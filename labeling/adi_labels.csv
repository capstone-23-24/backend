Ltd. (Nukkad) an organized tea café retail chain was checking his notifications on his phone. He saw that Nukkad had garnered positive reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor Facebook and other social media pages. Patel was proud of his social enterprise which encompassed two cafés based in Raipur a city in Chhattisgarh India. Since its inception in 2013 Nukkad had created quite a buzz in Raipur for its distinctive initiative: it specifically employed youths with speech- and hearing-related disabilities. Patel’s aim was to expand Nukkad to more locations so that more people with these disabilities could be employed and a larger customer base could be reached and he was trying to determine the best way to achieve this aim. Patel questioned whether franchising represented the optimal expansion route or whether he should continue growing with his own outlets. He realized that his decision could adversely affect his business and as a result his employees; if the expansion was not successful it could cost people their jobs or dilute Nukkad’s hard-earned reputation. Moreover Nukkad’s business model was exceptional with respect to its offerings employees and social values. If the model expanded to new markets Nukkad had to be prepared to face the challenge of serving customers with different preferences.NUKKADCompany History and BackgroundPatel was originally an electronics engineer working for various organizations from 2007 to 2011. During that period he also volunteered his services to several non-governmental organizations (NGOs). His work with these organizations helped Patel realize that he wanted to work in the marginalized segments of society.In 2010 Patel learned of a fellowship program run by ICICI Foundation which was established by Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) Group an Indian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Mumbai India. Patel applied to the program and was chosen to be one of the designated fellows at which point Patel left his corporate job. The program was designed to empower Indian citizens to participate in India’s inclusive growth by helping rural development projects; it centred on experiential learning and transforming the fellows into socially responsible leaders. The newly designated leaders spent 15 months working on grassroots development projects with NGOs intermixed with modules on management training and leadership development.Patel became a part of a community working to solve issues in remote locations. This experience became a turning point in Patel’s life. He worked in villages within three Indian states—Orissa Maharashtra and Gujarat—for 18 months. This opportunity resulted in two successful projects: the Community Resource Centre in Gujarat in which Patel worked with underprivileged communities to empower socially marginalized individuals by providing them with livelihood services employment skills wellness and education; and Tribal Women Cooperatives for NTFP (Non-Timber Forest Products) Trades in Orissa which organized trading and enhanced income for women in rural regions collecting non-timber forest products. His time with the ICICI Foundation was transformative for Patel: it provided him with insight knowledge and—most importantly—a commitment to inclusive growth. Patel gained a new perspective. He realized that disadvantaged young Indians needed to join the social sector to bring dynamic change and bridge the skill gap. Patel started developing ideas to create a bridge that could help society benefit from these individuals and offer them an enriching experience in return. As of 2011 India had nearly 27 million disabled citizens (see Exhibit 1); increasing their social and economic participation might have a positive effect on everyone.After six months Patel had the idea of creating a social space for people and groups to meet join and converse while adding value to society in different ways. This train of thought led him to create Nukkad The Chaitastic Teafé. Founded in 2013 Nukkad was a for-profit tea café with a mission of providing employment to individuals with disabilities and a platform for discussing various social issues. The café was decorated in a Bohemian theme with murals posters and artifacts (see Exhibit 2). It served 29 varieties of tea 17 varieties of coffee snacks and non-alcoholic cocktails in a calming ambience. Market and Competition India was one of the biggest tea-producing countries in the world and the fourth-largest exporter of tea. During fiscal year 2015/16 India exported 232.92 million kilograms of tea; the export valuation reached US$686.67 million with 90 per cent penetration in domestic markets. Growth in disposable income and urbanization had resulted in strong growth in the ready-to-drink tea market. However the popularity of ready-to-drink was limited among urban consumers aged 13 to 34. International firms such as Costa Coffee Starbucks Barista and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf rose to prominence at a fast pace in the Indian café market. The prior success and demand of domestic tea and coffee along with an abundant consumer population attracted these companies to India. Maharashtra was the top state when it came to spending money on tea but most tea consumption occurred in the home. Outside of the home consumption of tea had increased while consumption of coffee had fallen since the year 2012 (see Exhibit 3). There had been an acceleratory growth in the number of tea start-ups which led to an increase in tea drinking. These start-ups focused on increasing the quality quantity and ready availability of tea (see Exhibit 4). Nukkad was the first themed café of its kind in Raipur; the city’s other cafés served varieties of coffee. However attracting customers that would be willing to pay from $0.45 to $2.24 for tea was difficult because tea was available on every corner of Raipur for as little as $0.07. Advertising and PromotionIn 2016 Nukkad had a 4.6 rating in Google reviews and 4400 “likes” on Facebook. The business was also featured on a television series OMG! My Chhattisgarh that aired on History Channel India. The series ventured into various parts of the state to cover incredible stories of courage inspiration progress and culture. According to Patel at the core of Nukkad’s success was its employees its grounded philosophy in encouraging good conduct in people and its opportunity to give employees a platform to discuss various social issues. The business had no advertising budget and its marketing communication was mainly done through social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Patel had created some promotional campaigns in the form of social experiments that were aligned with Nukkad’s vision.“Digital Detox”Smartphones (and especially social networking apps and games) negatively affected the quality of face-to-face discussions. Nukkad promoted social interaction by offering a 5–10 per cent discount on the total bill if customers deposited their smartphones at the counter for the duration of their time at Nukkad.“GyaanDaan (Donation of Knowledge)”Nukkad maintained a small library that encouraged an exchange of books. Customers could deposit a book in the café and exchange it for another that could be taken home for three days.“Bill by Dil (Pay by Heart)”On Nukkad’s first anniversary the business customized a special menu that had no prices displayed. Customers ate what they liked and paid what they wished to; bills were not generated and at the end of the meal the staff placed an envelope on the table into which the customer could put whatever amount they wanted to pay.“The Charity Chai” The Charity Chai promotion created an opportunity for customers to pre-pay for a cup of tea for underprivileged members of society.choices AND CONCERNSPatel was considering his options for Nukkad’s expansion. The first option was to set up his own outlet and the second option was to pursue franchising. The franchising route could be further classified into three different models with respect to the ownership and operation: franchise owned franchise operated (FOFO) franchise owned company operated (FOCO) and company owned franchise operated (COFO). Patel knew that choosing any one of these options could affect Nukkad at its core challenging all aspects of how the company evolved and operated. Above all Patel’s priority was sustainable growth for Nukkad. Patel picked up his notebook and summarized the options.Expanding Traditionally with Own OutletsPatel had identified Nagpur as a potential location to expand Nukkad beyond Chhattisgarh. Nagpur was a Tier 2 city in Maharashtra—the third largest city in the state and the largest city in Central India. However taking Nukkad to Nagpur presented possible challenges as well as opportunities.Patel saw great risk in pushing his existing model into new markets. Entering into a new state without any prior connection there could leave Nukkad open to unknown market risks and aggressive competitors. Nukkad would face bigger competitors (that would potentially be more aggressive) and an unfamiliar environment. Patel wondered if he should outsource by bringing in a temporary executive who had experience in expansion train his staff in a new technology or start a new café with new equity rather than with existing cash flow.India was a diversified market with cultures and lifestyles that varied significantly from state to state. Nukkad had a presence in Raipur but would it be possible to replicate the same success in Nagpur? Could an outlet sustain itself without any link to local market knowledge? Patel was unsure. Knowledge of the local market was crucial for any café: such knowledge would help in promotional activities (e.g. with regard to particular festivals and celebrations) and offer an understanding of the customer base customer preferences and food habits.Expansion involved finding sources of funding—such as loans investors and any owner-contributed capital—but Patel could not count on his existing location for any funding. Rather he had to consider the new café as an entirely new business venture which would require that he invest in an initial set-up cost (see Exhibit 5). Notably this cost could be much higher than it would be for any location in Chhattisgarh. Further Patel’s model would require that he employ more people such as managers for this new location. The salaried managers’ earnings would be unrelated to their performance and would be added to the monthly cost.As a social enterprise Nukkad faced unusual challenges with respect to its employees because hiring and training involved a number of steps. Recruiting disabled individuals required collaboration with NGOs or social service institutions that worked for the disabled community or other sources. Patel also had concerns about how well his team would be able to handle daily operations without his monitoring and continuous support at the new café. Even if he employed managers would it be possible for the employed managers of the new café to have the same compassion and understanding as Patel did toward disabled workers? Finally what internal structural changes needed to be made? A larger business could not operate in the same way that a smaller one could; quite often smaller businesses had ways of managing employees and dealing with human resource issues in ways that were not scalable. In pursuing significant expansion these structures and processes could become unnecessarily bloated. Therefore Patel believed that he may need to re- evaluate aspects like restructuring departments and redefining roles. Keeping an eye on every outlet was important for a business owner. Patel wanted to monitor every aspect of the business dealings but he could not be on site at all times. He would need to screen hire and train employees to take charge of the business for him in some ways. Franchising NukkadThe second option for Nukkad was to franchise the café; doing so would be a ready-made solution. Patel had received messages from individuals (based out of different cities across India such as Nagpur Aurangabad Delhi Chandigarh and Ranchi) inquiring about Nukkad’s franchising options including the following: Dear Patel I own a manufacturing business based in Nagpur Maharashtra. I am a franchisee of [International Institute of Fashion Design] an educational institute. I came to know about Nukkad from friends and family and was very much interested in becoming a franchisee of Nukkad. I would like to know if you have an application form. Hi Patel I am based in Delhi India. I operate a small cafeteria. My cafeteria is 10 years old and serves varieties of Indian snacks tea and coffee. I visited Nukkad recently while I was in Raipur to meet friends and I would like to know if you are interested in franchising your café. I run an NGO for mute and deaf [individuals] in Ranchi Jharkhand where we train them for employable skills. I visited Nukkad last year and I am very impressed with the business model as I also work with the vision of action and compassion towards the deaf and mute community members. I’m curious as to whether you have a franchise model.Patel considered the requirements that would have to be met if he were to decide to franchise Nukkad. Despite the fact that franchising seemed like an easy solution to implement Patel had doubts over losing control of the business. With this option he would need to establish long-term relationships with the franchisees because he would be depending on them for profits and operations. Potential Obstacles to FranchisingNukkad’s foremost concern was its employees: its primary objective was to assist marginalized members of society by giving them employment. Patel feared that by pursuing franchising he might be developing a work culture that did not prioritize Nukkad’s core values. He could not be sure that the franchisees would emphasize respect compassion teamwork and collaboration as much as he did. Moreover Patel strongly believed that art was an important factor in Nukkad’s success and he had deliberately developed the café’s Bohemian-esque environment himself. Nukkad was designed to nurture a creative artistic and supportive culture. Its walls were decorated with hand-painted murals and most of the items in the café were handcrafted. Patel experimented with different activities to engage customers in socially beneficial initiatives and discussions. He organized a talk series at the café with local poets activists and journalists. On Nukkad’s third anniversary he presented a poetry and storytelling event that was heavily attended by locals. He also helped local writers promote their books at Nukkad.Each Nukkad location had three employees one of whom handled the management desk while the others worked as chefs. The dress code was casual. Nukkad was functionally organized and all communications between Patel and his employees were in sign language because the employees had speech or hearing impairments or both. Accordingly Nukkad also had to adopt an unusual service concept with its employees and customers. Customers ordered their food and beverages in writing. When Nukkad first opened Patel was not sure if people would react positively to this concept. Surprisingly however customers quickly adopted the method of ordering and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Some customers even began to communicate in sign language with the employees. Patel did not want to compromise on any of the distinctive aspects of Nukkad. Yet while the franchisees would have to agree to operate their cafés according to Patel’s stipulations there still remained some areas for innovation. Many ideas for new items on the menu could come from the franchisees responding to customer demand. Developing new products was crucial to any business even one that had successfully relied on a limited menu for many years. Consumer tastes could change over time and companies had to respond to these changes. Innovation could inject dynamism and allow Nukkad to utilize markets that Patel had previously overlooked. Each future franchisee would be required to put at least 40 hours a week into business development. What to do NEXTApart from questions about replicating Nukkad’s distinct operations Patel wondered whether franchising—a medium known for its focus on commercial success—could nurture a start-up that focused on a social cause. Patel knew that what separated a typical entrepreneur and a social entrepreneur was that the main goal of a social enterprise was to drive social change and that was the potential payoff—an enduring transformative advantage for society. For the typical entrepreneur the business would be organized to serve markets that could comfortably afford the new product or service and it would thus be designed to create financial profit. Contrastingly social entrepreneurs neither anticipated nor organized to create substantial financial profit for their investors or themselves. Unlike the entrepreneurial value proposition that assumed a market could pay for innovation and might even benefit investors the social entrepreneur’s value proposition targeted an underserved neglected or disadvantaged population that lacked the financial means or political clout to achieve any transformative benefits without outside help. However this did not mean that social entrepreneurs shunned profit-making value propositions as a rule. Profit though not the primary objective for a social entrepreneur was important for sustainable development of a social enterprise. Patel believed that social franchising required co-operative development. He wondered if the well-trodden path to success that commercial franchising offered could work for a social enterprise like Nukkad. The fact that there were other tea cafés rapidly opening in multiple locations India indicated that making Nukkad a prominent tea café brand was unrealistic without expansion to more locations. Patel viewed expansion as crucial for Nukkad to remain competitive. He knew that it was the best time to start another branch of Nukkad in a new location if he was going to do so. How could he maintain Nukkad’s success and effectiveness in each new location opened? Was franchising the best way to expand or should Patel employ the time and resources required to develop a tailor-made in-house solution?exhibit 1: Disability demographics in India (2011)Source: Social Statistics Division Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation Government of India Disabled Persons in India: A Statistical Profile 2016 18–20 accessed July 17 2017 http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Disabled_persons_in_India_2016.pdf.exhibit 2: InSIde nukkadSource: Company documents. exhibit 3: per CAPITA consumption of coffee and tea per month In each indian state (2011/12) (IN ?)Source: Dipti Jain “Tea or Coffee?” Livemint October 28 2014 accessed December 12 2017 www.livemint.com/Opinion/ZlRWL4feW4byUjtDs1MVpM/Tea-or-coffee.html.Exhibit 4: NUKKAD’S COMPETITORSChai Point: A Bangalore India-based funded tea café chain start-up.

She informed Amari that the school thoroughly enjoyed the demonstration he had given at its professional development day the previous week and was interested in buying several Speak-On packs. Amari had not expected such a fast response. He was still in the throes of preparing for future demonstrations at schools throughout September and October. While the government grant he received at the start of the summer helped to fund the prototype of Speak-On Amari needed to determine how much cash would be required in the first year of business once he incorporated on September 1. Furthermore Amari was contemplating what to do once he graduated next year and wondered if Speak-On could grow into a full-time venture or whether he should focus on school instead. He knew the new venture would require a great time commitment. COMPANY BACKGROUNDSpeak-On developed from the idea that students specifically in high school were not being adequately prepared in communication and public speaking skills. When Amari was in high school he was involved with an organization called DECA. DECA’s mission was to develop and help future leaders and provided Amari with an immense amount of practice with public speaking. He had won several competitions at both the provincial and national levels. In preparation for these competitions he would play games intended to improve his communication skills. DECA had provided Amari an avenue to develop his public speaking skills but he realized that most students didn’t get this opportunity in high school. Education guidelines in Ontario described public speaking as an important skill to learn; many schools offered an optional public speaking course but Amari felt students were still unprepared once leaving high school. Amari had developed the initial business plan for Speak-On ha while enrolled in Business 2257 an accounting and business analysis course at Western University. He applied for and received a Government of Ontario Summer Company Grant that allowed him to develop a prototype of the game. SPEAK-ONSpeak-On was an educational game designed to be used in high school classrooms to improve communication and public speaking skills in students. It consisted of a paper card deck a digital rubric and an online tracking tool (see Exhibit 1). The questions in the card deck were organized by domain of knowledge relating to courses taught across high schools in Ontario. The main version of the game had students coming to the front of the classroom picking a card from the deck and speaking about the topic on the card for up to a minute. The digital rubric allowed teachers to grade and give feedback to students. The online tracking tool to see progression was a future development Amari hoped to have ready next year. Multiple variations on the standard version were provided in the instruction manual with Speak-On. The rubric also integrated with the Ministry of Education’s curriculum. The initial versions Amari was planning to sell in the first year of operations were for grade 10 business and grade 9 and 10 English classes. Biology chemistry physics math French geography and history decks were under development. CONSUMER ANALYSIS Private SchoolsAmari attended a private high school and decided to focus his sales efforts on these schools due to both his relationships with past teachers and the financial flexibility these institutions had. Private schools generally charged fees for students to attend and therefore had more financial resources available. To help attract students and convince parents to send their children to private schools rather than free public schools private schools needed to provide an exceptional learning experience. This led private schools to be early adopters of new and experiential learning tools and games. Ontario had approximately 700 private schools. If teachers wanted to procure a learning tool for their students a pool of money was available for use. The teachers would approach their department head who had a budget of up to CA$1500 to spend on learning tools and games throughout the department as well as an additional $200 for each classroom. New learning tools and games would be used for only two to three years as private schools were constantly innovating. Amari believed that public schools would start implementing these games and tools after they had been widely used in private schools. StudentsStudents’ future personal and professional success was increasingly tied to their competence with communication and more specifically oral communication skills. Competent speakers were more successful in conveying their knowledge ideas and opinions. This increasing importance had led to several countries such as Germany integrating public speaking into education standards. Mastering public speaking was now seen as a core competency for well-educated students. Interestingly while the question of how to promote public speaking competence in pre-school to grade 12 and higher education had increased research on higher education had greatly outpaced research for elementary and high school students. When students were developing public speaking skills research had concluded that authentic learning tasks opportunities to practice and self-assessment were best practices leading to positive effects.INTIAL YEAR OF BUSINESSSummer Company GrantAfter developing the idea for Speak-On earlier in the year Amari applied for a government grant through the Ontario Summer Company program. The program was set up to encourage students to become more entrepreneurial and gain valuable experience in running a company. Successful applicants received $1500 to help with upfront costs and a further $1500 after meeting all the program criteria. After applying in June Amari received the initial payment in July and completed the program requirements to receive the final payment in September. He planned to incorporate the company in September but had already spent the initial $1500 grant. Amari had also planned to invest $500 of his own savings alongside the second half of the grant payment in September.SalesThe first year of operations had two distinct phases. Phase one consisted of prototyping the decks in classrooms leveraging Amari’s relationships with his previous teachers to better understand the consumer. Once prototyping was done Amari would start sales meetings in December. The sales process consisted of a one-on-one meeting with teachers at select private schools where Amari demonstrated Speak-On and described the potential benefits to their students. If teachers wanted to make a purchase they would go through their school procurement process and a sale would be completed one month after the sales meeting. Given his inexperience Amari expected to convert only 20 per cent of these sales meetings at first before improving in future months. Amari assumed each teacher would buy an average of two decks per purchase (see Exhibit 2).Logo and Website Development One of the first things Amari wanted to do was develop a permanent logo for Speak-On. The current logo was a starting point but Amari wanted to improve it. Logo Joy was a website that gave customers a multitude of basic logos to choose from and then allowed customization. The one-time fee for the website was $87 to be paid in September. After the logo was finished Amari would then purchase a subscription to Canva a graphic design tool website which allowed businesses to upload their logos to the website and design marketing materials. The cost of the Canva subscription was $168 for the year and gave the member access to the website. Payment was made in monthly instalments starting in September. Any marketing materials made through Canva would be at an additional cost and Amari planned to develop business cards from Canva. The business cards would cost $60 and would be paid for in October.Initially Amari had planned to design the website on GoDaddy a website builder and domain hosting service but then he discovered Fiber which was a freelance software and programming website that connected entrepreneurs with website programmers. Amari had connected with a programmer during the summer and had contracted out the design of the Speak-On website for $633. Amari had negotiated for the payment to be due once the website was functional in November. Once the initial build of the website was complete Amari would spend several months uploading specific content about the business. He had taken several computer sciences courses in school and felt comfortable with the process. Even though Amari did not design the website on GoDaddy he was still going to purchase the domain name SpeakOn.com through the website and pay for a membership. Claiming the domain name required a one-time fee of $10 to be incurred in September with membership fees of $5 per month also starting in September.Card DesignAmari had already designed Speak-On decks for English and business classes in high school. He was currently designing a wider range of topics and purchased a membership to Component Studio. Component Studio was essential in card development by helping to format images for cards and Amari estimated he would use the site more frequently as he developed new decks. The monthly cost was $20 and he had started that subscription in July. Banking Fees and InsuranceIncorporating the business was an easy process that would take only a few minutes. Amari would register with the Government of Ontario under the name of Confidence Games Canada. The cost of a business registration was $68 to be paid in September. Amari would also need business insurance. Insurance would cost $138 for the first three months due in September and then revert to a monthly payment format. On the same day of incorporation Amari would go to his bank and open a separate bank account for Speak-On. His bank had told him monthly fees would amount to $20 per month and would be charged to his account on the first day of the month following service.InventoryAmari had initially purchased prototype inventory in the summer but he realized he would need to have a supply ready before the sales process started in December. The supplier of Speak-On decks and Amari negotiated 20 decks to be delivered in December. Further purchases of 70 decks in February and 40 decks in May would ensure enough inventory for the busy spring season. All decks would cost $20 and payment was due in the month of delivery. Line of CreditSpeak-On would initially run based on the government grant and Amari’s investment. However with future investments required before sales could begin more financing could be needed. Amari had been approved for a line of credit with a $10000 limit. The line of credit had an annual interest rate of eight per cent based on the outstanding balance at the end of each month. Payment would be due the next month. If more financing was needed above the line of credit Amari was unsure where it would come from as his own personal finances were stretched thin with school payments.Other OptionsWhile Amari believed he was conservative with his sales projections he also wanted to perform sensitivity analysis on his calculations. The quick reaction and sales request from his old high school was unexpected and Amari wanted to see the effect on his cash balance if he started the sales process earlier than projected. Amari assumed the same sales levels for September October and November as was projected for December. For his supplier to deliver Speak-On decks in September Amari would be charged a rush fee of $5 per deck ordered. Amari estimated an additional purchase of 35 decks in September. Additionally more business cards would be needed and the expense would rise to $80. However Amari also needed to see the negative effect slower sales would have on the business and the potential need of a credit line. Amari assumed if other teachers were less receptive than his old high school teacher the number of decks sold would be 50 per cent less than projected. With a decrease in sales he would not require as much inventory. While the December purchase order could not be changed Amari would reduce his February and May orders by 35 and 20 decks respectively. CONCLUSIONAmari understood the impact Speak-On could have on high school students and their public speaking skills. He needed to determine his financing requirements and project a cash budget for the first year of operations. Upon analysis of the results Amari needed to decide whether to continue to invest his time and money in his new venture or focus on school and the upcoming employment recruiting experience. If Amari decided to continue he needed to choose whether to start selling earlier or continue with the original plan. With the school year about to begin difficult choices needed to be made.EXHIBIT 1: SPEAK-ON DECKSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: SALES ESTIMATE FOR FISCAL 2018Notes: Speak-On decks were sold for $50 each.Source: Company files.,"[{""start"":1060,""end"":1071,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1254,""end"":1259,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1433,""end"":1438,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1696,""end"":1701,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1833,""end"":1838,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2386,""end"":2391,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2244,""end"":2249,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2647,""end"":2652,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2998,""end"":3003,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2930,""end"":2935,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3974,""end"":3979,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4203,""end"":4208,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4448,""end"":4453,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5512,""end"":5517,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6659,""end"":6664,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7014,""end"":7019,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7237,""end"":7242,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7593,""end"":7598,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7737,""end"":7742,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8002,""end"":8007,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8113,""end"":8118,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8256,""end"":8261,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8360,""end"":8365,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8599,""end"":8604,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9014,""end"":9019,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9143,""end"":9148,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9378,""end"":9383,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9502,""end"":9507,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9645,""end"":9650,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9833,""end"":9838,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10141,""end"":10146,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10424,""end"":10429,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10685,""end"":10690,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10849,""end"":10854,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11039,""end"":11044,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11271,""end"":11276,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11469,""end"":11474,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11910,""end"":11915,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12191,""end"":12196,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12322,""end"":12327,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12533,""end"":12538,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12640,""end"":12645,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12856,""end"":12861,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12798,""end"":12803,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13013,""end"":13018,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13139,""end"":13144,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13411,""end"":13416,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13501,""end"":13506,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13746,""end"":13751,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13910,""end"":13915,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7483,""end"":7488,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11792,""end"":11797,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10772,""end"":10778,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1173,""end"":1175,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1313,""end"":1315,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1616,""end"":1618,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1478,""end"":1480,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1789,""end"":1791,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1873,""end"":1875,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1968,""end"":1970,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2003,""end"":2005,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2269,""end"":2271,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2449,""end"":2451,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2563,""end"":2565,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2705,""end"":2707,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3158,""end"":3160,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7139,""end"":7141,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9248,""end"":9250,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9725,""end"":9727,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9877,""end"":9879,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10232,""end"":10234,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10440,""end"":10442,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10481,""end"":10483,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10534,""end"":10536,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11351,""end"":11353,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11339,""end"":11341,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12337,""end"":12339,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12384,""end"":12386,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12587,""end"":12589,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13316,""end"":13318,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13607,""end"":13609,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13936,""end"":13938,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

(Walmart) the world’s largest retailer. Foran was speaking at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) Global Consumer and Retail Conference on March 7 2019. “It galvanizes an organization into doing something” he said. Walmart’s supply chain strategy continued to evolve with its retreat from international markets a slowdown of retail expansion plans in the United States and a focus on its growing online business. With revenues of US$514 billion in the fiscal year (FY) ended January 31 2019 Walmart achieved 4.2 per cent comparable sales growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of FY 2019 the best performance in the last decade. Its shares jumped 3.9 per cent higher on the news. As Walmart repositioned itself to grow its online presence it added 1000 grocery pickup locations during the past year and grew the number of grocery delivery locations to nearly 800. Walmart was working on the best way to deliver groceries directly to customers—it had a pilot test with Udelv for custom autonomous cargo vans to deliver groceries in Surprise Arizona and was collaborating with Ford on the development of self-driving cars for grocery deliveries. These were only a few of the changes Walmart was making as it reshaped its supply chain strategy to tackle the “last mile.”Walmart seemed to have an advantage over Amazon in infrastructure. While Amazon had 75 fulfilment centres and 25 sortation centres in North America Walmart’s vast store network in the United States was within 10 miles of 90 per cent of the U.S. population. As competition between Walmart and its online and offline competitors continued to heat up a key challenge facing Doug McMillon the company’s president and CEO was deciding what changes needed to be made to Walmart’s ever-expanding supply chain to support its strategic objectives. What supply chain capabilities would Walmart need as its business model continued to evolve?The RETAIL INDUSTRY The top five global retailers in 2018 were Walmart ($514 billion) Amazon ($160 billion) the Schwarz Group in Germany ($102 billion) Carrefour in France ($89 billion) and Ahold Delhaize in The Netherlands ($71 billion). U.S. retail sales excluding motor vehicles and parts dealers reached $6 trillion in 2018. Major categories included general merchandise food and beverage and health and personal care (see Exhibit 1). In the United States retailers competed at local regional and national levels with some of the major chains such as Walmart and Costco counting operations in foreign countries as well. In addition to the traditional one-store owner-operated retailer the industry included formats such as discount stores department stores (selling a large percentage of soft goods or clothing) variety and convenience stores specialty stores supermarkets supercentres (combination discount and supermarket stores) Internet retailers and catalogue retailers. Online retail sales were rising in importance in the United States reaching $517.4 billion in 2018 with Amazon accounting for approximately 40 per cent of the total. There were two broad strategies in global retailing: variable pricing or “hi-lo pricing” and everyday low pricing (EDLP). Hi-lo pricing practiced by retailers for decades involved adjusting the retail price of items to optimize total gross margins. For example at traditional grocery stores while most prices of key items—such as milk sugar eggs toothpaste and detergent—were kept at market rates a small number of products were discounted at below-market prices as part of short-term promotions. This strategy was used to attract customers with low-price offerings expecting that they would also buy some of the high-price items thereby expecting to increase overall profitability despite incurring losses on the few discounted items. Rotating promotional items allowed retailers to shift target customer segments.On the other hand an EDLP strategy meant that prices on items were generally consistent from week to week and were kept as low as possible in order to generate high consumer traffic. An EDLP strategy generally required the retailer to focus on opportunities to reduce operational and supply chain costs which translated into lower retail prices. The goal in an EDLP environment was to generate higher aggregate gross profit by increasing the volume of items sold.An emerging trend was demand from consumers for home delivery especially from millennials who prioritized convenience as part of the shopping process. This trend was spurred by the emergence of Amazon and other online retailers.WALMART STORES INC.Based in Bentonville Arkansas and founded by the legendary Sam Walton Walmart was the number one retailer in the world with FY 2019 net income from continuing operations of $7.3 billion on sales of $514 billion (see Exhibit 2). Globally Walmart had 2.2 million associates conducted business in 27 countries and served nearly 275 million customers each week in its more than 11300 stores and numerous e-commerce websites that operated under 58 banners. In the United States Walmart had 1.5 million associates and 5362 stores and warehouse clubs. Beginning with its “big box” discount store format in the 1960s Walmart’s store formats around the world had grown to include supercentres which were a larger version of a discount store that included groceries merchandise and apparel. Its strategy was to provide a broad assortment of quality products and services at “everyday low prices.” In the United States Walmart faced a wide range of competitors including Target Home Depot Ikea Costco Kroger Aldi Walgreens and CVS. The company was also facing growing competition for large ticket general merchandise products and from online retailers such as Amazon.com. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WALMART’S SUPPLY CHAIN Before he started Walmart Stores in 1962 Sam Walton owned a successful chain of stores under the Ben Franklin Stores banner a franchisor of variety stores in the United States. Although he was under contract to purchase most of his merchandise requirements from Ben Franklin Stores Walton was able to selectively purchase merchandise in bulk from other suppliers and transport these goods directly to his stores. When Walton recognized a new national trend discount retailing—based on driving high volumes of product through low-cost retail outlets—he decided to open large warehouse-style stores initially named “Walmart Discount City.” Because many suppliers were not willing to send their trucks to his stores which were located in rural Arkansas Walton set up his own distribution operations. Walmart undertook an initial public offering in 1969 to raise funds to build its first distribution centre (DC) in Bentonville Arkansas. As the company grew between 1960 and 1990 it benefited from an improved national transportation infrastructure and the slow response of its competitors to changes in legislation such as the removal of “resale price maintenance” which had prevented retailers from discounting merchandise. To keep an eye on his growing network Walton piloted a small single-engine airplane which he would land at air strips close to his stores.Walmart’s supply chain a key enabler of its growth from its beginnings in rural Arkansas was long considered by many to be a major source of competitive advantage for the company. It was one of the first firms to rely on data to make operational decisions use bar codes share sales data with suppliers control its own logistics and transportation activities and install point-of-sale information systems that collected item-level data in real time. As the company’s supply chain practices became widely publicized many of Walmart’s practices were adopted by competitors and became industry standards. Walmart.comIn the United States Walmart had three main online programs: Walmart.com (launched in 2000) an online site selling an assortment of goods that were also available in company stores; Marketplace a seamless platform that hosted third-party sellers on Walmart.com; and Jet.com a high-end retailer of consumer goods. The company was also partnering with major retail brands such as Lord & Taylor and Advance Autoparts to bring upscale brands to Walmart.com.Launched in 2009 Walmart Marketplace was a third-party e-commerce platform that allowed independent sellers to sell both new and like-new products on Walmart.com. Many of these suppliers purchased overstocked items which were then resold. Some of the items that were sold by third-party resellers included $3000 Celine bags Miu Miu sunglasses and Chanel perfume. To differentiate itself from Amazon Walmart did not charge suppliers setup or monthly fees to list on Marketplace. However Walmart did not allow its Marketplace sellers to use its supply chain network. Marketplace sellers had to fulfill orders on their own and manage customer service including returns.Walmart’s e-commerce capabilities had been augmented when it purchased Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3 billion positioning the site to target higher income urban shoppers. The acquisition coincided with an effort by Walmart to source a larger variety of goods in an effort to attract a broader range of customers. For example in 2015 Walmart.com had 7 million different items for sale online. By October 2018 it had over 75 million items online. Doug McMillon indicated that Walmart had purchased Jet.com because of its customer service capabilities e-commerce foundation and talent base along with the belief that both customer bases were complementary. Jet.com focused on urban millennials and offered online features that allowed shoppers to lower prices by opting out of free returns and paying with debit cards instead of credit cards. In contrast Walmart.com featured low prices and attracted value-conscious buyers. McMillon was looking to grow both online businesses stating:We’re in the business of “saving people money so that they can live better.” But the value of our customers’ time cannot be overstated. To win the future of retail we must save customers both money and time. By combining with Jet.com’s technology shopping experience customers and talent we will do exactly that. We will exceed their expectations!In addition to trying to reach a higher income demographic by partnering online with retailers such as Lord & Taylor Walmart was looking to offer higher-end brands on its site. It purchased Bonobos an online designer and seller of higher-end men’s clothing; Moosejaw an online outdoor products retailer; Hayneedle an online furniture and home décor shop; and Shoebuy an online shoe retailer. In October 2018 Walmart purchased plus-size digital brand Eloquii and lingerie retailer Bare Necessities. In May 2018 Walmart purchased 77 per cent of India’s Flipkart an e-commerce retailer for $16 billion. Of that amount $2 billion was earmarked for funding growth. Walmart intended for Flipkart to “. . . support national initiatives and . . . bring sustainable benefits in jobs creation supporting small businesses supporting farmers and supply chain development and reducing food waste.” In February 2019 India introduced new e-commerce restrictions that prevented foreign online retailers from selling their own products online restricting them to “. . . operate marketplace platforms where others sell goods to retail consumers.” The result was that Flipkart had to pull thousands of products offline.The combination of an improved Walmart.com website positioning Jet.com at higher-end customers and allowing third-party sellers to use Walmart Marketplace resulted in online revenue growth of 40 per cent to $15.7 billion in FY ended January 31 2019. Amazon’s U.S. e-commerce sales were $206.82 billion in 2018 up 16.3 per cent from 2017.In an effort to raise profits—and recognizing that fulfilling orders online was more expensive—Walmart began raising prices on Walmart.com for basic food and household items. A Morgan Stanley data analysis found that while Walmart dominated the market for lower-income consumers Amazon attracted higher-income consumers. ProcurementWalmart’s buyers located in Bentonville worked with suppliers to ensure that the correct mix of staples and new items was ordered. As Walmart grew many of Walmart’s largest suppliers opened offices in Bentonville staffed by analysts and managers supporting Walmart’s business. Walmart expanded its global sourcing in the mid-1980s by establishing international purchasing offices in China and other countries and working directly with suppliers to expand the company’s line of private-label merchandise. Private-label products were appealing to customers as they were often priced at a discount to brand-name merchandise; for Walmart the private-label items generated higher margins than suppliers’ branded products. Private-label sales at Walmart first developed in the 1980s accounted for approximately 16 per cent of revenues compared to about 25 per cent at U.S. rivals Safeway and Kroger. This was because Walmart’s strategy was to procure top brands in volume and sell them at low prices. Every quarter buyers met in Bentonville to review new merchandise exchange information and review a fully merchandised prototype store which was located in a warehouse. In order to gather field intelligence buyers toured stores and helped associates stock and sell merchandise. In addition to helping coordinate short-term plans for deliveries and inventories Walmart worked with suppliers on medium- to long-term supply chain strategies including product trends capacity management cooperation with upstream raw materials suppliers and forecasting. Globally Walmart was thought to have approximately 60000 suppliers of whom about 200—such as Nestlé Procter & Gamble (P&G) Unilever and Kraft—were key global suppliers. Walmart wielded enormous power over its suppliers. For example P&G sales to Walmart represented 15 per cent of its annual revenues in 2018 but approximately two per cent of Walmart revenues. During negotiations with suppliers Walmart insisted on a single invoice price and did not pay for co-operative advertising discounting or distribution. With Walmart’s expectations for data analysis category management responsibilities and external research it was common for key suppliers to have several employees working full-time to provide support. In order to harness the knowledge of its suppliers “category captains” were introduced in the late 1980s to provide recommendations to improve overall category performance including shelf space allocation for all suppliers. Walmart announced in February 2019 that it would allow suppliers such as P&G Unilever and Modelez to advertise directly to consumers in its stores and online at Walmart.com. The company had approximately 300 million visitors to its U.S. stores per month and the retailer was looking to generate revenues and boost profits. The move came at a time when Amazon was positioned to surpass Microsoft in online advertising revenues moving into third place behind Google and Facebook in the $111 billion U.S. digital ad market.DistributionWalmart’s store openings were driven directly by its distribution strategy. Sam Walton had insisted on saturating the area within a day’s driving distance of a DC in order to gain economies of scale with an average distance of approximately 130 miles. This “hub-and-spoke” distribution-led store expansion strategy persisted as Walmart expanded from its roots in Arkansas adding thousands of U.S. stores. In 2019 Walmart had 173 DCs in the United States with 125.8 million square feet of total space. Its DCs were focused on a variety of roles in the supply chain including regional general merchandise full-line grocery grocery and perishable food fashion e-commerce fulfilment centres specialty products (e.g. export optical labs pharmacy returns processing tires print and mail) import and redistribution centre point and Sam’s Club DCs. Approximately 77 per cent of store merchandise was shipped through its DC network with the remainder shipped direct-to-store (DSD) by suppliers. Exhibit 3 provides data showing the number and type of U.S. distribution centres.Walmart announced in January 2019 that it would add consolidation centres to improve supply chain efficiency. The current practice was for domestic suppliers with goods already in the United States to ship goods to one or more of the company’s 42 regional general merchandise DCs. Suppliers sending goods from abroad would send their product to Walmart’s import and redistribution centre points and goods would then be sent to regional general merchandise DCs. In July 2019 Walmart planned to build its first consolidation centre a 340000 square foot high-tech distribution centre to receive product from suppliers. The new technology in the consolidation centre was expected to be three times faster than the manual processes used in traditional DCs. Walmart anticipated that it would add 10 consolidation centres to its supply chain network which would ship product to regional general merchandise DCs.The company estimated that incomplete deliveries resulted in one-third of out-of-stock incidents in its stores. As a result in 2019 Walmart increased requirements for on-time delivery performance. Suppliers shipping full truckload orders were now expected to meet their two-day window 87 per cent of the time up from 85 per cent previously. Suppliers delivering less-than-truckload amounts were expected to deliver on time 70 per cent of the time up from 50 per cent. Suppliers who did not meet its “on time in full” guidelines would be fined 3 per cent of the amount invoiced. The company employed approximately 8000 truck drivers in the United States who logged nearly 740 million miles per year. Walmart’s truck fleet included an estimated 6000 tractors 53500 trailers and 5600 refrigerated trailers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise in the United States was transported primarily through Walmart’s private truck fleet and the company contracted with common carriers to transport the majority of its perishable grocery merchandise. Walmart invested in capabilities to improve delivery processes coordinating and deploying the entire fleet as necessary. Uniform operating standards ensured that miscommunication between traffic coordinators truckers and store level associates was minimized. Walmart categorized its inventory into four distinct types: finished goods and transit buffer and anticipation inventory. Finished goods referred to inventory that arrived from suppliers and was shipped at regular intervals to stores. Transit inventory referred to goods that were being transported via Walmart’s global supply chain to warehouses. Buffer inventory was extra stock held in stores’ backrooms to account for sudden and unexpected increases in demand. Anticipation inventory referred to goods held in stock for specific periods of high demand such as Black Friday.Information SystemsAs early as 1966 Sam Walton made information systems a focus at Walmart. The retailer had a central database by the 1980s point-of-sale systems and a satellite network. It launched its industry-leading Retail Link system in 1992 which was initially created to share inventory data with key suppliers. By 2019 Retail Link was a comprehensive information system providing all suppliers with access to information and decision support tools. Suppliers were able to use Retail Link to access real-time data on inventories and sales at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level and download to purchase orders. Incorporating information on product performance and regional consumer demographics Retail Link provided decision support systems that allowed suppliers to make data-driven decisions in areas such as sales forecasting route scheduling and assortment planning. Its capabilities provided even Walmart’s smallest suppliers with tools once reserved for only large companies. The access to the Retail Link resources also came with increased accountability for suppliers. It allowed Walmart to offload data analysis to suppliers expecting them to proactively monitor and replenish product on a continual basis setting targets for supply chain inventories and service levels. The company’s vendor managed inventory (VMI) program required suppliers to manage inventory levels at the company’s distribution centres based on agreed service levels. In some situations suppliers owned the inventory in Walmart stores up to the point that the sale was scanned at checkout.Walmart was an early adopter of RFID (radio frequency identification) tags to ensure cases of product moved efficiently through its distribution system and it was estimated that Walmart saved $500 million a year by using RFID in its operations. Store NetworkSam Walton was an original adopter of EDLP at a time when most retailers in the 1960s and 1970s such as K-Mart practiced hi-low pricing. EDLP was a strategy that Walmart refined over the decades. EDLP allowed Walmart to keep its costs low. Steady demand for product allowed management to control inventories and reduce stock-outs. The absence of promotions and discounts meant less spending on advertising. In turn the company channelled the savings to lower prices. Walmart grew rapidly as customers were attracted by its assortment of low-priced product as other retailers faltered. Over time the company copied the merchandise assortment strategies of other retailers. It bought in bulk bypassing distributors and passed savings on to consumers. Similar to its logistics operations the company strived to optimize the efficiency of its stores through efforts to continually reduce costs. Its stores were simply furnished and constructed using standard materials and light and temperature settings for all U.S. stores were controlled centrally from Bentonville. Each Walmart store aimed to be the “store of the community.” The display of merchandise was suggested by a store-wide template indicating the layout of Walmart’s various departments. This template was created by Walmart’s merchandising department after analyzing data from Retail Link and the profile of the local community. Associates were able to alter the merchandising template to fit their local store requirements. Shelf space in Walmart’s different departments—from shoes to household appliances to automotive supplies—was divided up each spot allocated to specific SKUs. Thus two Walmart stores a short distance apart could potentially stock different merchandise.Retail Link provided Walmart DCs with close to real-time information on stores’ in-stock levels allowing merchandise to be pulled to stores automatically. In addition store level information systems allowed suppliers to monitor product sales. In anticipation of changes in demand for some items associates had the authority to manually input orders or override impending deliveries. To ensure that associates were kept up-to-date management shared detailed information about day week and month store sales with all associates during daily 10-minute long “standing” meetings. In 2018 Walmart announced that it would raise the hourly wages for entry level associates to $11—providing total compensation including benefits of more than $17.50—in an effort to attract and retain talent. The company was also experimenting with organizational models that would provide more decision-making power to people on the floor in areas such as pricing and handling returns thereby allowing reductions in manager ranks. Other cost-cutting initiatives included the use of automation and robots in stores to monitor inventory clean floors and unload trucks more quickly.In 2019 Walmart was expected to add just 10 stores in the United States as it focused on remodelling existing stores and building its e-commerce capabilities. As part of its focus on online Walmart had closed 150 U.S. stores in 2015. Exhibit 4 provides a summary of Walmart capital expenditures for 2016–2019.focusing on the SUPPLY CHAIN Walmart remained focused on improving its supply chain capabilities. In addition to implementing zero-based budgeting the company was evaluating more than 300 technology-enabled initiatives to improve efficiency and to reduce costs. Some recent initiatives included warehouse unloading equipment shelf-scanning robots electronic shelf-edge labels and development of new apps. Specifically senior management had identified two broad areas where supply chain initiatives were critical to support corporate strategy: integrating retail stores and e-commerce to enhance the omnichannel experience of customers and increasing the use of technology to assist customers and to reduce costs.OmnichannelWalmart aimed to provide seamless omnichannel experience to customers integrating retail stores and e-commerce systems through services such as Walmart Pickup Pickup Today Grocery Pickup Grocery Delivery and Endless Aisle. Shoppers could order online select a pickup time and pick up their groceries at thousands of stores without leaving their cars. Marc Lore president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce commented on the opportunities at Walmart to integrate its store network with its e-commerce business:Wal-Mart has some really unique assets that no one else has. To date we haven’t fully leveraged the scale of Wal-Mart specifically its 4600 stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the population. Fresh frozen over 100000 general-merchandise SKUs are in that proximity. That product gets there in full truckloads—not cases and pallets—and those 4600 warehouses are profitable. They’re already covering their entire fixed expense. So each marginal dollar that ships out of there comes out at an incredible profit.Walmart’s foray into grocery pickup and delivery began in 2014 when it introduced curbside pickup. Meanwhile the U.S. online grocery market was growing rapidly—Forrester Analytics estimated that by 2022 the online grocery market would be valued at $36.5 billion up from $26.7 billion in 2018. In 2019 Walmart had more than 2100 grocery pickup locations and nearly 800 grocery delivery locations.Walmart was hoping that customers would come to the stores for the best deals on inexpensive items and place larger orders online. Speaking to an investor conference Marc Lore observed that “. . . there’s no cheaper way to get these products to consumers than have them come in the store and pick it off the shelf themselves.”In April 2019 Walmart announced it had hired 40000 store workers to pick groceries for online orders. The company was installing 900 pickup towers—each 16-feet high and located in the store parking lots—that would allow customers to pick up online orders without speaking to a store associate. Customers placed orders online at Walmart.com or on the smartphone app and then received a barcode. When the order was ready customers could go to a pickup tower in the Walmart parking lot enter a barcode and then wait for their products to be brought to them via conveyor belts. In a test in Nashville and New Orleans in September 2018 Walmart worked with Spark Delivery a crowd-sourced delivery platform that matched independent drivers with Walmart delivery orders. Once orders were placed Walmart’s personal shoppers would pick up the merchandise and hand the orders off to independent delivery drivers managed by Delivery Drivers Inc. a logistics service provider. In September 2018 Walmart purchased Cornershop for $225 million. Cornershop was a crowdsourced delivery platform for supermarkets pharmacies and food retailers in Mexico and Chile. Walmart announced partnerships in January 2019 with Point Pickup Skipcart AxleHire and Roadie aimed at providing home delivery services to customers. On June 7 2019 Walmart announced the launch of a service Walmart InHome which would see employees deliver groceries directly to a customer’s fridge. The service would be available in three cities: Kansas City (Missouri) Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) and Vero Beach (Florida) and employees would wear body cameras for security purposes and enter residences equipped with smart locks that could be remotely unlocked.However not all of Walmart’s omnichannel experiments had been successful. In August 2017 Walmart had partnered with Google Express to make Walmart products available on Google’s online marketplace. But Google confirmed via Twitter on January 22 2019 that Walmart products had been withdrawn from its online shelves.In January 2017 Walmart abandoned its effort to create a rival to Amazon Prime. The program ShippingPass had been introduced in 2015 and offered free two-day shipping for customers who paid a $49 membership fee. The program was replaced by free shipping for all orders greater than $35.An attempt by Walmart to turn its U.S. associates into an after-hours delivery workforce was scrapped in July 2018. A report in the industry magazine Chain Store Age noted that “. . . the initiative failed to gain traction in New Jersey specifically due to employees being required to use their own cars and insurance policies during deliveries. Many also had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.”TechnologyIn 2019 Walmart was engaged in a number of technology-related initiatives aimed at improving the customer experience and reducing costs. In September 2018 Walmart announced that some food suppliers would need to implement blockchain technology as part of a food traceability program. The objective was to track leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach from farm to store to improve food safety and quality. In April 2019 Walmart introduced robots in 300 U.S. stores to scan shelf inventory and boxes as they were unloaded from trucks. Robotic floor scrubbers were deployed in 1500 stores after having been tested in stores in 2018. Walmart was also running an experiment with a shelf-scanning robot that travelled up and down store aisles verifying shelf labels and looking for gaps in shelves signalling that product was out-of-stock. Another robot picked refrigerated and frozen products to assist in filling grocery pickup orders.The company was also actively developing new apps for customers and store associates. The My Productivity app was designed to improve inventory management in stores. Associates could access the app on their smartphone and review real-time data and sales trends. It allowed associates to reorder specific items and respond to customer questions if needed. The company also launched Dotcom Store an app that allowed associates to place orders for customers on Walmart.com if products were not available or if they were out-of-stock. Walmart also launched a detailed mobile store map for customers looking to navigate a particular store and “Check Out with Me”—an app that allowed customers to pay for their purchases while they were shopping.WALMART’S QUIET TRANSFORMATIONIn 2019 Walmart was transforming itself—leveraging its store network and investing heavily in e-commerce—as part of a new strategy. The company had sold its Brazilian operations while a proposed sale of its Asda chain to Sainsbury had been blocked by Britain’s Competition and Market’s Authority. As it positioned itself to attract higher income customers online and invest in labour-saving technology there was one part of the market that Walmart seemed to have vacated: the small-town rural markets where it had started in the 1960s. Meanwhile a new competitor Dollar General had built a strategy of opening its small stores in “. . . damaged inner-city neighbourhoods with basic goods at basic prices.”Walmart’s sup,"[{""start"":1103,""end"":1113,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1219,""end"":1224,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1534,""end"":1547,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1731,""end"":1744,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2642,""end"":2655,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3535,""end"":3548,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4122,""end"":4135,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6219,""end"":6232,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6654,""end"":6667,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7125,""end"":7138,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8942,""end"":8955,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16700,""end"":16713,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17511,""end"":17524,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18872,""end"":18885,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19092,""end"":19105,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":24902,""end"":24915,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":32860,""end"":32873,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":34176,""end"":34189,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":35013,""end"":35026,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1385,""end"":1387,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

(SingPost) appointed Paul William Coutts as the new CEO. With over 20 years of executive experience with global logistics and postal companies Coutts was well positioned and greatly anticipated to lead the group toward an integrated e-commerce logistics platform and a globally competitive business. However by April 2019 SingPost was plagued with service lapses and operational issues that generated complaints from customers and concerns from respective national agencies. Faced with increasing pressures from rising customer expectations surging mail volumes and the growing popularity of e-commerce SingPost needed to determine how to remain competitive and regain the confidence of its stakeholders. How could SingPost increase the robustness of its service recovery process to prevent the negative escalation of events? What measures could the company take to prevent these issues in the future? THE SINGAPORE POSTAL MARKETSingPost was one of four companies licensed to provide basic mail service in Singapore. Its three competitors were Asendia Management SAS DHL International GmbH and World Marketing Group. These three companies were originally granted Postal Services Operations Licences that allowed them to deliver letters weighing up to 500 grams each in addition to business mail and direct mail for marketers. Singapore’s postal service was privatized on April 1 1992. At that time SingPost received a 15-year exclusive right to deliver the post domestically and internationally over various forms of transport. The company was also granted a 25-year Public Postal Licence that provided SingPost the duty of maintaining postal boxes and providing basic mail service to anyone in Singapore. On February 5 2007 Singapore’s minister for information communications and the arts announced that basic mail services would be liberalized on April 1 2007 which would allow other companies to apply for a Postal Services Operations Licence. Eventually SingPost delivered most basic mail in Singapore. The parcel delivery service industry was more competitive however with many different companies offering door-to-door delivery.SINGPOSTBackground For 160 years SingPost was one of the main postal service providers in Singapore delivering trusted and reliable postal services to homes and businesses. As a pioneer and leader in e-commerce logistics in Singapore SingPost operated in 19 domestic and international postal service markets. SingPost prided itself on delivering “end-to-end integrated digital mail solutions” and offering e-commerce logistic solutions such as last mile delivery and international freight forwarding. ProfitsSingPost experienced positive profit growth over the years. In financial year 2017–18 the company earned S$126.4 million in profits for a 278.4 per cent increase over the previous year (see Exhibit 1). The company’s revenue in 2017–18 was S$1.46 billion for an increase of 8.6 per cent over the previous year thanks to growth in e-commerce activities in the postal and logistics services. On February 1 2019 SingPost announced revenue growth of 7.6 per cent for the third quarter of 2018–19 to reach S$441.4 million (see Exhibit 2). The increase was attributed to higher contributions from all business units during the global e-commerce peak season. Specifically in the post and parcel delivery segment growth in domestic and international e-commerce deliveries across the peak season resulted in a profit increase of 10 per cent on operating activities. However strong performance in the post and parcel segment and in the logistics and property segment was overshadowed by losses in US e-commerce businesses. Therefore overall profit from operating activities fell by 8.5 per cent to S$42.2 million (see Exhibit 2). Nevertheless domestic margins were reported to be “improving on operating synergies from the ongoing integration of its postal and parcel last mile delivery networks.” ManagementIn the previous two years SingPost had undergone a major transformation in its organizational structure due to a series of departures at both the senior and board levels of management. Five directors including the group’s previous CEO had resigned abruptly. The events caused a drop in both the company’s share price and the confidence level of investors. It took SingPost more than one year to overcome the loss with the 2017 appointment of Coutts who was expected bring about a transformation and maintain the company’s competitiveness in the global market. On April 1 2019 SingPost announced another major addition to the company’s management with the appointment of Vincent Phang as CEO of postal services. Phang would oversee the post parcel and logistics segment for the company’s Singapore business.Employee Management Systems The Singapore employment standards agency Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices identified SingPost as one of the best employers due to its promotion of an inclusive workplace culture. To maintain an open communication flow between management and its employees the company implemented regular employee engagement initiatives such as “Tea with the Senior Leadership” and town hall sessions. All employees also had the opportunity to voice their feedback through the SingPost Voice of Employees Survey which formed the basis for SingPost’s solutions for workplace issues. Additionally SingPost rolled out various recognition programs starting in 2011 to reward the best performers from the respective regional bases. The awards were accompanied by monetary incentives to help motivate employees and to promote higher worker retention and loyalty.Current Service Operations SingPost categorized its mail and parcel delivery services into three areas: sending within Singapore sending overseas and receiving mail and parcels. Within the category of receiving mail and parcels SingPost offered various services designed to meet the needs of different customers. Customers could choose to hold and manage confidential mail and parcels to avoid missing delivery if they could not be home during the delivery time. Customers could ensure that they would not miss the delivery of their parcel by using SingPost’s new service called Pick Own Parcel Station (POPStation). Customers could collect their parcels from one of many SingPost POPStations at any time by using a single-use code. A similar service Locker Alliance partnered with widespread parcel lockers and collection points to allow customers to collect parcels at their convenience. Rather than simply leaving mail or parcels at the customer’s doorstep SingPost employees would hold the item for the customer if no one was available to receive it. Customers could then request either a second attempt of a missed delivery or redirection of the item to a more convenient post office for easier pickup.Customers who preferred more management options for the delivery of their confidential mail could use a service called Hold Mail Service which would hold mail securely until it could be delivered in person. REPORTED INCIDENTSOverviewOriginally providing effective last mile delivery was considered SingPost’s unique competitive advantage. Over time however that standard became an expected service by all customers. Therefore in 2018 and in early 2019 SingPost received unfavourable publicity when various events were seen as failures in basic service operations. The incidents included mail being left on mailboxes discarded parcels false missed-delivery notices valuable parcels left on the doorstep and forged recipients’ signatures on the proof of receipt. When these service failure incidents were ignored rather than being promptly addressed and rectified negative attention was cast on the company. SingPost was blamed for lack of accountability and explanation and customer complaints were met with generic responses. Undelivered Letters Discarded Undistributed Flyers ConcealedIn January 2019 an Ang Mo Kio resident discovered stacks of unopened letters inside a trash bin and promptly proceeded to share the incident via a series of photos on Facebook. The 30–40 letters that were discovered included official mail from government agencies such as the Land Transport Authority and the Community Health Assistance Scheme. Under Singapore’s Postal Services Act it was an offence for any officer employee or agent of postal licensees to destroy or discard any postal article.After an internal investigation by SingPost the police took over the case which led to the eventual arrest in late January 2019 a 29-year-old postal worker. SingPost issued a Facebook apology to residents of the affected housing blocks and offered assistance for the inconveniences caused by the lost mail.The Ang Mo Kio resident’s Facebook post showing the discarded mail was shared more than 6000 times. People took to social media platforms and online forums to voice their disapproval. Most people who commented expressed concern for what they perceived as an unnecessarily heavy workload for SingPost employees which was considered a sign of deeper underlying problems within the company’s operations. However some comments suggested that the responsible postal worker should be punished. The discussion thread branched out to personal anecdotes of negative experiences with SingPost. One post described an event in which a SingPost customer service officer was unable to provide the address for the SingPost main office because the customer service function had been outsourced to India.Around that time another negative incident plagued SingPost. A small business owner who had paid S$7000 for the distribution of advertising flyers contacted SingPost to enquire about the status of his order and was sent photos showing the successful distribution of his flyers in various mailboxes. However the photos were later proven to have been digitally manipulated. On closer inspection all flyers in the photos shared the same unique identification marks which proved the successful distribution of only one flyer. It was alleged that SingPost staff had manipulated the photos to imply that they had completed the customer’s order without having actually performed their job. After the business owner contacted the police SingPost reacted by sanctioning the staff members responsible. SingPost received a strong critical response from angry consumers who felt that SingPost had intended to purposely mislead its customers had the fraudulent photos not been discovered.Issues with undelivered advertising flyers had occurred before. In February 2018 a SingPost worker was confronted by a customer who had reason to believe that his flyers were not being distributed after various bundles of letters were found unopened in nearby trash bins. Videos documenting the tense exchange showed the SingPost employee complaining that he was overworked having to deliver over 2600 letters per day. He also claimed that he was not compensated for overtime work and had no time to visit the doctor for his sore ankle. SingPost responded by dismissing the worker for failing to perform his duties. Leaving Failed Delivery Notifications without WaitingA December 2018 Facebook video depicted yet another negative account involving a SingPost worker. The video seemed to show the worker at the customer’s door for only a few seconds leaving a missed-delivery notice and going back to his vehicle before the customer could answer the door. When confronted the worker claimed he waited more than 20 minutes.SingPost investigated the event and issued a statement claiming that the worker had followed SingPost procedures by knocking several times without response and leaving a missed-delivery notice after waiting more than 45 seconds. Regarding the worker’s claim that he had waited 20 minutes SingPost explained that the worker was not fluent in English and was thus unable to express himself properly. The incident also raised the issue of whether 45 seconds was sufficient time for customers to set aside their daily routine to answer the door. Various other Facebook users joined the online discussion with their own unpleasant encounters with lost or delayed packages and letters. One user claimed that valuable parcels had been left outside the door apparently having been signed for despite the signature not belonging to any family members. Another user captured a SingPost worker on video leaving regular mail together with a failed delivery slip despite not carrying any parcels.SERVICE RECOVERY On January 14 2019 after a series of service lapses SingPost issued a public apology on its Facebook page. The company explained that approximately 3 million items were processed each day and the year-end was a very busy peak season for all staff members requiring 20 extra doorstep deliveries each day. Nevertheless SingPost promised to review operational procedures vigorously to increase the quality of its service. The company also announced that the workers who were involved in negative incidents had been dismissed. The Facebook post received responses from outraged customers who complained of unsatisfactory experiences. Others criticized the company for SingPost blaming peak periods when the issues had persisted for some time. Changes in Operation Procedures On February 7 2019 in response to the 2018 incidents SingPost announced immediate measures as part of a broad review of its postal operations. The measures were aimed at solving the most pressing issues within three to six months. One of the most pressing issues was the recent increase in workload resulting from the rapid rise of e-commerce especially in seasonal periods. SingPost planned to employ 100 additional workers to cope with rising delivery volumes and to increase the number of dedicated parcel collection counters and workers at post offices. The company also planned to work with government agencies and the Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore to upgrade worker skills and alleviate the large workloads.SingPost also addressed remuneration as part of its salary structure review. As of February 1 2019 workers would receive higher pay with incentives for successful deliveries of trackable items to the customer’s doorstep. Mail delivery shifts would also be extended to weekday evenings and Saturdays to reduce missed deliveries. Those workers who volunteered for the new shifts would receive overtime pay. SingPost also aimed to improve service levels at its core mail delivery service. Coutts announced other longer-term measures to address other issues raised. SingPost would also introduce new technology and infrastructure to improve the delivery process according to a specific timeline (see Exhibit 3).Other ImplicationsIn February 2019 Infocomm Media Development Authority fined SingPost S$100000 for a series of service lapses that occurred in 2017. In May 2017 SingPost had failed to achieve the standard of delivering at least 99 per cent of local basic letters within the Central Business District by the next working day. Later in the same year it had failed to achieve both 100 per cent delivery of local basic letters within two working days for a period of five months and 100 per cent delivery of registered mail for a period of three months. Although the February 2019 penalty was the heaviest fine ever levied by the national agency concerns were raised in Singapore’s Parliament regarding the adequacy of the fine considering that nine service failures had been recorded in one year. Growth in E-commerce: Three-Year Transformation PlanIn addition to improving its operational procedures to offer reliable postal services SingPost sought to develop new revenue streams from the growing e-commerce trend. To strengthen its foothold in the e-commerce logistic market and counter the drop in domestic postal service SingPost developed a transformation strategy for its postal and logistic networks to be rolled out progressively over a period of three years. With a goal to become the regional last mile delivery and urban logistic partner of choice SingPost built up new capabilities on its existing e-commerce logistic solutions such as front-end website management warehouse and fulfillment international freight forwarding and last mile delivery. The logistics service Last Mile Platform was set up in 2018 to synchronize various last mile delivery solutions (e.g. courier service collection points and parcel lockers) into one platform. The platform was expected to enable enhanced flexibility convenience and control for customers. It merged services from multiple retailers and logistic providers from across Southeast Asia allowing customers to obtain their digital purchases from any last mile service provider on the network.MOVING FORWARDBy early April 2019 SingPost’s immediate operational changes were still in progress. Although the company did not have a monopoly in the postal market it held the only public postal licence in Singapore and had the largest market share. Therefore SingPost’s service was crucial and fundamental changes needed to be implemented. Despite the measures that were in progress SingPost needed to do to more to address deeply rooted operational issues and regain consumer confidence over the long term.EXHIBIT 1: SINGapore POST Ltd.

Copyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation Version: 2019-05-28At the end of April 2015 Rui Zhang founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Chunyu Yisheng (Chunyu) was trying to decide how to create long-term business value and a loyal user base for his company. Chunyu which Zhang had founded in July 2011 was a Chinese mobile health application (app) that connected patients with doctors over the Internet. Its business model was based on providing a health care question-and-answer (Q&A) service by telephonic and online consultation with doctors. By the end of 2014 the Chunyu app had been downloaded 19.18 million times from four main Android app stores in China. However Zhang knew that he could not afford to be complacent with the app’s download volume because he was facing a series of issues that needed to be overcome. First the biggest challenge for Chunyu was to become profitable. Since its creation in 2011 Chunyu had been losing a significant amount of money each year. By the end of 2014 Chunyu’s loss for the year was expected to reach CN¥10 million. Second insights gained by in-app data analytics over the previous three years indicated to Zhang and his team that users’ engagement and retention rates were relatively low. Recognizing this low user loyalty they decided to move beyond just measuring application downloads and focus on building a sustained active user base for Chunyu. The third challenge was the increasing number of mobile health (m-health) apps which was rapidly increasing competition. A fiercely competitive market along with low revenues and high expenses was forcing Chunyu to create additional revenue streams to become profitable in the future. Zhang had much to worry about but the most significant concern was finding a cost-effective and long-term value-creation model. The question was should Chunyu rebuild its current online-consultancy-based model or move to an alternative business model?BACKGROUND The Global M-Health MarketThe Global Observatory of the World Health Organization defined m-health as “medical and public health practices supported by mobile devices.” In recent years the global m-health market had increased rapidly. In 2010 the m-health market was valued at US$1.7 billion and was projected to reach more than $4.1 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent. With the increased adoption of smartphones as well as continued global venture investment into the digital health care market the number of m-health apps had grown steadily over the previous few years. As of June 2013 over 97000 health apps were available in the top app stores worldwide and this number was projected to grow approximately 23 per cent over the next five years. The Rise of Mobile Health in ChinaThe Chinese health care system despite its lengthy process of reforms still faced several critical issues. For instance doctors were overworked and underpaid and while urban community health centres and county hospitals were underdeveloped and inefficiently utilized general hospitals in big cities remained overcrowded. Patient–doctor mistrust was widespread and unnecessary patient visits to well-known hospitals regardless of the severity of illness were common.In response to these emerging problems new technologies had evolved in the Chinese health care system over the previous decade. For example the smartphone app for patient health and fitness was one of the recent technologies influencing the Chinese health care industry. Mobile health apps enabled patients to access information about health care facilities communicate and schedule appointments with doctors remotely and order prescribed medications online. At the same time m-health apps provided doctors with real-time access to patients’ medical records and facilitated monitoring patients’ symptoms such as blood pressure heart rate and nutrition habits. Meanwhile the massive demand for online health care services in China attracted significant interest and investment from leading foreign enterprises. For example in April 2014 Virtual Radiologic (vRad) the largest telemedicine company in the US market signed a strategic partnership agreement with E-Techco Group a Chinese high-tech firm providing cloud-based personalized health management. In addition over the preceding few years leading Chinese tech giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. had invested millions of dollars in the Chinese online health care industry.According to a report by Research and Markets China’s m-health market was worth ¥ 2.21 billion in 2013 and was expected to reach ¥19.05 billion by the end of 2018. Another report from the China–Britain Business Council said China would be the world’s second-largest m-health market by the end of 2017. Government support also could be credited for the rise of the m-health market. Over the preceding few years the Chinese government had intensified its efforts to promote online health care and telemedicine. For example in 2012 the National Health Commission (then the Ministry of Health) invested over $9.5 billion to develop electronic medical records and advance hospital information systems. In the latter half of 2014 China’s central government made a series of announcements to regulate telemedicine and online sales of pharmaceuticals. In July 2014 Beijing’s municipal government and Baidu Inc. a leading Chinese Internet company jointly launched a cloud-based health-management system to offer pre-diagnosis assessments for users. Government agencies such as China International Capital Corporation Ltd. China Venture Capital Association and the China Development Bank were also providing funding support to new start-ups in the m-health market.CHUNYU: THE COMPANY Zhang together with Boyi Zeng and Guanghui Li founded Chunyu. Zhang was a former director of the Beijing Times news centre and deputy editor-in-chief at NetEase. Moving from the Beijing Times to NetEase then to Chunyu Zhang precisely grasped the opportunities that the Internet revolution presented. He handled overall management of the company while his two co-founder friends handled other essential company matters. Li previously general manager of China Gamma Group Ltd. based in Hong Kong was more inclined toward supervising day-to-day operations while Zeng who had worked at NetEase preferred to manage the application-development team.Zhang banked on the Internet to fulfill his vision of “resolving health care problems with innovative models.” The vision was realized through a smartphone application that offered a free health care Q&A service and five value-added services at a premium including “quick call” online consultation telephonic consultation personal doctor service and private consultation scheduling (see Exhibit 1). MAJOR PLAYERS IN the CHINESE M-HEALTH MARKET As a first mover in the Chinese m-health market Chunyu developed a basic business model for online health care services but faced powerful competitors such as Kuai Su Wen Yi Sheng Ping An Good Doctor HaoDF Online and DXY.Kuai Su Wen Yi ShengKuai Su Wen Yi Sheng was one of the top remote-consultation apps in the Chinese m-health market. Zhuhai Healthcare Cloud Technology Co. Ltd. launched the app in May 2012. The app provided three types of services: remote diagnosis medication guidance and appointments with doctors. Kuai Su Wen Yi Sheng’s business model resembled that of Chunyu. By October 2014 Kuai Su Wen Yi Sheng had amassed 13 million registered users and 60000 qualified doctors handling an average of more than 10 million daily queries.Ping An Good Doctor Ping An Good Doctor another remote-consultation app was officially launched on April 21 2015 by the Ping An Insurance Company of China Ltd. which was the first integrated financial services conglomerate in China. Specifically Ping An Good Doctor followed Chunyu’s business model while it developed its own model. The Ping An app provided one-on-one consultations with doctors. The app was also equipped with an online drugstore providing details on medications and other health care products. HaoDF OnlineHaoDF Online was one of China’s first disease management and post-surgery rehabilitation apps. Founded in 2006 HaoDF Online was also the first mobile application in China to provide free online medical advisory services appointments with doctors and follow-up services. Moreover HaoDF Online was credited with introducing China’s first online hierarchical appointment and referral system to resolve problems with long queues in general hospitals. By using this hierarchical appointment and referral system the HaoDF platform classified patients based on the severity of their illnesses. Less sick patients were treated at community medical centres while those needing more serious care were sent to general hospitals. Importantly HaoDF Online equipped its patients with the power to vote for their favourite doctors based on the patient’s service experience. DXYDXY was one of the largest online health care service communities for health care professionals. Founded in 2000 by Li Tiantian the portal offered an extensive database of popular health and medical articles. DXY similar to Chunyu also offered online consultations with doctors and guidance on choosing hospitals. In addition to allowing users to check a drug’s authenticity and other detailed information DXY enabled users to locate nearby pharmacies providing accurate contact information and comprehensive data related to drug manufacturers. CHUNYU’S PATH TO GROWTH When Chunyu was founded no one on the management team except Zhang was familiar with the health care industry. Through frequent chats with his father a long-time doctor Zhang had learned about the difficulties that Chinese patients encountered as well as the general challenges facing the Chinese health care system. Chunyu’s strategy for growth remained consistent over the years whereas products and pricing schemes were being fine-tuned regularly. According to Li Chunyu’s chief operating officer Chunyu progressed through three distinct development phases: application development resource gathering and commercialization. Product Development and the Freemium ModelIn the first six months following Chunyu’s inception four critical advancements were made in funding product development and global recognition. A few months dragged on with financing problems then on November 1 2011 Chunyu raised $3 million in a Series A round of funding from BlueRun Ventures a US-based venture capital firm (see Exhibit 2). During that same month with great zeal and effort Chunyu completed development of its first mobile app and launched it for iOS (Apple) devices. Two months later Chunyu launched an Android version. Within six months of the app’s launch from November 2011 to April 2012 the app was downloaded approximately one million times. The Chunyu app was recognized in 2012 with a Microsoft BizSpark award a global support program for start-up companies engaged in software development and technical support.By August 2013 the number of users registered in Chunyu reached 12 million with 5000 registered doctors and 400000 active users. During that same year Chunyu was recognized as one of the top 50 most innovative Chinese business. The app itself was free for patients and doctors to download. After registration patients could access two free services. One service was for asking health care questions on the platform and the other provided one free 90-second phone consultation with a doctor daily. As time passed Zhang felt Chunyu could no longer afford to provide these free services. The challenge was that for the free services Chunyu was paying doctors about ¥500000 each month on behalf of its users. For Chunyu this expense presented a significant barrier to becoming profitable. Zhang learned over time that while these payments that Chunyu made to its service providers provided immediate benefits to the company in the long run they proved to be challenging. Thus he wondered how he should address this issue. As a leader in the Chinese m-health market Zhang was well aware of the performance of other market players. HaoDF an online platform established five years earlier which allowed users to search for and book appointments with doctors faced a less severe profit challenge because it began charging its users for telephonic consultations in 2013.Another challenge that attracted Zhang’s attention was the small fraction of active users on the platform: by August 2013 the platform had only 400000 active users compared with 12 million registered users. Zhang recognized that it was still relatively common for users to download the Chunyu app use it once then remove it from their smartphone. Thus Zhang and his team were keenly interested in learning more about loyalty-building hurdles.Creativity and Innovation: Keys to Unlocking Value and ProfitabilityAs time passed Zhang began to get frustrated. He recognized that the company’s existing services were not generating sufficient revenue to keep up with the growing expenses so he decided to be more creative in his thinking about developing paid services commercially viable products and a profitable business model. However the process of introducing paid services and creating commercially viable products was not an easy task for Zhang. He expressed his concerns in an interview with NetEase: “I fear that users would be annoyed if you actually charged them and then they would abandon you.” Thus Zhang postponed commercialization until the end of 2013 and strived to continue with the existing business model and services. After two-and-a-half years of exploration while suffering losses Chunyu finally took a step toward commercialization: in December 2013 it introduced monthly and annual subscriptions for users. In the updated version users could subscribe to the membership services which cost ¥8 per month or ¥88 per year. Unlike the free services membership enabled users to consult with doctors with no limitations on consultation frequency and the response time was guaranteed to be no more than 30 minutes. Chunyu did not publicize these features and incorporated them only in the latest version of the application. Besides generating additional revenues for Chunyu the membership system was expected to provide three additional benefits. First participating doctors could draw stable part-time income from Chunyu’s platform. Second users could acquire more reliable health care services. Finally the system would unlock commercial value for Chunyu. Later in May 2014 Chunyu updated its application with five value-added services: Quick Call (users paid ¥15 to initiate a call request but could not request a specific doctor); Online Consultation (users could schedule an online consultation with a particular doctor); Telephonic Consultation (users could schedule a telephone consultation up to 15 minutes long with a specific doctor); Personal/Private Doctor Service (users were allowed unlimited online and telephone consultations with a particular doctor); and Personal Consultation Scheduling (users could schedule face-to-face services in hospitals). Meanwhile in August 2014 Chunyu announced the completion of a Series C funding round raising $50 million. Two months later Chunyu launched yet another updated version of its app and this one integrated with a patient remote monitoring device. It allowed physicians to access patients’ electronic health records such as medical history treatment plans and laboratory test results. That same year Chunyu earned three top awards—one identified Chunyu as a best start-up company another acknowledged Chunyu as having the best mobile medical app and the third recognized Chunyu’s contributions as an innovative health industry Internet company in China. Chunyu had an impressive strategy of providing free medical information additional medical services with a subscription and finally value-added services at a premium. However in addition to building a reasonable base of loyal users and doctors who could produce long-term value in the application more business models needed to be investigated to address the profitability challenge and make the application more commercial.The Decision to Appoint a Chief Marketing OfficerThe main challenge for Chunyu came from its business model. Zhang reflected “We tried membership services and value-added services but all seemed to be less successful in capturing long-term value. They were unable to build a strong connection between the platform and its users.” The CEO wondered whether he had overlooked something that meant Chunyu was unable to achieve profitable growth.As Chunyu continued to grow Zhang recruited more experts. In October 2014 aiming to capture the desired commercial value for the application and to build a long-term connection between the platform and its users Zhang appointed Chengping Liu as chief marketing officer (CMO) responsible for commercialization. Liu’s approach was to use commercialization to build a long-term and robust connection between the platform and its users. After a detailed analysis of in-app data Liu noted: There was a weak connection between the platform and its users; therefore it would be impossible to capture commercial value. It was hard to commercialize Chunyu’s online inquiry services wherein the patients interact with different doctors every time leading to patient dissatisfaction. Premium services were also unsuccessful in capturing the desired commercial value due to patient–doctor mistrust. The commercial value could only be created if patients trusted doctors and were willing to pay the long-term subscription fees.Under these circumstances Liu contributed by introducing a ranking system for doctors and users. The Chunyu system identified the top-rated doctors based on users’ reviews and the top-ranked users who frequently used the application and were willing to pay for the services. The CMO used this system to work on the “brand effect” of individual doctors. In addition Liu developed a fee-determination mechanism enabling doctors to set charges for their services. THE ROAD AHEADThe fee-determination system became more widely accepted and the brand effect of affiliated doctors showed steady growth. By March 2015 Chunyu had amassed 45000 registered doctors addressing on average 60000 queries a day. Chunyu also was among the top players in the industry well on its way to realizing its vision of resolving health problems with innovative models. However Zhang knew that the road ahead would present him with more choices and challenges. As a first mover in the Chinese m-health market Chunyu developed a well-established market share and competitive advantages but Zhang wondered what the next step should be. How should Chunyu address the concerns that the CMO had raised? How could Chunyu sustain its revenue and reduce profitability pressures in a competitive market?EXHIBIT 1: CHUNYU consultation charges Note: ¥ = CN¥ = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1 = ¥6.206 as of December 31 2014.Source: “Spring Rain Allows Doctors to Set Own Prices” Marbridge Consulting April 29 2014 accessed March 27 2017 www.marbridgeconsulting.com/marbridgedaily/201430/article/74632/spring_rain_allows_doctors_to_set_own_prices.exhibit 2: CHunyu financial SupportNote: * In USD; US$1 = CN¥6.206 as of December 31 2014.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation Version: 2021-06-16It was a pleasant cold morning in October 2017 and Balaji Viswanathan founder of Invento Robotics (Invento) was eagerly waiting for his team members to join him in the corporate board room. An event manager for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) an international entrepreneurship event organized by the US and Indian governments had approached Invento with a mandate to build a unique humanoid robot that would locomote around the stage to greet India’s prime minister Narendra Modi and Ivanka Trump senior adviser to the US president Donald Trump when the two would appear together at the summit in Hyderabad. Viswanathan was not interested in participating in the summit because of the money; the event was poised to be a platform to showcase what humanoid robots could do. The event would attract the attention of the international media and could propel Invento onto the international stage. Viswanathan was aware that the event might offer the perfect platform to expose Invento to many potential customers. It was thus imperative to design a complete marketing strategy—target customers product highlights distribution and advertising—before heading to the GES.With just one year of research and development (R&D) thus far invested in the creation of its humanoid robot it would be difficult for Invento to finish casting casing and finalizing all product functions in only three weeks’ time which was when the robot was expected to be ready for the summit’s opening ceremony. It was likely that potential customers and industry stalwarts would bombard Viswanathan with questions about the robot’s features and price as well as information about how they could purchase a robot once unveiled to public eyes at GES. With so much on his plate Viswanathan was disconcerted about the complex marketing strategy decisions he had to make in the next few days.Invento RoboticsViswanathan Invento’s chief executive officer (CEO) and founder completed a master of science at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2007 and a master of business administration at Babson College in 2014. After spending three years at his first job with Microsoft Corporation he returned to India where he started a set of entrepreneurial venturesNalandaU Agni Innovation Labs Zingfin and Limitlesssome of which were in India some in the United States. Viswanathan had a great deal of followers on the popular social media platform Quora where he regularly wrote answers to questions on topics such as history economics politics and society. As of 2017 he was one of the most followed persons on that platform. He enjoyed an extensive reach on other social media platforms as well.Viswanathan started Invento in Bangalore in 2016 with the aim to make robots relevant in the households of India. Invento designed and manufactured two product lines named Mitra and Mitri humanoid robots in male and female versions (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Humanoid robots were robots with features resembling a human being. The company wished to enable robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to reach the public in a way that would be similar to what personal computers had done for the computing industry. Invento’s mission was to productize key inventions from the labs by combining research with business sense. The vision was to bring about a robotics revolution similar to those brought about by the iPhone in 2007 and personal computers in 1981. Invento built robotic stacks that sustained and provided a platform for delivering proprietary and third-party AI solutions (see Exhibit 3). See Exhibit 5 for Invento’s balance sheet for the years ending 2017 and 2018.Robots made by Invento were equipped with four unique features. First they had a location-based awareness with a precision tolerance of a centimetre that enabled them to navigate through indoor spaces. The robots could be directed by voice to reach a particular location which was specifically useful for retail settings. Second gesture-based immersive voice conversations allowed the robots to understand non-audible cues in the conversation. Robots could also understand verbal exchanges ranging from a one-line command to a natural conversation. Third voice stacking with triggerless exchange allowed for a user’s face to serve as a trigger instead of having to use trigger words (such as “Hey Alexa!”). Invento had developed proprietary natural language processing techniques that were utilized for this feature. Fourth Invento’s distinct computer-vision stack combined with a computer-vision application programming interface (API) and TensorFlow models enabled the robots to detect emotions objects and faces. These features were distinctively present in Invento’s products and put Mitra and Mitri a step above the competition.Most of Invento’s clients recognized the high quality of the company’s products. In interactions with Invento’s senior leaders various companies had shown interest in humanoid robots and in deploying them. These positive testimonials were deemed of great importance and generated positive sentiments about the company’s future.Market for Humanoid RobotsThe market size of humanoid robots also known as humanoids was valued at US$450 million in 2016. The use of humanoids was an increasing trend globally with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35 per cent from 2017 to 2024. The industrial robot industry had grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of 9.5 per cent between 2013 and 2017. As of 2017 China was the biggest market closely followed by Japan and Germany. However new markets such as Mexico India and Australia had displayed faster growth rates (see Exhibit 5).According to an industry profile on global robots published by MarketLine all strategic forces (buyer power supplier power degree of rivalry threat of substitutes and threat of new entrants) were equally high and played a relatively important role in the industry. Robots were internationally marketed products and a player’s performance was decidedly based on the alignment of all strategic market forces. Buyers in the industry were mainly large organizations and multinational conglomerates that possessed the wherewithal to handle such large-ticket purchases. Suppliers were fragmented and globally dispersed. Extensive specialization in production resulted in high switching costs. Entry to market was restricted due to the intellectual property rights held by existing players. However new players were quickly emerging and were applying their knowledge to new developments and proprietary technology.Major international players included Japan-based SoftBank Robotics and China-based Amy Robotics and Sanbot Robotics (Sanbot) from China. Backed by the multinational conglomerate holding company SoftBank Corp. SoftBank Robotics was the world’s leading humanoid robot manufacturer with three major offeringsa customer service robot a teaching assistant robot and an autonomous vacuum sweeper. The company had a wide global presence with offices in Tokyo Shanghai San Francisco Boston and Paris.Amy Robotics a Chinese humanoid manufacturer founded in June 2015 had research offices across the globe. It had development centres and offices in the United States Germany Japan and the United Kingdom. Amy Robotics’ robot was supported by its state-of-the-art AI extensions in addition to well-developed hardware. Sanbot was also a Chinese robotics firm and had four major humanoid offerings differentiated by size: Sanbot Nano Sanbot Elf Sanbot Mini Elf and Sanbot Max. Sanbot offered an API service that enabled developers to build their own apps for Sanbot robots. Peppera robot built by Aldebaran a French robotics company later acquired by SoftBank Roboticswas possibly most similar to Invento’s offerings. Invento’s robots performed better than Pepper on several parameters including autonomous navigation inbuilt support for facial recognition and contextual conversations. Importantly Pepper was not available outside Japan and had multiple restrictions on its use and publicity. Apart from international competitions Invento’s robots faced competition from Indian manufacturers such as Sirena Technologies.Viswanathan commentedThe key competitive advantage we are going for is being very focused on enterprise applicationsincluding integration into their [the enterprise’s] systems security privacy and deployments. The robot is only as useful as it is integrated into an enterprise’s systems. Our Chinese or Japanese competitors often lack this understanding of large software teams and enterprises.For example a humanoid in a hospital would require contextual integration and updating—hardware to hardware hardware to software and software to software. The humanoid should know where to pick up and drop off medical instruments and medicines in operation theatres and pharmacies while updating the information system with inventory wait times and other elements. Even when a humanoid was great at navigation facial recognition and conversations integrating it with an enterprise’s information technology (IT) system added multifold value.Indian MarketThe humanoid robot market in India was expected to follow the global trend although specific numbers varied with unreliable estimates. Nevertheless in terms of installation India’s industrial robot market was the 11th largest in the world as reported by the International Federation of Robotics. Further in 2017 alone the country increased its robot production from $111.23 million to $124.27 million (i.e. by 11.7 per cent). The cumulative annual growth rate between 2013 and 2017 was 9.3 per cent which was less than the global CAGR of 9.5 per cent (see Exhibit 4). The general sentiment however was that India’s market would soon increase significantly. The industry was expected to grow further as the country was expected to follow a steep economic growth trajectory. The country’s gross domestic product was expected to grow by 7 per cent and companies intended to increase capacity and automate menial jobs an initiative that would result in higher sales of robots and robotic equipment.TARGET CUSTOMERSInvento positioned its humanoids for six major industries and sectors: retail finance health care government hospitality and education. Humanoids were becoming increasingly attractive for use in retail for their emotional engagement proposition. The robots could create an empathetic link with shoppers providing them a better shopping experience. Typical usage for robots in retail included offering greetings processing payments providing information and sales support services including surveying the shoppers. The finance industry used robots for personalized targeted positioning of financial products among other things; the expected use cases included employing the robots as receptionists for on-demand report generation and as recommendation engines. The health care industry used humanoids as health assistants for self-diagnosis and preliminary nursing. In the government sector robots could be used to create additional methods to deliver services in multiple languages. In the hospitality industry humanoids could be employed for the direct delivery of information and personalized services to customers (see Exhibit 3). They could also be used by educational institutions as a teaching-aid tool. In the service sector humanoid robots were considered a latent need and there were few manufacturers of service-sector robots. The finance and hospitality sectors were expected to drive a major share of revenues in the forthcoming year.Invento targeted Fortune 1000 companies that were looking for such humanoid robots. Its primary customers mainly belonged to two industries: (1) banking finance and insurance (BFI); and (2) IT. Some prominent names in Invento’s portfolio included Barclays PLC HDFC Bank Limited Accenture PLC Infosys Limited and HCL Technologies. BFI customers looked for humanoids for customer engagement and product selling. IT customers on the other hand used robots to offer different solutions to their customers. Viswanathan explained “In the next five years we believe almost every major enterprise in the world would use robotsin a way akin to PC [personal computer] entry into [the] enterprise world in the 1980s. The applications would range from customer engagement to sales visitor management security and employee engagement.”Beyond industry requirements Invento categorized its customers into two groups: vanity and sanity. The customers who made up the vanity segment were typically high-end users who took pride in owning a robot appraising it as a luxury good. Serving this segment resulted in higher margins but lower sales volumes. On the other hand sanity customers had a complex and long buying process. The perceived value for sanity customers revolved around the novelty of robots. With this segment the margins were lower but the sales volumes were much higher.Invento’s closest competitor SoftBank Robotics targeted its robot Pepper to players in the hospitality retail banking and automotive industries. In the past SoftBank Robotics had engaged customers such as HSBC Bank in Manhattan New York and Courtyard by Marriott. HSBC Bank used Pepper for providing information to customers about financial products; directing customers to the appropriate staff; and even posing for selfies telling jokes and dancing for the audience. Courtyard by Marriott had observed an 11-point increase in customer satisfaction by using Pepper.ProductInvento had built a vendor supply chain to outsource many of the standardized components required in the assembly of robots. The final product was manufactured at Invento’s Bengaluru plant. As the product specifications evolved rapidly it was a challenge for Invento to find appropriate vendors to whom it could outsource the relevant parts. As Viswanathan maintained the production of the robots would remain in India in the foreseeable future.The male version of the humanoid robot Mitra was five feet tall and weighed 50 kilograms. It could easily be disassembled carried and reassembled as per the requirements. It had a unique suspension system that enabled it to walk on surfaces as rough as earthen roads. The robot was equipped with a battery that had a working capacity of more than 12 hours on a single charge. It was also equipped with a screen speaker connectivity and Bluetooth support to allow it to carry out its daily operations (see Exhibit 1). Considering its size Mitra’s movement needed to be calibrated and controlled to safeguard it from toppling.Viswanathan stated “Autonomous navigation in an uncontrolled environment is the toughest problem to solve. Designing robots for [an] indoor environment eliminates the possibility of having a line-flow arrangement atypical of theoretical modelling.” It was apparent that training the user base for interaction with robots in environments such as retail settings was a tough task given that such places attracted people unfamiliar with humanoids.Mitri the female version of the humanoid robot was a new addition to Invento’s product portfolio. The Mitri line of robots was designed to be a human-resource robot with its usage aligned to jobs like operating a reception desk. She was equipped with “soft skills” such as etiquette which made this robot unique. Invento claimed Mitri to be India’s first female robot receptionist. She constantly blinked her blue LED (light-emitting diode) eyes and looked around to register people in her database. She could register the emotions of the people around her and was programmed to frequently cheer up employees who were feeling low. Interaction with Mitri typically started at the reception area of a workplace where the interactor communicated to Mitri their details such as their name age workplace and the purpose for their meeting. Based on the registered data and data saved during any previous interactions Mitri would recognize the person with her wide eyes.Her head was spherical and had an antenna fitted to it. The body was cased in a plastic frame that was reminiscent of C-3PO from Star Wars. Like Mitra the body could be disassembled and packed easily. Mitri was also equipped with the ability to communicate in multiple languagesincluding Indic languagesthat were coded as needed. Both Mitri and Mitra came with a one-year warranty and a service-level agreement of 24-hour level-1 support. This could be topped up with an annual maintenance contract. Although the two robot lines were used for different purposes they had some overlapping characteristics. Viswanathan sometimes wondered whether sales of Mitri robots could cannibalize sales of Mitra robots. Were the products different enough to be targeted to different segments?Mitra and Mitri robots were discernibly branded. On a casual look Mitra’s name written in a satiny font was visible on the robot’s right arm and bottom wheels. The front of Mitra was loaded with a touch screenused for taking instructions that were beyond audio- or visual-based input mechanismswhose screen saver usually set to be the client company’s logo could be changed. Mitri was available in bright colours such as yellow pink and violet. Mitri’s lower body was characteristically unique: it appeared as if the humanoid was wearing a frock or a robe (see Exhibit 2).PriceEqually challenging for Invento was what price it should charge for the Mitra robot. There was a perfect Goldilocks zone for pricing: set the price too high and the product would remain unsold; set the price too low and there was risk of leaving a surplus on the table. Further the pricing had to take care of recovering the costs. Apart from production costs the R&D costs were quite high for a specialized product like a robot. According to Invento’s internal research other players in the market priced their product in a range of $12550$16730.It was difficult to gauge exact figures for production as most of it was done in-house and Invento did not have any pre-determined cost accounting system in place. Viswanathan estimated that Invento spent around $34863 per month as fixed costs. About four-fifths of these were salaries paid to staff and personnel. The R&D and design departments were deemed important from a product perspective and were expected to remain as such in the near future. Viswanathan recalled contemplating the pricing the previous year: “It was confusing. Should we just add a flat margin to all over and above the cost? Should we estimate the ‘true value’as MBA [master of business administration] grads put itand charge for that? Could we somehow peg the price to our competitors? In any case we can’t push our gross margins to below 75 per cent.”Sumit Roy Invento’s chief revenue officer explained that either Mitra or Mitri would ideally be suited to replace a receptionist at for example a health care facility. The median salary of a receptionist in India was $2621 per year. In addition to this an average receptionist earned about $209 as a bonus and another $140 as commission every year. The humanoid robot could also be used for selling credit cards in a mall. In that case the number of credit card leads generated for the bank could be estimated. The objective for a start-up like Invento was not to maximize cost savings but to increase revenue generation through customer engagement an area where the company performed well. While making such calculations one could assume the average life of Mitri to be around five years.DistributionMost of Invento’s sales had thus far been through direct sales. Invento’s salespeople who were first trained on sales and product features contacted potential buyers and negotiated the purchase. Having a completely isolated sales department enabled the salespeople to close deals rather swiftly. The typical cost to company for a new salesperson at Invento was about $19520. Of this 70 per cent was fixed and the remaining cost was variable.The company lacked direct distribution partners. Most of its sales were driven through its own sales professionals. The company struggled to find distribution partners; small and medium-sized enterprises often lacked the resources and the right sales force to sell a complex product such as the Mitra and Mitri robots. Further executive sales representatives were difficult to train for non-traditional products. Invento was considering the idea of having an external sales agency driving the sales as the sales numbers were not yet certain. Even though the company had never entered any contract for independent sales representatives it was common knowledge that independent sales representatives could present new opportunities as a channel partner. They were apparently also less expensive than a regular sales force (until they closed deals). Most of them had no fixed charge and worked on commission. According to Invento’s estimates independent sales representatives would command a commission of somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent of the order value. Important benefits of employing independent sales representatives were their vast knowledge of the territory in which they operated and their ability to work remotely.AdvertisingFor Invento public relations interaction with the press and social media played an important role in how it communicated to the public and disseminated critical information about the firm and its robots. Viswanathan himself was very active on social media platforms such as Quora and Facebook. He had a huge following on Quora that enabled communication on a large scale.Invento also participated in more than 20 international trade shows including CES and the World AI Show which often led to international client leads. CES was the annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association a standards and trade organization representing more than 2200 consumer technology companies in the United States. The annual event inaugurated in 1967 was currently held in Las Vegas Nevada every January. CES 2017 saw an attendance of 184279 people from around the world which substantiated its popularity. The World AI Show hosted international AI experts data scientists start-ups think tanks technology leaders government bodies and investors together in a single event aiming for the promotion and exchange of developments in the field of AI.Invento had a one-person public relations department that coordinated different activities. Viswanathan’s personal online presence was very strong and attracted significant attention for Invento and its robots as a result. When communicating with industry participants and businesses Invento highlighted the benefits of using humanoid robots and took such opportunities to promote its flagship products. It presented major statistics and data about the changing industry to prospective customers. Invento continued to emphasize to its prospective and current customers that robots were going to be present in all industries soon. It constantly reminded them that not utilizing humanoid robots could put their firms in a disadvantageous position competitively. Invento spent around $1394 on direct advertising but more than $27886 on indirect advertising (trade show participation travel etc.). In addition to the CEO the head of marketing and a sales executive there were four full-time personnel on Invento’s sales team.The Way ForwardIn the short term participating in the GES would be an enriching experience for Invento. However Viswanathan still had challenges to face. As a start-up Invento was almost always bootstrapping itself out of its issuesbut would this method be sufficient in the long run? The foundations of a company were important and Viswanathan had to ensure that Invento had strong foundations. Invento had to work on the final outline of the marketing strategy comprising product price channels of distribution and promotion. Viswanathan and his team members were aware that this task would not be limited to three weeks. The bigger question concerned whether they could put a concrete marketing strategy in place that would boost their confidence when they inevitably met curious minds at the summit.Exhibit 1: Mitra RobotSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: MItri robot employed at smartworksSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Smart Kiosk Management Using Mitri robotsNote: TAT = turnaround time; AI = artificial intelligence; NLP = natural language processing.

(Hengda) a Chinese company that produced anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion materials. As the new leader of the procurement department Gan decided to immerse himself in the department’s daily business routine before rushing into any transformation decisions. Soon after his appointment he met with all procurement department team members to gain a sense of the interactions that normally took place between his new department and the company’s other internal functions and external groups (i.e. suppliers). Gan also decided to carefully review previous procurement records and all written procedures. Gan considered himself a very decisive person but he was having trouble understanding some aspects of his new team’s operations. The procurement department seemed to have a complex relationship with other corporate and business functions (e.g. marketing manufacturing warehousing and inventory and finance). It seemed to routinely receive and fill rush orders which overwhelmed the department and negatively affected the team’s motivation to provide value to the company. However Gan noticed that his team had lost any willingness to improve the situation and had become accustomed to the low-morale environment. Gan learned that his predecessors had tried to improve the situation in the department but they had failed. Even so Gan decided that he could not accept failure as an option and became intent on addressing the systemic issues in his department. He believed that the reason his predecessors were unable to find a solution was because they did not look beyond the surface to find the root causes. Staring at the purchasing data on the screen and reflecting on his staff’s complaints Gan wondered about the nature of the problems in his department. Where did the root causes lie? What would be the best strategy to address them?Jiangxi Hengda High-Tech Company Ltd.Hengda was established in 1993 as a chemical materials manufacturer. In the early years it focused on research and development manufacturing and sales of anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion painting products. The company obtained multiple patents for its research. Hengda went public in 2011 and was listed on the small and medium enterprise board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company was widely regarded as China’s number one anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion stock. After becoming a public corporation Hengda began to diversify into other fields. By mid-2019 the company was involved in waste incinerator (for energy saving and environmental protection) and acoustic noise reduction services. Over the many years of its development Hengda had become an industry leader in China maintaining rapid growth in both revenue and net profits for several years.Unlike its early years when the company had operated within a narrow business scope and simple business processes Hengda currently operated using a functional department model with several business departments operating under the supervision of the general manager’s office. These departments included human resources procurement manufacturing warehousing and inventory finance and marketing (see Exhibit 1). Each department had its own mission and performance goals. The streamlined organizational structure allowed the company to increase its overall operational efficiency which led to consistently favourable net profits. However after Hengda became public and expanded its business lines the company’s internal management structure became more complex reflecting a wider business range and corporate ecosystem.Increasingly the procurement department had to deal with a larger number of suppliers and greater volume of materials. The manufacturing department had to become more innovative and was designing different production processes for new types of products. The warehousing department was required to manage more categories of inventory while the finance department had to deal with complex payment requirements for raw materials. Even the marketing department which interacted with different customer groups was required to meet new volatility in demand. Therefore business processes and information exchange among the company’s business departments became more entangled and complicated. Despite their individual silos structure the various departments had to interact more frequently and their previous work processes were no longer effective in supporting the company’s growth. Internal collaboration was becoming a major challenge. Gan and the Procurement DepartmentBefore assuming his new role as manager of the procurement department Gan had worked for 20 years at a Hengda subsidiary that conducted research and development as well as sales of metal materials and chemicals. Having gained essential experience in procurement and management he was rewarded for his achievements by Hengda’s chairman of the board Zhu Xinghe who helped Gan attain a position on the company’s middle management team.After investigating the status of the procurement department Gan realized that the problems he identified in his department could be a company-wide issue. He might therefore face numerous hurdles in his attempts to resolve his own department’s problem. Nevertheless he was optimistic that he could overcome any hurdles and that career advancement opportunities could be his reward. If he could leverage his rapport with top executives and use his job experience to successfully resolve these problems his contribution to the overall company would be considerable. As a result he would likely gain more trust from his superiors and follow a path toward further career development. He felt pleased with this prospect.Under Hengda’s structure the procurement department operated in parallel with the marketing manufacturing warehousing and finance departments. In addition to Gan as manager there were seven procurement officers in his department. The officers managed the purchasing of materials by category and based on production project requirements. The project cycle for the waste incinerator service was normally short—usually completed within one week—whereas the anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion business generally included just-in-time on-the-spot installation. Therefore the company had to be very responsive to customer requirements. The job of a procurement officer included making purchase plans that included category batching and timing of each supply activity on the basis of internal orders market supply and inventory level. Thorough knowledge of market pricing of raw materials was necessary to perform cost analysis cost control and supplier selection and management as well as to sign contracts and coordinate just-in-time delivery. Key performance indicators for the procurement department included completion of purchasing plans completion of cost reduction targets and punctuality of procurement (see Exhibit 2).Gan knew that the company’s management had been neglecting the value of the procurement department. The company held patents for most of its products and these products sold well because there were not many substitutes on the market. In addition suppliers usually offered favourable payment deferral terms to Hengda. Therefore the executives had not been focusing on enhancing procurement efficiency to reduce costs. Gan decided that if he could make senior management see the value of his department and if he could lead his staff to increase working efficiency there was a potential to considerably reduce costs for the entire company. However he sensed that the company was indifferent to the abilities of his department and of his team members. The general impression was that procurement officers simply placed orders and met production needs. Their responsibilities were considered easy and routine. Other departments assumed that procurement team members were not motivated to work effectively.Gan reviewed the qualifications of his staff. He consulted their resumes and work reports for previous years. He found that only three procurement officers held a bachelor’s degree. The level of competence and professional ability among his staff varied widely. For example they were instructed to simply follow directions without requirements to perform effective data analysis tasks or make sound decisions based on data input. Based on his department’s complaints Gan realized that it was understaffed and operated under considerable work and emotional pressure. He realized that the daily work of a procurement officer was not easy as others assumed but the lack of training and the nominal performance assessment may have been misinterpreted as proactivity. Based on employee feedback Gan found that there had been many complaints from his department to previous managers about considerable pressure from both internal and external sources.After careful thought Gan believed he had found the root issue of the problems in the procurement department. All Hengda functional departments operated at an equal structural level which meant that the procurement team interacted with internal clients (i.e. other functional departments) on a horizontal communication level. However procurement officers had to abide by key performance indicators such as procurement plan fulfillment rate procurement quality and just-in-time material supply for all the different internal customers which often caused friction among the various business units. That friction was reflected in the attitudes of Hengda workers when communicating with the procurement team which led to a lack of information sharing among departments. Procurement officers had to go back and forth between departments and business units to retrieve necessary information and coordinate resources which reduced the effectiveness of the department. The poor information sharing was further affected by an outdated internal communication system that was mostly paper-based. Tracing and retrieving essential data was an excessively time-consuming task.The procurement department purchased a large amount of materials from external suppliers and the selection and management processes for those suppliers involved considerable efforts. All supplier qualifications were evaluated using paperwork rather than on-site inspections. Abiding by the company’s strict financial control the primary consideration for any procurement decision was price; therefore product quality punctual delivery service responsiveness and quality were largely ignored by a procurement department that was already fully extended. Supplier relationships were therefore based on short or single duration. There were no differentiated terms available to specific suppliers nor any attempt to maintain a favourable supplier relationship. The lack of internal information sharing and coordination meant that there was no comprehensive procurement plan. The procurement department was therefore unable to provide suppliers with a proposed shipping schedule in advance. Suppliers often complained about being unable to schedule their own production process based on Hengda orders and some refused to maintain a long-term partnership or offer co-operative service.Gan made a list of all the issues he had identified and glanced over the items which included low work efficiency lack of planning poor information sharing and inefficient supplier management. Gan added another term to the list—invisible wall—and sat gazing at that key term for some time.Invisible WallGan decided that the root cause of his department’s low efficiency was the invisible walls between departments in the company’s silos structure. Each department head was fully in charge of that particular department and had the power to make decisions and perform performance reviews for that department’s team members. Therefore before he could begin to transform the procurement department Gan would have to influence change across the entire company. The first step would be to understand the roles and work processes of Hengda’s different departments but he would have to cross the invisible wall between departments to do so. With a clear goal in mind he began learning how the marketing production warehousing and finance departments operated. He would then try and determine how his staff’s feedback was manifested in the processes of these departments.Marketing DepartmentIn Hengda’s early years the company simply catered to the anti-corrosion paint market. At that time the work of the marketing department was specific and well organized. In recent years however the company had extended its operations into multiple markets and product categories including noise reduction products and waste incinerator services. Therefore the company’s customer base was expanding and its configuration becoming more complex.The procurement department and the marketing department represented two ends of the company’s value chain. Gan knew that it was the procurement department that interfaced directly with manufacturing not the marketing department. However the marketing needs and information came from the marketing department and indirectly influenced production and purchasing plans. In recent years it had become harder to make precise market projections because the company had expanded into different fields with a wider ranging product catalogue. The manufacturing department forwarded its purchasing requirements to the procurement department according to market fluctuations. With large orders the marketing department promoted specific product lines and tried to accelerate production for those products. Therefore the procurement department had to place urgent orders to suppliers based on the marketing plan. Under this circumstance both Hengda and the suppliers had to bear a higher cost and the risk of not being able to fulfill the required orders. Gan wondered if his department could receive market information directly from the marketing team rather than relying on the manufacturing department to relay the information. Was it possible to enhance the entire chain’s market responsiveness? Manufacturing DepartmentBased on Gan’s observations the conflict between the manufacturing and procurement departments was the most evident issue in the company’s internal process.Hengda was a manufacturing company. The primary responsibility of the procurement department was to ensure a smooth production process. Therefore the procurement department and the manufacturing department interacted most closely. These two functional departments shared the main goals of ensuring production and quality. However there were several differences in priorities. For example the procurement team’s objectives included cost cutting and supplier management which meant that its goal was to retain a moderate inventory level. However the manufacturing department aimed to produce high-quality products in a timely manner which meant that its goal was to keep raw materials in full stock at all times.The company’s silos structure created invisible walls that caused information sharing blocks and Hengda had made no efforts to correct this issue by implementing a proper information system. Specific production plans were not provided to the procurement department. Instead procurement officers executed purchasing orders based on paperwork provided by impatient manufacturing staff who were indifferent to purchasing plans or cycles. Procurement team members were therefore often blamed for production delays.Warehousing DepartmentThe warehousing department operated using a multi-level inventory model. In addition to common warehousing functions this department also collected data from company warehouses operating at different levels of the organization and coordinated logistics among them. The central warehouse held tier-1 inventory whereas the two workshop warehouses managed by the manufacturing department served all tier-2 inventory consisting of materials received from the central warehouse. In addition the sales department occasionally set up temporary warehouses at customer project sites. This model was designed to save logistics costs and improve efficiency.However the invisible walls had created an inadequate information sharing environment between the procurement and warehousing departments. Procurement officers could only obtain information about tier-1 inventory from the central warehouse. This issue made it difficult for the procurement team to operate effectively when placing orders with suppliers because they simply had no information on how much inventory was available at the company’s workshop warehouses or at various temporary project warehouses. By considering only tier-1 inventory and being unaware of the company’s other warehouses the procurement team could inadvertently create an over-supply or overstock situation. On the other hand if the department did not purchase enough supplies it would be blamed for causing a production delay.Finance DepartmentHengda’s finance department was focused on improving the company’s profitability and capital turnover rates. To improve the company’s cash flow situation the finance department worked on delaying payment to suppliers and collecting payables as soon as possible. The department had also been closely monitoring purchasing costs based mainly on prices and payment deferral terms. However the procurement department was required to meet the specifications outlined by the manufacturing department which meant strategically selecting and supporting preferred suppliers.During the initial part of the procurement process the finance team did not directly intervene in procurement decisions. However the payment process for supplies soon became an important consideration for this department. For example questions were raised about reasonable pricing selection criteria for suppliers potential corruption in the selection of suppliers contracts and payments conforming to company policy potential risk to the finance department and whether suppliers were properly registered with the commercial administration. To fulfill urgent orders the procurement staff sometimes had to make quick decisions which were usually questioned by the finance department. Gan decided to meet with the manager of the finance department to ask about its scrutiny of the procurement team. Gan was informed that because the finance department was not directly involved in front-office business it had to act as a gatekeeper for the company’s financial activities which required a thorough understanding of every detail of the company’s purchases. Gan was informed that payment terms for example could have a great impact on the company’s financial health.Suppliers In 2019 Hengda’s total procurement expense increased sharply to ¥269 million from ¥187 million in 2018. This coincided with the company’s expansion into the waste incinerator and acoustic noise reduction business lines. The impact of the expansion on the procurement team was working with a large variety of new materials and numerous new suppliers. Gan decided to meet with several suppliers and ask for their feedback but he received mainly negative comments about Hengda’s procurement department. Not surprisingly suppliers complained mainly about two issues: returns and the lack of a long-term procurement plan.Suppliers claimed that they could not make appropriate production plans to fill Hengda orders without a proper long-term procurement plan. Urgent supply requirements were very costly to suppliers who had to use overtime work to fill the orders. Returned goods were also a major issue especially for goods with short expiry periods. Suppliers stated that returns from Hengda that had a long expiry date could be resold but goods returned with short expiry dates had to be heavily discounted recycled or destroyed. All of these measures caused the supplier to incur costs.Making Transformation PlansAfter completing a thorough investigation Gan realized that the problems manifested in the procurement department were actually deeply rooted in the lack of collaboration among departments. The company’s diversification in recent years had exacerbated this problem and added strain to the company. These problems posed great challenges for Hengda’s future development. Gan was concerned about the company’s long-term future and was determined to make a difference. But he also knew that it took more than a procurement manager to affect such important organizational changes.He contacted Hengda’s chairman Zhu to proudly present his findings but was disappointed by the chairman’s lack of enthusiasm in Gan’s report. After regaining his composure Gan proceeded to carefully explain the situation. He informed Zhu about how the procurement department’s issues were related to the company’s silos structure and was glad to see that his analysis was gradually earning Zhu’s approval. The chairman agreed that the silos structure had been a long-term issue but explained that there were three main reasons why the company chose to retain its current organizational format.The first reason had to do with corporate culture. Hengda had pursued a lean management structure to gain a competitive advantage in different markets. Corporate leaders had allowed great autonomy to sales departments to secure orders and sales teams tended to satisfy every requirement from demanding clients. Therefore other functional departments had to be highly responsive to the sales department who represented the customer. The second reason had to do with performance reviews of department managers which emphasized departmental goals rather than the company’s overall operation. With individual departments pursuing their own bottom line rather than being aligned across departments the company could promote a more competitive culture among departments which benefited the company’s overall bottom line. The third reason was in response to Gan’s recommendation to improve information sharing and save costs by revising the company’s organizational structure moving positions and investing in reengineered and improved information systems. Zhu stated that strengthening inter-departmental collaboration would require changing traditional and cultural practices. This would be very time-consuming and costly and did not necessarily guarantee business growth and increased revenue in a fiercely competitive market environment. The chairman then stated that there was another issue related to acting on Gan’s report: Even if he agreed to support Gan’s initiative who would be the right person to lead the transformation? Also how would this person’s achievement be evaluated?Gan was silently considering the chairman’s response. He agreed with Zhu that the situation was a systematic challenge. From the chairman’s viewpoint there were other important considerations beyond individual employee problems including maintaining a competitive edge growing the company’s stock price and ensuring appropriate timing and priority for investments. But Gan was still convinced that internal collaboration cost-cutting and enhanced work efficiency were indispensable steps for the company’s long-term future. Zhu and Gan did agree on this point. Therefore they decided that this direction of transformation for Hengda needed further contemplation and planning before it could be put into action. Gan returned to his office perplexed by the questions the chairman had raised and wondering what recommendations he would make in his next meeting with Zhu about the company’s future.Exhibit 1: Organizational Chart of Jiangxi Hengda High-Tech

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation Version: 2021-03-11Ami Shroff (Ami) looked around the exhibition venue in Mumbai with satisfaction; 2020 had begun on a good note for Shrujan Trust (Shrujan) the not-for-profit craft organization that Ami managed. The organization had just concluded its 200th exhibition on January 15th the birthday of Ami’s late mother Chanda Shroff who had started Shrujan 50 years earlier. This exhibition had been one of Shrujan’s most successful: they had sold all of their products and at least 15 customers had paid advances for personalized orders.Exhibitions played an important role in Shrujan’s growth but that could change if Ami were to seriously consider a proposal her niece Alia Shroff (Alia) had made just a few days earlier. In an internal meeting Alia a budding fashion designer had proposed ambitious plans to increase Shrujan’s domestic and global presence. Her proposal would require upfront investments of ?10 million with a projected revenue of ?40–50 million over the next two years. Alia wanted to discuss her proposal with Ami and get feedback. Ami had managed to delay the meeting by citing the excuse of preparing for the exhibition. They planned to meet for breakfast on Sunday morning and Ami wanted to be prepared.The global recognition of India’s rich handicraft tradition provided an opportunity for Shrujan to build a bigger market presence for its exclusive and high-quality merchandise. Ami knew this would substantially increase the opportunities for generating revenue for the trust and it would translate into greater earnings for the nearly 3000 craftspeople currently associated with Shrujan. But what would pursuing Alia’s plan mean for the ethos of Shrujan which prided itself on putting the artisan at the centre of everything? Being a small quality-conscious brand had worked well for Shrujan so far; would growth on the scale proposed by Alia strain the threads that bound Shrujan to its artisan community?Handicraft tradition in IndiaThe Indian handicraft tradition was over 5000 years old dating back to the Indus valley civilization. The handicrafts sector was not just a reflection of the cultural identity of the people who made the crafts but was also an important source of income in the rural and semi-urban areas. The most popular crafts included metal ware earthenware pottery sculpting woodwork hand-printed textiles and scarves embroidered and crocheted goods shawls zari products stone carving and imitation jewellery. The handicrafts sector was one of the largest employment generators with over 6.88 million artisans out of which 3.00 million were male and 3.88 million were female. Most artisans were from economically disadvantaged sections with low levels of education and they tended to be self-employed.The production of Indian handicrafts had been increasing steadily with over 60 per cent of the country’s production exported (see Exhibit 1). Yet while the handicrafts sector accounted for a significant share in India’s export (see Exhibit 2) the country’s share in total world handicrafts exports was estimated to be less than 2 per cent. The Indian handicrafts industry was promoted in the global markets by more than 67000 exporters and export houses; the United States Europe the United Arab Emirates Canada and Australia were among the top 10 export destinations (see Exhibit 3).Demand grew both internationally and domestically for handicraft and handloom products and consumer consciousness around organic fair trades practices that created value for marginalized populations increased. However handicraft exports shrank as a share of the country’s total exports due to the fragmented nature of the value chain and inadequate links to markets and consumers. Further the sector’s growth was challenged by a scarcity of raw materials poor production facilities limited access to financing and limited marketing capabilities. Despite the government’s efforts to address these challenges and efforts by many for-profit and not-for-profit social enterprises that had worked in the sector for many decades the sector continued to be plagued by issues relating to scale and to building sustainable growth models.Indian handicrafts were traditionally sold by retailers (direct sales) or through a network of wholesalers and distributors (see Exhibit 4) which hampered the handicrafts’ market reach. However with the growing popularity and reach of e-commerce through websites like Aporv (no longer active) Craftsvilla Naaptol Fabindia and Mydala the handicrafts industry was looking at e-commerce to increase market access and sales in both domestic and international markets. Adoption of e-retailing was also expected to improve margins for the artisans by eliminating intermediaries and providing both business-to-business and business-to-consumer opportunities.Kachchh (Kutch) Province Gujarat IndiaKachchh (Kutch) district was in the northwest part of the state of Gujarat on India’s western coast. The province was a largely barren and harsh desert landscape spanning more than 45000 square kilometres with a population of over 2 million people. Because it was a border district many nomadic and semi-nomadic communities from various countries had over centuries made Kutch their home. Craft especially embroidery was inextricable from the culture of the communities with each community continuing to keep distinctions in style stitches patterns and colours and the rules for using them. Many of the handicrafts especially embroidered items were made by the artisans for themselves and their families for marriage and other social obligations; they were never meant for sale as commercial products. Some of the most skilled artisans renowned for their embroideries included people from the communities of Jat Aahir Rabari Mutwa Meghwals Sodha and Jadeja.The Kutch region was known for its arid and inhospitable climate: it experienced drought nearly every three to four years. On January 26 2001 the region was rocked by a massive earthquake (6.9 on the Richter scale) which killed over 20000 people left hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed or damaged more than a million buildings. The earthquake came at a time when the region was already experiencing a severe three-year drought thus creating serious water shortage and livelihood problems. However with US$1.8 billion in aid and donations from both domestic and international sources and focused government projects the region bounced back and transformed from an agrarian to a manufacturing- and services-focused economy. Non-government organizations (NGOs) were actively involved in the rehabilitation of the region and helped build an international focus on the local arts and crafts as a means of raising funds.The Gujarat State Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation Ltd. (GSHHDC) an undertaking of the Government of Gujarat handled the development and marketing of handicrafts and handlooms from Gujarat through its chain of Garvi Gurjari emporia. GSHHDC also regularly organized exhibitions for selling and creating awareness of handloom and handicrafts products among prospective buyers. Many NGOs such as Shrujan Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan Kala Raksha and Khamir were also active in this space offering support to the artisans in terms of design product development and marketing (see Exhibit 5). Many of the NGOs had set up their own stores or brand labels to sell the handicrafts in domestic and international markets.ShrujanChanda Shroff (Chandaben) was born in 1933 in the village of Mandal and married into the industrialist Shroff family which hailed from the Kutch district. The Shroff family was known in the business community for its philanthropic and charitable activities. In 1969 Chandaben travelled from Mumbai to Kutch which was then suffering from prolonged drought as part of the Ramakrishna Mission’s relief work. In one village the volunteers found that the women of the village (who belonged to the Ahir and Meghwad Gujjar communities) were not comfortable accepting the relief material considering it to be charity and asked for work instead.Chandaben had noticed the beautiful embroideries on the villagers’ clothes and decided to use that to accede to the villagers’ request for income. Ami Shroff told the story:My mother bought 30 plain saris in Mumbai took them back to the village and commissioned the women to work on them. The women were paid ?300 per sari on acceptance of the commission. It took the women about five months to complete the embroidery. On completion my mother organized an exhibition of the saris in Mumbai. Each sari was priced at ?1000 with an average margin of about ?150 per sari. All the saris sold out within a day raising ?30000. More hearteningly there were many requests for more such saris. The positive feedback from the exhibition and the demand for similar products lead to the birth of Shrujan (meaning creativity in Sanskrit). All the money raised from the first exhibition was used to buy raw material for a fresh batch and that is how Shrujan started building connection with the artisan community.Initially conceptualized as a one-time drought-relief project the initiative received was overwhelming response. Ami saidMy mother was surprised by the response of the women. As word spread about how we were helping women to make money from the skills that had been passed down for generations we started getting enquiries from different parts of Kutch asking for help. From just 30 women in 1969 today we have over 3000 members across over 100 villages.Shrujan was registered as a not-for-profit charitable trust in 1983 with ?5000 as initial capital. In 2007 the brand Shrujan was trademarked. The organization employed 65 people: four in Mumbai and 61 in Bhuj the capital of Kutch (see Exhibit 6). The Bhuj office coordinated all the activities of the trust which included production planning (see Exhibit 7) liaising with craftspeople preparing production kits and managing the logistics at the village level (dropping off production kits and picking up the finished products). The Mumbai office handled sales and marketing and liaised with the designers and tailoring units.The key responsibility of the Bhuj office was to ensure that the core group of artisans had regular work while the Mumbai office focused on staying in touch with both retail and corporate customers. Ami shared “Our primary focus is always the artisan. We do not provide work based on the orders received. Instead we focus on selling the work of the artisans. This ensures that we are not driven by commercial pressures.”Shrujan prioritized 15 products while preparing the production based on customer feedback and past sales (see Exhibit 8). These products were sold through exhibitions and Shrujan’s own stores in Mumbai and Ahmedabad at the Bhuj airport and at the organization’s headquarters in Bhuj. In addition Shrujan occasionally partnered with a few exclusive online and offline lifestyle stores for pop-up stores or shop-in-shop stores (see Exhibit 9). Shrujan’s product margins ranged from 15 to 45 per cent across various product categories.The organization’s artisan base included women who in addition to their regular normal household responsibilities contributed to the household income through various activities such as animal husbandry and goat rearing. Ami explainedWe distribute work to the women depending on how many hours per day and the number of days they can work. We get requests for more work during times of drought as agricultural incomes go down or when there is an occasion like a wedding when the family expenses increase. The women work on the products during their spare time which is usually between four and six hours per day. Some of our artisans work with other organizations too but the artisans tell us that it is easier for them to associate with other organizations or get financial aid from banks or NGOs if the artisans mention that they are Shrujan karigar [workers].Shrujan’s craftspeople worked from home. The production team ensured that the fabrics and threads were delivered to the craftspeople at their doorsteps. The women did not have to pay for the materials and they were paid for their work as soon as they completed the embroidery. Shrujan found that on average its craftspeople worked about 18 to 20 days a month and the most skilled artisans earned ?220 per day. Payment to artisans was based on skill and mastery over their craft with the most skilled artisans making at least ?60000 per year. The least skilled artisans earned between ?15000 and 20000 a year and the moderately skilled artisans could earn between ?20000 and 50000 a year.Once the embroidered textiles were received back at the Bhuj office they were fashioned by Shrujan’s in-house design team and its tailoring team (a mix of in-house and outsourced local tailors) into apparel accessories and lifestyle products and then sold through Shrujan’s shops and exhibitions. Shrujan used the generated revenue to buy more raw material and to train artisans so that their income could be protected. Working capital requirements and financial deficits were met by a bank overdraft (see Exhibit 10).Proposal for Growth: Alia’s VisionShrujan’s management team consisted of Ami Saket Bakshi (marketing) Sakshi Mathur (store supervisor) Dinesh Shah (head of production) Sulo Gujjar (artisan coordinator) Dipesh Shroff (Ami’s brother and the organization’s financial adviser) and Hetal Thakker (design consultant). The team met every quarter to review performance.Alia who was Dipesh’s daughter grew up with Shrujan having spent summers in Bhuj with her family and having travelled with the Shrujan team to the villages. She had graduated in 2016 with a degree in fashion design from the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York City interned for a year with a leading design house in New York and then worked for one year with a well-known Indian designer before joining Shrujan as an employee. Since January 2019 Alia had been working closely with the design and production teams based out of Bhuj.On January 10 2020 Alia made a presentation to the management team in their quarterly meeting. She had been working on a proposal for three months and was excited to share her ideas with the management team. Her proposal was to take the Shrujan brand global and to strengthen the brand’s domestic presence.Take the Shrujan Brand GlobalTwo popular designers from the United Kingdom and Australia had approached Alia for partnership opportunities. These designers had their own stores in London and Manchester and in Sydney and Melbourne and they occasionally opened pop-up stores in leading high-end department stores. They wanted to build an India-centric fashion line to target the affluent Indian community in their cities.Both designers had bought Shrujan pieces from exhibitions and they were keen to engage on a professional basis. They proposed building a long-term relationship with Shrujan starting with home furnishings like cushion covers wall hangings and table linens and after that extending to apparel. However these designers operated on tightly defined production plans and were keen to implement these plans in their collaboration with Shrujan.As well a leading home furnishings chain based in the Netherlands had expressed interest in carrying an India-themed furnishings pop-up and it wanted to collaborate with Shrujan for the chain’s spring/summer line for 2021. The chain had 10 stores across the Netherlands and wanted to know if Shrujan could work on a line of embroidered window decorations (curtains and blinds). The opportunity would allow Shrujan to build expertise in working with fabrics like jacquard and organza—expertise Shrujan did not have.Strengthen Domestic PresenceAlia proposed increasing the number of Shrujan’s physical stores having Shrujan-owned and managed stores in 10 Indian cities within two years and having a total of 20 stores by the third year. These stores would carry the complete range of Shrujan products and would be positioned as high-end shopping venues with an exclusive product range. Alia also proposed tying up with two upcoming fashion designers to develop the merchandise for Shrujan’s stores.The organization could also collaborate with leading interior decorators to provide home furnishings for high-end dwellings. The wife of a leading Bollywood actor had used a Shrujan wall panel in her dining room and it had drawn a lot of attention when the house was featured in an international lifestyle magazine. The interior decorator on the project had expressed a desire to have at least 20 distinctive wall pieces from Shrujan over the next two years. Each piece would be priced at a minimum of ?1 million.Alia had also been contacted by a prominent Indian fashion designer who wanted exclusive embroidery pieces for the designer’s label. The implicit understanding was that fashion accessories would be the next step.Both of Alia’s proposals would generate more work for the artisans and add at least ?40 million to Shrujan’s revenues on a conservative basis. However the proposals also required Shrujan to completely change its approach to operations. Investments would have to be made in training artisans recruiting staff managing inventory and expanding tailoring units and warehouses. Alia expected that Shrujan would have to make an initial capital investment of approximately ?10 million over the next 15 months; incremental recurring expenses would be around ?22 million. Shrujan would also need to increase its long- and short-term borrowings to fund its growth plans (see Exhibit 11).At the end of Alia’s presentation. Ami could feel all eyes in the room turn to her to gauge her reaction to the presentation. Ami was gathering her thoughts just as her phone rang with an emergency call from the Bhuj office. She excused herself from the meeting but knew that it was a temporary reprieve. Alia had already scheduled a breakfast meeting with Ami for the coming Sunday to discuss the proposal. Alia want Ami’s thoughts.Ami had always believed that Shrujan was a movement not an enterprise. It had always worked with the aim of helping craftspeople become financially independent by using their traditional crafts. Profits or income had never figured in Shrujan’s planning. However Ami realized that Alia had a valid point in wanting to build a better market presence for Shrujan. Could Shrujan become more commercial without compromising its values? Would Shrujan’s craftspeople support the growth plans? Would the organization still remain a social enterprise if it implemented Alia’s plans? Ami knew she needed some answers before meeting Alia on Sunday.Exhibit 1: Production and export of handicrafts (in ?

Ltd.Qasab was set up in 1997 as a collective socio-cultural enterprise of 1200 rural master craftspeople to revitalize the embroidery craft of Kutch. Qasab was known for its quality of authentic Kutch embroidery appliqué and patchwork products. The rural craftspeople set the prices of the products themselves as being competitive and fair. Qasab distributed a part of its profits as dividends to its artisan members plowing back the rest for business growth capacity building and training of new artisans and community development activities.KhamirKhamir was established in 2005 as a joint initiative between Kachchh Nav Nirman Abhiyan and the Nehru Foundation for Development to strengthen and promote the artisanal tradition of the Kutch district. It offered support to the artisans by offering production commitments for a minimum of six months per year and providing advances raw materials design inputs wages that were a minimum of 25 per cent over market rates and marketing support through exhibitions and its outlet shop.Kala RakshaKala Raksha meaning “art preservation” was started as a trust in 1993 by co-founders Judy Frater and Prakash Bhanani to preserve the art tradition of the Kutch region and make it economically workable. Kala Raksha worked with over 1000 artisans and experts in the fields of art design rural management and museums. The organization set up a design school in 2005 catering to the artisans of Kutch to offer knowledge and skills directly relevant to the artisans’ traditional art to enable innovation according to market requirements. The graduates of this school also worked under the label “Artisan Design” registered by the trust in 2010 so that the artisans were involved in all aspects of the product. from design to manufacture.Source: Compiled by case author based on data from “Origination of Qasab” Qasab accessed April 7 2020 http://qasab.org/qasab/origination-of-qasab; “Values” Qasab accessed April 7 2020 http://qasab.org/qasab/values; Pankaj Bhanushali “Qasab—Imparting Kutchi Embroidery A Global Recognition” Megastores March 8 2019 www.megastores.com/blog/17/qasab-imparting-kutchi-embroidery-a-global-recognition; “Who We Are” Khamir accessed April 10 2020 www.khamir.org/about/khamir/who; “Our Work: Trade Facilitation” Khamir accessed April 10 2020 www.khamir.org/work/activity/trade-facilitation; “Kala Raksha 20 Years Preserving Traditional Art and Empowering Artisans” Cloth Roads April 25 n.y. accessed April 10 2020 www.clothroads.com/kala-raksha-empowering-artisans; and “Kala Raksha Trust” Kala Raksha: Preservation of Traditional Arts accessed April 10 2020 www.kala-raksha.org/trust.htm.Exhibit 6: Organizational Structure & Management TeamNote: Shaded boxes = management team; figures in brackets indicate number of staff.Source: Enterprise documents.Exhibit 7: Production planning (Extract from plan for 2020–21)Annual Production Plan Based on Embroidery Types—Quantities to Be Assigned and Amount PayableSource: Case author’s analysis of enterprise documents.Exhibit 8: Shrujan Product Sales MixSource: Case author’s analysis of enterprise documents.Exhibit 9: Sales by channelNote: Other = corporate and online sales and job work.Source: Enterprise documents.Exhibit 10: Summary financials for the Fiscal year as of March 31 2019 (in ?)Source: Enterprise documents.Exhibit 11: Alia’s Proposal Preliminary cost and revenue estimates(a) Preliminary Cost Estimates (? millions; investments to be made from June 2020)Exhibit 11: Continued(b) Projected Revenue (? millions)Source: Case author’s analysis of enterprise documents.ENDNOTES,"[{""start"":1009,""end"":1020,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1021,""end"":1024,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1191,""end"":1194,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1293,""end"":1296,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1612,""end"":1615,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2024,""end"":2027,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2046,""end"":2049,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2194,""end"":2197,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2398,""end"":2401,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9242,""end"":9245,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10207,""end"":10210,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11372,""end"":11375,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12345,""end"":12348,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14408,""end"":14411,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18690,""end"":18693,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18781,""end"":18784,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19012,""end"":19015,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19072,""end"":19076,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19088,""end"":19091,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19350,""end"":19353,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19662,""end"":19665,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2246,""end"":2251,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2951,""end"":2956,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3956,""end"":3961,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5923,""end"":5928,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15738,""end"":15743,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16361,""end"":16366,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19831,""end"":19836,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":20647,""end"":20652,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":20791,""end"":20796,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14709,""end"":14712,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15191,""end"":15194,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":19671,""end"":19674,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18880,""end"":18883,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1654,""end"":1657,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1853,""end"":1856,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2006,""end"":2009,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":14638,""end"":14641,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15268,""end"":15271,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15304,""end"":15307,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17449,""end"":17452,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18734,""end"":18737,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18747,""end"":18750,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18892,""end"":18899,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18799,""end"":18802,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18820,""end"":18823,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation Version: 2021-03-11It was Saturday August 1 2020 and Ricardo Estrada the corporate purchasing and sustainability manager at the Plastilene Group felt various ideas storming disorderly in his mind. He had left his house on the outskirts of Bogotá Colombia in the city of Cajicá shortly after 7 a.m. heading to northeast Bogotá. He had arranged a meeting with Stefano Pacini the Plastilene Group’s chief executive officer (CEO); Fernando Venegas a member of the Plastilene Group’s shareholders’ board; and Gabriel Jaramillo vice-president of operations. The goal of the meeting was to define how to address the sustainability challenge that Pacini had entrusted to Estrada. During his journey Estrada thought about how to face the situation in Colombia and the region. The media had demonized plastic due to the impact of its waste on marine ecosystems while members of Colombia’s Congress had proposed tightening and increasing prohibitions against plastic items. Meanwhile the financial sector questioned companies’ survival in the sector and there was no clarity about appropriate technologies for plastic waste management. The Plastilene Group’s large multinational petrochemical suppliers were stunned by the size of the threat against the industry. How could Estrada enhance sustainable innovation strategy within the Plastilene Group’s structure? How could Pacini enhance corporate entrepreneurship and innovation at the Plastilene Group?A Volatile Uncertain Complex and Ambiguous context At the beginning of 2016 it was estimated that the equivalent of the contents of a plastic garbage truck were dumped into the world’s rivers and ecosystems every minute eventually ending up in the oceans. In the same year during the World Economic Forum the Ellen MacArthur Foundation declared that by 2050 the oceans would have more plastic than fish. Environmental organizations such as Greenpeace had long been promoting a battle against plastic items. In 2017 a significant proliferation of regulations occurred worldwide with the main objective to reduce the consumption of plastic bags plates glasses cutlery straws and other single-use plastic items. Large mass-consumption multinationals such as Unilever PepsiCo Coca-Cola Company and others ratified their commitments to reduce plastic consumption and use more environmentally friendly packaging: wrappings and containers that were recyclable compostable reusable or manufactured from recycled materials. Such events threatened the stability of global plastic item companies and their supply chains; the countries in which the Plastilene Group operated were not exempt from this reality.Estrada began working at the Plastilene Group at the beginning of 2010. Before his arrival he had managed consulting projects with an international company within the Colombian Ministry of National Education. Estrada had also worked as a business consultant an independent entrepreneur and an executive in private companies. He had served in various management positions as a collaborator of recognized trade services food footwear textiles and clothing companies. By mid-2017 Estrada had been part of the Plastilene Group for seven and a half years initially as a project consultant in the planning and production areas then as an employee. He assumed the role of logistics manager in which he had the opportunity to participate in the implementation of SAP enterprise resource planning software and lead the implementation of logistics co-operation agreements with strategic customers. Estrada had recently led the implementation of the Corporate Management of Purchasing and Materials Planning as a transversal area for all the Plastilene Group companies. The new corporate model made important impacts on cost reduction and the diversification of supply risks. It strengthened strategic relationships with global and local suppliers and directly increased the company’s profits by reducing the percentage cost of raw materials and more effectively negotiating trade agreements with strategic suppliers. In July 2017 Estrada spoke with the Plastilene Group’s previous CEO and raised the possibility of working on sustainability in an orderly manner to respond to the general threat facing the plastics industry. However with the appointment of Pacini as CEO the Plastilene Group officially decided to face the growing threat against plastic materials through a sustainability strategy. Estrada was delegated to lead this task.The Plastilene Group: 62 Years of Innovation and LeadershipThe Plastilene Group was part of the Pacini family’s business group which operated businesses in many sectors including plastic cardboard boxes packaging flower crops granites and marbles. As an organization the Plastilene Group had 62 years of history. It operated production plants in Colombia Ecuador and Guatemala and a US plant was in the preoperational stage. In 2017 its main products included flexible polyethylene packaging polypropylene-laminated films and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets for food beverage and other industrial uses; and flexible films for floriculture. The Plastilene Group also produced post-industrial recycled composites and materials. The organization had served its markets for a long time and they represented its primary income and sources of profit. The following companies comprised the Plastilene Group: Plastilene Laminates Khroma Novalene Altalene Reciclene and Interplast in Colombia; Agroplásticos in Ecuador; Technofilms in Guatemala; and Plastilene NA in the United States (see Exhibit 1).The Plastilene Group had been vertically integrated since 2015 when it decided to organize itself in a matrix manner. It had corporate management positions to oversee the functional management in operations logistics and systems finance human resources purchasing and sustainability. Additional company managers were primarily in charge of regional strategy product commercialization and fulfilling legal requirements in each company and region.Forty-two years earlier the entrepreneurial innovative and continuous improvement awareness of its founder had led the Plastilene Group to manage plastic waste that resulted from its plant operations. The organization’s interest had always been to optimize resources be efficient in processes and ensure that industrial waste could have a new life. This interest had led to Reciclene a company that by 2018 had transformed 3000 tons of post-industrial plastic waste per year and converted it into new raw materials resins straps and tubes. Reciclene marked a line of responsibility in the Plastilene Group. It paved the way so that 100 per cent of plastic waste from factories could be recovered. In the late 1990s the Plastilene Group ventured into the manufacturing of PET sheets a business that allowed it to establish a supply chain of 3000 tons per year from beverage bottles’ recycled material for the manufacture of agricultural industrial and food packaging.A New Leader a Single CultureIn November 2017 Pacini became CEO of the Plastilene Group. He was the son of the family business group’s founder and had inherited his father’s passions for sailing and operating industrial businesses. While the two interests may have seemed unrelated Pacini’s passion for navigation had led to his awareness of how waste negatively affected the oceans. On several occasions while sailing the Atlantic he had found fishing nets bottles bags and other plastic items. Pacini had been involved with the Plastilene Group for many years having served as a leader in relevant events and in negotiations with both clients and suppliers in significant multinational organizations. He had led the Plastilene Group’s foray into the Central American market with the opening of Technofilms in 2000. In 2001 Pacini led a vital agreement with the multinational company DuPont de Nemours Inc. for the manufacture of flexible milk packaging for the Latin American region. Pacini led the Plastilene Group’s technological transformation for which among other actions he developed agreements with the German firm W&H Group one of the world’s most recognized manufacturers of specialized machinery for the plastic film industry. Pacini had promoted the implementation of SAP enterprise resource planning software which laid the foundations for a future digital transformation within the Plastilene Group. Pacini was a member of the Plastilene Group’s board of directors and was involved in other businesses where the Pacini family was present. Pacini’s vision closely aligned with his father’s which was always directed toward values innovation entrepreneurship and recognition of the human factor as pillars of the organization’s growth. He held the conviction that the only way to do things was the right way. He conveyed this leadership style once he assumed the position of CEO. At the end of 2017 shortly after taking over as CEO Pacini defined some strategic objectives and new projects for the Plastilene Group’s management team including implementing a sustainable strategy improving staff training and well-being and increasing local and international sales. Another goal was to open two new production operations by 2023 which would work toward the objective of establishing a significant presence in North America. Additionally the Plastilene Group’s management team worked toward strengthening innovative products sale with high added value becoming a carbon-neutral group to reduce the environmental impact of the Plastilene Group’s operations and establishing an operational efficiency model based on technological development and process control.At the meeting on Saturday August 1 Pacini Venegas Jaramillo and Estrada discussed the complex context they were facing. They reviewed and analyzed the Stanford University webinar “How to Build a Sustainable Organization” delivered by Professor Julia Novy-Hildesley and discussed ways to maintain the values of entrepreneurship and innovation within the company while working toward a sustainable strategy. The day’s discussions led to the defining of the Plastilene Group’s Sustainable Innovation Strategy.Fundamentals of the Plastilene Group's Sustainable Innovation StrategyThe Plastilene Group’s sustainable innovation strategy began with the acknowledgment that plastic was threatened by a lack of education by culture and by excessive use in some applications and that its customers were sensitive to the sustainable management of their products’ packaging. The Plastilene Group wanted to be an innovative leader with social and environmental awareness and to work within the increasing regulatory frameworks for the sustainable management of plastic use. At the end of the meeting Pacini established the CEO’s sustainability guideline: We are an organization committed to the environment; we have innovative processes and products that contribute to improving the well-being of our society and our customers. We contribute to the conservation of the future quality of life and the well-being of our planet.Structural Organization Toward Sustainable InnovationThe purpose behind the sustainable innovation strategy was to address the organization’s daily operational activities starting with Pacini and followed by Estrada the corporate managers the company managers and then their work teams. The sustainability strategy needed to permeate all areas of the organization while using the same human resources required to maintain performance on a day-to-day basis. Situations inevitably arose in which the work team’s time and concentration were not enough to promote sustainability with the necessary force. Because of the need to share resources it was not easy to assign priorities and identify who was responsible for making decisions. As a result differences and territorialities emerged that were typical of a shared structure and were resolved through persistence and teamwork aligned to the superior common goal which Pacini constantly reiterated. Pacini formed an executive strategy implementation committee that met every two months. The committee led by Estrada included participants from the Plastilene Group’s corporate managers and some company managers as well as leaders of management lines. The committee became the stage where corporate progress was regularly reviewed on environmental social and economic issues related to the sustainable innovation strategy.The management lines of the sustainability strategy were established and interdisciplinary workgroups were created. Each management group had a directive leader and a management leader who reported to the managerial sustainability committee (see Exhibit 2). Short- and medium-term objectives were established and were used to frame the sustainability management lines of the various Plastilene Group companies.THe Plastilene Group’s Sustainability Strategy—Management LinesThe Plastilene Group’s sustainability strategy included several guidelines for management lines which were expected to raise public awareness and communication for the positioning of both the Plastilene Group and the plastics industry (see Exhibit 3). The strategy stipulated that projects with customers and suppliers must align with the Plastilene Group’s sustainability programs and goals. It required social responsibility initiatives with employees and vulnerable communities and called for active participation in associations for the development of joint initiatives and constant monitoring of regulations that might affect the plastics industry. Management lines were expected to both strengthen the Plastilene Group’s sustainable product portfolio through innovation and maintain financial management when investing in sustainability projects. The strategy also required internal environmental management to measure and control greenhouse gases in production plants and end-of-cycle projects in which a circular economy would be implemented in a practical way with the leadership and commitment of the Plastilene Group.Estrada hired a consulting company that specialized in environmental issues to accompany the implementation of the strategy on particular issues such as carbon footprint measurement life cycle analysis and the methodological framework for the sustainability report. He also carried out a careful selection process to hire Luisa Ribero a social communicator with a master’s degree in Sustainability and Social Responsibility who assumed the position of corporate head of Sustainability. Upon her arrival Ribero monitored interdisciplinary teams’ activities and was in charge of articulating monitoring and communicating the Plastilene Group’s sustainable actions.In the process of adapting the sustainable innovation strategy to the particular problem of the plastic industry the strategy’s references expanded to include the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals circular economy theory and concepts of the new plastic economy exhibited by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.The Plastilene Group referred to the Global Reporting Standards methodology to report the strategy’s progress by consolidating information in a way that allowed for establishing a path of progress and creating new commitments based on indicators. The methodology proposed by this institution allowed the Plastilene Group to define and manage material issues for its stakeholders as well as to identify where the Plastilene Group’s principal investments in sustainability should be made.Material Topics for the Plastilene Group’s StakeholdersThe material topics for the Plastilene Group’s stakeholders included greenhouse gas management waste reduction from the start of operation and the management of plastic waste through education on proper separation at the source in alliance with different actors in the chain (see Exhibit 4). Other topics included thinking from the beginning of the circular economy about sustainable management of packaging involving analysis from design production disposal and recycling. Finally the Plastilene Group focused on strengthening scientific and technological capacity to move toward more sustainable consumption and production modalities with efficiency in processes materials and energy use.Building Strategic AlliancesWhile Jorge Moreno directive leader of Regulators and Associations Management line coordinated the work of objectively contextualizing political leaders the need to join forces led Estrada to strengthen the organization’s strategic alliances. The Plastilene Group joined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) in the United States and continued the path of learning and co-operation for developing sustainable products. Estrada joined the SPC’s Next Markets committee which focused on a permanent search for new applications that would increase the use of recycled materials. With the support of Venegas Estrada led the Group’s participation in organizations such as the National Association of Companies of Colombia (Asociación Nacional de Empresarios de Colombia or ANDI) the ANDI pilot for compliance with the Law of Extended Producer Responsibility Vision 30/30 Colombian Association Plastics (ACOPLÁSTICOS) the organization Compromiso Empresarial por el Reciclaje (Business Commitment to Recycling or CEMPRE) in Colombia and the Guatemalan Plastic Association (Cogualplast). Estrada and his team were involved in working sessions with the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and other public and private entities to back the development of public policy around plastics and packaging supported by scientific data such as life cycle analysis. The development of strategic alliances to achieve goals led Estrada and his working group in purchasing and sustainability to establish collaborative partnerships with suppliers. The partners searched for sustainable raw materials special materials to facilitate recycling recycled raw materials for contact with food and biodegradable resins while developing supplier evaluation models that included sustainability criteria. To strengthen the recycling chain and develop the line of social responsibility the Plastilene Group formed close relationships with different associations of recyclers. The Plastilene Group provided financial support and accompanied the recyclers in their operational and commercial development through training and purchase guarantees of their products at fair prices.The customer management line focused on communicating sustainability strategy to this stakeholder. The Plastilene Group became a permanent customer advisor on sustainability issues fulfilling its extended producer responsibility and the joint development of sustainable packaging.Collaborative projects were generated with important beverage and cleaning products companies around strengthening the collection chain the transformation of recycled materials and the circular economy as a way to comply with REP (Responsibilidad Extendida del Productor or extended producer liability) legislation. New business models were developed in which the alliance with third parties to make up for a lack of proprietary technology became the first step in generating solutions to impact the circular economy.The Challenge of Taking on the Circular Economy In 2018 the necessary studies were executed to carry out the compensation of greenhouse gases in the primary plants of the Plastilene Group and a process for the compensation of carbon footprint was developed for the Plastilene and Novalene companies. These studies resulted in the foundations looking forward to being carbon-neutral in 2020.Sustainability became a fundamental part of developing the Plastilene Group’s product portfolio. Eco-design became a protagonist for developing new products with reduced plastic consumption and new recyclable materials. The Plastilene Group incorporated products with a high content of raw materials that had been recycled by mechanical and chemical processes and it was working on developing compostable products and bio-based products among others.In April 2019 the Plastilene Group was a finalist in the SPC Sustainable Packaging Awards in the Sustainable Products and Processes category. The Plastilene Group presented an innovative lightweight technology that reduced up to 20 per cent of plastic consumption by decreasing film density.The Plastilene Group set out to find the best way to increase its direct offering to the circular economy by avoiding the use of plastic in packaging so that plastic packaging would stop ending up in rivers seas and terrestrial ecosystems. Pacini Jaramillo Estrada and the technical team of the Cycle Closure Management Line led by Luis Ortegón and Fabián Forero travelled to international fairs and visited research and development plants and laboratories in Europe China and the United States where new recycling technologies were being consolidated. In October 2019 while they were at the K-Show the plastic industry’s most important technological event they decided to invest in a mechanical recycling plant for plastic waste and agreed to build a production that would be operational in Colombia by the end of 2020. This technology would allow the recovery of approximately 10000 tons of post-consumer plastic waste per year thus allowing the Plastilene Group to take the next step toward a circular economy.In November 2019 in a simple event in the city of Bogotá and before a large audience Pacini submitted the Plastilene Group’s first sustainability report to the stakeholders. He communicated the Plastilene Group’s three sustainable commitments: facilitating its Colombian customers compliance with the regulations of REP: 1407/2018 offering a competitive portfolio of sustainable products under the principles of circular economy and eco-design and becoming carbon neutral by 2020.The financial sector was pleasantly surprised by how the Plastilene Group was mitigating the company’s risks. Other stakeholders such as customers suppliers and collaborators expressed their satisfaction with the way the Plastilene Group was implementing its sustainable innovation strategy.The preparation and delivery of the report consolidated the foundations of the sustainability communication strategy. With participation from Estrada Ribero and a communications specialist company the Plastilene Group developed a communication strategy in social networks to tell its stakeholders about its vision and actions regarding sustainability and the role that each of society’s actors must play to contribute to the circular economy and correct disposal of waste.All these actions allowed the Plastilene Group to fulfill its internal goal of sustainability which was to generate competitive advantages and promote growth in the Plastilene Group’s sales through the sustainable products and actions of its companies. At the end of 2019 sustainability had become a benchmark for actions carried out by the Plastilene Group with its stakeholders. The sustainability strategy’s achievements played an essential role in fulfilling the strategic objectives Pacini had set when he assumed the position as the Plastilene Group’s CEO. Thus within the line of environmental management the leading companies of the Plastilene Group achieved carbon footprint compensation during 2019 and were on their way to obtaining carbon neutrality in 2020. At the beginning of 2020 a new plant was installed when the American market opening took place. The new plant played an important role in supporting sustainability and the sale of sustainable products. The Plastilene Group’s sustainability strategy contributed to anticipating the start-up of two new production operations before 2023. The first would take place in the United States for product manufacturing with an emphasis on sustainability. The second would be built in Tocancipá Colombia with the capacity to process 10000 tons of post-consumer plastics recycling per year thereby contributing to the circular economy. Sustainable product sales multiplied and contributed to the consolidation of customers’ preferences while obtaining new sponsorships from suppliers and other financial partners to strengthen the circular economy and sustainability strategy.The Plastilene Group considered 2019 to have been its best historical year in terms of tons of product sold economic income EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) and other financial indicators. As of December 2019 the sustainable innovation strategy’s exact financial results could not be quantified. Nonetheless it was clear that the strategy offered support for the Plastilene Group’s present and future and that—together with the motivation and leadership transmitted by Pacini the operational excellence of company managers and their work teams and the contributions of technological innovation—this strategy contributed significantly to obtaining the desired results.In August 2020 Estrada continued to lead and advance the development of the Plastilene Group’s sustainable innovation strategy with the mission of incorporating sustainability into day-to-day operations. Despite the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic fundamental advances were expected for the year’s end including the development of a carbon-credit emission system as a result of the processing of recycled materials and the replacement of virgin raw materials. Additionally the company’s management anticipated that the consolidation of products offered with recycled material content and the consolidation of a communications strategy to disseminate topics of sustainability would solidify the Plastilene Group’s positioning as a sustainable company.The Challenge of Integrating and Coordinating Innovation at the CompanyThroughout its history the Plastilene Group’s innovation policy had focused on product development. The innovation structure that managed the operation’s vice-presidency was made up of different cells within each company. Since Pacini’s arrival the innovation concept had taken on a new dimension and transcended the product and manufacturing processes. It contemplated sustainability innovation in technology administrative procedures and the generation of new business models. Innovation at the Plastilene Group was headed by Pacini who integrated different lines of innovation inside and outside the company. Pacini continued to reflect on the Plastilene Group’s accomplishments and identify new ways to move forward in a conscious and orderly manner. However Pacini was faced with several key questions to consider. How could the company keep innovation active and permanently in operation within the Plastilene Group? Specifically how could Estrada enhance the sustainable innovation strategy within the Plastilene Group’s structure while Pacini worked to enhance corporate entrepreneurship and innovation?Exhibit 1: THE Plastilene Group Structure in 2017Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 2: composition of the Plastilene Group’s Managerial Sustainability CommitteeNote: COB = chair of the board.Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 3: the Plastilene Group's Sustainable Innovation Strategy Management LinesNote: CSR = corporate social responsibility.Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 4: the Plastilene Group’s Materiality Matrix Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.,"[{""start"":1095,""end"":1110,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1733,""end"":1740,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1705,""end"":1712,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2305,""end"":2312,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3682,""end"":3689,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3891,""end"":3898,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4159,""end"":4166,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4570,""end"":4577,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5102,""end"":5109,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5471,""end"":5478,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10758,""end"":10765,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12314,""end"":12321,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13163,""end"":13170,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15077,""end"":15084,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17495,""end"":17502,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17737,""end"":17744,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17921,""end"":17928,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18397,""end"":18404,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18740,""end"":18747,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21661,""end"":21668,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23330,""end"":23337,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26015,""end"":26022,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27774,""end"":27781,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1288,""end"":1296,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1784,""end"":1792,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1910,""end"":1918,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5857,""end"":5865,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6494,""end"":6502,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18073,""end"":18081,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18334,""end"":18342,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18025,""end"":18033,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":22196,""end"":22204,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":24916,""end"":24924,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1239,""end"":1241,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1369,""end"":1371,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3773,""end"":3775,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4007,""end"":4009,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4374,""end"":4376,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4324,""end"":4326,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8111,""end"":8113,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8454,""end"":8456,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8725,""end"":8727,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9101,""end"":9103,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9771,""end"":9773,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9844,""end"":9846,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9883,""end"":9885,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15343,""end"":15345,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22591,""end"":22593,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":24168,""end"":24170,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1229,""end"":1232,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1251,""end"":1254,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1721,""end"":1724,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3761,""end"":3764,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8183,""end"":8186,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8347,""end"":8350,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9613,""end"":9616,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18409,""end"":18412,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18752,""end"":18755,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

It was 4:00 p.m. on a Tuesday which meant that it was almost time to meet with his executive leadership team. The atmosphere at the head office was always light and easy-going and playing with his dog in the office always seemed to help MacLean mull over strategic business issues. His latest struggle was fraught with opportunity and risk—he was considering stretching ECL beyond its regional identity.In 2013 MacLean founded ECL a Nova Scotia-based apparel company that sold a range of products from T-shirts and hoodies to dog collars and baby onesies. The company had experienced exponential growth as a small business. Despite having operated for less than four years ECL had already sold more than 500000 products. Its product line was now available in 91 retailers across Canada and had been worn by many high-profile celebrities including singer Ed Sheeran Nova Scotian hockey star Sidney Crosby and members of the rap band Wu-Tang Clan. At 25 years old MacLean was now the chief executive officer of one of Canada’s fastest-growing business ventures. He had received many accolades for his leadership including being featured as one of the “Top 30 under 30” in Marketing Magazine. For ECL to continue its substantial growth it needed a market with more space. One option was to invest heavily in extending its brand portfolio. MacLean had recently won a lengthy copyright battle over the rights to West Coast Lifestyle (WCL) a nascent sibling brand to ECL which had limited current appeal and relatively small sales volumes in British Columbia and Alberta. He had the chance to develop this brand for bicoastal collaboration or friendly competition but doing so presented the risk of brand cannibalization and identity confusion. MacLean also had the vision of making ECL a truly global brand by expanding into the United States before launching in Japan and Australia. While the U.S. Eastern Seaboard offered a massive market for lifestyle apparel and offered synergies with ECL’s current positioning the logistics of brand-building distribution taxes and tariffs and revising ECL’s organizational structure were roadblocks for getting started. Plus was it realistic to think that ECL could become an imported regional brand that locals were proud of or was ECL already too mainstream and corporate to resonate with non-Canadians? MacLean started the meeting: Lately we’ve been trying to do everything—launch new product lines develop West Coast Lifestyle as a separate brand and penetrate the U.S. market. I’m not convinced that our divided attention is working because we are not seeing enough progress fast enough. Perhaps we should choose one option for growth and focus on it.After two hours of protracted debate MacLean still felt he was in the same position. He wanted to do everything but he knew that choosing one strategy for the time being was likely the right thing to do. The real question was which one strategy to pursue and more importantly how to implement it and roll it out. COMPANY BACKGROUNDIn January 2013 MacLean was a 21-year-old business student at Acadia University in Wolfville Nova Scotia a small student town with a population of less than 5000. Along with eight other students he was enrolled in a class called Venture Creation where the goal of the course was to create a business plan for an invention. MacLean who was rather pragmatic if not rebellious thought “Why would I create a business on paper when I can start a real business?” With an $800 loan from his father and the idea that locals wanted to wear their maritime pride he created East Coast Lifestyle. He bought 30 hoodies and screened them with the phrase “East Coast Lifestyle.” He then became active on social media platforms including Facebook Instagram and Twitter to create awareness about his start-up. He sold the hoodies on his front lawn—and sold out on the first day. He reinvested the profits to purchase 60 hoodies the following day and began allowing consumers to pre-order to facilitate inventory management. By the end of the month he had generated $3000 in revenue. At the end of the semester his professor was not overwhelmingly impressed with MacLean’s success—it was a business plan class not a business class. MacLean decided to continue with ECL after the class had ended.

During the summer of 2013 MacLean worked part-time at Atlantic Lottery and part-time on ECL selling about 25 hoodies a week. He hired his first employee Taylor Northey as ECL’s creative director. ECL began diversifying its products by also offering T-shirts and tank tops. By late 2013 MacLean was approaching retail chains to carry his product line. Pseudio a regional apparel retailer with 30 stores was the first store to sell the ECL brand. One store manager took 10 hoodies initially and told MacLean that if he could sell those 10 hoodies Pseudio would place them in stores across Canada. Pseudio sold out of the ECL hoodies in 30 minutes. That day MacLean learned about his consumers’ price elasticity when he realized that people were willing to pay an extra $10 in the store for the same product he was selling on his lawn. In May 2015 he graduated from Acadia University and made ECL his full-time job. THE ECL BRANDMacLean consistently talked about the distinctive character of ECL as being simple and universal—it was about being proud of where you are from. To understand East Coast pride it was important to understand some of the history of the region. Historically the major industries of the region were based on fishing agriculture forestry and coal mining. For myriad reasons including fiscal policy and investment decisions being driven by the needs of urban centres in Central Canada the region entered a period of economic malaise in the 20th century. To this date the Maritime provinces remained one of the poorest regions in Canada with lower average wages and lower property values relative to the rest of Canada. As a result Maritimers tended to be rather humble but still felt a tremendous amount of regional pride. Maclean understood these challenges as opportunities: “I’m proud of being from the East Coast where oftentimes we are the underdogs of Canada. People are often required to leave their home to find work.” With ECL people could share this identity wherever they went showing others where they came from and connecting with other people from “home.” competitionThe ECL brand transcended traditional apparel categories being positioned as a true lifestyle brand that encapsulated surf skate and snow vibes. While lifestyle branding was unique for the region it also positioned the brand against a broad array of competitors. The competitive landscape for lifestyle apparel was diverse with varying niches marketing budgets and access to capital. Regardless the lifestyle apparel business was a lucrative one; margins on apparel goods were typically upward of 70 per cent. In Atlantic Canada ECL was the market leader in regional lifestyle apparel. Other clothing companies that sold Atlantic Canada-inspired designs such as Lost Cod New Scotland My Home and Local Legends generally operated out of one location or solely online. While these brands satisfied the needs of tourists and advocates of buying local they appeared to lack the resources distribution or brand awareness to consider scaling. In addition the positioning of these brands tended to be predominantly geography-based and not inherently tied to a specific fashion subculture. ECL designs and promotions aligned closely with premium consumers of surf skate and snow fashions. This market space was incredibly competitive and saturated occupied by many large U.S.-based apparel organizations that had substantial financial backing. For example Zumiez one of the largest retailers in surf skate and snow clothing and accessories carried more than 400 different brands from Burton and Vans to Nike and Adidas. More generally consumers could choose from countless other fashion brands outside of this space ranging from value brands (e.g. T. J. Maxx) to mid-market brands (e.g. The Gap) to luxury brands (e.g. Tom Ford). According to the 2017 report from McKinsey on “The State of Fashion” the global apparel industry was characterized by uncertainty change and a series of challenges that resulted from volatility in global sales based on geopolitics the proliferation of city-based strategies instead of country-based strategies a preference for discounts on fashion the emergence of new apparel categories based on casualization and active lifestyles (e.g. athleisure clothing) digital shopping and fashion e-commerce. ECL PRODUCTSECL’s product portfolio had diversified to include a broad range of apparel offerings. In February 2017 the most popular products were the hoodies ($69) T-shirts ($34) tank tops ($30) hats ($30) and toques ($30). ECL also sold a variety of eclectic accessories including baby onesies flags anchor-logoed bowties stickers duffle bags and throw pillows. The company even collaborated with a local carpenter to make an ECL gnome door. MacLean wanted to continue launching three to five new products per year. In 2017 the winter plan was to release branded socks men’s boxers women’s tall sweaters and a new style of blankets while the summer offerings would include beach towels and water bottles. Novel products in conjunction with the virtually non-existent discounts offered on products helped rejuvenate and preserve the fresh and premium positioning of the brand.One key differentiator of ECL products was that many of the products were limited editions. With the exception of the anchor-logoed apparel (see Exhibit 1) all other lines were of a limited run. Once a limited-edition product was sold out Maclean’s policy was to never reorder or recreate the line. For example ECL had recently partnered with rapper Ghostface Killah from the rap band Wu-Tang Clan to create a limited-edition Wu-Tang hockey jersey. Only 100 jerseys were produced each with a number from 1 to 100. As a result of its predominantly limited-edition products ECL had experience in launching hundreds of logoed items. PROMOTIONSECL continued to promote its products using guerrilla marketing tactics and a very lean budget. MacLean typically relied on social media with happenstance celebrity endorsements an ambassador program and cross-promotional initiatives to communicate with prospective customers. Instrumental for ECL in communicating with its customers about new product offerings was ECL’s Instagram account which now had almost 600000 followers (see Exhibit 2). Although the products offered varied drastically from year to year MacLean relished the control of communicating the culture of the brand and was personally responsible for ECL’s social media messaging and customer feedback. ECL typically decided which products to brand based on feedback from customers on social media. Celebrity support had been perhaps the biggest driver of exposure for ECL. Although MacLean had never paid for an endorsement he used the social media platform to get gear into the hands of a broad swath of celebrities including Sidney Crosby (and other National Hockey League players) the rapper Classified and pop singer Ed Sheeran. Each celebrity “placement” was then actively promoted on ECL’s social media and website. For example MacLean reached out to a social connection that worked with Ed Sheeran who then provided the singer with ECL clothing to wear during his concert. After Ed Sheeran wore a branded T-shirt on stage the item with the help of a social media push sold out online.ECL concurrently ran a brand ambassador program which offered free promotional items and commission on products sold in exchange for various local promotional activities for the brand. This influencer program was initiated from a simple Instagram post looking for student brand ambassadors asking where each prospective brand ambassador was from; ECL received more than 10000 responses. Over several days MacLean and his team narrowed the list to 50 students; each had between 5000 and 150000 Instagram followers and regularly posted about ECL. The brand ambassadors also received a discount code to share with their followers which enabled ECL to track each brand ambassador’s effectiveness. For each sale that brand ambassadors closed they received between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in discounts. ECL had also run a series of cross-promotional campaigns. In 2014 MacLean received a call from Alexander Keith’s Brewery (Keith’s) a 200-year-old brewing institution located in Halifax Nova Scotia regarding a campaign to target a more youthful demographic with a T-shirt giveaway in specially marked Keith’s bottle packs. Keith’s paid for all of the T-shirts upfront and gave ECL a royalty on each case of beer sold. MacLean went on to secure a cross-promotional deal with Captain Morgan Rum on a probationary three-year term. ECL also gave back to the local community that had supported the company’s growth by launching special co-branded collections with Wounded Warriors and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation sponsoring local sports teams with apparel and offering gear to groups aligned with surf skate and snow. ECL recognized that to get people to buy into a regional brand the brand should do something for the region. DISTRIBUTIONECL sold its products through three primary venues: four ECL retail locations an e-commerce-enabled website and various other retailers. ECL operated a flagship retail store on the Halifax waterfront which was near the Seaport Farmers’ Market the Halifax boardwalk and the disembarkation point of cruise-ship passengers. The flagship store had a staff of four employees. ECL also sold its products at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport in a shop run by six staff members to reach travellers seeking an East Coast souvenir. ECL had recently set up a kiosk that employed four people at Dartmouth’s Mic Mac Mall Atlantic Canada’s largest shopping mall. ECL even used a “pop-up” shop—a truck and trailer containing a broad array of merchandise—that travelled around the Maritimes with a team of four employees and sold its products at various festivals from May to November. ECL’s e-commerce platform accounted for 30 per cent of annual sales. Online customers were primarily Canadians with sales from every province. What MacLean always found interesting was that the majority of online sales were not from the Atlantic region but rather from Alberta and Ontario—a not-so-subtle nod to the East Coasters who worked far from home. ECL used various manufacturers to satisfy customer demand and outsourced the majority of its products to fulfil bulk retailer orders. However some products maintained their Canadian roots. For example the classic hoodies were made in Toronto while many of the T-shirts were screen-printed in Halifax. Although ECL had been expanding its own retail operations the ECL stores still comprised a small portion of the overall retail sales. ECL relied heavily on its retail partnerships to maintain the majority of its sales volume without having to deal with traditional retail management issues and costs. MacLean ensured that all products sold—whether online or in partner-retailer locations—were priced identically to mitigate potential channel conflict.When ECL was first launched it stocked its product for any Canadian retailer that was interested in carrying it. However with many small retailers concurrently selling knock-off lifestyle products (e.g. “Cape Breton Lifestyle”) ECL made the strategic decision to withdraw all products from the hodgepodge of retailers and to sell through only two retailers: Pseudio (in Atlantic Canada) and Below the Belt (in Central and Western Canada) which meant that ECL had its products in 91 stores. While the Canadian retail operation followed a specific structure the three small U.S. retailers—two in Rhode Island and one in Florida—received product only because they explicitly asked for it. All three had discovered ECL through Instagram and wanted to try out their inventory. However by October 2016 when each store received 50 more units to sell they had moved only one or two units per week and all U.S. stores still had inventory from their original shipment.THE GROWTH OPTIONSWest Coast LifestlyeFrom day one MacLean wanted to make people proud of where they were from on a worldwide scale. This insight led to the development of a sibling brand in 2014 for Canadians in British Columbia and Alberta: West Coast Lifestyle. At the time of launching the start-up MacLean could not afford to trademark both ECL and WCL so other businesses blossomed in the region with a similar name and aesthetic to ECL. MacLean had to fight trademark issues for a year and was ultimately successful with his lawsuit making him the rightful owner of WCL. In 2017 WCL was relaunched with new logos through both online and in-store locations of Below the Belt. While WCL products were now carried in 35 stores in Western and Central Canada the resources available to invest in ECL were not available for WCL. MacLean explained that to this point he worked on WCL only 10 per cent of the time. One of the primary challenges with WCL was that the same formula used by ECL had not “unlocked” the region’s potential. Products moved at a glacial pace relative to their Atlantic counterparts. In addition West Coasters were potentially less inclined to identify with the coast as a region. Albertans for example did not typically see themselves as being on the coast because they lived in a landlocked province. MacLean felt that WCL had tremendous potential in terms brand development. However simply using a boilerplate or standardized ECL model by substituting mountains for anchors was unlikely to do the job. Geographic ExpansionBesides brand development and new product launches MacLean grappled with geographic expansion ideas. He wanted ECL to become a global player in the lifestyle apparel category. The most logical step was the U.S. Eastern Seaboard whose population of more than 115 million dwarfed Atlantic Canada’s population of less than 5 million. He had grand plans to eventually capture the hearts and minds of consumers in other countries that had rich surf skate and snow subcultures and were located on a seacoast including the east coasts of Japan (with a population of 10 million) and Australia (with a population of 15 million). While ECL had shipped to 55 countries to date through its online store the logistics of stocking suppliers and brand-building outside of Canada was truly foreign. At the time ECL’s U.S. presence had been built from the requests of a handful of small retailers who had ECL products that were not moving. MacLean had no overarching strategy or rollout in place for expansion. First of all it was unclear how ECL could develop a deal with an established retail partner. Professional salespeople were available who were trained to approach U.S. retail chains that had brand alignment with companies such as ECL including Zumiez PacSun and Urban Outfitters and these salespeople did not cost much upfront. However for every chain that the salesperson signed the salesperson received a rather hefty percentage (10–15 per cent) of all products that were sold through the chain. This commission was on top of the 60 per cent margin that retailers often demanded to justify carrying the product. At that point it would be very difficult for ECL to be profitable at launch considering the import taxes it would need to pay to take product into the United States. While ECL might have hit the ceiling on Atlantic Canada other domestic growth opportunities were available. For example ECL could develop its retailer presence itself opening a series of small stores and kiosk locations to earn full margins on its products. MacLean was unsure how this idea might affect his existing retail partners and was leery of investing in assets that were not the traditional strength of ECL. ECL could also make its products available to other retailers in Canada—the demand was certainly there. The trade-off was the cost of potentially mainstreaming the brand too much and thereby diluting the uniqueness of ECL and what it meant to offer limited-edition apparel. MacLean could also make other global decisions such as expanding the brand ambassadors network to a global scale and using a social media influencer network and online sales to sell directly to consumers without brand building. Another international option had recently presented itself. An organization in South Korea which had a rich surf skate and snow culture with coastal identification had approached ECL with the opportunity to license the brand on a one-year contract trial basis. In this scenario ECL would mitigate much of the expansion risk and cost to access a new consumer base in exchange for even lower margins and less brand control online. This option did lead MacLean to consider a hybrid of leveraging the brand ambassadors program as a franchise initiative to mitigate risk and grow quickly but he was skeptical of the implications of a novel business model. MOVING FORWARDMacLean’s quandary came down to one question: How should ECL strategically expand? The ECL and WCL brands were trademarked and incorporated globally and both were assets with broad appeal and public relations momentum. The perspective that ECL could grow in many different directions was exciting for MacLean but also concerning given ECL’s lean organizational structure (see Exhibit 3). Because he had invested so much of his own time and resources into the business and felt that he truly understood his customers the prospect of risk and giving up control was daunting. Around his office MacLean kept free promotional items from Hurley and from Burton American West Coast companies that thrived after their expansion into Canada. MacLean wanted to reverse that trend bringing some Canada to the world in a way similar to what Herschel had done for bags and what Westbeach had done for snowboard apparel. Could an Atlantic Canadian brand resonate in a city such as Los Angeles with WCL or in Miami with ECL? Americans clearly had a sense of pride that MacLean could tap into but he wondered whether a Canadian brand could authentically fill that void. MacLean wondered whether East Coast states such as Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire New York Florida Georgia and the Carolinas would react favourably to the brand. ECL had always been an Atlantic Canadian signal of strength humility and warmth that could easily start conversations about where people were from. It was exciting to think about what this lifestyle business could evolve into.

The highlight of the year was the arrival of two new ?40 degrees Celsius [°C] deep-freeze tuna purse seiners Dolomieu and Belouve which joined an Indian Ocean tuna fleet already composed of three ships. Moreover if the tuna activity was growing the southern seas activity (Saint Paul rock lobster and toothfish) was also doing very well with good fishing campaigns and steady sales.De Chateauvieux was pleased to see that return on equity had improved significantly in the past two years. However reading through the company’s financial statements and the report on ship deliveries and payment terms he knew that SAPMER still had enormous challenges related to its growth. He needed to know the reason for the improvement in return on equity what potential problems could be identified from a DuPont analysis of SAPMER’s financials and what bottlenecks could appear in the coming years. A BRIEF HISTORY OF SAPMEREarly YearsJean Chatel Georges Michel and Raymond Latour three entrepreneurs from Réunion Island created SAPMER in 1947 when they joined forces and acquired a three-masted motorized ship outfitted by Madagascan ship fitters. The trio sent the ship rechristened the Cancalais fishing around the Saint Paul and Amsterdam Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. That was the beginning of a rich journey for the company.The period from 1947 to 1965 was the age of pioneering and conquering the Southern Ocean with the fishing company’s strategic plan taking shape in 1949. After an exploratory mission and some trial and error SAMPER’s founders realized that they needed to catch and prepare their haul with whatever they had on board. They also realized that in this environment “the future of seafood belonged to the cold rather than salt preservation techniques.” SAPMER bought a refrigerated 62-metre-long cargo ship and turned it into a giant lobster freezer. They added eight motorized whaleboats to the ship to support fishing activities and on December 31 1949 sent the ship on the first of what would become an annual fishing campaign.From 1965 to 1980 companies took advantage of fishing grounds teeming with lobster—difficult to harvest but a catch worth the effort. SAPMER advanced its capacity in 1965 by replacing its first ship with a former wine carrier fitted for pot fishing and on-board processing with a freezing tunnel. But exploitation was exhausting the resources. At the end of the 1973–1974 fishing campaign quotas were greatly reduced dropping from 960 to 450 tons. Only one ship was allowed to fish on behalf of the three companies working the area: Organis pêcheries Ouest Bretagne [Organization of the Fisheries of West Bretagne] SAPMER and Bretic. Year after year the resources were replenished through sustainable management of fishing. In 1986 SAPMER’s boat focused on catching toothfish a species that had not attracted much attention until then. The deep sea fish described by sailors as the most beautiful species of the Southern Ocean had been considered a by-catch and stock was considered depleted. But in this new venture SAPMER brought 241 tons of toothfish to Réunion Island and Japanese customers took interest. The fish resembled a species of fish favoured by the Japanese but which Japanese fishing companies could no longer access. With popularity prices started to rise. After ten years of difficult campaigns fishing the waters surrounding the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) finally became profitable for the Réunion Island fishing company. On land the company was also restructured: Maurice Barrier son-in-law of Robert de la Fortelle the previous chairman took charge of the company in 1987. The Bourbon YearsIn 1989 Les Sucreries de Bourbon (Bourbon) then focused only on sugar and managed by de Chateauvieux began its diversification. Its sugar business was struggling and the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. SAPMER whose majority share was owned by de la Fortelle’s family was already a symbol of Réunion Island famous for its small fish-processing activity. De la Fortelle’s son and de Chateauvieux had studied together at Columbia University in the United States then worked together for the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Later they were both members of the founding team of BCG Europe. Because they knew each other very well and de Chateauvieux was very fond of SAPMER’s management team de Chateauvieux began to consider investing in SAPMER. Believing in and appreciating SAPMER’s commitment to development as well as its growth potential in lobster and toothfish Bourbon took a majority of shares in SAPMER in June 1989.In November 1990 Bourbon bought a retail operation. In 1991 it acquired a shipping business in order to become further diversified. In 1992 de Chateauvieux’s group attained sole ownership of SAPMER. Over the following years SAPMER’s performance with reasonable ups and downs was in line with the expectations of the management team. The toothfish business was good and SAPMER renewed the vessel for lobster fishing. Keeping SAPMER in the FamilyIn 1998 Bourbon was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. However the stock market did not show much interest in the company even though the company delivered a good performance in line with the forecast of its initial public offering prospectus. From 2000 to 2001 Bourbon’s leaders reconsidered the company’s strategy and decided to narrow its focus to one field rather than continue as a conglomerate. Having so many unrelated businesses was unattractive for financial analysts and investors. Bourbon sold off its sugar business in February 2001 and decided to gradually step out of its retail business in November 2001 focusing on its marine service activities and offshore oil ship businesses. Because the Bourbon team liked SAPMER very much it was one of the last businesses to be sold. In 2005 Bourbon looked for a buyer of the fishing company. An Indian Réunion Island family that was a SAPMER competitor offered €15 million.De Chateauvieux held a family meeting to talk about the possible disposal. His wife and six children all knew about SAPMER products; they had been visiting the port to see the vessels and had been enjoying the lobster and toothfish for many years. They expressed their wish to keep the fishing company in the family. De Chateauvieux decided to buy SAPMER from Bourbon for his family holding group JACCAR Holdings SA. As a related party de Chateauvieux finally paid €21 million to buy SAPMER and keep it as a wholly owned subsidiary of JACCAR. De Chateauvieux regarded buying SAPMER as he would collecting a painting; he did not expect the company to create value as it should for Bourbon. Bourbon’s share price soared after its business became more focused.The strategic rebirth of SAPMERDiversification with the Tuna VentureWhile rock lobster and toothfish were SAPMER’s two main sources of revenue the fishing company had never stopped seeking new commercial species. Because both lobster and toothfish were resilient profitable businesses with high quota limits each year SAPMER’s limited production could hardly meet the demand. To find new methods of development the company undertook various campaigns in different sectors of the Indian Ocean over the years. In 2006 de Chateauvieux asked general manager Yannick Lauri how they might further grow SAPMER’s business. Lauri proposed an idea he had developed with his predecessor Jacques Dezeustre: expanding into the tuna business. Experiments with fishing pelagic fish (e.g. tuna and swordfish) had been going on in the Indian Ocean since 1995. The experiments involved using “a freezer longliner capable of producing sashimi-quality fish for Japanese buyers.” The tropical Indian Ocean was abundant with tuna and SAPMER knew the demands of the Asian market. The growth potential of the European market was within the company’s reach.Lauri decided that the tuna business could be a source of diversification for SAPMER. Various studies and trials also confirmed his judgement. Accordingly SAPMER bought two old tuna vessels to learn the business seriously. The two freezer purse seiners were renamed Titan and Takamaka. SAPMER had begun learning a new trade. SAPMER used these old vessels for tuna fishing from 2006 to 2008 then sold them in 2008. De Chateauvieux and Lauri reviewed the financial results and found that the business was cyclical. Its profitability for canning and fresh markets was low. But they believed that the tuna business could succeed if they targeted the correct markets and carefully segmented them. Thus they developed a plan for ordering new ships to develop the market for tuna products. New Niche Positioning for the Tuna BusinessIn 2007 SAPMER ordered three ships from the Piriou shipyards in Concarneau a French county highly renowned for tuna fishing. De Chateauvieux’s holding company was Piriou’s largest shareholder. The company accepted the daunting task of developing a freeze and deep-freeze seiner of a completely new design. The ships used the purse seiner technique with very modern means giving them great power and a rapid execution time. At 90 metres long they implemented high-performing fish-detection methods. The most important novelty was their propulsion system. Two electrical engines activated a pitch propeller while these two electrical engines were powered by a main diesel engine. The new propulsion system saved fuel and reduced emissions while also giving the ships the power and manoeuvrability to operate seines 1800 metres long 280 metres high and weighing 90 tons. The electrical power of the vessels also allowed fish to be frozen in reduced time preserving the natural quality of the fish. On board the fish was handled in two ways. First the undamaged fish was immersed in a smooth-walled 300-ton tank of chilled brine and frozen to the core at ?9°C. Then the frozen fish was transferred to a work area where the small fish were separated from the large ones and transferred to 700-ton freezing holds. There the core temperature of the catch was lowered to ?40°C; this very low temperature was maintained until the fish was unloaded.With the new ships SAPMER embarked on a five-year plan with proven development of a new segment—super-frozen tuna fishing and processing in the Indian Ocean. The process addressed the Asian consumer market for premium sashimi and tataki and premium tuna loin and steak. The company created a niche position between canning and fresh markets targeting mainly the Japanese market (see Exhibit 1).At the same time SAPMER and Seafood Hub Ltd. (a subsidiary of Ireland Blyth Ltd.) partnered to invest in a processing factory for frozen fish on the wharf of Port Louis the capital of Mauritius. The factory supported an important element of the SAPMER strategy: to provide all markets with tuna without any thawing during the whole process from capture to the consumer’s plate. Part of the catch was intended for the canning industry while the best fish would be used for processing and value enhancement to meet customers’ demand for fillets steaks and dices (see Exhibit 2). This value enhancement would allow SAPMER to triple its sales in the near future and further expand the market in accordance with its long-term strategic plan. Financial Arrangement Ordering new ships for tuna fishing required significant investments. To finance the new vessels for its tuna venture SAPMER decided in 2007 to open up shareholding through private placement to investors. After two years de Chateauvieux realized that SAPMER needed to choose whether to buy back the shares with a given return or list SAPMER on the over-the-counter (OTC) market in Paris. He concluded that the easiest way to waive his obligation was to be listed on the OTC market. SAPMER was listed on the Alternext in July 2009 becoming the first French fishing company to be listed. The first investors were Réunion islanders. strategy since 2008The strategic five-year plan was successfully implemented in 2008 (see Exhibit 3). In 2012 SAPMER’s revenue was €93.1 million an increase of €16.1 million from 2011’s revenue of €77 million. This increase was mainly due to an increase in whole tuna sales growth in value-enhancing tuna products an increase in Saint Paul rock lobster revenues and steady toothfish sales.Strong Fishing ActivitySAPMER’s fishing activity represented 79 per cent of total revenues. This growth was the result of increases in gross tuna sales and a slight increase in its rock lobster sales. Southern seas fishing (Saint Paul rock lobster and toothfish) still profited from a strong demand from the Asian markets with steady prices over the year.Rock lobster sales increased from €8.7 million in 2011 to €9.3 million in 2012 as a result of a favourable price and exchange rate. SAPMER caught its whole quota. The price index was 138 and the basic price index was 100 based on whole rock lobster average prices from 2007 to 2011. Sales were primarily to Japan.Toothfish sales dropped from €40.7 million in 2011 to €39.4 million in 2012—a result of a change in fishing trip dates and a slight price decrease in the second half of 2012. The price index was 139 based on HDG average toothfish prices from 2007 to 2011. More than 85 per cent of the sales were in Asia including 10 per cent in Japan.Gross tuna sales increased by 74 per cent from €13.8 million in 2011 to €24 million in 2012. This growth was linked to a strong increase in the average selling price over the year and an increase in sales volumes. In 2012 the whole tuna market met a strong demand with an average price that almost doubled compared to 2010. SAPMER’s increase in volume was a result of having on average four tuna purse seiners in operation over the whole of 2012 compared to three in 2011. The main clients for tuna were based in Mauritius (43 per cent) the Seychelles (33 per cent) Europe (12 per cent) and Japan (10 per cent). SAPMER’s main achievement for tuna in 2012 was diversifying its client base.Value-Enhancing ActivityValue-enhancing activity included processed tuna sales (e.g. tuna that was fished and processed in the factory into loins and steaks) and the Mauritian subsidiaries’ activities. SAPMER’s premium choice line increased value-enhancing activity by 51 per cent to €19.9 million in 2012. This growth was linked to an increase in sales volumes and an augmentation of catches suitable for processing. In 2012 36 per cent of the total catch was value enhanced. A price rate effect also affected growth and the Mer des Mascareignes factory also increased its whole tuna value-enhancing production to 7600 tons up from 5300 tons in 2011. Revenues could be divided into two main products: loins at 68 per cent of revenues and steaks at 20 per cent. Loins were mainly sold in Japan and steaks were mainly sold in Europe and the United States.SAPMER’s strategy of diversifying sale zones continued with penetration of the North American market led by the popularity of tuna steaks. Mirroring its toothfish and lobster activity SAPMER was positioned in a “very high-quality” niche market and enjoyed an excellent reputation for its value-enhanced tuna products especially its loins. SAPMER was then the only company in the Indian Ocean operating across the entire value chain: fishing deep freezing at ?40°C and cutting and packing tuna into sashimi-quality loins. This high-end positioning was particularly appreciated by Japanese clients and generated high demand for sashimi loins.Benefits of a Diversified PortfolioBecause the economic crisis in Europe had made it difficult to assess economic and financial prospects SAPMER’s potential in its home market was uncertain. In Europe and South Africa SAPMER supplied supermarkets (frozen sections) and out-of-home catering. In Asia and Japan the tuna sold by SAPMER (e.g. loins bellies and saku) was mainly consumed raw in sushi bars; SAPMER also supplied the tataki market with high-quality pre-grilled skipjack loins that were raw in the centre. In the United States SAPMER products were sent to major specialized high-end food stores (the organic market). SAPMER was also studying other outlets that would enable the resource to be most effectively value enhanced.SAPMER was not as affected by the European economic situation as were other companies. By 2012 the majority of SAPMER’s sales were exports to either economically buoyant countries such as China or countries with a major and growing market for fish such as Japan. Revenues from Japan in 2012 accounted for 30 per cent of the total; revenues from Hong Kong Singapore Taiwan Korea Indonesia and China combined accounted for 33 per cent. Japan seemed to be the main market for processed tuna: this small country contributed 72 per cent of the revenues for this product in 2012.De Chateauvieux was satisfied that through the years SAPMER’s share price had been steady and had grown since the end of 2011 (see Exhibit 5). However reading through the financial statements the report of ship deliveries and the company’s payment terms de Chateauvieux also knew that SAPMER still had enormous challenges (see Exhibit 6). The company’s growth would require a balanced view and careful management.EXhibit 1: Super-frozen tuna—value chain and niche marketSource: Company documents.

P. accessed April 21 2016. Exhibit 5: Deliveries of Freezer Tuna Vessels and payment terms The shipbuilding contract was signed in July 2007. Deliveries were respectively the Franche Terre in July 2009 the Manapany in May 2010 and the Bernica in November 2010. Payment terms were 20 per cent in each of five payments: 20 per cent on the order date; 20 per cent upon completion of the hull; 20 per cent on delivery of the electrical generators; 20 per cent on delivery of seine cable; and the final 20 per cent on delivery. The total investment of €93 million was financed by debt (€75 million); tax benefit (€30 million); and capital increase (stock exchange €5 million). The first ship of the series was built in Concarneau France christened Franche Terre after the Sainte-Suzanne locality of Réunion Island. It was completed in May 2009 and began unloading its first catches in the second half of 2009. The construction of Franche Terre’s two sister ships the Manapany and the Bernica (both names emblematic of Reunion Island) were continued at Ben Luc in Vietnam in the SEAS shipyards a subsidiary of Piriou. The Manapany was christened in May 2010 and began fishing trips in August 2010. The christening of the Bernica followed in November 2010. It began fishing trips in December 2010.

Since starting with no specific knowledge in November 2014 he had built Re-Matt Inc. (Re-Matt) into a one-of-its-kind enterprise in Alberta where municipalities both urban and rural had been categorizing mattresses as waste and sending them to landfills for disposal for decades. In December 2015 the City of Calgary had set a goal of diverting 70 per cent of waste from landfills towards environmentally friendly avenues by 2025. This agenda would affect how used mattresses in Calgary would be disposed of going forward.Re-Matt’s business was diverting used mattresses from landfills and recycling them by routing their individual components back into the economic streams and recovering value. The company had reached an annual revenue of CA$500000 in two years. Cable was now weighing his options with respect to scaling up Re-Matt’s operations. He was also trying to identify ways of differentiating Re-Matt from its potential competition which seemed imminent.WASTE GENERATION IN CANADA Canada was generating about 25 million tons of solid waste annually—the highest tonnage among members countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (see Exhibit 1). The reason for this large amount of waste was that Canada unlike many other OECD members was a processor of natural resources. For example the country’s oil industry was the largest producer of waste followed by mining livestock and solid municipal waste. A provincial ranking based on the index of waste generated per capita placed Nova Scotia at “A grade” (with 386 kilograms of waste per person) and Alberta at “D grade” (with 1007 kilograms per person). Overall Canada generated 720 kilograms of waste per capita in 2014. Managing waste was part of the core customer services that Canadian municipalities were responsible for providing to their residents. This waste management involved four priorities: reduce reuse recycle and recover. Reducing the quantity of waste generated at source was crucial to minimizing its impact on the environment. Reusing the end products of waste recycling them into secondary markets and recovering the end products to produce an altogether new output often involved the use of relevant technologies. Municipal waste was defined as “waste from households including bulky waste similar waste from commerce and trade office buildings institutions and small businesses yard and garden waste street sweepings contents of litter containers and market cleansing waste.” In Canada 95 per cent of municipal waste was sent to designated facilities for disposal into landfills. Some was diverted to recycling facilities for recovery of value in terms of secondary materials while some was incinerated. Municipalities in general had two major limitations in managing municipal waste: lack of access to affordable diversion technologies and the absence of nearby markets for secondary materials.MATTRESS RECYCLINGMattresses were complex products from a sustainability perspective. Although their customer value proposition was clear as providers of rest relaxation and sleep there was ambiguity about their eco-friendliness beyond the products’ end-of-life which averaged 10.8 years. Used mattresses were being disposed of in four ways: through reuse at landfills via incineration and via recycling. The most common channel for reuse was charitable institutions. Most municipalities in Canada aggregated mattresses at their solid waste disposal facilities to be buried in landfills or fed into incinerators both of which also had significant environmental impacts and operational problems.A mattress was less dense than other solid waste but larger in volume which was a disincentive for aggregators because the fees they charged for accepting waste (or “tipping fees”) were based on weight rather than volume. In addition a mattress was bulky springy and had a compaction rate that was 400 per cent lower than regular waste. Each mattress occupied 0.6 to 1.1 cubic metres (23 to 40 cubic feet) of area in a landfill depleting valuable airspace. Moreover mattresses could take decades to decompose in landfills often popping out of the ground long after they were buried. A mattress was also difficult to incinerate because its springs or coils could be caught in the moving grates of an incinerator or shredding machine harming the equipment. In any case even after incineration 40 per cent of a mattress (by weight) had to be disposed of in a landfill anyway. A typical mattress was an assembly of steel polyurethane foam wood fibre and cotton (see Exhibit 2). There were markets for all of these components. Steel components like spring metal and box spring metal once separated could be scrapped and reconverted into steel. Polyurethane foam could be turned into carpet underpad. Wood could be chipped and used as animal bedding mulch or biomass fuel. Fibre could be recycled into industrial filters or padding materials. Cotton could be used in locomotive oil filters. Although 95 per cent of the components of a mattress were recyclable only 7 per cent of used mattresses were recycled in Canada; the rest ended up in landfills.Canadian municipalities had not taken any initiative to establish dedicated facilities for recycling mattresses because of issues related to investment in recycling machinery and plant/labour capacity utilization. Thus mattress recycling was left to private enterprise. The country’s first mattress recycling operation was set up in Montreal in 2007. Since then independent recyclers had launched operations in select urban centres in British Columbia Alberta Manitoba Ontario and Quebec. Many of them had provisions for recycling products in other categories like soft furniture. These recyclers sourced used mattresses from locations that generated them in bulk (e.g. hotels hostels retailers and hospitals) and created drop-off points for individual residents.Some large mattress manufacturers and retailers collected used mattresses for recycling when they delivered new ones. They recovered the recycling fee from the buyer at the point of sale and paid it to the recycler. This system was characteristic of the strategy known as extended producer responsibility (EPR) which shifted the responsibility for waste management from a municipality to the individual manufacturer. EPR saved tax dollars and incentivized manufacturers to incorporate environmental considerations right from the stage of product design though it was voluntary for mattress manufacturers in Canada.In product categories where EPR was mandatory like electronics the strategy had led to increases in recycling rates. The corresponding legislation included performance goals and collection site convenience metrics. The growth in recycling had to be led by new entrepreneurs creating new markets. Regulatory actions like banning landfills could provide the groundwork for a future EPR program for mattresses. Metro Vancouver for example had implemented a mattress landfill ban in 2012. Calgary had set a goal of diverting 70 per cent of its waste (including mattresses) from landfills by 2025. The Province of Ontario had identified mattresses for future EPR programs as part of a drafted waste reduction strategy that it had prepared for its municipalities.RE-MATT Company Background Cable had founded Re-Matt in mid-2014. Before that point he had worked for three years on the supply chain operations of an oil sands company in Calgary where he had witnessed first-hand the negative impact that industry could have on the environment. As part of a skills upgrade program the oil sands company had sent him to attend a course in logistics at Mount Royal University in Calgary. The class was touring a local Sears distribution centre when Cable saw a pile of used mattresses at a warehouse. He learned from the warehouse supervisor that the mattresses were destined for a landfill because there was no mattress recycling facility in the province and that Sears was willing to provide a fee per mattress to anyone who could dispose of them in another way. Cable immediately spotted a business opportunity. He enlisted a friend with whom he had worked earlier at a national restaurant chain for over a decade as a partner. The two drove along alleys in Calgary found a few discarded mattresses took them to their garage and started taking them apart. It took 15 minutes for each of them to disassemble a mattress. The process seemed akin to peeling layers off of an onion.The two men spoke to other potential suppliers of used mattresses and put together a business plan (see Exhibit 3). One of the difficulties they faced was ascertaining sources of revenue. The recycling fee that some retailers were charging customers at the point of sale of a new mattress became a benchmark for determining the fee that their company now called Re-Matt could charge for recycling a used mattress. The duo set this fee at $13–$15 for non-residential sources and $15 for residential sources. However when they approached Canada’s main banks for a working capital loan of $150000 they were turned away because they could not offer any collateral. Fortunately the Business Development Bank of Canada which focused on small and medium enterprises was willing to finance an idea that it recognized as novel in the province. The partners acquired a 10000-square-foot warehouse on a five-year lease and converted it into their business’s shop floor (see Exhibit 4). Re-Matt was officially in business by November 2014. Cable and his partner initially learned through trial and error. They trained themselves and their new employees who joined the company on a part-time basis. The business had no entry barriers but those in related businesses including mattress manufacturers and retailers were reticent about revealing their knowledge of the industry tricks of the trade. One such “trade secret” was that the sale of secondary materials could be a source of revenue. Cable and his partner had identified the recycling fee as the main source of income in their business plan. It was only much later as they settled into the business that they recognized that the byproducts had a regular market of their own and that they raised the value of each mattress to $0.80 more than the partners had estimated in their business plan. Cable had been manager of a restaurant for seven years and general manager—responsible for the profitability of regional units in the restaurant chain—for five years. The work was paid hourly rather than daily or weekly and involved many different skill sets. He applied the lessons and skills gained from his restaurant experience to this new business. By early 2015 Re-Matt had five full-time and three part-time employees. Cable recognized that in order to break even the company needed to recycle one mattress every 10 minutes per employee. The need to reach out to part-time workers became a rough measure of how good (or bad) a week was for the business. Recycling seven mattresses an hour became the new performance metric.The business was not always even. The end of each year (when residents bought furniture for the holiday season) and spring (when many people cleaned out their homes) witnessed heavy inflows of used mattresses. During the summer months business was usually slow because people were out of town on vacation. Therefore Cable designated July and August as months when Re-Matt employees could take their leave. There was typically a spike in supplies whenever a large vendor announced a sale. As Cable soon realized recycling mattresses “was not the most glamorous work in the world” but it required skills that could only be developed over time—like understanding what made each mattress unique identifying quality end products and getting a feel for the mattress parts by using sight and touch. For example different types of foam had different flashpoints and segmenting them on the shop floor was crucial to determining where a foam type could be used (e.g. punching bags carpet padding car seats or bus seats). In addition to dismantling mattresses the shop floor duties included unloading trucks as they came in operating forklifts and loading the recyclable materials when they were ready for dispatch. Cable immediately noticed that maintaining morale on the shop floor would be an issue and employee retention became a metric for him to monitor. The disassembly of each mattress was manual at Re-Matt. This process reduced wastage and maximized the quality of the recyclable materials but it was slower than the mechanized separation that was common in some places such as California. In mechanized facilities each mattress would be placed on a conveyor belt and specially designed saws would cut away soft materials on the top and bottom separating the polyurethane foam and cotton fibre. The metal pieces would be removed magnetically and the remaining fibre materials were then shredded and baled. The process took one individual three to four minutes per mattress. Scaling up Operations Ensuring steady sources of used mattresses (on the supply side) and finding established markets for recycled materials (on the demand side) were crucial to building scale for Re-Matt. These actions would enable automation ultimately driving down costs and in turn generating greater efficiencies. Scaling up the business would also ensure better commodity prices for end products. Together these two agendas would create a virtuous cycle. By 2016 the disposal fee had stabilized at an average of $12 for large sources and $15 for households. Cable had to work on two streams in enhancing procurement sources: developing new collection systems for large non-residential sources and providing multiple channels for small and independent residential sources. Some large retailers had their own reverse distribution systems to return used mattresses to their original manufacturers; it was important that Re-Matt integrate its procurement systems with these retailers. For residential customers Re-Matt’s options included setting up permanent drop-off sites and one-day collection events in neighbourhoods or regular curbside collection. Mattress quality was an issue with curbside collection because mattresses left outside for collection were quickly damaged by exposure to the elements. Re-Matt would be in a better position to access large volumes of mattresses if (1) a ban of mattresses from landfills was enacted and (2) a recycling fee at the point of sale of each mattress was collected.The original concern with byproducts was their disposal. The tipping fee was about $113 per ton. There were several materials that had to be sent to landfills. For example the top layer of a mattress was a combination of textile and foam sewn so closely together that separating the two components was a labour-intensive task; however without being separated the materials had no value and would have to be sent to a landfill. Similarly although pocket coils had a metal component traders in Calgary would not accept them unless the microfibre in which they were wrapped was taken out. Traders in provinces like Ontario however saw value in pocket coils. These differences meant that Re-Matt was facing a business location conflict—to scale up the supply side the company needed to go where the mattresses were; to scale up the demand side Re-Matt had to go where the end markets were. Re-Matt’s original business plan was predicated on a conservative income of $0.80 per mattress from the sale of recycled materials. Since then Cable had developed a better understanding of end markets. The monthly yield from the 4000 mattresses that Re-Matt recycled in 2016 was 20000 pounds of metal 20000 pounds of foam and 4800 pounds of cotton. Metal was sold at a price range of $0.17–$0.28 per pound foam at $0.25–$0.35 per pound and cotton at $0.10 per pound. The five-year lease for Re-Matt’s existing shop floor premises would end in 2019 when the company would need to look for larger premises and pursue increases in plant and staff capacities. Moving into Ontario and Quebec which had Canada’s largest and the second-largest waste generation by weight respectively would scale up operations. Cable wondered whether diversifying beyond mattresses into other recycling-related products (e.g. soft furniture) would be another option for scaling up.DifferentiationRe-Matt had a first-mover advantage in Alberta as the first enterprise of its kind. By January 2017 it had diverted 1 million pounds of mattress waste from landfills. Sustaining this position was critical because new players would be drawn to the business in the absence of entry barriers. Re-Matt had to build a differentiation strategy that addressed both the supply and demand sides of the business.As part of building differentiation the company had started providing certificates of appreciation to its customers for their commitment to recycling. The certificate mentioned the quantity of waste that Re-Matt diverted in a year (see Exhibit 5). Further partnerships could be a way to erect entry barriers. Establishing long-term contracts with large companies (particularly manufacturers and retailers) would enable Re-Matt to lock in supply sources in Alberta. Even if the recycling fee were renegotiated large volumes would ensure the recovery of fixed costs. However Cable wondered how Re-Matt could avoid the risk of low-cost positioning. The risk was greater on the demand side where the end products were already commoditized. Building a sustainability proposition into its sale of end products would not only differentiate Re-Matt but generate higher prices as well. Re-Matt could also avoid the secondary markets and route the recycled materials directly to the mattress manufacturers. These companies could then pitch their products to eco-conscious consumers making an emotive appeal based on the recycled content of the product. Re-Matt had to rebuild its value proposition. While weighing the options available to him with regard to both scaling up and building differentiation Cable wondered what would be the best way forward—both for the novel business enterprise he had built and for him personally.

(Netflix) was faced with another round of skeptical business press as he attempted to grow his firm in 2017. His 1990s start-up business plan which had introduced the market to the convenience of home delivery of DVDs through the mail had eviscerated the prior market leader Blockbuster LLC (Blockbuster) forcing it to divest itself of thousands of brick-and-mortar video rental stores before finally falling into bankruptcy. Hastings was so successful that Fortune magazine named him its 2010 “Businessperson of the Year.” This meteoric rise however seemed a distant memory as Netflix focused on its transition to the digital delivery of video content. Digital delivery required mastering new technologies and created the need to acquire or create popular content. Numerous competitors including both established mainstream content producers and digital upstarts were making it difficult for Netflix to recreate its earlier dominant success. The business press had become critical of Netflix’s slowing acquisition of subscribers and its accelerating levels of debt which had reached US$3.4 billion by March 2017.Netflix was faced with the challenge of determining where and how quickly it would invest its capital in order to continue its growth. Though the company had had early success in creating new exclusive content (e.g. television series House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black) this apparent invincibility appeared to be fading as more recent shows (e.g. The Get Down Iron Fist) had been panned by the critics. As Netflix faced increasing competition to acquire exclusive content some of which came from companies with a long history of success in content development both the cost and the risk of failure seemed to be rising. In addition former content suppliers that had previously licensed content to Netflix now viewed Netflix more warily given its growth and apparent ambition to become more than just a delivery platform. Future deals would undoubtedly be more expensive if agreement could even be reached at all. Should Netflix continue to try to be a content producer competing with Hollywood’s industry leaders? Should it form a partnership with another media company or companies to align everyone’s incentives? Should it consider moving into other media content areas outside of traditional entertainment? Further there remained the question of how to treat its legacy DVD-by-mail business a former cash cow that had been the subject of controversy both in the market and internally at Netflix. Would the best choice be to sell the franchise and cash out? Netflix needed to decide where when and how to invest so as to ensure its future lest it suffer the same fate as Blockbuster.BACKGROUND: VIDEO RENTAL STORES AND THE RISE OF BLOCKBUSTERTo better understand Netflix’s situation it is useful to understand the industry that existed before it entered the marketplace. Although Sony Corporation (Sony) developed its Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR) in 1976 for U.S. consumers the key development in the growth of home video entertainment was a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court 5–4 decision that found that the Betamax did not violate copyright laws. This was followed by Congress affirming the copyright law’s “first sale” doctrine and refusing to pass a law proposed by Hollywood studios that would have forbidden the renting or re-selling of movie videotapes. In short order the focus of VCR users shifted from recording broadcast shows onto blank tapes to buying or renting pre-recorded media. The video rental industry in which VCR owners could rent tapes with video content (e.g. movies) was initially dominated by a variety of independent stores that had sprung up quickly in neighbourhoods everywhere. In 1985 David Cook opened the first Blockbuster store in Dallas Texas. Blockbuster brought to the industry an aggressive strategy based on multiple stores and a central database that connected them. These data allowed Blockbuster to more accurately forecast demand for videos and its emerging economies of scale kept its costs lower than that of its competition. By opening stores larger than those run by mom-and-pop operators Blockbuster could offer customers more choices and more copies of popular movies. By 1993 Blockbuster had grown to over 3400 stores an accomplishment it achieved despite some hesitancy by the movie studios which preferred the higher margins on individual consumer sales via outlets like Best Buy rather than the smaller margins available from Blockbuster’s rentals. NETFLIX’S DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION Netflix Knocks Off BlockbusterNetflix lore noted that Hastings’s desire to found Netflix started with a $40 Blockbuster late fee that he incurred in 1997. As motivating as that might have been the shift from bulky VHS videotapes to slimmer more durable DVDs was also necessary to make a mail-order model feasible. One limitation for Netflix in 1997 was that DVD players were new and expensive and therefore had limited U.S. household adoption. Blockbuster continued its growth of brick-and-mortar stores and also began integrating DVDs into its inventory. In 1999 Netflix hired Ted Sarandos from Blockbuster competitor West Coast Video and he focused on the content side of the business. Rapid growth in U.S. DVD adoption helped both firms—half of all U.S. households owned a DVD player by 2003 and over 80 per cent of households adopted this technology within the first nine years of its introduction. This adoption rate was even faster than that for VCRs which had taken 13 years to reach the same level.Netflix’s pricing evolved from a traditional fee per rental just as in video stores to a monthly subscription model at first limited to a fixed number of DVDs then later evolving into a $20/month price for unlimited rentals. Significantly Netflix had no late fees—customers could watch their rentals at their convenience whereas late fees were Blockbuster’s primary revenue source. Netflix also touted the convenience of shopping by mail eliminating both the trip to the store to rent a title and the trip to return it. However Netflix found it challenging to provide an adequate number of high-demand titles to its customers. Its solution was to be an early developer and exploiter of database personalization using a customer’s past rental history to suggest other titles they might like. Though keyed from past rental history the recommendation system was also biased towards titles that Netflix actually had in stock and therefore allowed Netflix to fulfill a greater percentage of orders. In addition its relatively centralized inventory permitted it to stock a greater variety of titles which Blockbuster with its inventory scattered across thousands of individual retail locations could not easily support. Netflix developed good relationships with DVD suppliers who saw it as another outlet for their product and as a hedge against the growing near-monopsonist Blockbuster. Netflix also worked closely on advanced integration with the U.S. Postal Service becoming one of its biggest customers. In 2000 Netflix with its 300000 subscribers was still not profitable. Meanwhile DVD-player adoption had helped fuel Blockbuster’s growth to some 7700 stores. Hastings who earlier in his career had started but later sold the company Pure Software had reported that in 2000 he engaged in negotiations with Blockbuster to sell it interest in Netflix for $50 million: “We offered to sell a 49-per-cent stake and take the name Blockbuster.com” he said but Blockbuster was not interested.Blockbuster would attempt to copy Netflix with an online service in 2004 hoping to leverage the availability of its brick-and-mortar stores with the mail-order option and keep the operations integrated. It was ultimately unsuccessful with its online offering however as were other contemporaneous imitators such as Wal-Mart. Netflix grew from 4.2 million subscribers in 2005 to 15 million in 2010 (see Exhibit 2). Although Blockbuster still had 47 million registered customers its eventual demise seemed apparent. Netflix had more than doubled to 32 million subscribers by November of 2013—the month that Blockbuster announced it was going out of business. NETFLIX FACES DIGITAL DELIVERYWhat Is Digital Delivery?Information goods (i.e. any good that could be represented digitally) could be delivered over a communication network such as the Internet. Initially early Internet content was limited to lower-volume content such as text and then later images and music. Video content with its relatively large file sizes tended to be limited to physical media such as film videotape and discs. However with advances in both network speeds and compression algorithms to deliver content with greater fidelity using less data other options emerged.Traditionally the first step in digital delivery was via downloaded content such as Apple iPod users downloading the complete file of any music they purchased from the iTunes online store. These files were stored on the user’s device and could be played repeatedly thus mimicking physical media such as vinyl records audio tapes and music compact discs which consumers were used to purchasing and owning. Streaming content on the other hand was content that was played on the consumer’s device but stored on a different device—typically a server operated by the content owner or licensee. Streaming required a network connection between the two devices in order to play the content. In this way it more closely resembled listening to music on the radio where the listener needed to have a connection to the content (similar to radio frequency reception) as opposed to owning local copies. Because video typically required much more data than music streaming video required a faster network connection in order to provide a reasonable viewing experience. As a consequence some content owners developed lower-resolution versions of their files in order to reduce their size which then allowed them to stream the content. This also avoided the problem of allowing consumers to possess a digital copy of their content which could potentially be shared or resold. Furthermore the very large file sizes of full movies acted as a partial deterrent to digital piracy (as did law enforcement efforts such as the 2012 closure of the popular website Megaupload). Netflix initially thought the future of digital video delivery would be downloading not streaming. It created a dedicated device (that later was sold and became the Roku box) for this purpose but eventually developed a standalone streaming service which was released as “Watch Instantly” in 2008. Early attempts at streaming were low quality and in any event most potential customers did not have the required Internet bandwidth. However seeing the potential of streaming in 2011 Netflix made what would be seen as an ill-fated too-early commitment to the digital delivery model when it announced a decision to split itself between its traditional DVD business (to be re-named “Qwikster”) and an uncoupled streaming business which required separate customer logins. As it was to be operated as two separate companies with no bundled discounts for those seeking both DVD rentals and streaming availability the new pricing model would mean a 60 per cent effective price hike for existing subscribers who wanted to continue both service types. Predictably the announcement was met with a loss of 800000 subscribers and Netflix’s stock price fell 77 per cent. Although Netflix reversed the decision a month later considerable damage had been done. This public relations disaster fed into a variety of contemporaneous pessimistic predictions about Netflix’s future. One noted that Netflix shares were in “free fall” after the third-quarter mishaps and projected future losses. Another said “customers wasted little time in jumping ship.” Despite these misgivings Netflix recovered and continued to grow after 2011 increasing its subscriber count from 23.5 million to over 93 million by the end of 2016 a compound annual growth rate of 32 per cent. REED HASTINGS’S DECISION POINTSDigital Delivery ChallengesRegardless of the mode or degree of digital delivery adoption digital delivery presented Netflix with significant challenges in terms of streaming content acquisition. This was not a problem in the DVD-by-mail delivery model as DVDs could be acquired from distributors and then rented. However acquiring streaming content was both riskier and more expensive.First licensing content was subject to the terms dictated by the content owner. Netflix learned this lesson early on when its original streaming contract with the Starz network expired. Starz would not renew the contract on terms acceptable to Netflix leaving Netflix with a hole in its available inventory. Second the home entertainment market was a very crowded one with 12 streaming competitors to Netflix that had each surpassed 1 million subscribers. One significant competitor was Hulu founded by The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and 21st Century Fox (Fox) in 2007 and later joined by the Disney–ABC Television Group and Time Warner Inc. It operated on a subscription model but also offered advertisement-supported options. Fox streamed content 24 hours a day through Hulu in some cases even bypassing its local affiliates. As of July 2017 Hulu had the greatest viewer engagement of all streaming services measured at 2.9 hours per day (versus Netflix’s 2.2 hours per day) and its content included the shows Casual and The Handmaid’s Tale. Another streaming competitor was Amazon Prime Video. Amazon initially offered its Amazon Prime Video service as a bonus for subscribers to its fee-based Prime membership service. Doing so provided the video streaming service a large number of subscribers at launch. Further the service benefited from Amazon’s financial power and multiple lines of business (e.g. Amazon Web Services). Amazon spent more than $100 million on content in the third quarter of 2014 alone and its portfolio included the television series Transparent and The Man in the High Castle. In addition its Fire TV platform grew with each device it sold (see Exhibit 3 for additional details).Traditional web giants that competed with Netflix included both Google LLC/YouTube LLC (YouTube) and Facebook Inc. (Facebook). While 75 per cent of U.S. Wi-Fi households had a Netflix subscription YouTube had quickly grown into second place in 2017 with 53 per cent penetration and reached more of the coveted 18–34-year-old demographic than any cable network. Its content included the series Escape the Night. Facebook late to the sector had also announced plans to offer new proprietary content and tried to make up for its late start by offering Hollywood studios better terms for their content including sharing advertising revenue and data on viewership the latter of which was an important asset that had distinguished the success of digital platforms such as Netflix. Of course Netflix also competed with traditional home entertainment outlets including Home Box Office (HBO) and Sling TV Dish’s live TV service. HBO had an extensive library of shows to watch on demand via cable and it had an app (HBO Go). It had a large number of subscribers and a strong extended track record of developing very popular original content such as television series The Sopranos and Game of Thrones. Sling TV although it had fewer subscribers than Netflix in 2017 had viewers who were more engaged averaging 47 viewing hours per month versus Netflix’s 28 hours per month.Many of these competitors fell into the category of “coopetition” to Netflix a term that suggests co-operation between competing companies. Netflix licensed content from some of the same companies that formed Hulu but at the same time provided a competing service. Further it relied on companies like Sony which had its own streaming service to carry the Netflix app on Sony’s PlayStation videogame consoles. Lastly Netflix relied on the availability of bandwidth from cable companies to provide its services to customers; many of these same cable companies (e.g. Comcast Time Warner Inc.) were also content producers with an interest in streaming services and with which Netflix competed.Major news outlets such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix was seen as a rival to firms from which it had previously licensed content and that therefore deals were being cut back. The Wall Street Journal wrote “[Netflix] must keep things cordial with Hollywood’s traditional studios . . . [and] prevent them from turning to its main competitors Amazon and Hulu.” It only had the one source of revenue but in its new market it was competing with firms that had much more diverse portfolios and revenue streams.For example if Netflix wanted to acquire some popular new show it most likely would have to borrow money from the bank; if Amazon wanted to acquire it it could borrow money from the Amazon Web Services division (of which somewhat ironically Netflix was a customer). Apple Inc. another financially powerful competitor with $260 billion in cash in 2017 was also investing in content creation most recently poaching two senior executives from Sony TV.As an alternative to licensing third-party content in 2013 Netflix ventured into developing its own original content. It started out with a “home run” when it acquired House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey which went on to win three Emmys. Given its lack of a track record at the time Netflix needed to commit to buying the entire season of the show without the option of declining after a pilot episode as traditional media outlets usually required. It also did well with Orange Is the New Black a popular series based on a book as well as the 1980s-style adventure series Stranger Things. However and to illustrate the risks a more recent effort Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny was widely regarded as a flop and Netflix found itself increasingly cancelling original series that did not produce sufficient returns such as Sense8 and The Get Down.In addition there were significant sums at risk in these ventures. Netflix budgeted $6 billion in 2017 for content—more than twice its total revenue. This level of spending resulted in $3.4 billion in long-term debt. Critics said that its debt was such that it must continue to add more subscribers just to feed the business model or everything could come crashing down. Whereas Netflix’s streaming content obligations were approximately equal to its revenue in 2011 by 2017 a significant gap had emerged.In-House Competition; the Challenge of IncumbencyOne consistent challenge confronted by all successful organizations facing significant technological change was the allure of their existing incumbent line of business. This took several forms including financial investment in the existing capital infrastructure organizational investment in skills and routines and the risk associated with moving away from a consistent well-understood source of cash flow. Author Joshua Gans termed this challenge “supply side disruption” about which drawing on the academic research of Rebecca Henderson he saidDemand side disruption involves an established firm missing a certain kind of technological opportunity but supply side disruption arises when an established firm becomes incapable of taking advantage of a technological opportunity. Specifically when a new competing innovation involves a distinct set of architectural knowledge established firms that have focus on being “best in breed” in terms of component innovation may find it difficult to integrate and build on the new architecture.At Netflix those responsible for the legacy business had successfully argued for its re-investment. The finely tuned industrial-engineered manual process of opening and stuffing the trademark red mailing envelopes was replaced by special-purpose robots that could process 3400 envelopes per hour versus the 680 per hour processed the prior labour-intensive way. This enabled Netflix to reduce the number of distribution centres from 50 to 33. These efficiencies resulted in cutting 75 per cent of its labour costs while retaining a high degree of customer service—92 per cent of its customers received next-day delivery service. Competitors also continued to see promise in the DVD format as Redbox with its trademark automated kiosk vending machines grew from about 100 locations in 2004 to 34000 by 2012. One argument for continued investment in the legacy business was that as recently as August 2015 fewer than half of all U.S. homes had high-speed broadband service and it could be expected that the currently un-served lower-population-density areas might be without this service for the foreseeable future. This lack of connectivity contributed to the continued success of brick-and-mortar video rental stores in these areas. This primarily rural phenomenon in the United States could presage markets in international locations with limited broadband that might also continue to support the DVD format. And when it temporarily split off its DVD business in 2011 Netflix lost a number of its own senior managers.On the other hand Netflix did not face the sort of business cannibalization challenges often faced by traditional media businesses with the advent of a disruptive technology. Netflix for example did not face the loss of advertising revenue as a result of a shift to streaming delivery a potentially significant problem for some of its competitors. Further despite its increased internal efficiencies its traditional DVD-based business faced other costs such as its dependence on the U.S. Postal Service which had recently resulted in a $100-million increase in mailing rates. Uncertain Future Public Policies—“Net Neutrality” and Its Variants In 2003 Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu coined the term “net neutrality” to describe a government regulatory principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source without favouring or blocking particular products or websites. It gained in visibility as Internet traffic became more and more concentrated over time with Wired magazine reporting in 2014 that half of all Internet traffic originated from just 30 organizations including Google LLC Facebook and Netflix. The policy required that ISPs not discriminate (e.g. “throttling back” throughput speeds) or charge differentially by user content website platform application type of attached equipment or mode of communication. This controversial policy tended to find favour with Internet firms especially those that generated a lot of traffic like Netflix. It tended to be opposed by ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon which argued that by limiting their decision rights the effect of the regulation would be to reduce investment in broadband network services and therefore to stifle innovation. In 2015 the Democratic Party administration in the United States enacted the rules into law effectively making broadband firms “common carriers” like the telephone network. In 2017 the Republican Party administration scaled back the regulation. Netflix similar to other Internet firms originally lobbied for net neutrality as streaming video required significant amounts of bandwidth and limiting ISPs’ ability to differentially charge for this service effectively subsidized the Internet firms’ activities. By 2017 at least publicly Hastings argued that it was no longer especially important. However the uncertainty about the regulation and its future added risk to any decision-making in the digital delivery market. In addition as the telecommunications sector of the economy grew and prospered it became an attractive area for lawmakers to target for new taxes. In 2017 Canadian legislators proposed but did not pass a 5 per cent tax on broadband charges dubbed by the press the “Netflix tax.” These monies would have been redistributed to traditional communications firms like newspapers that were adversely affected by the rise of the Internet. Traditional media firms lost revenue due to the Internet—particularly classified advertising but also subscription revenue—as some of their customers shifted use to their Internet equivalents. If broadband revenue would be ultimately subject to additional taxes this could decrease demand for it and thereby hamper the growth of Netflix-like streaming services.HASTINGS’S DECISIONSHastings faced a significant number of business decisions and despite Netflix’s successes he was self-critical and was often quoted as admitting to having made a number of at least in hindsight poor decisions in relation to the technology and home entertainment industries. These included online advertisements on the website starting an independent film production company and buying DVDs out of the Sundance Film Festival (which turned out to offer limited profitability) in addition to the 2011 Qwikster gaffe. In addition he had initially believed that the future would be digital downloading rather than digital streaming and in 2009 Hastings said that there would still be DVDs in 2030 a prediction that looked increasingly unlikely. However despite some of these missteps Netflix was positioned to compete with some of the biggest firms in both entertainment and consumer technology. Hastings himself noted that historically firms facing disruption such as AOL Inc. and the Eastman Kodak Company failed because they were too cautious. But which non-cautious path should Netflix take? Should it continue to create its own content or revert back to being a neutral platform? Should it look to form exclusive contracts with content providers and/or hardware manufacturers to “lock in” its customers? Did it need to acquire competitors and/or upstream or downstream partners? What was the appropriate role for the legacy DVD division—should it continue to be operated as a cash cow for as long as it was economically viable or should it be sold off so as to reinvest the funds in current operations? Or was it finally time as suggested by analysts who argued the firm was over-valued to sell the company and cash out while it had a high market capitalization? Exhibit 1: CHRISTENSEN’S DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION CONCEPT Harvard Business School’s Clayton Christensen has authored a number of books and articles defining and illustrating what he terms “disruptive innovations” which are new products or services that re-make whole industries generally at the expense of the incumbent firm. This occurs because the incumbent firm does not recognize the threat posed by the innovation due to two main reasons. First the disruptive innovation possesses a different package of performance attributes not all of which are valued by existing customers; therefore the incumbent’s current customers do not initially find it attractive. Second the performance attributes of the innovation that existing customers do value which are often weak in the innovation improve at such a rapid rate that the new entrant can later move up and capture the incumbent’s existing customers.Disruptive innovators typically either enter at the low end of the market or create entirely new markets. Both of these scenarios are characterized as markets not well served by current solutions. Incumbents therefore have a tendency not to take serious notice of the innovation because either they are not losing current customers to it or when they are they are customers who buy low-margin products. Losing such customers has the paradoxical effect of increasing the incumbent’s average margin thus improving its bottom line. As such the financial signals that incumbents receive create Christensen’s “dilemma” whereby incumbent firms often do not recognize the threat. In addition incumbents often have difficulty adopting disruptive innovations themselves because as these innovations initially serve the existing customers poorly to adopt them could mean the loss of existing revenues through cannibalization. Conversely new entrants have no current customers to lose removing any hesitation to invest in the innovation.Source: Clayton Christensen The Innovator’s Dilemma (New York NY: Harper Business 2001).Exhibit 2: Netflix Subscriber Growth (millions) Over TimeSource: “Netflix Subscribers from 2001 to 2011 (in 1000)” Statista accessed November 12 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/272551/subscribers-of-netflix-since-2001/; Jeff Dunn “Here’s How Huge Netflix Has Gotten in the Past Decade” Business Insider January 19 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/netflix-subscribers-chart-2017-1.Exhibit 3: Netflix and its Competitors 2017Exhibit 3 (continued)Note: n/a = not available1 “Movie/TV Show Counts” JustWatch accessed July 1 2017 www.justwatch.com.2 Mark Fahey “Netflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Deal” CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html.3 Seth Fiegerman “Netflix Nears 100 Million Subscribers” CNN April 17 2017 accessed July 2017 http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/17/technology/netflix-subscribers/index.html.4 “Number of Netflix Streaming Subscribers in the United States from 3rd Quarter 2011 to 2nd Quarter 2017 (in Millions)” Statista accessed July 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us.5 Mark Fahey “Netflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Deal” CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html. 6 Stephanie Pandolph and Jonathan Camhi “Amazon Prime Subscribers Hit 80 Million” Business Insider April 27 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-subscribers-hit-80-million-2017-4.

Ltd. (SNB) was co-operating with her lawyer Rajashri Menon taking measures to be implemented at SNB to mitigate losses from an incident that had occurred in her company ranks. Sunitha’s most trusted employee and studio manager at SNB Raghuveer Urs (Raghu) had quit SNB without notice. Further it appeared that Raghu had stolen money from SNB taken away one of SNB’s important clients and started a business that competed directly with SNB. Sunitha and Rajashri considered what measures needed to be implemented at SNB to contain any further damage and to preserve Sunitha’s relationships with her clients and vendors. They needed to review Raghu’s employment contract and determine what if anything Sunitha might do to prevent Raghu from using SNB’s resources—knowledge processes designs clients and employees—in his new business.EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT WITH RAGHURajashri directed Sunitha to retrieve Raghu’s employment contract. Sunitha provided Rajashri with what she had but cautioned Rajashri:Currently Raghu was working as the studio manager in charge of all of SNB’s offices. At the time of promoting him to studio manager a couple of months back we did not sign a new employment contract. It was just an oral understanding based purely on the need for managing the SSP movie project. But we had signed an employment contract when he was appointed as the assistant fashion designer. Rajashri was surprised that her friend—a very careful and clever designer—had overlooked a business responsibility but Sunitha explained:We did not have time to document all the responsibilities of the new role. We were planning to get it done once the movie project was complete. Before we got there he put me through this. Rajashri read what Sunitha did have: a two-page document that provided the job description for Raghu’s position as assistant fashion designer (see Exhibit 1) and an older single-page document that Raghu had signed when he was appointed trainee fashion designer (see Exhibit 2). Neither document included the legal aspects Rajashri was looking for in an appointment letter. Sunitha explained that the documents were drafted by the office manager who had some legal training. She had requested something simple to document the roles and responsibilities with a mention of the compensation package. She also wanted some flexibility so she could modify Raghu’s roles and responsibilities as needs evolved. Hence Sunitha asked the office manager to keep the agreement “open” and expected Raghu to execute what was delegated to him as SNB became busier and busier. When asked Sunitha confirmed that most of SNB’s employees had signed similar employment contracts. Rajashri explained to Sunitha:An agreement or contract between two parties (in your case between SNB and your employees) is a document that would be signed by both parties and would be referred to and reviewed only in extraordinary circumstances such as during a performance review salary revision or dispute between parties. An agreement should be as comprehensive as possible documenting all possible scenarios that the employer and employee could reasonably encounter. The document should also prescribe the remedies available in case of a breach of contract. In a good employment contract drafted effectively all of your requirements could have been taken care of while still providing the flexibility necessary to have Raghu execute the work you assigned him. To safeguard the interests of the employer the employment contract should also contain provisions preventing employees from joining competitors or starting a competing business when they leave your employment. Such provisions are called non-compete clauses. Your employment contract does not have any such provision.An employment contract should also contain a confidentiality clause which is also known as a non-disclosure agreement. Such a clause would prevent an employee from sharing any confidential information the employee encounters during employment. This helps to keep sensitive business information confidential within the organization. Your employment contract does not contain this provision either.Sunitha was surprised to hear that she might need to protect confidential information:But we don’t have any confidential information at SNB. Everything that we do is available for public scrutiny. We are leading fashion designers in the industry and all the information about what we do how we do it who we do it with and so on is transparent. So what is there to hide?Rajashri explained that while much of SNB’s information might be available for public scrutiny Sunitha would be maintaining some information as confidential even from her employees. Rajashri directed Sunitha to think about the information that she would not want her competitors to know. That could be the information that would provide SNB with competitive advantage in the market. Such information should be maintained as confidential within SNB. Rajashri advised Sunitha that any information that met two key requirements could be considered confidential information: (1) the information was not openly available easily accessible openly discussed and shared or easily ascertainable; and (2) the information provided a competitive advantage to SNB. Sunitha acknowledged that she did maintain some information as confidential and did not share it with everyone in the firm. But Raghu in his position as studio manager had Sunitha’s complete trust. He had access to all such data at SNB so he could manage SNB’s offices in Sunitha’s absence.Rajashri stated that non-compete and non-disclosure clauses might have helped Sunitha in this situation:For a design firm like yours apart from creativity which is individual in nature information is a very crucial component. The information provides its holder with needed agility and uniqueness. These are the qualities that provide you with recognition and competitive advantage in the industry. You needed to give Raghu access to the information so he could do his job but you needed to restrict Raghu’s use of the information to SNB’s business. Now he has started operating in the same space as you have been operating and he has also taken business away from you by underbidding in a project that you were executing. Also he has started a business that is directly competing with SNB all of which is possible because the employment contract you have with him did not have non-compete and non-disclosure clauses. Sunitha nodded in agreement. “I now realize my mistake in executing a very simple employment contract” she acknowledged. Rajashri interjected “That’s not quite all. The employment agreement doesn’t have a non-solicitation clause either.” She elaborated:A non-solicitation clause is also called a no-raider clause. Let me explain. You know that Raghu has already started a business which competes directly with your activities. He needs some employees who are good at their job and who also have relevant experience in the field. Let’s assume he finds that some of his ex-colleagues here at SNB could be persuaded to join him. Because he is aware of the details of the compensation paid at SNB he would top that salary and poach your employees crippling your business. Not only that he could also take away your customers and your vendors. He would be soliciting your employees vendors and customers to join his business by terminating their relationships with you. If there were a non-solicitation clause in his employment contract then he would not be in a position to do such a thing.Rajashri added that legally Sunitha could not take action against Raghu based on the employment contract he had signed with SNB. Based on their current contracts Sunitha could not prevent employees from joining Raghu’s business. However there were other ways they could prevent Raghu from poaching SNB’s clients customers and vendors. One approach would be to update the employment agreements Sunitha had with her remaining employees. Rajashri explained that non-disclosure non-compete and non-solicitation clauses collectively called restrictive covenants in an employment contract tried to achieve different objectives; hence they could not be captured with a single clause in an employment contract. Sunitha would need multiple clauses for her employment agreements. Rajashri offered to have her staff prepare a format for the clauses.Rajashri also cautioned Sunitha not to expect permanent prohibition from such restrictive covenants. She continued stating that if the courts found that the restrictive covenants prevented an employee from using his or her knowledge skill and experience to secure profitable employment (primarily the fundamental right to carry on business trade and profession which was guaranteed by the Constitution of India) then the courts could set aside such restrictive covenants. Rajashri gave an example of a recent case decided by the Delhi High Court. Before departing Rajashri reminded Sunitha to take care of the mitigating measures they had previously discussed. Rajashri was keen to have Sunitha quickly address some of the important needs:Raghu had access to everything in the office including the keys the passwords and so on. Now that we have evidence that he has stolen money belonging to SNB for his office interior work we don’t know what else he would do. So as a precautionary measure I suggest that you change the passwords and access codes to the computers in the office. Also get his email address deactivated immediately so that he doesn’t misuse it. Similarly get the office locks changed as he might have had copies of the keys made before leaving. Get these [things] done as soon as possible.Rajashri set an appointment with Sunitha for later the same day at 5 p.m. She asked Sunitha to gather as much information as she could about the interior design work Raghu had commissioned so they could consider that matter when they met later. She also reminded Sunitha to speak to her clients and vendors to ensure their accounts were in order and to determine whether Rajashri had contacted them. Sunitha thanked Rajashri for her assistance and promised to be at her office later in the day with her research.EPILOGUEAfter Rajashri left Sunitha reflected on the events that had transpired during the day. She had lost her most trusted employee when he quit SNB without informing her. The employee had started his own firm competing directly with SNB and had taken one of SNB’s key clients with him. He had also been interacting with SNB’s vendors and customers encouraging them to join his competing business. And before leaving the employee had arranged for his office interior to be completed and the work paid through SNB’s accounts—a theft of ?400000 (about US$6000). The silver lining to this incident was that she had also learned how not to structure an employment contract and the importance of including non-disclosure non-compete and non-solicitation clauses in employment contracts.Sunitha recalled what Rajashri identified as the two key requirements of confidential information: (1) the information is not openly available easily accessible openly discussed and shared or easily ascertainable; and (2) the information provides a competitive advantage to SNB. Sunitha wondered what kinds of information available in a fashion-designing firm like SNB would meet the requirements of confidentiality. She was also wondering what she needed to do to protect such information.Given that she did not have a strong employment contract with Raghu and the contract she did have did not contain a non-solicitation clause Sunitha wondered what preventive measures she should adopt to prevent her existing employees from leaving her. Specifically she was wanted to prevent Raghu from poaching her existing employees. Rajashri had also reminded Sunitha that some restrictive covenants in employment agreements would not be enforced by the courts if they infringed on the constitutional right of freedom of an employee to carry on business trade and profession. Sunitha made a mental note to ask Rajashri how to include restrictive covenants that the courts would uphold thereby effectively preventing similar incidents from happening again at SNB. Sunitha had much to review and clarify with Rajashri during their meeting in the evening.

According to a March 2015 report sales of BYD’s Qin a new energy vehicle (NEV) reached 1932 units—or 32 per cent of total NEV sales in China—in February of that year. The Qin had been selling extremely well since its launch: total sales in 2014 hit 14747 units or 27 per cent of China’s total production of passenger NEVs and 88 per cent of plug-in hybrid passenger EVs. By January 2015 the Qin had a backlog of orders for more than 8000 units.In 2014 sales income from the Qin and BYD’s other NEVs amounted to ¥7.328 billion (an increase of six times from the previous year) and accounted for 27.05 per cent of BYD’s total income from auto sales. In the same year BYD was ranked 15th among China’s passenger vehicle companies with sales of nearly 440000 units. How could BYD succeed in jumping from number 15 to number one as Wang projected? Should BYD rebuild its brand and maintain its low-cost competitiveness in the NEV market? COMPANY BACKGROUNDBYD was founded in Shenzhen China in 1995. With borrowed registered capital of ¥2.5 million Wang initially established the company in the battery business. On July 31 2002 BYD was listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx). The following year the company made its first move into the automotive market and on December 20 2007 its cellphone components and modules division spun off and was listed on the HKEx. In 2008 BYD expanded its business to the NEV market especially the EV segment. On June 30 2011 BYD was publicly traded as an A-shares company in the Chinese mainland.According to BYD’s 2014 annual report it had three major businesses at that time: automobiles and automotive products; cellphone components and cellphone assembly; and secondary batteries and photovoltaics with ¥94.058 billion in total assets. In 2014 BYD pulled in ¥58.196 billion in revenue with a net profit of ¥434 million. Sales from its auto cellphone and battery businesses totalled ¥27.834 billion (47.8 per cent) ¥24.48 billion (42.06 per cent) and ¥5.339 billion (9.17 per cent) respectively.The BatteryWang had concentrated primarily on batteries during his undergraduate and graduate education and they continued to be his main research interest after graduation. When the first generation of cellphones appeared in Shenzhen Wang became keenly aware of the huge potential demand for batteries as the devices caught on and he established BYD to capitalize on this demand.Market BackgroundSince 1990 the rechargeable battery had been adopted worldwide; however initially Japanese companies such as Sanyo and Toshiba kept a tight grip on the technology setting a high barrier for Chinese producers. Then in 1993 the Japanese government called a halt to the production of nickel–cadmium (NiCd) batteries in Japan due to environmental concerns.The termination of NiCd battery production in Japan presented a rare opportunity for Chinese battery companies. In Wang’s opinion Japan’s halting production did not signal the end of the NiCd battery worldwide; rather he believed demand would remain as strong as ever because the product was durable and economical. Any company that stepped in to take the business from the Japanese companies could become a huge success overnight but a fully automatic production line for NiCd batteries would cost tens of millions of yuan which Wang could not afford at that time.Lower Manufacturing CostsDue to cost constraints instead of replicating the Japanese system Wang created a new production mode by delving into the Japanese model step by step and dividing the manufacturing process into a semi-automatic model that combined manual operations and necessary machinery. With an investment of only ¥1 million Wang created a NiCd battery production line with a daily output of 4000 units. The BYD facility which cost nearly 40 per cent less than its Japanese counterparts was granted ISO 9000 Certification in 1996 ISO 9001 Certification in 1998 and QS 9000 Certification in 2000. Three years after its founding BYD outdid its rivals in the global NiCd battery market taking a 40 per cent share.At the end of 1997 Wang sought to make a quick push into the lithium-ion battery (LIB) market by buying equipment from Japan. Lithium a highly active metal required a special dry environment for processing and storage. At that time a fully automatic dry production facility cost billions of dollars and the technology was controlled by Japanese firms. Visiting an equipment provider in Japan with ¥2 million in hand Wang discovered that the least expensive set cost ¥4.14 billion. Even worse the company’s executives turned him down coldly stating that they would not sell any equipment to a Chinese company. Wang’s appeals to other Japanese equipment suppliers received similar rebuffs.Wang realized he would have to create a facility himself. A water-absorbent material was added to the desiccant to dry the environment and simulate a drying chamber. These alternative measures later helped to address the public’s doubts about BYD’s technological capabilities. In 2002 as BYD pursued an initial public offering an American investor asked Wang whether BYD had plagiarized the technology. He replied “Our technology and equipment are totally different from [that of our] Japanese counterparts.” This unique production mode though created out of expediency ultimately enabled BYD to outperform other LIB producers thanks to its lower cost. In 2003 BYD became the second-largest rechargeable battery manufacturer in the world and it gained the majority share of the global LIB market in 2009.The Secret of BYD’s Low Costs: Research and DevelopmentBYD’s low manufacturing costs could be partially attributed to its research and development (R&D) on the company’s manufacturing mode. For example the production of NiCd batteries necessitated a large amount of corrosion-resistant nickel sheets which cost ¥140000 per ton. Nickel-plated sheets which cost only ¥10000 per ton were prone to corrosion which impaired the batteries’ quality. Therefore BYD changed the chemical composition of the battery to reduce corrosion on nickel-plated sheets; this change reduced the company’s monthly expenditures for nickel from ¥5–6 million to less than ¥1 million.Since 1999 BYD had posted an average annual growth rate of 19 per cent in overseas patent applications. Each year the company had invested ¥50 million in patent maintenance and offered an average award of ¥10000 to any employee who obtained a patent. By 2003 BYD had secured a pool of 2099 effective patents making it one of the top 10 Chinese companies in terms of patent numbers (see Exhibit 1). In addition the R&D team had expanded from just over 100 employees in 2003 to 15000 in 2014.BYD AutoReverse EngineeringBYD’s patent strategy based on a commitment to patent application and protection had not only safeguarded its battery business but also strengthened its development in the automotive industry as Wang explained: “In fact a new car is a combination of elements 60 per cent of which come from open literature 30 per cent from samples 5 per cent from raw materials and only 5 per cent from R&D.” In January 2003 BYD rushed into the auto manufacturing industry by purchasing Xi’an Tsinchuan Auto Co. Ltd. for ¥270 million a transaction that allowed BYD to obtain the production permit needed to enter the auto industry. When BYD set out to develop its first car the F3 reverse engineering was the company’s first choice for R&D. The contour and interior design of the F3 were similar to those of the Toyota Corolla. Yet when asked about possible patent issues with the F3 Wang answered “We have applied alternative technology to stay clear of any possible patent problem. Although we have drawn on many non-patented technologies we have made innovations by integrating them to form new combinations.” He gave an example: the F3’s front and tail lamps were BYD’s original designs so he was confident that “patent is not an issue.” In 2005 the F3 was launched in the market at the relatively low price of ¥73800 (compared with ¥150000 for the Corolla). At its release the F3’s strong similarity to the Corolla and the wide price gap between the two cars were the F3’s key selling points. Some BYD dealers in Zhengzhou Henan Province even offered to replace the car’s logo with a Toyota logo for less than an extra ¥1000. In 2009 the F3 was the best-selling vehicle model in China and BYD reaped sales of 300000 units. In 2012 total sales of the F3 exceeded 1 million units which meant it had passed that milestone in the shortest time of any Chinese vehicle model. From then on reverse engineering was applied to almost every new BYD vehicle model: the F0 (which was based on the Toyota Aygo) the F6 (based on the Toyota Camry) and the F8 (later renamed the S8 and based on the Mercedes-Benz CLK) (see Exhibit 2). However each of these BYD vehicles was priced around half that of the comparable branded car.Vertical IntegrationThrough the use of reverse engineering BYD had not only rolled out new car models one by one but also acquired the know-how for automotive components gradually. Because BYD had set about manufacturing components on its own the company accomplished vertical integration of the whole auto industry chain. For example BYD’s 1.5-litre turbo-charged gasoline direct injection engine was based on Volkswagen’s 1.4-litre twin-charger stratified injection engine in structure and layout but BYD used an aluminum-alloy die-cast engine block for lighter weight and higher thermal efficiency.By 2012 except for a few standard components such as tires and glass BYD had been able to manufacture nearly all components partly or entirely on its own including the engines gear boxes dampers seats lamps and windshield wipers. A set of BYD F6 moulds consisted of over 1800 parts. BYD took eight months and spent between ¥70 million and ¥80 million to design and manufacture the moulds internally while outsourcing would have taken one to two years and cost between ¥150 million and ¥200 million.As with its battery manufacturing BYD applied a semi-automatic manufacturing model in its production using a combination of skilled workers and necessary machinery (the worker–machine manufacturing model) although automatic manufacturing had moved into the mainstream in the auto industry. “We won’t buy automatic production lines. They’re too expensive” said Wang. “We have managed to split the manufacturing process into separate procedures which our capable workers can perform according to the programs designed by our engineers. That’s why we can keep our manufacturing costs so low.”BYD’s ELECTRIC VEHICLEsProduction of gasoline-fuelled vehicles turned out to be merely a springboard for BYD. Wang declared that EVs were the company’s objective for entering the automobile industry. He believed that China’s auto industry had no choice but to develop EVs. The EV MarketThree Technological Approaches to NEVsNEVs which began to be developed in 1992 fell into the categories of EVs hybrid vehicles and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Launched in 1997 the world’s first mass-produced hybrid vehicle Toyota’s Prius reached global cumulative sales of one million units in 2008. Also in the late 1990s General Motors launched the world’s first mass-produced electric vehicle the EV1 but after turning out over 2000 units the company ceased production of the EV1 in 2002 because of a low cost-to-income ratio. FCVs were regarded as the toughest approach to NEVs. In 1992 Toyota began parallel R&D of hydrogen FCVs and hybrid vehicles but Toyota’s first hydrogen FCV did not make its debut until December 2014.The EV market picked up in 2008 when Tesla Motors a U.S. automotive company launched its pure electric vehicle (PEV) the Roadster. Seeing the market gain momentum again General Motors realized that the commercialization of LIBs would grow and thus shifted its focus from FCVs to PEVs with the launch of the Chevrolet Spark EV and the Chevrolet Volt (an extended-range electric vehicle). Meanwhile BMW rolled out its i3 PEV and Volkswagen debuted its Golf PEV. Major Players in China’s EV MarketThere were over 300 models of EVs in the Chinese market. Most pioneers in EV R&D were Chinese-branded manufacturers such as BYD Chery Changan and SAIC Motor. In 2014 China’s NEV industry had a total of 78500 units in output and 74800 units in sales—up by 3.5 times and 3.2 times respectively from the previous year. PEV production increased by 2.4 times from 2013 to 2014 and sales by 3.2 times. For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) output and sales grew by 8.1 times and 8.8 times respectively. The growth of the market was due to the contributions of its major players (see Exhibit 3). Government PoliciesIn addition to the forward-looking strategies among automakers government support could also be credited with the rise of NEVs. The Chinese government began a push for NEVs in 2001. R&D on hybrid vehicles PEVs and FCVs was incorporated into the EV project under the 863 Program a high-tech development program funded by the government to boost basic research in certain spheres. In July 2012 the State Council issued the New Energy Automobile Industry Development Plan (2012–2020) which committed the government to facilitate the development of PEVs and the industrialization of PEVs and PHEVs. On the consumption side the Chinese government issued a subsidy policy to encourage private purchases and the use of NEVs in June 2010. For each NEV produced the manufacturer would be granted a subsidy of ¥3000 per kilowatt-hour up to ¥50000 per unit for PHEVs ¥60000 per unit for PEVs and ¥3000 per unit for energy-saving vehicles with a swept volume of 1.6 litres or less. In September 2013 the Chinese government increased subsidies for NEVs. The subsidy system remained effective until the end of 2015. In response to the central government policies five cities also granted their own subsidies and lifted the restrictions on licences for NEVs. Further PEVs PHEVs and FCVs would be exempted from the vehicle purchase tax from September 1 2014 to December 31 2017.BYD’s Approaches to ELECTRIC VEHICLESBYD’s Dual-Mode EVsIn December 2008 BYD launched its first EV the F3 Dual Mode (DM) which was based on the F3. According to BYD dual-mode EVs were vehicles that could switch between the pure electric modes and hybrid modes. BYD’s DM vehicles unlike other hybrids had high-capacity plug-in battery packs. For example when fully charged BYD’s F6DM could travel a maximum range of 430 kilometres (km) including 100 km in the electric mode and 330 km in the hybrid mode. The car was equipped with a one-litre gasoline engine and a 15-litre tank for long-distance trips when recharging was inconvenient. With such a gasoline engine the fully charged car could travel around the city for one to two days. Battery packs in other hybrid EVs such as the Toyota Prius and the Lexus LS600HL had much lower capacities because they were aimed at keeping the gasoline engine working in the most fuel-efficient manner for as long as possible rather than at powering the vehicle in electric mode for long-distance travel like BYD’s offering.BYD’s first EV was dual mode rather than pure electric because of limited auxiliary charging facilities. However in its 2014 annual report BYD reemphasized that it would continue to give priority to PHEVs that could run in electric-only mode for short trips and in hybrid mode for longer distances. Due to the inadequacy of auxiliary facilities like charging stations in the long run the company believed that PHEVs were the most suitable NEVs for China and that they would dominate the private market.Entering the Government and Company Segments FirstInstead of targeting private buyers (as was typical for gasoline-fuelled cars) BYD first promoted the F3DM to group customers like governments and businesses. It was initially sold only in Shenzhen where BYD’s headquarters were located. The car’s principal customers included organizations like the Shenzhen municipal government and China Construction Bank. BYD later confirmed that aside from the shortage of auxiliary facilities the marketing strategy for the F3DM was also based on the fact that individual consumers valued a strong user experience. If the F3DM failed to make consumers’ lives easier they would respond negatively to the car and maybe to BYD in general. Moreover the NEVs were priced twice as high as their gasoline-fuelled counterparts which might further deter individual consumers. With group customers however the user environment was standardized or easier to control. Governments or businesses could build new parking lots for NEVs or add charging poles to existing facilities while these measures were beyond the capacity of most private buyers. Furthermore BYD could provide after-sales service more easily for group customers ensuring a better user experience and a greater brand reputation for the F3DM.The company later extended its marketing strategy for the F3DM to PEVs as well. In 2011 BYD electrified buses and taxis and then spread the PEV concept to the public. Together with the China Development Bank BYD initiated a solution to electric buses and taxis in cities in 2012. With the promise of “zero payment zero cost and zero emissions” the project offered such financing as financial leasing operating leasing and buyer’s credit to enable public transport service providers to access EVs at no (initial) cost. For example with financial leasing a financial company could purchase BYD electric cars and lease them to a taxi company which would pay rents by installments and could assume ownership after the lease expired.However BYD’s attempt to enter other local EV markets for public transport across the country suffered from local protectionism. Because EVs were entitled to national and local government subsidies many local governments would siphon these subsidies to their local NEV manufacturers and remove any EVs produced by non-local companies from their EV catalogues. Therefore BYD would seek to become a local manufacturer by building factories in the local market to boost local growth of gross domestic product.BYD extended this marketing strategy for public transport to such overseas markets as Europe South America and Singapore. It entered the taxi market by establishing partnerships with local governments and companies. In March 2015 BYD signed a deal with Uber a U.S.-based ride-sharing service provider for trial operations of electric cars; 25 BYD EVs were subsequently put to the test in Chicago.BYD’s AdvantagesWang regarded BYD’s battery technology as the backbone of the company’s EV development and an advantage against its competitors. He believed that the LIB was the future for EVs. On the strength of its LIB technology BYD kicked off its EV battery program in August 2002. In November 2006 the company showcased its ferrous battery-powered concept car at the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition. In October 2007 BYD succeeded in producing rechargeable ferrous EV batteries ahead of its Chinese competitors and launched the F6DM as its first hybrid EV powered by ferrous batteries.A lithium iron phosphate battery was a patented ferrous battery; however BYD maintained that the patent simply meant that lithium iron phosphate materials could be used to make batteries and thus it filed a utility patent. In early 2010 BYD began to mass produce ferrous batteries. In October of the same year BYD and Tibet Jinhao Investment Company Ltd. jointly acquired a 22 per cent stake in Tibet Shigatse Zhabuye Lithium High-Tech Co. Ltd. for lithium mineral exploration and refinement so as to secure the supply of raw materials.BYD embarked upon R&D on EVs in 2002 developing not only batteries but also motors and electronic control units in place of combustion engines and the peripheral technology used for gasoline-fuelled cars. In 2003 BYD and Tesla set about producing EVs at the same time although BYD sought to produce EVs to meet public needs while Tesla’s position was in a much smaller high-end segment. In February 2008 Tesla integrated external resources to launch the Roadster as its first EV; in December BYD delivered the F3DM to the market. BYD’s first DM vehicle was the F6DM but the F3DM reached the market first. Among the company’s gasoline-fuelled vehicles the F6 was positioned higher than the F3.By applying its vertical integration model to EV development BYD tried to secure the supply of both raw materials and technology in the upstream sector. Consequently BYD acquired Sino MOS Semiconductor (Ningbo) Inc. for ¥200 million in October 2008 for the R&D and production of EV motors. The company also established a horizontal integrated chain with its strong presence in photovoltaics light-emitting diodes and energy storage stations thus making an efficient two-direction supply between NEVs energy storage stations and solar energy plants. Further BYD’s organizational culture found expression in EV manufacturing and marketing as well. The company stuck to its worker–machine manufacturing mode and sold EVs in its dealer stores as it had with its gasoline-fuelled cars.Development and ChallengesPartnerships with Warren Buffett and Daimler AGIn September 2008 investment guru Warren Buffett announced he had acquired 10 per cent of BYD’s stock at HK$8.00 per share. Less than two years after the acquisition the price of BYD’s H-shares skyrocketed by a factor of 13.73 to HK$88.40. Since then Buffett and his partner Thomas Munger had supported BYD. In January 2009 Buffett appeared at the BYD stand at the Detroit Auto Show wearing BYD’s logo. In September 2010 when BYD’s auto sales had been declining for five consecutive months and dealers had backed out both Buffett and Munger attended the company’s town hall meeting in Shenzhen and Buffett offered a free dinner to thousands of BYD dealers. On the first day of Buffett’s arrival in Shenzhen BYD’s H-shares rose 4.25 per cent closing at HK$57.65 and Morgan Stanley raised the company’s stock rating from “neutral” to “overweight.” In addition to Warren Buffett BYD’s new energy business had attracted Daimler AG the German auto giant. In July 2010 BYD and Daimler AG founded a 50–50 joint venture with total registered capital of ¥600 million. The new venture would focus on China’s EV market and would operate on the basis of BYD’s battery and drive technology and Daimler AG’s leading whole-vehicle technology. In March 2012 the joint venture launched its NEV brand DENZA positioned as a premium brand. Since September 2014 DENZA PEVs had entered the markets in Shanghai Beijing and Shenzhen with a goal of selling 5000 units in 2015.ChallengesDespite an impressive performance in the EV market BYD found its profitability slightly disappointing. Net profit had decreased dramatically from 2010 to 2014 with 2013 being the only exception (in that year BYD’s year-on-year growth rate was 579.63 per cent) (see Exhibit 4). One reason for this exception was that the battery cellphone and regular auto businesses posted gross margin growth of 4.53 per cent 1.63 per cent and 0.07 per cent respectively in 2013; another reason lay in the government subsidies for NEVs which totalled ¥677 million. Finally net profits in all BYD’s businesses fell to an all-time low in 2012 which made growth in 2013 even more prominent. The poor profitability raised BYD’s expectations for an explosion in market demand for NEVs.How to Maintain Cost Advantage on the Battery Side?The battery made up 40 per cent of the cost of an EV; therefore a low-cost battery could give a vehicle a significant competitive edge in the market. BYD’s ferrous battery cost less than other EV batteries in both China and Japan but paled in comparison to Tesla’s battery. Tesla’s ternary EV battery cost US$416 per kWh (¥2554 per kWh) while BYD’s ferrous battery cost US$435 per kWh (¥2671 per kWh) in 2014. Moreover Tesla’s battery cost could be expected to drop by 30 per cent once annual production reached 500000 units. When a large number of companies took interest in Tesla’s ternary EV battery in 2014 Tesla opened up all its related patents to EV manufacturers around the world. Naturally most Chinese NEV makers (including JAC Chery BAIC and Zotye) declared that they would use Tesla’s ternary battery rather than BYD’s ferrous battery further trimming Tesla’s battery costs. How to Win in the Private Vehicle Market?BYD’s Qin was a leading PHEV in the private vehicle market. With subsidies of ¥70000 from the central and local governments the vehicle’s lowest sale price was ¥119800. Around 70 per cent of the Qin’s sales came from Shanghai in 2014 where the Qin was among the NEVs entitled to financial subsidies and other incentives from the Shanghai government. In addition Shanghai offered the bonus of a free licence plate for NEVs. Since the vehicle licence auction policy was implemented in Shanghai in 1994 car buyers had faced increasing difficulties in affording licence plates. In July 2014 the hammer price of a licence plate in Shanghai hit ¥74000 with a success rate of no more than 5.44 per cent. Some buyers bought the Qin simply to obtain the free licence plate but most bought the car to use as a traditional vehicle. Contrary to its popularity in Shanghai the Qin was greeted with a cold response in Beijing because it was not on Beijing’s list of NEVs eligible for government subsidies. Without those subsidies or incentives (particularly the free licence plate) how could the Qin sustain its popularity? How to Shift from DM EVs to PEVs?BYD had stated that DM PHEVs only provided a springboard for PEVs. However in shifting from DM to purely electric vehicles BYD would face considerable challenges not only in the availability of charging facilities but also in terms of battery range. A fully charged BYD Qin could run 70 km far below the 300-km threshold for commercialization. In contrast the Tesla Roadster’s battery range had reached 480 km and the company was attempting to extend its battery life through software optimization. With only 10 years left for BYD to realize its goal of becoming a global auto leader by 2025 how could BYD make it?Exhibit 1: BYD’s Number of Annual New Patent Applications Over the Past 10 YearsSource: Patent Search and Analysis of SIPO accessed March 7 2017 http://pss-system.gov.cn.Exhibit 2: Roadmap of BYD’s Vehicle ModelsF3—BYD’s first A+ class passenger car launched April 16 2005F3R—BYD’s first A class compact car launched July 2007F6—BYD’s first mid-size sedan launched March 2008F0—A one-litre mini-car launched September 2008F3DM—BYD’s first dual-mode electric vehicle launched December 2008S8—BYD’s first entry-level sports car launched July 2009M6—BYD’s first multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) launched July 2010S6—BYD’s first sports utility vehicle (SUV) launched May 2011Qin—BYD’s second-generation dual-mode electric vehicle launched December 2013e6—A purely electric crossover based on the SUV and MPV launched March 12 2014S7—An SUV launched October 2014 Source: BYD accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/BYDEnglish/index.jsp.Exhibit 3: Major Players in China’s Electric vehicle MarketSource: “Changan Launched 9 NEVs During 2 Years” [in Mandarin] Info Agency July 13 2015 accessed August 1 2015 http://auto.sohu.com/20150713/n416661918.shtml; “Chery Launched Two NEVs” Anhuinews.com November 8 2014 accessed March 22 2015 http://ah.anhuinews.com/system/2014/11/08/006592301.shtml; “Dongfeng Nissan Produced Its First NEV” [in Mandarin] EnergyTrend September 12 2014 accessed March 22 2015 www.energytrend.cn/news/20140912-9585.html.Exhibit 4: Net Profit of BYD (2010–2014) Source: BYD Go with Green: Annual Report 2010 accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/byd/upload/2010-01/2010%E5%B9%B4%E5%B9%B4%E6%8A%A5.pdf; BYD Catching the Eye on Green Stage: Annual Report 2011 accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/byd/upload/2010-01/20120325-2011%E5%B9%B4%E5%A0%B1.pdf; BYD Energy 100% Clearing through Our Way: Annual Report 2012 accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/byd/upload/2010-01/20130324-2012%E5%B9%B4%E5%B9%B4%E6%8A%A5%EF%BC%88H%E8%82%A1%EF%BC%89BYD.pdf; BYD Gearing Up for Our Future: 2013 Annual Report accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/byd/upload/2010-01/20140429-%E6%AF%94%E4%BA%9A%E8%BF%AA%E8%82%A1%E4%BB%BD%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%202013%E5%B9%B4%E5%B9%B4%E6%8A%A5.pdf; BYD Promote Green Practice Theory: 2014 Annual Report accessed March 7 2017 www.byd.cn/byd/upload/2015-03/2015032911115431738598782.pdf.

(Meakin Industrial) and Meakin Farms Inc. (Meakin Farms). While both organizations remained viable he wondered what he should do for 2017 and beyond given the unique structure of the businesses and the vast uncertainty of the agricultural industry. Should he remain at the 2016 farm size of 3200 seeded acres (1295 hectares) or go back up to approximately 4000 acres (1620 hectares) as he had farmed in 2015? What should he do with the trucking business—expand contract or maintain the current levels of business? Could he expand both operations or would he need to have a contraction in one to enable an expansion in the other? What were the risks and benefits of the changing business environment and how would they influence his decision? MEAKIN ENTERPRISES: COMPANY HISTORYAs a child Meakin had spent many days with his grandparents on the family farm near Langham Saskatchewan. Like many children when Meakin graduated from high school he was encouraged to attend university and develop a career away from the farm. He followed this advice and earned an engineering degree in 1998 and went to work for a farm implement manufacturer in Regina Saskatchewan some 300 kilometres away from the family farm.Although Meakin had a successful and fulfilling career as an engineer farming remained his passion. By 2004 when Meakin had chosen to return to Langham to embark on a career in farming the family farm had already been sold as land prices had been favourable and no successor had been identified. Meakin was left with the unenviable task of starting a farming operation from scratch. In 2005 Meakin started his farming operation Meakin Farms by purchasing one quarter section (160 acres or 65 hectares) of land from his grandmother and supplementing the owned acreage with rented land. Through the years Meakin gradually bought more land and rented additional land to increase the land base. The farm size peaked in 2015 at 3840 acres (1554 hectares). While growing the farm Meakin employed a true entrepreneurial approach and used his professional engineering skills to be of service to other farmers in equipment modifications servicing repairs and grain hauling. In this way he gained farming skills while creating income and cash flow to expand his own farming operation. This farm service income led to the creation of Meakin Industrial which grew into a trucking operation for the hauling of grain bins grain seed and fertilizer with annual revenues of more than CA$250000 by 2016. THE Agriculture IndustryThe Supply Chain: Sourcing InputsThe size and structure of the agriculture industry had seen significant change in recent decades: the total number of Saskatchewan farms had decreased from 63431 in 1986 to 36952 in 2011 and a further decrease was evident. The average farm size had grown substantially from 1036 acres (419 hectares) in 1986 to 1668 acres (675 hectares) in 2011 with many active farming operations managing 5000 acres (2023 hectares) or more. The thousands of Saskatchewan farmers typically purchased their crop inputs such as seed fertilizer and chemicals from numerous independent retailers across the province. Large multinational agrochemical and biotechnology companies such as Monsanto Bayer Inc. Syngenta Canada Inc. DuPont BASF SE and Dow AgroSciences LLC supplied many of these inputs to the retailers. Farmers were free to choose their retailer of choice and to seek a low-cost provider but price differences between retailers were negligible and many sought to create relationships with their local retailer in an effort not only to reduce transport distances but also more importantly to gain access to new products application methods and farming techniques. As with the farms themselves much of the production and retailing of agricultural inputs had been consolidated. For example many of the input retailers had other regionally affiliated stores and the large inland grain terminals that historically handled grain were increasingly adding input sales to their product and service mix. Furthermore fertilizer and fuel markets two crucial inputs had seen vast price variability in recent years given the changing microeconomic factors. As a result of this supply chain the farmer had become very much a price-taker with many of the crop inputs having volatile prices. The prices of the crop inputs supplied to the farmer varied due to not only the changing commodity prices of the inputs but also crop selection. Of the main inputs of seed fertilizer and chemicals the highest input cost was most often fertilizer. In crop selection the farmer faced difficult investment decisions; for example while canola traditionally realized a higher selling price than wheat the required seed fertilizer and chemicals costs were also greater for canola.From Field to PlateThe marketing of commodities was a vital skill not often associated with farming. Farmers aimed to be low-cost producers but also needed to maximize their profitability in commodity sales where prices were largely determined by global supply and demand. Many modern farmers were skilled in marketing commodities as crops such as canola peas and lentils had been traded in an open market system for decades. The marketing of wheat and barley however had recently changed with the dismantling of the Canadian Wheat Board marketing agency in 2012 which paved the way for a free market system that allowed farmers to capitalize on market opportunities but also exposed them to risks. Many farmers argued that the Canadian Wheat Board’s monopolistic system had limited sales and subsequent price opportunities while others felt that the pooling system had offered the best returns for their commodities. Farmers often attempted to reduce production risks and “lock in” prices by forward contracting a specified amount of crop at a minimum quality level and specified price. These contracts could be made using intermediary brokerage agents or directly with distribution processors and terminals. In practice forward contracting was a useful risk management tool but if discrepancies arose the agreements could be difficult for individual farmers to enforce with larger processors. Determining the grade of commodities was not an exact science particularly given the volume of product handled by both farmers and processors. Farmers were always seeking to produce and market the highest-grade commodities possible to capitalize on their price potential while processing and distribution intermediaries were trying to realistically assess the grades. Disagreements existed. Fluctuations in production both locally and internationally led to a wide variation in the price per bushel of crops produced (see Exhibit 1).As was the case with the production and marketing of all commodities differentiation of the final product was difficult. Farmers regularly sought means to make their products more appealing to processing intermediaries and final consumers alike. Some means of differentiation included attaining premium-grade quality crops or producing new crops and crop varieties that had characteristics desired by consumers. The organic movement which had resonated with end-consumers in recent years could yield price premiums for producers but much misinformation persisted and many farmers questioned the profitability and land use of organic production. Upon completion of harvest farmers delivered their commodities to several inland terminals and processors. Some farmer-owned co-operatives and independent intermediaries existed particularly in the processing of pulse crops such as peas and lentils but much of the processing capacity was also held by a few large multinational agriculture corporations such as Cargill Inc. and Viterra Inc. many of which also supplied the inputs and agronomy services used by farmers. The iconic image of the small-town prairie grain elevator had all but disappeared to make way for more modern and efficient grain terminals. These large terminals were strategically located in the province to reduce the rail infrastructure needed to move the commodities to shipping ports in Vancouver Churchill Thunder Bay and the St. Lawrence River. The consolidation of the inland terminals meant that more grain was transported from country farms to terminals via roadways with truck and trailer. The rail system was an oligopoly dominated by the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway and the scheduling of grain cars could be problematic resulting in the terminals becoming filled to capacity and forcing farmers to invest in grain storage while also straining their cash flow.The final market for commodities varied from year to year and new markets were emerging. While some of the canola was used locally in crushing plants to create canola oil and meal Canada exported approximately 90 per cent of the canola produced nationwide. Key canola markets included the United States Mexico and the European Union for biodiesel development and China and Japan for edible oil. Peas were generally used for human consumption in regions such as India Bangladesh and China. Wheat was Canada’s most significant grain export to some major import markets in the Western Hemisphere (United States Mexico Colombia and Peru) Europe Asia (Indonesia China and Bangladesh) and Africa (Nigeria). Weather and PestsA number of exogenous variables influenced agriculture but perhaps none was more impactful than weather conditions. Producers needed to regularly contend with weather-related factors such as excessive rain or drought damaging winds hail and extremes in temperature (heat and frost). Farmers attempted to mitigate weather risks through insurance crop rotation production contracts and plant varieties but uncertainty persisted. Furthermore some scientists and interest groups were concerned that weather conditions were becoming unpredictable given the influence of global climate change. In addition to weather variables farmers needed to regularly monitor and control yield-robbing pest pressures in the form of weeds disease fungi and insects. Modern producers had long relied on herbicides and pesticides as effective means to control these pests. The use of herbicides had increased in recent years as farmers adopted a “zero-till” approach in an effort to capitalize on valuable soil moisture and nutrients that traditional tillage methods released into the atmosphere. Modern herbicides were much more effective in controlling pests and led to fewer health and safety concerns; still some interest groups were concerned about herbicides’ long-term ecological impacts. The impact of weather and pests resulted in variations in production yields (see Exhibit 2).The Increasing Value of Farm LandOne of the greatest challenges affecting the viability of modern farms was the immense capital expenditure necessary to maintain an appropriate land base to contend with the ever-growing size of competing farms. Land prices had increased significantly in the past decade (see Exhibit 3). Although high land prices were a welcome sight for retiring farmers looking to sell their land the prices were prohibitive for those looking to start or expand. Land prices varied significantly from province to province and from region to region within each province. Numerous factors influenced land prices including farmers’ crop income and cash position the health of the land as a result of historical farming practices the land’s proneness to drought or flooding tree coverage oil or natural gas wells on the property proximity to urban centres foreign investment and competitive pressures from expanding farms. Farm Credit Canada noted that numerous profitable growing seasons and limited available land as a result of expanding farms and family succession had resulted in high demand for land. Purchase prices varied from as low as $1000 per acre ($405 per hectare) to well over $2500 per acre ($1012 per hectare) given some of the aforementioned influences. Lease rates were similarly volatile and varied with rates as low as $40 per acre ($16 per hectare) to upwards of $100 per acre ($40 per hectare) in certain regions. The “lease versus buy” debate was a common discussion among farmers. Purchasing land enabled the upside potential of capital appreciation but required either an extensive cash investment or financing. Furthermore land prices had been rising for several years and some industry insiders wondered whether prices would begin to level out or even decline in the near future. Inclement weather or low commodity prices or both could further strain land prices at any time. Leasing land reduced some of the risks of land purchases but limited capital appreciation and determining lease rates could be challenging for both farmers and landlords. Securing leased land for periods of more than five years at a time was an uncommon practice and many farm operations had seen their leased acreage fluctuate from year to year making equipment investments difficult. When making land acquisitions the price was only one factor. Farmers also needed to assess the location and quality of the land the timing of expansion their financial situation the market situation and finally the business’s short- and long-term goals. Skilled Labour in Short SupplyThe availability of skilled labour posed constraints for many farms. In past decades many farms were family-run operations where multiple generations would come together to bring in their own harvest and that of their neighbours. The dynamics were changing as children were often encouraged to pursue post-secondary education and many did not return to the farm. The average age of farmers in Saskatchewan had increased from 50.5 in 2001 to 54.2 in 2011. Families were getting smaller and farms were getting larger relying more on large-scale technology to replace the once historic abundance of labour. The jobs that remained were challenging to fill as they required a combination of skills that weren’t always available: the agribusiness management necessary to execute a successful growing season and the technical skills of operating modern farm equipment. The seasonal nature of the business further exacerbated the problem and drove many prospective farm workers in rural areas into oil and gas jobs while farms close to the urban centres always contended with the draw of city opportunities. Even the grandparents and retired neighbours that were once relied on as seasonal help were less relevant as a labour pool given the complex nature of modern farm equipment. Operating a modern combine was more akin to flying an aircraft than driving a car. Many farm owners also maintained off-farm occupations to help alleviate the ever-present risk of a crop failure and cash flow concerns. The Crisis of Cash FlowA significant risk for a farming operation was managing cash flows. While most businesses had working capital requirements for inventory and receivables the working capital typically turned into cash inflows in a matter of a few months. In farming the lead times from the cash outflows such as crop inputs the interest and principal on the financing of land and machinery fuel wages and insurance preceded the cash inflows from crop sales by many months and sometimes by more than a year. As almost all of the farm’s cash outflows were expended before the crop was harvested and ultimately sold the economic effects of a crop failure were particularly acute. While other businesses could potentially avoid variable expenses if the revenue did not materialize farmers had already incurred all of their fixed and variable expenses before any revenue was realized. Thus any reduction in revenue due to crop failure or low commodity prices directly affected the operating earnings of the farm operation with little or no reduction of expenses. The Trucking Industry Bin HaulingThe demand for on-site grain bins had increased in the past decade as a result of the growing size of farm operations and the distance of the farms to grain terminals. Grain bins varied in length and diameter; the larger bins were up to 32 feet (9.8 metres) long and had a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). Bin delivery required the use of a pilot truck (the largest bins require two pilot trucks) to precede the truck that was hauling the bin to warn of the large load approaching on the highway. Bin hauling required specialized trailers that enabled the large round grain storage bins to be delivered to a farm fully assembled (see Exhibit 4). The trailers utilized a hydraulic lift system to transport the grain bins in a horizontal position. Once at their delivered destination the trailers were able to place the bins in a specific location in a vertical position. The hauling of bins required permits from the Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries obtaining permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck.The peak period for bin hauling occurred from August to October which coincided with the harvest period and the increased need for grain storage.Grain Seed and Fertilizer HaulingGrain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the grain terminals. As the distance of the farms to grain terminals increased larger trailers were utilized to haul grain. Grain and fertilizer could be delivered using a “Super B Train” trailer that could haul a payload of up to 46.5 tons (42.2 tonnes or approximately 1700 bushels of wheat) depending on road conditions (see Exhibit 5). Fertilizer was particularly corrosive to trailers and could increase both depreciation and the costs associated with maintaining safety for insurance. Some trucking companies maintained special trailers to haul corrosive fertilizer or used smaller grain trailers to access farmyards and gravel roads when spring season weight restrictions were in effect.Chemical HaulingHauling chemicals and other goods required a flat-deck trailer which was the least complex and least expensive of the three trailers but was very useful in a variety of applications. The driver needed to attain hazardous goods training to haul chemicals. The Impact of WeatherWeather had a profound effect on the profitability of both the farming operation and the trucking operation. The excessive rain drought winds and hail that resulted in lower crop yields could also lower the demand for grain bins and grain hauling and could make deliveries challenging. Skilled Labour Still a ConcernTo drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries a driver needed a Class 1 licence which required oral or written knowledge tests for Class 1 vehicles and a road test in a Class 1 vehicle. A pre-trip inspection known as a circle check needed to be demonstrated at the time of the road test. Drivers possessing this licence were in high demand particularly during peak delivery seasons. Drivers typically sought to own and operate their own trucks and trailers often under the umbrella of a larger established trucking company. Maintaining loyal long-standing employees was often a challenge as competitors could entice drivers away by offering higher wages. Drivers could be paid hourly or by piece rate by the tonnage hauled while some farm employees received a salary and operated a truck and trailer as part of their farming duties. One of the challenges in the hauling business was employing drivers over a cyclical year where demand fluctuated from season to season and even from month to month. The scheduling of deliveries could also be complicated as trucking companies sought to link deliveries and make use of “back hauls” to avoid empty miles on the road. Scheduling needs increased commensurately with deliveries. COMPANY OPERATIONSFarming OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Farms for the three-year period 2014–2016 is provided in Exhibit 6.Land: Lease or Buy?Meakin was in the unique and challenging position of trying to start a farm from scratch and the increasing prices were both a benefit and a curse. He was able to further leverage more financing as a result of the capital appreciation of his existing land but was limited in his ability to lease or buy more land given the high prices. The number of seeded acres farmed had fluctuated from 2014 to 2016 as Meakin Farms changed the proportion of land leased and owned (see Exhibit 7).The 2016 reduction in acreage was the result of Meakin not having renewed a lease on 800 acres (324 hectares) of land due to the high lease rate of $62 per acre ($25 per hectare). Meakin Farms had incurred rental rates ranging from $45 to $62 per acre ($18 to $25 per hectare) over the past three years. It was likely that additional farmland could be leased at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) in the near term. In 2017 the company purchased two additional quarters of previously rented land (320 acres or 130 hectares) which brought the total land owned up to 1200 acres (486 hectares).Crop ChoicesAs with most farms Meakin Farms produced a variety of crops—namely canola wheat and field peas. The choice of one crop over another was not merely based on the highest price commodity. The farming practices for each commodity differed. For example canola which was often the highest priced commodity required more fertilizer than wheat. In addition the harvesting of canola was a two-step process of first knocking down the crop into swaths and then picking up the crop with a combine; thus requiring two passes in the field incurring the twice the costs in equipment fuel and labour as wheat and peas which when “straight cut” harvested required only one pass. Field peas were beneficial to soil health by fixing nitrogen and making it more available to crops planted in subsequent years. A healthy crop rotation of seeding different crops from year to year on the same land also helped to reduce the impact of diseases weeds and pests. During the past three years Meakin Farms had shifted away from wheat and towards canola (see Exhibit 8). Equipment UtilizationMeakin Farms used older farm equipment that was stretched to the limit in farming more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) in 2015 and was underutilized in 2016 as yields were down due to hail damage on 640 acres (259 hectares) of land. If the farm size were to return to more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) it would likely need a further investment of $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment. Human Resources: Daved Meakin as a Key to Success The availability of farm labour could be problematic. The need for the farm labour was seasonal yet the responsibilities of the labour when operating complex equipment were great. Like most farm operations Meakin relied on both seasonal farm labour and family. For example Meakin’s spouse Nicole a chartered professional accountant who had an off-farm career often pitched in to operate the combines during the peak harvest season. In addition Meakin’s management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. Unfortunately the busy bin-hauling component of the trucking operation often coincided with the harvest season of the farm. Meakin was clearly pivotal to the success of the business because of his time relationships and expertise which drove the organization. Farming was also one of Saskatchewan’s most hazardous industries with an average of 13 people killed each year and many others injured. In the unfortunate event of his injury or death the company operations would most certainly fail. As with many busy managers and entrepreneurs Meakin also wanted balance his obligations of work and life with his personal interests and family being key priorities. Financing with Long-Term DebtFarmland and equipment were financed with long-term debt. As a farming operation that did not benefit from a land-base inheritance Meakin Farms was highly leveraged with 75 per cent of the land and equipment financed. In addition the costs of crop inputs for seed fertilizer and chemicals which ranged between $110 and $130 per acre ($45 and $53 per hectare) needed to be financed until the resulting crop was harvested and sold. The costs of fuel wages insurance and repairs ranging from $25–$35 per acre ($10–$14 per hectare) along with the long-term debt servicing also required cash outflow before the crop was sold. This situation resulted in high levels of operating lines of credit and bank indebtedness.The Trucking OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Industrial for the three-year period 2014–2016 is provided in Exhibit 9.Types of Hauling Bin Hauling: The trucking operation Meakin Industrial began in 2013. The genesis of this business was to primarily service the delivery needs of two large industrial bin manufacturers for Central Saskatchewan. The bin manufacturers typically outsourced the delivery of grain bins to private operators such as Meakin Industrial. The grain bins varied in length and diameter with Meakin Industrial’s current equipment able to transport bins up to 32 feet (10 metres) long and with a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). In 2014 Meakin Industrial had contracts with two large bin manufacturers which resulted in revenues of more than $150000. In 2015 Meakin Industrial lost one of the contracts with a major bin manufacturer to a competitor that undercut the delivery charges. The bin hauling remained strong in 2015 albeit only for one of two bin manufacturers due to a need for on-farm grain storage because of a backlog of rail car grain deliveries. In 2016 the demand for bin hauling declined due to some hail damage in the area during the 2016 growing season.Grain Hauling: Grain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the inland processing terminals. Meakin Industrial provided this service to 10–15 farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. When one of the contracts for grain bins was not renewed in 2015 Meakin set out to expand the grain-hauling portion of the business. Meakin Farms was also able to reduce its own grain delivery costs by utilizing the services and equipment of Meakin Industrial.Seed Fertilizer and Chemical Hauling: During the spring seeding season Meakin Industrial was busy hauling seed fertilizer and chemicals to farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. A unique flatbed trailer was needed to haul chemicals and the driver needed to have attained hazardous goods training.Human Resources: Time in Short SupplyAs a result of the seasonality of the hauling business Meakin Industrial faced similar challenges to the farming operation in terms of the availability of skilled employees. As noted earlier to drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries required a Class 1 licence. In addition drivers who hauled chemicals required hazardous goods training. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck for bin hauling.Meakin’s management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. The hauling of bins required permits from the provincial Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries securing permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Financing with More DebtThe cost of financing equipment for the trucking operation was relatively high with interest rates usually at 8 per cent. All of the trucks were owned and financed with bank debt while most of the trailers were leased on five-year terms.Word-of-Mouth MarketingMarketing for Meakin Industrial was mainly done through word of mouth. The contracts with bin manufacturers were secured through direct marketing by personal contact from Meakin. All trucks were marked as “Meakin Industrial Ag” to facilitate name recognition when the trucks were delivering products on the highways. THE FUTUREIn January 2017 Meakin Farms purchased an additional 320 acres (130 hectares) of farm land that it had previously rented for $260000; 75 per cent of the cost was financed at a mortgage rate of 4 per cent. As Meakin contemplated his future plans he received a letter notifying him of the opportunity to lease an additional 960 acres (389 hectares) of government-owned farmland at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) which coincided with the rate he was currently paying for other rented land. Just as he began to prepare projections for an expanded farm size he received a text message from the large industrial bin manufacturer that had previously opted for another contractor in 2015. It was dissatisfied with the service from Meakin’s competitor and wanted him to handle the contract moving forward and offered a 5 per cent price increase for his services. Meakin’s excitement for the new opportunities was short-lived when he recalled that in 2016 he had been overloaded with management responsibilities. The demands on his time and the need for hired labour which was difficult to find were at a maximum. In addition the farm’s poor financial results in 2016 as a result of hail damage and the additional financing of the 2017 land purchase would leave little financing capacity to expand his farming and trucking equipment.Meakin quickly realized that the constraints of management time labour and financing would result in some difficult choices. He could choose one of following three options for 2017:Option 1: Maintain the current levels of business. Keep the farm size at 3200 acres (1295 hectares) (substituting the 320 additional owned acres [130 hectares] for rented acres) and keep the trucking business the same size thereby forgoing both the land lease and the bin-hauling opportunities.Option 2: Expand the farm to 4160 acres (1684 hectares) and reduce the trucking business. Meakin did not have the management time and needed labour resources to both increase the farm size and maintain the trucking operation. Given the similarity in peak seasons the bin hauling would need to be eliminated if Meakin were to expand the farm. He would need to invest $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment to expand the farm size of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing bin-hauling trailers for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needed for the farm expansion.Option 3: Reduce the farm to 2240 acres (907 hectares) and expand the trucking business. Due to the constraints of management time and labour resources Meakin could not both increase the trucking operation and maintain the farm size. He would need to invest $100000 in bin-hauling trailers and pilot trucks to service the new bin-hauling contract of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing seeding and harvesting equipment for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needs for the trucking expansion.EXHIBIT 1: CANOLA WHEAT AND FIELD PEAS CROP PRICES 2014–2016 (in Canadian DOLLARS PER BUSHEL)Note: 1 bushel

By 2008 ECCA’s two runways required an estimated CA$10 million in capital upgrades and $35 million in additional maintenance costs over the next 10 years. In light of these facts city council had begun to consider whether maintaining ECCA was feasible or if other alternatives would put the land to better use.If ECCA closed city council foresaw multiple prospective uses for the land. For instance Edmonton was experiencing an exponential population growth rate and an anticipated need to supply additional housing for 150000 citizens by 2019 (see Exhibit 2). This population increase would further support trending suburban development which presented a significant financial concern; for every $1 spent on suburban development the City of Edmonton had to invest an estimated $0.80 towards the development of corresponding infrastructure. These combined factors made the 536-acre ECCA land a hot topic citywide and a main focus for city council.In November 2011 city council asked Mark Hall City of Edmonton Land Director to explore various opportunities for the land. The alternatives available for consideration were maintaining ECCA and the status quo by completing the necessary repairs; selling the property to a real estate developer thereby generating immediate revenue for other City of Edmonton projects; or closing ECCA and the City of Edmonton would act as the land developer for a community project.KEY STAKEHOLDERSEdmonton City CouncilAt the time of the ECCA decision-making process Steven Mandel was approaching his last term as the mayor of Edmonton. City of Edmonton’s Land Director Mark HallHall had worked for the City of Edmonton in diverse roles over many years. At the time of the ECCA dilemma he served in the corporate properties branch and was thus aware of ECCA discussions and debates. With Hall’s assistance the city councillors hoped to find a clear and sustainable solution to the challenges presented by ECCA.HISTORY OF EDMONTON CITY CENTRE AIRPORT (ECCA)Throughout its 80-year history ECCA had held as many names as it had roles: The Hagmann Farm Jimmy Bell’s Air Harbour Blatchford Field #2 Air Observer School Royal Canadian Air Force Western Air Command Industrial Airport and Municipal Airport. In 1926 the Edmonton and Northern Alberta Aero Club received a $400 grant to transform a patch of farmland into a runway by cutting down willow bushes and packing down soil. Officially declared an “Air Harbour” this site saw the first trained pilots graduate from the site in 1927. Two years later Edmonton’s city council authorized $35000 of expenditures for the airfield and Blatchford Field was born. Named after Keith Alexander (“Kenny”) Blatchford who was mayor of Edmonton from 1924 to 1926 and later a member of parliament Blatchford Field became Canada’s first licensed airfield.During the next 35 years the airport played an important role in commercial and military aviation serving not only the Edmonton region but also destinations within Canada and the United States. In the 1950s however a new generation of larger aircraft required longer runways which a space-confined ECCA could not accommodate. Thus the search began for another airfield site in the Edmonton region. The airport was supposed to be closed in 1963 when EIA was completed. However due to active political opposition based on the ECCA’s historical importance and the value that it held in being located near to downtown the airfield was saved. The airfield operated under different names and mandates with perhaps one of the most important mandates being its role in providing MedEvac services. In 1995 the citizens of Edmonton voted 77 per cent in favour of consolidating scheduled air traffic at EIA and keeping ECCA open to general and corporate traffic. HISTORY OF EDMONTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTPrior to 1955 Edmonton’s primary aviation hub was the airfield north of downtown ECCA which housed a flight school and a military airfield. As Edmonton grew however and because industrial and residential neighbourhoods hemmed in ECCA the city required more land to house a larger-scale airport. By 1955 it was obvious that ECCA was inadequate for the innovative jet airliners which would need two-mile runways and spacious terminals to accommodate over 100 passengers with each flight. A site for EIA was selected near Nisku Alberta and Transport Canada purchased 7600 acres of land for a total cost of $1469657. With an unwritten “gentleman’s agreement” the original landowners were allowed to lease back and continue to farm the land until it was needed for further development of the airport. EIA remained Canada’s largest airport in land area with more than half of its land still under cultivation.EIA had always competed with ECCA. EIA advocates had long desired to expand its network of international destinations. However because of the success and profitability of ECCA in creating convenient business air travel in downtown Edmonton Canadian authorities refused EIA’s expansion due to insufficient revenues and a lack of clear growth strategies. ECCA’s niche market was in direct competition with EIA’s regional travel options and growth plans which led to an enduring dispute between EIA and ECCA.In 1995 however there was overwhelming public support to close ECCA. Fuelled by this public support EIA began the development of a $450 million construction project to upgrade its facilities in anticipation of what it perceived as the inevitable shutdown of ECCA. Expansion plans for the airport included a new terminal for international flights a new site for Air Canada a repurposing of the existing Air Canada terminal for WestJet Airlines Ltd. to accommodate the rapid growth of its regional travel program additional security and screening infrastructure and a new cargo management facility.Although air travel at EIA decreased significantly between the late 1980s and the early 1990s demand increased in the late 1990s. Despite having been constructed to support 2.8 million passengers EIA was actually accommodating nearly 3.8 million passengers. This imposed urgency for the completion of the expansion project. In 2009 EIA anticipated that it was only a matter of time until city council voted to shut down ECCA. The shutdown would require EIA to absorb the entirety of Edmonton’s regional business travel further justifying EIA’s expansion for international travel and large facility upgrades.EDMONTON’S LAND DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRYAt the same time that news travelled about ECCA’s necessary renovation costs and its potential closure land developers had also anticipated Edmonton’s next great real estate opportunity. Following the financial crisis of 2008 a lengthy recession depressed the real estate market into a difficult period marked by value losses increased foreclosures and reduced rental property revenues. The economic downturn combined with an opportunity to develop over 500 acres of land near the downtown core provided land developers with the potential for a large-scale project that could infuse citizens with optimism for the future. With the anticipated first wave of millennials entering the workforce industry experts were predicting a flood of young adults into the city core to live closer to work and to enjoy their preferred downtown lifestyle.It was rumoured that key stakeholders in Edmonton land development including Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. Yorkton Group International Inc. and Melcor Developments Ltd. were submitting large proposals to the City of Edmonton to purchase the entire ECCA land site for redevelopment purposes. One land developer in particular The Katz Group was well known for innovative large-scale projects. Therefore selling the land was a viable proposition for city council to consider.The Katz Group headquartered in Edmonton was one of Canada’s largest privately owned enterprises. As well as being a successful real estate and land developer also owned diverse businesses including pharmacies and sports and entertainment facilities. Founder and chairman Daryl Katz was a well-known and well-liked local celebrity. The Katz family had made its first fortune in the pharmacy industry owning and operating over 475 drugstore locations across central and western Canada. The Katz Group also owned the city’s National Hockey League (NHL) team the Edmonton Oilers. With Edmonton being home to the third-oldest arena in the NHL Katz had also planned to build a new arena in the downtown core. With a vision to create a legacy in Edmonton and with plans to rebuild the downtown core and make the city an international icon Katz was an ideal candidate to undertake a major land development project like ECCA.SWEDISH SUSTAINABILITY MODELIn other parts of the world sustainability had been explored with different models of implementation and with differing degrees of success over the years. Sweden a globally acclaimed proponent of sustainable land development was one such example. Following Sweden’s economic boom in the 1990s a strong demand for housing led to a strategy to build inwards rather than outwards. The innovative Scandinavian country thus raised the bar for northern-climate cities with large-scale redevelopments and integrated approaches to harvesting and reusing resources. If successfully completed these ambitious commitments to produce local renewable energy and to reduce energy consumption would produce leading-edge communities that would attract international visitors eager to witness the ground-breaking sustainable initiatives first-hand.Sweden completed the first phase of a 395-acre redevelopment of a harbour-front brownfield site in the city of Malmö. Västra Hamnen (“Western Harbour”) an industrial waterfront zone was planned to be fully redeveloped to house 10000 residents and to support a total of 30000 people who would either work or study in the area. The urban development plan included a large expansion of Malmö University featured a seaside park and hosted a mobility centre that offered bicycle parking and bio-fuelled cars. Outdoor energy-efficient lighting and accessible public transportation encouraged people to walk and enjoy the boardwalk and public artworks. The area was intended to become Europe’s first carbon-neutral district and to serve as a global example of a sustainable city. Thus Västra Hamnen also became known as “The City of Tomorrow.”Developers submitted bids to the city of Malmö and of the many applicants more than 20 were chosen to build in Västra Hamnen. Selection was based on contractors’ abilities to meet the goals of the large-scale project: sustainable housing powered by renewable energy attractive and affordable housing and a revitalized brownfield site for economic growth. The successful candidates signed The Quality Programme which listed contract guidelines for building with minimal environmental impact.The housing plan was dense (approximately 20 units per acre) and strategically placed to maximize efficiency. High-rises along the shoreline formed a wind shelter around smaller blocks and courtyards. Most units featured windows and mirrors predominantly as a way to maximize the use of natural light and passive solar energy. Natural materials and energy-efficient or water-saving appliances were also emphasized. Green rooftops captured rainwater for gardens and insulation and rooftop solar panels were used to heat the buildings and provide electricity to the district system.Ecologically the development included a local district energy system powered entirely by renewable energy sources—a combination of wind solar heat from seawater and biogas. Electricity was generated by solar and wind energy and hot-water heating was sourced from seawater and solar energy. Buildings were heated and cooled by an aquifer energy storage system that stored heat extracted from seawater. In the summer warm water filled cavities in the limestone underground and cold stored water was pumped up for usage in the district cooling system. In winter a heat pump increased the water temperature. A geothermal system was used to heat and cool the water.The automated waste system had separate receptacles for garbage organic waste and recyclables that connected to an underground pipeline system. Receptacles both inside buildings and outdoors sucked these through an underground pipeline system that ended at a central storage area for municipal waste truck pickup. At the time waste materials were composted but plans for a pre-treatment plant included turning organic waste into biogas to generate electricity and vehicle fuel. However at the time of the project development costs were much higher than anticipated due to the new technologies to meet these high standards and the slowdown in the housing market. Consequently the development’s estimated rental costs were $2000 per month for a 1000-square-foot unit compared with $1500 for similarly sized units elsewhere. Offsetting the price difference at least partially was an expectation of 25 per cent lower energy costs in addition to longer building lifespans expected to support higher resale values. FINANCIAL BACKGROUNDThe City of Edmonton located in oil-rich Alberta depended on the strength of the oil market for a significant portion of its economy. At the time of the ECCA decision a financial recession in the United States had dropped the price of oil from a record peak of $147.27 per barrel in July 2008 to less than $60 per barrel in subsequent months leaving the future of Alberta’s oil revenues in a highly uncertain state. For its capital budget the City of Edmonton was dependent on both provincial grants and property tax revenues that were tied to the real estate market and the economy. While most Canadian cities including Edmonton had survived prior shocks to the real estate market the job market and local economy were forecast not to remain resilient if oil prices remained depressed.Financial Comparison of AlternativesCity council faced several financial implications regarding what to do with the large area of prime ECCA land located near downtown Edmonton. Upholding the status quo and maintaining ECCA operations was an attractive option because the city would not be placed in a controversial situation. However maintaining ECCA would come at a steep cost because the city would need to invest tens of millions of capital dollars in the infrastructure over the next few years. Additionally opportunity costs were associated with keeping the airport operational particularly because downtown buildings were restricted in height due to the Airport Protection Overlay a set of regulations that constricted downtown development. Furthermore ECCA was operating a breakeven cost model and was not expected to ever become profitable given its small and restricted scale.The prospect of closing the airport left the city with two primary options: to sell or to develop the land. An immediate sale of the land was expected to generate approximately $250 million. Moreover interested buyers who were more than qualified as potential developers had unofficially approached various councillors and administrators. Therefore the city could plan the sale of the land dispose of the land systematically in a short period of time and expect revenue all within a short timeframe of a year or two. Given the uncertain economic environment in 2011 such a significant cash flow would bolster the city treasury or be used for other much-needed projects that had been postponed due to a lack of financing.A third option existed which was a staged development of the land that would provide residences for over 30000 people. This option however required a significant cash outlay upfront. The cash inflows from sales were expected to occur over 20 to 25 years in an effort by the city to avoid flooding the local market with homes. The investment option would thus be long-term and the city would hold the investment risk which would be subject to unforeseeable real estate demand and price fluctuations.Yet another consideration was the adding of a sustainability dimension to the development plan. This dimension however would involve a cost premium due to both the new technology and the limited number of builders able to commit to such a novel concept. Because consumer demand for a sustainable neighbourhood was unknown the city would here again be left managing the risk.One financial advantage to an infill development (using ECCA land for residential purposes) was a reduction in operating costs because an infill development would be cheaper to service than an expanded suburban development. If the city could divert 30000 residents from new suburbs to the downtown area the reduced need for additional infrastructure development over time would decrease overall operating costs such as snow clearing garbage collection and road maintenance.MOVING FORWARDIn 2008 an interesting factor arose that influenced decision making related to the ECCA development. The City of Edmonton developed “The Way Ahead” (see Exhibit 3) a document that proposed Edmonton’s strategic vision over the next 40 years as well as its strategic goals for the next 10 years. “The Way Ahead” contributed significantly to city council’s mind-set for overall municipality decision making. In contemplating the sustainability of ECCA land in particular the project’s decision making needed to consider the goals of “The Way Ahead” document.Although no official offer to purchase ECCA land had been considered by council potential buyers did exist and the expected sale price of the complete parcel would be approximately $250 million. If council pursued this option the immediate and long-term financial impact of the sale on the city’s budget would be extraordinary for its population of one million. Situated in downtown Edmonton ECCA land could for example be used for a world-class development that could support the co-existence of commercial and residential lifestyles simultaneously. This multi-purpose development could promote many economic benefits such as job creation and increased tourism revenues. This option would also silence the critics of city development as many development industry experts believed that the city was either unqualified or should not be competing with land developers. In 2009 on behalf of ECCA stakeholders the Canadian Business Aviation Association released a report outlining future plans for ECCA and the reasons why ECCA should be maintained as an operational airport. Within this report were plans to reduce noise and light pollution and increase revenues by garnering corporate business interest in utilizing the airport for northern flights to Alberta’s oil sands. Additional plans included the development of a “Mayo Clinic of the North”—a healthcare concept intended to create a national centre of excellence for healthcare services in Canada. While these clinic plans alone were promising the persuasive voices arguing to keep ECCA’s MedEvac Services intact presented city council with an ethical dilemma. If MedEvac Services were to be transferred to EIA the increase in patient transportation times to Edmonton’s major hospitals would be dramatically increased. As documented in a report regarding MedEvac Services some of Edmonton’s highest-ranking medical officials wrote letters to city council expressing their opposition to the closure of ECCA. These letters were inspired by the sensitive timely nature of medical care required for MedEvac Services’ patients. Between 2006 and 2008 ECCA accommodated an average of 3867 MedEvac Services flights per year of which approximately 350 were deemed “time critical” (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Although it was difficult to estimate some officials believed that between five and eight more patients would die each year should MedEvac Services be moved to EIA.Ultimately the future of ECCA land would be determined by city council which recognized in this situation an immense opportunity for environmental leadership. Hall believed that a plan needed to be formulated that would inspire Edmontonians to seek a brighter future for the city. After months of research and feedback Hall had created a vision for the city’s future and was ready to make a clear recommendation to city council so it too would deliver a strong future for the ECCA land.EXHIBIT 1: Location of Edmonton City Centre AirportSource: Created by the authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 2: Expected Population Growth of the City of EdmontonSource: Created by authors using data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 3: City of Edmonton’s 10-Year Strategy: “The Way Ahead”Source: City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 4: MedEvac Services’ Transport TimesAverage Transport Times from ECCA to Edmonton’s Major HospitalsAverage Transport Times from EIA to Edmonton’s Major HospitalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 5: ECCA MedEvac Services Traffic 2006–2008Total MedEvac Traffic Using ECCA2008 Fixed-Wing and Rotary TotalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.,"[{""start"":4245,""end"":4251,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5621,""end"":5627,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6847,""end"":6853,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6888,""end"":6894,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":9518,""end"":9524,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":20162,""end"":20168,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2245,""end"":2254,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2872,""end"":2876,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2863,""end"":2872,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21290,""end"":21294,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21450,""end"":21454,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3081,""end"":3085,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2979,""end"":2981,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2790,""end"":2793,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

The building was close to a bustling centre of malls business offices and hotels in Kathmandu Nepal’s capital city. With the city’s fast-growing economy and appetite for coffee Shrestha saw an opportunity to make this location the first of a large chain of cafés that he would call Kaffeine. He and his partners each had their own successful businesses. From money management to consumer packaged goods distribution to construction the founders brought a great deal of knowledge and valuable relationships that would help them operate in the Nepalese business environment. They had many things to consider such as location competition target market and how to measure the feasibility of this new venture. The KAFFEINE TeamShrestha Pradhan and Gurung were each successful entrepreneurs in their own right. Shrestha and Pradhan met while studying business at Kathmandu University one of the most prestigious institutes in the country. After graduation Shrestha founded an investment company called iCAPITAL that researched and invested in private and publicly-traded Nepalese businesses. Pradhan took a different route after business school choosing to become the exclusive distributor of Optimum Nutrition consumer healthcare products in Kathmandu. Gurung whom Shrestha met at a social event in Kathmandu owned and operated his own construction firm in Hong Kong. Overall Shrestha was quite confident about pursuing a venture given his group’s accomplishments.ENTREPRENEURIAL CHALLENGES IN NEPALNepal was a landlocked Asian country surrounded by China and India. Located in the Himalayas the country was extremely mountainous and was the home of Mount Everest the tallest mountain in the world. Being located between two of the biggest economies in the world was a great opportunity for aspiring Nepalese entrepreneurs but also a big source of political tension. For example in 1989 the Indian government imposed an economic blockade on Nepal because of its growing relationship with China and disputes over transit treaties. There were few places Nepal could turn for trade due to the Himalayan mountain range along its northern border and India in the south. The lack of oil and gasoline flowing to the country was one of the biggest challenges for the everyday population as well as entrepreneurs. Costs that were normally stable skyrocketed as people turned to the black market to fulfill their needs which drastically raised the cost of doing business in Nepal. The results of the blockade were disastrous for Nepal’s economy with gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropping from 17.92 per cent from 1987–1988 to just 1.09 per cent in 1988–1989. The threat of another blockade was very real if Nepal and India’s relations worsened again.Beyond these political challenges Nepal faced many developmental challenges that affected its population. Nepal was considered a least developed country by the United Nations with low economic growth and subsistence farming. This designation was conferred through the consideration of per capita income human assets and development and economic vulnerability. The Nepalese government set forward plans to become eligible to graduate from a least developed country to a developing country by 2022. As of 2012 only 67 per cent of the population had access to electricity 62 per cent had access to sanitation and the adult literacy rate stood at 57 per cent. Some progress had been made though with the percentage of those living below the poverty line dropping from 42 per cent in 1995 to 24 per cent in 2013 and GDP growth at 4.9 per cent in 2012. The developmental challenges facing Nepal directly affected entrepreneurs attempting to start businesses in the country.Major hurdles for entrepreneurs in Nepal included lack of funding and electricity deficiencies. It was nearly impossible to receive funding for a business without putting up significant collateral in the form of land or buildings. The concept of credit scores did not exist in Nepal so there were few ways for young entrepreneurs to build up a reputation of paying back loans and becoming creditworthy. Most funding came from existing family business houses causing large family conglomerates with holdings across diverse industries. Also Nepal faced large energy deficiencies which it managed through planned load shedding also known as rolling blackouts. As a result businesses had to cope without electricity for hours every day. To ensure smooth business operations many businesses ran expensive generators to keep the lights on which cut into operational margins. Overall these challenges discouraged many keen young entrepreneurs from entering the uncertain business market.Coffee in Nepal Britain’s heavy influence on Nepal contributed to the Asian country’s large tea-drinking culture. The Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923 was the first to declare Nepal a sovereign international state. It was not until 1938 that coffee was introduced in Nepal and it remained a niche product that was primarily consumed by expatriates throughout the 20th century. Nepal’s mountainous terrain provided the potential for its coffee farmers to produce a top-quality product; however farmers often had trouble maintaining consistency in harvests each year. Up until the 21st century the limited amount of coffee that was grown in Nepal was mostly exported. However in the 2000s farmers had noticed an increase in both international and domestic demand for Nepalese coffee. Although exports had declined since a peak in 2008 export demand for coffee was supplanted by growing local interest (see Exhibit 1). This movement toward consumption of coffee was largely driven by Gagan Pradhan founder of Nepal’s largest coffee chain Himalayan Java Coffee (Himalayan Java). Prior to the founding of Himalayan Java Nepalese primarily purchased instant coffee a form of coffee that was inexpensive and consumed at home. Gagan Pradhan was able to achieve success in changing Nepal’s coffee culture by placing great emphasis on the location of his cafés. His first café was opened in an upscale region of Kathmandu called Thamel after which he was able to expand his chain to other booming regions in the fast-growing city.Potential CustomersThe prospective Kaffeine building was located one block away from Durbar Marg one of Kathmandu’s busiest streets. Durbar Marg contained offices for many large companies large malls upscale hotels restaurants and bars thus attracting a wide variety of people. Shrestha divided his potential customer base into three distinct groups.The first group Shrestha considered targeting was the business people working at large companies such as the Nepal Investment Bank and Nabil Bank. Many of these businesses had coffee canteens for their employees and Shrestha wondered whether the appeal of his café would be enough to attract these wealthy customers. Not only did they come to the area for work but they would also shopped in the upscale stores and restaurants around Durbar Marg.Another group Shrestha considered targeting was tourists. Durbar Marg contained many shops and restaurants that were popular tourist spots. The café’s location was about a 25-minute walk from Thamel the largest tourist hub in Kathmandu. This district was highly popular with tourists a segment that had grown from 736215 in 2011 to 803092 in 2012. It was also a five-minute walk from Hotel Yak & Yeti a five-star deluxe hotel for affluent travellers. One concern that Shrestha had with targeting this group was that the vast majority of tourists were interested in trekking in nearby mountains as opposed to shopping in Kathmandu. Without being centrally located it would take a lot of marketing and online presence to attract tourists.A third group Shrestha considered targeting was domestic students. Durbar Marg contained many of Kathmandu’s most popular malls restaurants and bars which would attract students to the area. The café location was a 10 to 15 minute motorcycle ride from many of Kathmandu’s large universities such as King’s College. Students frequented cafés and enjoyed using them as quiet study spots with a steady stream of coffee to keep them awake through long study sessions. Although they had relatively low disposable income compared to the other groups students were more often willing to try new products and brands. Shrestha considered these three types of people the most easily distinguishable groups in the area. Although there were people who frequented the area but did not fall into these groups Shrestha found it difficult to categorize them into an addressable market.SUPPLY CHAINIn starting Kaffeine the founders needed to decide where to source their coffee from weighing considerations such as price quality consistency and branding.Nepalese BeansNepal’s unique high-altitude Himalayan environment made it ideal for growing specialty coffee. Coffee grown in Nepal included the Bourbon and Typica varieties of the C. arabica species. The Nepalese coffee production market was highly fragmented with most coffee grown on small plots by independent farmers. This made the Nepalese coffee market a somewhat niche market with mass production to the scale needed by international brands not possible. Segmentation was also a problem for quality control. Because batches of beans came from many different plots and growers quality across shipments could vary greatly. Despite the quality issues there was a pride in showcasing locally grown products. Of all the options locally-sourced coffee was the most affordable costing between Rs1300 and Rs1600 per kilogram.Imported BeansThe second option was to import beans from popular growing regions around the world such as Ethiopia Colombia and India. Importing beans without branding would allow Kaffeine to brand and label them however it wanted while gaining the consistency of larger farm operations. However the company would lose the “locally grown” appeal and marketing power of a larger brand. Imported beans would provide quality consistency but would cost Kaffeine Rs2500 per kilogram.Branded ImportsFinally Kaffeine could purchase imported branded coffee from international brands. Two popular options worldwide were Illy and Lavazza—Italian brands with operations spanning the globe. The benefit of going with a branded option was that Kaffeine would be able to advertise with the supplier’s logo on shop and advertising materials leveraging the international brand. Additionally these brands underwent extensive quality control on their coffee beans. At Illy a coffee batch could be quality tested as many as eight times before being incorporated in the Illy blend. However using a branded option might take away from the core Kaffeine brand and came at a premium; importing Illy cost Rs3950 per kilogram and Lavazza’s international beans cost as much as Rs4500 per kilogram.COMPETITIONSince 2003 there was a large increase in the number of coffee shops in Kathmandu. Within a three-minute walk of the location there were four established coffee locations that Kaffeine would be competing with the largest of the four being Himalayan Java Coffee. Himalayan Java CoffeeHimalayan Java Coffee was founded in 1999 and proudly advertised its sourcing of Nepalese coffee. It targeted tourists heavily and the upper middle-class in the Thamel area and priced its coffee between Rs200 and Rs300. The company used Facebook and TripAdvisor to advertise to tourists and spread its growing brand. Due to its backstory and heavy social media presence Himalayan Java Coffee would be Kaffeine’s toughest competition in the Nepalese market.The Coffee ShopThe Coffee Shop was a high-end restaurant in Hotel Annapurna a 50-year-old 5-star hotel in Kathmandu. The shop was very formal rather than relaxed like a café with coffee being offered at prices between Rs200 and Rs400. The Coffee Shop’s customers mainly consisted of wealthy tourists staying at the Hotel Annapurna and well-off local businessmen who used it as a venue to meet clients.Magic BeansMagic Beans was a mid-range coffee shop located in Sherpa Mall on Durbar Marg. It mostly targeted local shoppers with prices between Rs150 and Rs250. It had some social media presence but did not have the same brand strength as Himalayan Java coffee. While Himalayan Java coffee had the potential to be a national brand Magic Beans was more of a local one-off shop.Coffee ExpressCoffee Express was a coffee kiosk located on Durbar Marg catering to on-the-go customers with lower prices. Coffee started at Rs100. Coffee Express did not have much of a retail presence and lacked the feel of a modern coffee shop. It was not a place that people would convene to socialize or have meetings.FINANCIALSMarket SizeShrestha estimated that 250000 to 350000 cups of coffee were sold in cafés around Kathmandu annually. This figure was growing quickly at approximately 5 per cent year-over-year. It was driven by new customers becoming avid coffee drinkers and by increasing economic prosperity which made café-sold coffee more accessible. Given Shrestha’s relatively large marketing budget he believed he could capture 2 to 4 per cent of the Nepalese coffee market in his first year. Shrestha believed that the market share captured would depend on his price point which ultimately depended on the quality of beans his café would use. As a relatively discretionary good a more expensive coffee would likely lead to lower market penetration. As his business grew and he opened up more locations Shrestha projected that his market share would increase to 10 per cent in five years.Costs and InvestmentsShrestha recognized that his direct costs would vary depending on how he sourced his coffee beans. Direct costs would make up 35 per cent 40 per cent or 45 per cent of revenues if he used local beans branded beans or imported beans respectively. Shrestha also predicted all of the indirect operating costs of operating his first store (see Exhibit 2). Finally Shrestha expected that the initial investment in his café would be Rs4800000 which would be enough to cover a rent deposit renovations and fixtures. He believed it was reasonable to assume that renovations and fixtures would last 10 years before having to be replaced.The DecisionShrestha and his team planned to meet the next day to discuss the many decisions and questions facing them. Was the location they were considering the right place to establish operations?

Cleghorn the chair of the board of directors for one of Canada’s oldest railway companies Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) received a rather blunt e-mail from Bill Ackman the chief executive officer (CEO) of CP’s largest shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing). In the e-mail in which Ackman stated that “war is also not inevitable” Ackman demanded that Cleghorn provide Pershing with two seats on the board of directors and approve the hiring of a new CEO of Ackman’s choosing. Cleghorn’s uncertainty about how to respond to Ackman’s request was documented in the email he had sent to Ackman that day: “Thank you for your email and for your phone message. Let me reiterate that we would like to reach an agreement which advances the best interests of the company. As you will appreciate I will be discussing your email with my board.” Whatever decision Cleghorn made it had to be in the best interests of shareholders.”HISTORY OF CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAYThe Early DaysCP was one of Canada’s most recognized companies with a history that dated back to the late 1800s. As part of Canada’s Confederation in 1867 the provinces that joined were promised a transcontinental railway to physically link them with the other provinces from east to west. The railroad’s early construction was fraught with controversy and politics until a group of Scottish-Canadian businessmen formed a viable syndicate and incorporated the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPRC) in 1881. Despite some continued building struggles the last spike of the railroad was driven into the ground in Craigellachie British Columbia in 1885 and the first transcontinental train departed on June 28 1886.Throughout the early 1900s CPRC expanded its business into land sales telegraph lines locomotive construction and steamships and served as the primary transportation network during World War II. The company also focused on expanding its rail network through acquisitions particularly in the United States through the Soo Line in the Midwest and the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Northeast. By 1986 CPRC was Canada’s second-largest company with CA$15 billion in revenue.The Modern RailroadIn 2001 the five subsidiaries created through various acquisitions by CPRC were spun into separate companies leaving CP as an independent public company. The following decade witnessed continued expansion through track re-building renewing locomotive fleets modernizing information technology systems and focusing on railroad safety; however CP also faced significant challenges during this time. The company was often the focus of takeover rumours including a widely reported rejection of a takeover inquiry from a private equity group led by Brookfield Asset Management in 2007. The company also suffered during the economic recession; in 2009 CP reported operating income of $830 million reflecting a 20 per cent drop from 2008 levels. This decline was primarily due to lower traffic volumes decreasing fuel prices and a drop in both the freight rates and the average length of haul of coal exports. In 2011 severe weather and flooding caused significant train disruptions resulting in an over 13 per cent decline in year-over-year operating income. CP was committed to executing its multi-year plan which aimed to drive volume growth expand network capacity and control costs. See Exhibit 1 for a summary of CP’s key financials for 2007–2011.By 2012 the company had grown to over 16000 employees operating in six provinces and 13 U.S. states across 14700 miles of railway track. The railway transported a wide range of goods including industrial and automotive products food and agricultural products forest products and energy/wind energy products. Customer shipments were handled either through traditional transloading or through the use of intermodal containers depending on customer needs and preferences. The transportation of unit trains (i.e. a shipment of multiple cars containing a single product) was considered more efficient and less complex than mixed-load trains which had to make multiple stops and switch cars in and out of the train. As a result mixed-load trains required more complex scheduling and labour utilization. Bulk products transported primarily by unit trains represented approximately 44 per cent of CP’s total revenues in 2012 with the remainder requiring mixed-train planning and execution.the north american railroad INDUSTRYPrior to the invention of the automobile rail networks represented the sole means of long-distance travel. As such railway operations in North America received significant political attention and continued to be viewed as an essential form of infrastructure.The United StatesThe railroad industry in the United States had faced significant regulation since its origins in the early 1800s. The Interstate Commerce Commission was formed in 1880 to limit the exercise of monopoly power by local rail companies and stabilize the industry through the regulation of freight rates formations and consolidations and service levels. Unfortunately the growth in regulation and resulting pace of approval stifled the industry leading to financial crises and numerous firm bankruptcies from 1960–1980. In 1980 the industry was revolutionized by the Staggers Rail Act which eliminated regulatory control of freight rates in the United States. Canadian firms were forced to respond to the resulting competitive pricing pressure given their significant rail network within the United States.CanadaUnlike in the United States which from 1980 onwards was struggling with industry consolidation in Canada with extensive mergers and acquisitions starting after the repeal of the Staggers Rail Act in early 1980 and gathering momentum in the late 1990s two key players dominated the railroad industry: CP and Canadian National Railway (CN). While rationalization of the rail network in Canada was limited by various regulatory restrictions the effects of regulation were not as severe as the effects of regulations in the United States. The Canadian Transport Commission which was responsible for adjudication and safety regulation was disbanded in 1988 and its functions divided among various new bodies significantly “deregulating” the industry and allowing competitive forces to prevail. The Canadian and U.S. rail industries began to merge into a broad North American industry with acquisitions in the 2000s given the significant cross-border assets and alliances between firms. The industry was heavily concentrated with the seven largest Class I freight railroads accounting for 69 per cent of freight rail mileage 90 per cent of employees and 94 per cent of revenues. This concentration prompted governments on both sides of the border to maintain the regulation of anti-competitive railroad conduct. Noteworthy was that CN had made significant acquisitions in the United States and had evolved as a north/south railroad network largely through a major acquisition of the Illinois Central Railroad providing access to Chicago and points south and west; in contrast in 2011 CP had largely focused on a Canadian railroad network—an east/west network.Canadian National Railway CompanyCN was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government to assume responsibility for a number of small railroads on the brink of collapse. As a Crown corporation CN received government subsidies to support its operations—an action that was the topic of significant political debate. CN posted deficits from its inception up to the late 1970s which the government absorbed as part of its budget. The company began to rise to profitability after 1978 by divesting non-core freight rail assets including hotels airlines and telecommunication companies. Following deregulation CN abandoned unprofitable rail lines it had been forced to absorb through prior government policies. In 1995 the government initiated the largest privatization in Canadian history at the time by selling all of its CN shares under the CN Commercialization Act. The Act specified that the company’s headquarters must remain in Montreal Quebec and that no individual or corporation could own more than 15 per cent of CN’s shares. In 1998 CN purchased the Illinois Central Railroad shifting its focus from solely an east–west Canadian link to a north–south North American railway. The company also embraced “precision railroading” which focused on stringent train scheduling to reduce terminal dwell time and improve asset utilization. For CN this strategy produced industry-leading operating ratios and on-time performance.By 2012 network rationalization focused expansion and operational improvements had transformed CN into a $9 billion company with over 23000 employees making it the largest railroad in Canada. Its focus on precision railroading contributed to a significant decline in the company’s operating ratio from 75.3 per cent in 1998 to 63.5 per cent by the end of 2011. See Exhibit 2 for a summary of CN’s key financials for 2007–2011.CP’s MANAGEMENT TEAM and board governanceManagement TeamIn 2006 CP announced the retirement of CEO Robert Ritchie after an 11-year term and appointed the then chief operating officer (COO) Fred Green as the new CEO. Green had joined CP in 1978 and had progressed through the organization by assuming roles in operations marketing and sales. He had also served as an officer or director of many of CPRC’s former subsidiaries. In the six years since Green’s appointment the remainder of CP’s management team had been described as a revolving door with three different chief financial officers and five different COOs. Board of DirectorsCP’s board of directors’ mandate disclosed that “the Board is responsible for CP’s long-term strategic direction succession plans for senior officers and risk management oversight.” At the end of 2011 CP’s board of directors consisted of 15 members including current and former CEOs of publicly traded companies railway industry veterans and political leaders (see Exhibit 3). For example board members included the former or current CEOs of some of Canada’s largest companies such as the Royal Bank of Canada Suncor Energy and Shell Canada Limited. In addition one-third of board members had been appointed Officers of the Order of Canada.The CP board was considered long-tenured with 60 per cent of members having served on the board longer than five years. In December 2011 the board appointed two railroad industry veterans as directors: Tony Ingram the former COO of the CSX Corporation and Ed Harris the former COO of CP. Board governance documents indicated that the board could consist of no fewer than five members and no more than 20 members.canadian corporate governance and shareholder activismCorporate GovernanceA company’s board of directors was charged with the overall governance and stewardship of the organization and directors were appointed to act in the best interests of shareholders. By virtue of corporate and securities laws shareholders of a corporation had the right to vote on a range of issues affecting the corporation including the appointment of directors appointment of auditors and approval of certain fundamental changes or transactions. When organizations sought approval from shareholders on various proposals they engaged in a process termed proxy solicitation to gather votes in advance of the annual general meeting of shareholders. Shareholders typically voted on these proposals by appointing another party to vote on matters on their behalf (a “proxy”) in order to streamline the process. The proposals were detailed within the company’s proxy circular which included the relevant information required by shareholders in order to make an informed vote.“Dissident” shareholders who wished to challenge management and propose alternative agendas could do so by engaging in a “proxy contest” to solicit votes from shareholders in their favour. In Canada any shareholder with more than a 5 per cent share ownership of a certain voting class of a company’s equity could call a shareholder meeting and solicit proxies in support of their agenda. Reporting Beneficial OwnershipShareholders acquiring 10 per cent or more of a voting class of a Canadian company’s equity were required by the Securities Act to issue a press release announcing the acquisition and to file an “early warning” report within two days. Similarly U.S. securities legislation required that shareholders file a Schedule 13D within 10 days of acquiring more than 5 per cent of a voting class of a company’s equity while also reporting the transaction and providing a rationale for the acquisition. In Canada shareholders were not required to disclose their intentions with respect to the ownership creating potential uncertainty and unwelcome “surprises” for the company.The Rise of Shareholder ActivismActivist shareholders could be defined generally as investors who purchased a large stake in a publicly traded organization with the intent to enact changes and realize a profit on the investment. The first notable wave of shareholder activism began in the United States in the 1980s with so-called “corporate raiders” taking advantage of depressed share prices and undervalued assets. By the early 1990s companies had responded by introducing takeover defense mechanisms such as poison pills and golden parachutes resulting in a decline in takeover activity.Given the concentration of institutional investor share ownership among many Canadian companies the level of shareholder activism in Canada paled in comparison to activities at U.S. organizations. Canadian institutional investors typically communicated displeasure by selling shares rather than initiating conflict. Notwithstanding shareholder activism in Canada had gained traction in recent years as evidenced by the increasing number of proxy battles launched against Canadian companies. Approximately 101 proxy contests were completed in the five-year period ending December 31 2012 representing an 84 per cent increase over the 55 contests completed in the prior five-year period. This growth in shareholder activism and proxy contests in Canada could be partially attributed to activist-friendly legislation introduced in 2008 allowing eligible shareholders to solicit proxies without issuing a proxy circular. As such shareholders could solicit proxies by simply issuing a press release or public announcement at any time prior to the proxy submission deadline (which could be as late as the eve of a shareholders’ meeting).bill ackman and pershing square capital MANAGEMENTWilliam (Bill) Ackman graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1992. Upon graduation he teamed up with Harvard classmate David Berkowitz to launch a hedge fund called Gotham Partners. With a passion for investing and US$3 million in start-up capital the fund achieved significant success throughout the next six years with annual returns of up to 40 per cent. Although the fund began by investing in relatively conservative opportunities the pair became increasingly speculative and ran into trouble in the early 2000s. A highly leveraged investment in a money-losing golf course combined with a probe into improper conduct by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forced the fund to wind down operations and sell off its assets in 2002.Unfettered by the failure of Gotham Partners Ackman launched a new hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing) in 2004. Pershing was described as a research-intensive fundamental value investor typically focusing on long-term large-cap and mid-cap companies. The fund’s style combined value investing and activist approaches to drive company share prices and improve fund performance. The bulk of Pershing’s portfolio was fairly concentrated with the majority invested in consumer goods and consumer services businesses.Over the next few years Ackman garnered significant media attention by engaging in activist behaviour —that is investing in companies and aggressively pursuing changes such as shifts in strategy or changes in management. In many cases he succeeded in driving changes at his targeted companies with limited effort; however not every activist investment made by Pershing proceeded according to plan. In 2007 Pershing established the “Pershing Square IV” fund and invested $2 billion in shares of retail giant Target Corporation in order to enact changes in strategy and increase the share price. Although the company had partially implemented some of Pershing’s strategic recommendations Pershing’s investment had fallen by 90 per cent by 2009 which Ackman described as one of the greatest disappointments of his career. When the company rejected further proposals by Ackman he launched a proxy battle to appoint himself and four others to the board of directors; however his bid was rejected by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Of the 24 companies Pershing had targeted for active investment Target Corporation was only the second proxy battle initiated by Ackman (see Exhibit 4).By 2012 Pershing had grown to over $11 billion in assets under management and employed 51 people. Since its inception Pershing had delivered more than a 20 per cent annual compound rate of return to investors approximately 90 per cent of which was generated based on activist plays.A Stake in CP RailOn October 28 2011 Pershing filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating that it had acquired 12.2 per cent of CP’s outstanding shares at an approximate cost of $1.07 billion. The filing also indicated that Pershing’s intent was to “engage in discussions with management the board other stockholders of [CP] and other relevant parties concerning the business management operations assets capitalization financial condition governance strategy and future plans of [CP].” The acquisition made Pershing the largest single shareholder of CP shares.In response to the filing Cleghorn issued a memo to all CP employees on October 31 stating “As with others CP is open to the views of its shareholders. We will speak with Pershing Square to hear their input into our plan already targeted at realizing greater efficiency and improved service reliability.”initial correspondence and pershing square requestsAfter some initial phone calls Ackman and Cleghorn decided to meet on November 2 2011 to discuss Pershing’s investment objectives. During this meeting Ackman focused heavily on CP’s past performance—specifically the firm’s operating ratio. CP’s operating ratio was notably higher than most other Class I freight railroads and had been trending upward during Green’s tenure. By the end of 2011 CP’s operating ratio was the worst among its key competitors. Ackman asserted that the operating ratio could be reduced to the mid-60s by 2015 but only if a change in leadership occurred. Further Ackman proposed that existing CEO Green be replaced by Hunter Harrison the retired CEO of CP’s Canadian rival CN. At the time Cleghorn indicated that the board supported Green and CP’s existing strategy and the two parties closed the meeting with limited resolution. Over subsequent communications in the days that followed it became apparent that Ackman had two primary objectives: install Hunter Harrison as CEO and secure two seats on CP’s board of directors.Hunter HarrisonHunter Harrison had had an extensive career in the railway industry beginning in 1964 as a carman-oiler for the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. The Burlington Northern Railroad acquired the railway in 1980 and Harrison quickly progressed through the organization to the executive ranks. He was appointed CEO of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1993 and COO of CN when it acquired the Illinois Central Railroad in 1998. In 2003 he was appointed CEO of CN and remained in the position until his retirement on December 31 2009. During his career Harrison was named Railroader of the Year (2002 Railway Age) CEO of the Year (2007 Report on Business) Railroad Innovator (2009 Progressive Railroading) and International Executive of the Year (2009 Canadian Chamber of Commerce).As part of his previous employment contract with CN Harrison was bound by non-compete and non-solicitation agreements expiring December 31 2011. In addition his retirement and pension arrangements separately prohibited him from competing with CN until the end of 2014. Notwithstanding Ackman was adamant that Harrison was the only candidate who could improve CP’s performance and help the company achieve its operating objectives.Request for Board SeatsOn November 4 2011 Ackman contacted Cleghorn requesting that the board provide Pershing with two seats on the board for him and a business partner Paul Hilal. The board agreed to interview Ackman for a board seat but declined to consider Hilal given his lack of railway industry experience. This rationale was given despite a lack of railway experience among CP’s board members at the time. Following Ackman’s interview the board extended him an offer to join the board; however Ackman subsequently refused the offer due to a “standstill” agreement he was being asked to sign. On December 13 2011 Pershing filed another Schedule 13D indicating that it had acquired further shares of CP bringing its total holdings to 14.2 per cent of CP’s shares outstanding.Canadian pacific goes publicOn December 30 2011 The Globe and Mail newspaper published an article titled “CP’s Activist Investor Eyes Former CN CEO Mr. Hunter Harrison.” The article represented the first public declaration of intent by Pershing to have Green replaced. In response to the article Cleghorn publicized a letter addressed to Ackman on January 3 2012 to reiterate the board’s commitment to Green and the company’s existing strategic plan. He refuted any rumours that the board was considering meeting with Harrison and emphasized the board’s commitment to engaging in continued dialogue with Pershing (see Exhibit 5).Pershing square fires backThe following day Ackman released his own public letter addressed to Cleghorn countering the statements made by Cleghorn in his earlier letter. Specifically Ackman asserted that Cleghorn had indicated that there was interest in meeting with Harrison that the board was “forcing” Ackman to sign an exceptional contract in exchange for a seat on the board and that Pershing did have a strong plan to improve CP’s operating performance. He closed by urging Cleghorn to meet with Harrison and board candidate Hilal as soon as possible (see Exhibit 5).Early the following morning Cleghorn received an e-mail from Ackman titled “War and Peace” in which Ackman reiterated previous comments and provided an ultimatum: accede to his requests or Pershing would launch a proxy contest at the next shareholders’ meeting. As part of this contest Pershing was prepared to “take the largest public hall available and make a presentation to shareholders and the public about management and board failure over the past 10 years at CP.” His e-mail closed with a not-so-subtle threat: “Let’s avoid having a border skirmish turn into a nuclear winter. Life is too short.” The set of emails between Cleghorn and Ackman were fully reproduced by The Globe and Mail in its article of January 16 2012. What came across in the emails was a sense of heightened emotions between Cleghorn and Ackman.planning his next moveCleghorn was faced with a dilemma. On the one hand he could view the e-mail as an unfounded attack on the company one that he needed to defend vigorously. On the other hand he could view Ackman’s recommendations as having additional merit and as warranting more in-depth investigation. There were three potential courses of action. The choice made by Cleghorn and his board would be driven by their having to act in a manner consistent with the Canadian Business Corporations Act—to act in the best interests of the corporation. Taking such an action would be a clear expression that the board viewed their role as fiduciary agents of the corporation.Agree to Ackman’s ProposalOne way to end the issue was to offer Ackman and Hilal two seats on the board (removing the standstill agreement) and commit to replacing Green with Harrison. If Cleghorn were to determine this was the optimal solution then he was faced with how he would recommend these changes to the remaining board members and whether there was a business case to remove Green from the position of CEO. If he agreed to these changes what else would Ackman push for once he was appointed as a board member? Was opening the doors to Ackman without certainty of his voting intentions the beginning of future boardroom battles?Ignore Ackman and Maintain Existing StrategyWith a careful reading of the email exchange between Cleghorn and Ackman it is reasonable to suggest that Cleghorn might consider that Ackman was bullying the board by using threats. Cleghorn based on his most recent upbeat annual presentation to shareholders demonstrated confidence in the company’s current strategic direction; thus the question he had to consider was whether Ackman had a clear plan to implement the changes he sought. The company was a blue-chip Canadian company with a long and illustrious history and hedge funds such as Pershing had to date largely ignored the Canadian marketplace. Therefore a question that the board should consider was whether Ackman would give up the battle if Cleghorn and the board did not respond to this e-mail or what other measures might be necessary to end his advances. Should Cleghorn return to the media and employ a tactic based on preserving Canadian firms to largely Canadian owners and encourage other shareholders to push back against Ackman? Perhaps strength in numbers was all that was needed.Continue NegotiationsAlthough recent conversations between Cleghorn and Ackman had been made public one of the possibilities for Cleghorn in deciding the best course of action was to continue negotiating privately with Ackman in the hopes of swaying his opinion or at the very least reaching some form of compromise. What would be best for the corporation? Should Cleghorn on behalf of the board offer Ackman some other arrangement to appease his interests while maintaining the stability of CP’s current management team?With the knowledge that he should act in the best interests of shareholders and that Pershing was CP’s largest shareholder Cleghorn had to confront the challenge of determining how to prioritize these competing interests. With Ackman’s escalating threats and a shareholders’ meeting expected to occur in the next few months time was not on Cleghorn’s side and he needed to resolve this matter quickly.Exhibit 1: Canadian Pacific railway KEy Financial Data (2009–2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 2: Canadian National railway KEy financial data (2009–2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Note: * Not strictly comparable to Canadian Pacific Railway.Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 3: Selected CP Board of Directors Biographies (as at december 31 2011)John E.

YourStory was a media and technology company focused on helping build an entrepreneurial ecosystem in India by creating and disseminating news stories related to entrepreneurs. While Sharma was filled with optimism about the prospects of YourStory the discussions with the investor had made her realize that there were many challenges to be overcome. Sharma realized that YourStory had no option but to scale up its business far beyond its current size and scope and it needed to do so rapidly. Sharma mentally reviewed her current situation: YourStory has done well over the years and yet there is so much more to do. We are leaders in our niche and yet potential investors are not satisfied. They want us to grow to a much larger size. These discussions have made me question some of the key assumptions that I have always made about YourStory. I have to address the questions posed and design a comprehensive strategy to build the VCs’ confidence in YourStory’s growth prospects and I should do so within the next couple of weeks to be ready for the next (and hopefully final) meeting for our first round of external funding.BACKGROUNDAbout YourStorySharma launched YourStory in 2008. She had worked in conventional print and television business media for a few years and understood the dynamics of that sector. Sharma remembered the path that led to her creation of YourStory:While working in the business media I realized that when conventional media companies wanted to focus on entrepreneurs they only focused on the large success stories. The smaller younger and high-potential entrepreneurial ventures were left out and received almost no attention or publicity via the conventional media channels; this was not just an Indian phenomenon but happened globally. This was the gap that YourStory focused on. I realized that the traditional media mainly limited itself to “breaking news” while there were so many other interesting stories out there especially related to entrepreneurs and their ventures.Sharma explained why she had named her venture “YourStory”: “I firmly believe that if I celebrate your story you will celebrate my story. That thought was the origin of me naming my start-up ‘YourStory.’”To keep costs low she initially worked mainly on her own. For nearly seven years she sought no external funding and managed with her own funds. Sharma ran the business frugally conserved cash in all possible ways and kept expenses low. In the first two years the venture struggled. It received nearly no revenues. At that stage the main costs were those needed for generating news content every day and retaining visibility for YourStory in the market. She recalledI had very limited funds then. I could neither hire any employees nor pay good authors on a per-story basis for content generation. That is where my . . . education and ability to write came in handy. For the first three years I was writing most of the content on my own. Keeping my costs under control helped me survive the tough years. By the time the business broke even I had only spent about ?2 million in cumulative expenses. Things changed once we became relatively well known. By 2015 YourStory had been profitable for three years in a row.About YourStory’s FounderIn 2003 Sharma obtained a master’s degree in history from the prestigious St. Stephen’s College in New Delhi. She studied further to obtain a postgraduate diploma in communications management from MICA India in 2004. She worked for about two years as a brand advisor with the Times of India a leading English-language daily in India. Subsequently she switched to television journalism by joining CNBC TV18 an English-language business news channel in 2007. Within two years Sharma rose to become an assistant vice-president there. At that stage she quit her job and plunged full time into starting her entrepreneurial venture in the field of media and communications. Sharma was proud of the awards and recognition both she and YourStory had received in recent years. She statedI won the L’Oréal Paris Femina online influencer award this year. Last year I was ranked among the top five women entrepreneurs in the Indian start-up ecosystem by the Economic Times. Coming from a media group that we compete with directly I especially cherish this award. I was pleased when I heard that YourStory was rated among the Top 500 LinkedIn influencers in the world in 2015. In 2013 [one of my ventures SocialStory] received the Impact Economy Innovations Grant Fund from the Rockefeller Foundation Omidyar Network and Dasra. In 2010 I received the Villgro journalist of the year award. YourStory’s business modelOver the years YourStory had evolved into many niche businesses all related to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Its most well-known offering was YourStory an online media platform. Under the umbrella brand of YourStory was HerStory an online media offering focused specifically on women entrepreneurs. Sharma had also started SocialStory which was focused on social-sector entrepreneurs. All these brands were active in the online world. They were also used for organizing and sponsoring a variety of events and conferences to promote the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. YourStoryBy early 2015 YourStory had become the top-ranked media platform focused on promoting the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. Its main activity was publishing stories related to entrepreneurs and their ideas. It provided coverage to all kinds of entrepreneurs irrespective of their sector scale or stage of life. In recent years YourStory had provided a media platform to a large number of entrepreneurs in the web mobile e-commerce cloud computing social eco-friendly green and creative domains. YourStory worked with a variety of strategic partners. First it partnered with technology giants such as Microsoft Intel Google Amazon Dell Cisco and VeriSign. The large technology companies benefited because YourStory was able to connect them with a focused audience of technology-sector entrepreneurs—risk-takers who were often the first to adapt new technologies programming languages and solutions put forth by large technology giants. Feedback from the early adopter tech-entrepreneurs helped corporations such as Microsoft and Google improve their offerings before releasing them to wider audiences. YourStory charged these large companies a fee in return for allowing them access to its huge and constantly growing database of start-up companies. As a matter of principle YourStory did not charge the start-up ventures for these services.Second YourStory had developed partnerships with venture capitalists private-equity players and angel investors. Some of the big-name investors in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem that had partnered with YourStory included Sequoia Capital Operations LLC (Sequoia Capital) Accel Partners Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. These financial investors were interested in spotting potential unicorns among the crowd of new start-ups. YourStory helped bring these potential investors together with entrepreneurs. Finally YourStory collaborated with many of the ministries and departments of the Government of India. These partnerships were important because the government aimed to promote an entrepreneurial climate and ecosystem in India. The Government of India had designed many schemes and supportive policies to help start-ups grow and prosper. YourStory disseminated information about these initiatives and helped the start-ups understand where to start and how to benefit from governmental support. Over the years YourStory had developed into an extremely strong brand in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. According to Archana Patchirajan co-founder of MyCityWay “We really adore the way YourStory.in recognizes technology ventures. Like Mashable and TechCrunch Yourstory.in is ‘the’ platform for entrepreneurs in India to showcase their dream to the world.”HerStoryHerStory—started by Sharma under the umbrella of YourStory—focused exclusively on the stories of women entrepreneurs leaders innovators and change agents. From her own experience and keen understanding of prevalent social mores Sharma realized that women entrepreneurs found it especially tough to set up and run businesses in India. The HerStory platform gave space and an exclusive voice to stories and issues related to women entrepreneurs. Reflecting the sectors where women were actively engaged in entrepreneurship HerStory had stories and news from technology health arts crafts and social enterprises. It disseminated news related to a variety of government schemes on skill development and funding that were available exclusively to women entrepreneurs. SocialStoryWhile YourStory provided coverage of all kinds of entrepreneurial ventures SocialStory focused on start-ups in the social and developmental sectors. The stories on SocialStory related to non-governmental organizations and social ventures in the education health environment civic responsibility clean energy culture and traditional handicrafts sectors. The platform provided visibility to entrepreneurs from these social sectors and gave those interested in social entrepreneurship a way to gain information about the people already active in that space and to collaborate with them. EventsYourStory organized many national and international events and conferences that provided networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. Its flagship events included TechSparks MobileSparks E-Sparks EduStars and WebSparks and it partnered and actively participated in entrepreneurial events organized by others. For instance YourStory was a principal partner for the Bangalore Business Literature Festival in September 2015. This event aimed to develop the culture of reading writing and publishing business literature (see Exhibit 1). Entrepreneurial ventures benefited from the knowledge sharing and networking that took place at such events and conferences. For instance Mir Abid Hussain founder of emo2 Inc. said “Thank you for the opportunity to present at TechSparks. It was very useful and I connected with a good number of people for [business] development.” Potential investors also appreciated the forum as a place to meet new ventures. For instance Shailendra Singh managing director of Sequoia Capital India statedWe were very happy to partner with YourStory again this year and [always] look forward to participating at their TechSparks events. We find these events draw young enthusiastic entrepreneurs from all over the country and we thoroughly enjoy interacting with them and learning about their businesses. Sequoia Capital is strongly committed to investing in early-stage companies in India and we see this partnership with TechSparks as a wonderful initiative that keeps us connected to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country.The various awards that were given out at these events helped many start-up ventures gain credibility and further visibility. For instance the founder of Vindhya e-Infomedia Private Limited Ashok Giri D. who won a “sociopreneurship” award in 2010–2011 stated “This award not only gave us recognition for the commitment that Vindhya had in its mission but also was able to open doors to many diverse opportunities like prospective customers investors and likeminded social entrepreneurs. This was one of the very few platforms exclusively for socially committed organizations.”Apart from large-scale national events YourStory also regularly organized local-scale boot camps entrepreneur meet-ups workshops and other smaller networking events. These were typically shorter more focused networking and knowledge-sharing events that lasted from two hours to half a day and catered to an audience of a few hundred participants at most. YourStory succeeded in attracting sponsors for all its events and its success was dependent on conceptualizing designing and executing focused events that added value for the sponsoring companies. Sharma spent a large part of her time identifying potential sponsors understanding their needs and motivations and co-designing customized YourStory-organized events. She expended a great deal of effort in publicizing the events to the targeted group of entrepreneurial ventures.One of the challenges Sharma faced was that some of the events were organized in partnership with organizations that were direct competitors of YourStory. For example some events were organized by large print media houses such as the Times of India and Economic Times and others by business news television channels such as NDTV Profit and CNBC TV18. While these media organizations were much larger than YourStory they were also present in the online world and therefore they were in competition with YourStory. Despite the apparent contradiction Sharma realized that it was better to collaborate with these competitors on such events because everyone in the ecosystem benefited.Current statusBy June 2015 YourStory had published over 20000 stories about Indian entrepreneurs. It had reached over 60 million readers and had garnered regular readership from over 50 countries. Sharma and her team had hosted over 220 entrepreneur-related events in which over 1.7 million people had participated. YourStory’s campaigns and networking support had helped numerous start-ups achieve funding and Sharma estimated that YourStory was directly or indirectly involved in about US$550 million of fundraising achieved by Indian start-ups. The firm reached over 4 million people daily via various channels on social media platforms. Its main sources of revenue were from tickets to its events rental fees for exhibit space at its conferences online advertisements registrations on profile pages for start-ups and premium-priced listings on the homepage. YourStory had achieved annual revenue of ?43 million in financial year (FY) 2014-2015 compared to ?39.6 million in FY 2013-14. However increased employee benefit expenses managerial remuneration and other expenses had resulted in a small loss of ?1.9 million in FY 2015 against a net profit of ?5.2 million in the previous financial year (see Exhibits 2 and 3). According to SharmaThe YourStory platform reaches over 100 million readers every month. The company has evolved into various content-driven sub-properties managed by our in-house editorial team who work with a network of freelancers that provide us content. We are growing rapidly and seeing good traction in revenue (one of the best among new digital media companies in India). We’re expecting US$3–$4 million in revenue over the next 12 months. We expect the native content [business-to-business] market to be around US$400 million in the next four years. The majority of the incremental spending is expected to be in digital [media]. We believe that we have a great chance of being one of the largest players in the segment with over 10 per cent market share in the near future.Cost of OperationsThroughout its existence YourStory had maintained an extremely lean setup. For the first three years Sharma had operated out of her own home and maintained only a skeletal staff. YourStory’s main costs came from employee salaries sourcing news content marketing expenses and information technology. YourStory had grown to a team of nearly 60 employees by 2015. Most of the staff were either journalists or marketers. Employee costs were one of the biggest cost drivers for YourStory. Sharma explained:We have a team of 10 engineers with varied experience who take care of building new products and applications. Our major expense is maintaining the team (mainly salary costs). The editorial or content team is our largest team in terms of both numbers and costs. The cost of content varies from ?200 to ?2000 depending on the quality of the article and the influencer rating of the author. We believe that this high editorial cost is justified. We are proud of the fact that over 80–90 per cent of our content is from editorial/independent sources and therefore carries an unbiased message. Our paid-for stories are clearly marked as “sponsored” on the website. As such we do not have large marketing expenditure; most of the expense on this is around promoting our events. On average we spend 2–5 per cent of our revenue on marketing.The news content that YourStory presented on its online media platforms was from a variety of sources. These included news-syndication organizations such as Press Trust of India (PTI) or Reuters other news channels the journalists employed by YourStory and freelance journalists and writers. To ensure sustainable profit YourStory had to keep its content costs low especially on a per-story basis; thus it had to be extremely selective about the kind of stories it sourced and the quality of news offered. As an online media platform YourStory had to constantly upgrade and scale up its technology infrastructure and remain up to date with the latest in technology to cater to its ever-growing readership. Because readers were increasingly consuming content on mobile phones and handheld devices YourStory was forced to additionally customize its offerings to suit these needs.competitive Challenges YourStory faced direct competition from a few Indian online media platforms that focused on entrepreneurial stories. Among the prominent competitors was VC Circle Network which was acquired by News Corp in 2015. VC Circle positioned itself as a source of news and analysis on Indian entrepreneurship and followed a premium subscription model on its website. It also tracked innovations in technology; covered news stories about the infrastructure sector; provided an online database about venture-capital and private-equity deals in India; organized conferences seminars and events for entrepreneurs; and engaged in executive training and coaching. Another similar firm was Bangalore-based start-up NextBigWhat which was founded by Ashish Sinha. It positioned itself as an online community of founders of start-ups and product marketers in the Indian technology sector. YourStory also faced indirect competition from a variety of blogs where users shared stories (e.g. Wattpad and Figment) online business news sites and magazines (e.g. Businessweek and WSJ Magazine). It also competed with conferences such as TEDx and TEDGlobal and with sites such as Quora which allowed users to interact in a question-and-answer format. In addition YourStory faced some indirect competition from foreign websites like Mashable (see Exhibit 4) and TechCrunch (see Exhibit 5).Expansion optionsSharma struggled with the question of how to scale up a niche entrepreneur-oriented online media company to reach a mass user base of over 200 million users. Her challenge was to scale up the venture grow its loyal readership and gain market share in an extremely competitive and evolving media marketplace. She realized that she had many alternatives from which to choose.Going VernacularOne of the options Sharma was considering was tapping into the vernacular language market in India. This meant that the English-language stories currently being showcased on YourStory would be translated into various regional Indian languages. Sharma explained:There is reason to consider going vernacular with our services. After all the English language despite being popular in India has a limited reach. Stories in English are typically only consumed by urban educated middle- and upper-class consumers. But there is an entire other part of the vast Indian population that will remain left out if we continue to follow an English-only approach. We have the potential to expand the number of our news consumers significantly if we venture into vernacular language-based services. However [this shift represents] a costly option. First we have to consider the cost of translating our English-language stories into vernacular languages. I recently explored a few technological solutions for automated translation but the results were not entirely satisfactory. At this stage I envisage having to employ teams of translators who would translate our English-language stories into vernacular languages. Additionally there is the cost of technology to ensure that our stories are presented or rendered in a user-chosen language. Also I’m unsure as to whether we should begin with one or two languages at first and then roll out to all the major Indian languages or go with a “big bang” approach on this. Our burn rate on this expansion option will depend on how many languages we choose to provide our services in.Adopting a Hyperlocal FocusYourStory was also considering the option of going “hyperlocal” with its stories meaning its stories would not be limited to content that appealed to a wide national audience but could instead focus on local stories that appealed to smaller-sized but highly focused audiences in each geographic area. These stories would be about entrepreneurial developments taking place in a suburb city district or state. The appeal would be very strong because the stories were about people in the vicinity of the readers. However the appeal of each story would be limited to a small number of readers. It was possible that each story would only be read by a few dozen or a few hundred readers who belonged to the town or district featured in the story. Sharma described the opportunity:I find going hyperlocal very exciting. Unlike mainstream channels our hyperlocal focus would make us the preferred news outlet for local communities. I believe that people are as interested in news about the developments in their immediate vicinity as they are in larger national and global news. In fact my hunch is that hyperlocal news would have a more loyal and regular readership; this is something that would appeal to anyone funding us. Sharma realized that going hyperlocal was easier said than done. She explained: The first issue is with content. While there is a mature market for development or syndication of content related to national and global stories content for local stories is relatively scant. Also quality of content is very variable when it comes to local news. Our costs—costs of developing content on a daily basis monitoring quality and ensuring relevance to the unique needs tastes and preferences of hundreds of local communities—seem like an insurmountable challenge. We currently have a team of about 60 people engaged with content-related activities. If we continue to follow our existing model we will need 10 times that number of employees to achieve a hyperlocal business. This certainly doesn’t seem to be the right way to grow. I know that the market is attractive but we need to find the right business model to service it. Moving from Niche to Mass MarketAnother alternative Sharma considered was moving away from an exclusive focus on entrepreneur-related stories to become a more mainstream news player. She explained that choosing a very generic name YourStory for her business made it “possible to expand the scope of our business beyond entrepreneurship to any kind of news.” She continued: “I have the opportunity to move in any or even all directions while leveraging the brand. I am considering making available more broad-based content related to entertainment movies and celebrity gossip.”However the issue was with the preferences and loyalty of YourStory’s existing reader base. Sharma worried that going from being a niche player that was fully focused on entrepreneurial ecosystem-related stories to being a generic news site would disillusion the company’s current consumer base. It would also dilute the YourStory brand that Sharma had built up assiduously over the years. She said “Today I am fortunate to have the goodwill and affection of a core . . . loyal audience. In trying to reach out to a wider audience I don’t want to risk losing my loyal customers.” Sharma knew that for her business to scale up massively (without a linear increase in costs) she needed to source stories from users themselves. She was considering developing technology that would allow readers to contribute their stories directly to YourStory. This democratization of content would give readers the power to share their own stories easily with the rest of the world. One option was that Sharma could develop the required technology in house. Another option was to acquire a company that already had such technology available. Sharma had come across one such company: Papyrus Editor (Papyrus) founded by Gaurav Tiwari in 2012. Papyrus had developed a simple online editor that helped authors create e-books using a straightforward user interface (see Exhibit 6).Targeting Other NichesSharma stated that she was also eager to consider other niches that YourStory could expand into:We have a track record of identifying and exploiting niches profitably; we have done so many times in the past few years. I believe that there are many other niches that could be targeted. For instance one niche that I am actively exploring is that of extremely short stories. These stories would typically be three- to four-line news items that could be consumed very quickly by readers. I believe that a lot of our readers are busy people and this service is likely to appeal to them. People could read such stories while on the move or when they took a few minutes’ break from their work. Also such stories would be extremely convenient to consume on mobile and handheld devices. There are many other such niche ideas I am exploring all the time. Yet Sharma realized that targeting niches was not without its challenges adding[Going] after a niche has its challenges. If the niche is really small it will not make us much money. If the niche expands over time competitors will notice and jump in with their solutions. Entry barriers are typically low and hence profits will be affected once competition enters the scene. In general my experience has been that targeting niches has kept the work environment at YourStory very start-up like. We are always in a project mode going after one niche or another. While that has been exciting it can also be very stressful.Focusing on Start-Up JobsAnother idea that Sharma was toying with was to start an online job portal focused on openings in start-up organizations. Because YourStory already regularly interacted with a large number of start-ups Sharma believed that they would be willing to share their job openings on the YourStory portal. She was banking on YourStory’s goodwill and strong brand to kick-start this new business. She explained: I am hoping that our vast network of contacts in the start-up ecosystem will be useful for the online job portal. Jobseekers know us from our website and from our technology events. That we are focused on start-ups is well known in the market. Jobseekers could look to us as their first choice of information when they are looking for a job with a start-up company in India. However Sharma was not entirely confident about venturing into a job portal because this was very different from her news-oriented business. Further there were already many different online job portals in India such as Naukri.com and Monster.in. The online job portal business was extremely competitive and would require YourStory to develop entirely new organizational capabilities. ConclusionSharma had to make some quick and decisive moves. Having previously been part of many entrepreneur–VC conversations Sharma realized that the possibility of massively scaling up was what attracted VCs the most especially in the online media and technology space. Growing organically and at a relatively steady pace as YourStory had for the last seven years was not enough; nor was it enough to grow only by grabbing opportunities as they came up—investors were looking for proof of a big-picture strategic plan. It was important that Sharma be in control of her business’s direction. It was equally if not more important to appear to be in control of where YourStory was headed in the coming few years. Sharma was confident about being in the right industry and poised for rapid growth. At the same time she understood that potential investors would translate their initial interest into actual investments only if she was able to demonstrate that YourStory had a coherent comprehensive and consistent story of its own.Exhibit 1: YourStory Meet-ups in May–June 2015Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Yourstory Profit and Loss account (in ?)Note: ? = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ?63.88

Rao president of the Engineering and Research and Development Services (ERS) division and senior corporate vice president at HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCL) had every reason to be proud as he congratulated The Boeing Company (Boeing) on the maiden flight of its 787 Dreamliner jet airliner (Dreamliner) on December 15 2009. Out of the many companies working on the 787 Dreamliner project HCL was the only Indian information technology (IT) services firm to be selected for the project. As part of the project HCL worked closely with Boeing and some of Boeing’s tier-one suppliers in developing various onboard mission-critical software systems such as the electrical power generation and distribution system and the pilot controls. The multi-million dollar deal between HCL and Boeing valued at approximately US$110 million marked a significant point in HCL’s corporate history in that it had important implications for HCL and its future in the $644.3 billion aerospace and defence (A&D) industry.After 4 million hours of engineering services that culminated in the successful fulfillment of the requirements of the Dreamliner project the time was ripe for Rao to make a crucial strategic choice. HCL ERS could choose to continue to excel in offering great value to its customers by helping them optimize costs and improve delivery time or it could move up the value chain by investing more in research and development (R&D) capabilities thereby emerging as a leader rather than a follower in the highly complex and technology-driven A&D industry. BACKGROUND AND COMPANY PROFILEHCL was a large Indian multi-national IT services and product engineering solutions provider headquartered in Noida India. The firm was a subsidiary of the $5 billion HCL Enterprise with $2.3 billion in consolidated revenues as of September 30 2009 (trailing 12 months; see Exhibit 1). Though HCL was primarily an engineering services outsourcing company it positioned itself as a technology enabler and brought the end-customer’s experience to the forefront of its business. In 2009 HCL employed 54443 individuals and offered an integrated portfolio of services comprising software-led IT solutions remote infrastructure management engineering and R&D services and business process outsourcing across five industry verticals: manufacturing financial services health care public services and consumer services. The firm earned almost 21 per cent of its revenues from engineering and R&D services. HCL was successful in establishing its reputation as a trusted partner that could manage important research and development projects. When Boeing chose HCL to participate in the Dreamliner project this choice not only reinforced HCL’s reputation for reliability but also increased credibility about its overall competence. In line with the entrepreneurial spirit that HCL strived to inculcate among its employees the company referred to its engineers as “ideapreneurs.” Over the years HCL was able to develop and establish an ecosystem and a corporate culture that allowed these employees to freely ideate and innovate. On average HCL’s employees were older than those of competitors like Infosys Limited due to HCL’s policy of hiring mostly experienced engineers versus fresh engineering school graduates. Analysts estimated that almost 65 per cent of HCL’s total workforce consisted of experienced professionals. Employees received an average salary that was approximately 20 per cent higher than that offered by competitors. HCL’s global workforce mostly comprised Indian nationals but the company expected to change this in the future by hiring more American citizens in order to allay fears of job migration and job loss among a section of the American public. In this regard HCL demonstrated its commitment to the plan by opening a development and service centre in Raleigh North Carolina in 2008. The company planned to staff its Raleigh centre mainly with fresh graduates from American engineering schools. However by the end of 2009 HCL still had not fully staffed the centre. Meanwhile HCL continued to deliver its services to its customers through a network of offices in 26 countries across the world with a strong presence in the United States Western Europe and Asia.ENGINEERING AND R&D SERVICES DIVISIONThe ERS division formed the core of R&D at HCL. The division offered engineering and research and development services to its customers and remained unfailingly focused on the end-consumer’s product or service experience. Typical projects included complete reengineering of complex legacy flight test systems reducing costs for tier-one automotive component suppliers creating and maintaining customer-facing software platforms for customers across a wide range of high-tech industries and reducing the time to market for various industrial product manufacturers thereby enabling these original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to deliver a superior end-customer experience. The ERS division endeavoured to deliver this experience through a mix of three ingredients: faster delivery (acceleration) superior value creation (by striking the right balance between costs and benefits) and access to advanced technology based on research and development.HCL ERS served 10 industry verticals including aerospace and offered six horizontal engineering solutions across these verticals (see Exhibit 2). In 2008 HCL earned $1.9 billion from services. Out of this figure almost 25.2 per cent was earned by HCL ERS. The greatest share of revenues came from the telecommunications and networking sector (38 per cent) followed by the A&D sector (20 per cent). Medical equipment accounted for 12 per cent of revenue; computing hardware and software storage and office automation accounted for 10 per cent; consumer electronics accounted for 7 per cent; automotive accounted for 5 per cent; and the remaining 8 per cent of revenue was earned from other sectors. HCL’s annual investment in R&D—including infrastructure product development and intellectual property—had remained at $15 million since 2007.“Engineering Out of the Box”Senior executives at HCL including Rao acknowledged the need for HCL to move up the value chain while creating greater value for end-consumers their partners and themselves. With this goal in mind HCL ERS initiated its “engineering out of the box” (EOOTB) philosophy and method of service delivery in 2009. EOOTB involved looking at products and services as enablers or as means to an end as opposed to ends in themselves. EOOTB encompassed a collection of offerings termed “productized solutions” that were almost ready to be deployed. These solutions were subsequently customized to form a completely finished end product depending on specific customer requirements. Productized solutions were designed for efficiency as well as customizability.Apart from assisting HCL customers in reducing their time to market EOOTB provided a platform for creating meaningful differentiation. This philosophy of value creation and delivery was ultimately driven by the increasing complexity and sophistication of the end-consumer’s needs. At times technological innovations opened up the possibility of creating and delivering value in ways that had been previously unimaginable. For instance advancements in telematics made it possible for next-generation automobiles to communicate directly with consumers’ kitchen appliances allowing customers to heat dinner during their drive home from work.Further as core products became increasingly commoditized and the technology matured an ecosystem perspective of products allowed firms to create value by looking at how individual products functioned in conjunction with other products or services over and above their standalone functionalities. Consequently how consumers used products in combination or the overall end-consumer experience started to emerge as the most important factor in value creation. With EOOTB as its guiding principle HCL considered the end-customer as part of a larger ecosystem that included various products and services wherein the overall customer experience became central to designing solutions. Though the possibilities were immense the key question remained whether HCL was ready for the challenge.BOEING AND THE DREAMLINER PROJECTThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner reflected a paradigm shift in the way Boeing manufactured aircrafts. Deviating significantly from its traditional approach of developing most of the components and subassemblies Boeing outsourced almost 70 per cent of its aircraft production across 50 tier-one suppliers. These primary suppliers were in turn expected to integrate subsystems and subassemblies manufactured by tier-two and tier-three suppliers. Boeing restructured its role as the primary systems integrator. This arrangement resulted in aircraft components being sourced from more than 100 suppliers spread across 12 countries. The extent of outsourcing was not only unprecedented in the history of Boeing but also unheard of in the entire civil aviation industry. While Boeing claimed to have purchased 65 per cent of the Dreamliner’s airframe from outside suppliers Boeing’s major competitor Airbus SAS remained conservative purchasing only 52 per cent of the airframe from outside vendors. Reductions in production costs and delivery times were the most important factors that motivated outsourcing at Boeing. Other factors included expanding its global footprint in manufacturing and mitigating financial risk by tying supplier payments to aircraft sales. While leveraging a global supply chain and offshoring engineering services had its benefits it posed significant challenges especially for projects involving multi-tier suppliers. With multiple layers of contracting it was easy for OEMs like Boeing to lose visibility of the supply chain resulting in unprecedented delays cost overruns and quality problems. Though it was hailed as a revolutionary approach towards aircraft manufacturing the Dreamliner project cost Boeing $32 billion—a figure that was grossly over the initially planned budget of $6 billion. Moreover the first test flight took off two years behind schedule following six delay announcements. The production process aside the Dreamliner itself reflected major changes in its design and use of materials. For instance aluminum the material typically used to construct parts of the fuselage (skin and airframe) was replaced by much lighter and stronger composites which not only reduced structure fatigue and consequently maintenance cost but also fuel consumption. Another key way Boeing reduced the Dreamliner’s fuel consumption was by replacing the mechanical systems on board the Dreamliner with electrical and electronic systems; this made the aircraft lighter by almost 907 kilograms (2000 pounds). Boeing’s ultimate goal was to reduce the fuel consumption of the Dreamliner by as much as 20 per cent versus other aircrafts in the same category. This reduction was significant given the higher cruising speed that the Dreamliner was capable of flying at (Mach 0.85 and a top speed of Mach 0.98) compared to other similar aircrafts. These speeds were close not only to those of the Dreamliner’s predecessor the Boeing 767 and the directly comparable Airbus A300 but also to those of larger aircrafts. Further the new design improved passenger comfort by allowing better climate control and lowering cabin noise. The lighter weight also increased the operating range of the Dreamliner thereby reducing layovers and improving passenger convenience. The Dreamliner had a range of approximately 15279 kilometres.Boeing was already thinking beyond the Dreamliner’s dimmable windows and its starry ceilings in terms of improving passengers’ flying experience. Both Boeing and Airbus were experimenting and developing ideas involving radical shifts in structural design aircraft navigation and control and avionics—all with the ultimate aims of improving operational efficiency augmenting the flying experience and increasing passenger safety. One of these concepts for example included windowless fuselages with liquid-crystal display panels replacing the traditional smaller aircraft windows in order to present passengers with an interactive augmented reality experience. Boeing and Airbus were well on their way toward patenting some of these innovations. HCL ROCKWELL COLLINS INC. AND BOEINGHCL was introduced to Boeing by Rockwell Collins Inc. (Rockwell) an American corporation based out of Cedar Rapids Iowa. Rockwell which was a supplier of avionics and communications systems to the A&D sector was a tier-one supplier to Boeing and had approximately $4.4 billion in turnover in 2009. Rockwell specialized in flight deck avionics cabin electronics mission communications simulation and training and information management. HCL’s association with Rockwell had begun in 2000 with a much smaller verification and validation project not specific to avionics. Since this partnership HCL’s relationship with Rockwell had evolved and the two companies partnered in executing more complex and higher-valued projects. In 2007 HCL and Rockwell set up two offshore design development and verification centres in the Indian cities of Bangalore and Chennai—one in each city—with the aim of developing high-value software and hardware design and verification services for the aerospace industry. The centres employed a dedicated team of HCL engineers who worked closely with their Rockwell counterparts.Rockwell served as the systems integrator for the Dreamliner’s flight deck displays crew-alerting system and the more critical pilot controls communication and surveillance systems and common data network for the common core system. The integrated surveillance system which included critical functions like hazard detection traffic alerts collision avoidance Mode S surveillance and terrain avoidance and warning competencies was certified for the first time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the U.S. regulator and its European counterpart the European Aviation Safety Agency. A company spokesperson from Rockwell highlighted the importance of the company’s association with Boeing as part of the Dreamliner project; she emphasized that the project was considered to be a landmark given that none of Rockwell’s customers had previously entrusted the company with a project of such scale and scope. The project was commissioned in 2004 and valued at $3.5 billion over its lifetime. Rockwell subcontracted a part of the project involving verification design and development to HCL following Boeing’s approval in 2004. Specifically HCL was entrusted with developing the cabin software for the Dreamliner. This association with Rockwell represented HCL’s first aerospace engagement a fact that underscored the strategic importance of the project. Rockwell’s decision to subcontract was primarily driven by cost considerations. Other strategic and operational concerns involved access to good engineering talent and Rockwell’s motivation to expand its global footprint. Apart from HCL Rockwell partnered with firms like the Aeronautical Computing Technique Research Institute from Xi’an China and the China Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute Company in Shanghai. Rockwell outsourced project components mainly to India and China. Rockwell’s principal engineering manager for Commercial Systems Engineering (Design Support) Roger French explained:Our overall strategy is to increase our customer value. For instance our systems engineering and development skills are highly valued by our customers but there are other things that we don’t necessarily have to do in-house and those are the things we’re asking our subcontractors to assist us with.Similarly the vice president of Commercial Systems Engineering at Rockwell Steve Nieuwsma also emphasized the benefits of outsourcing: We save about 50 cents on the dollar when we ship something offshore and have it done in India. Last year we saved $17 million and we put that back into our organization which enabled us to chase new programs. Doing so ultimately leads to increased sales and revenues. It’s really a self-feeding economic engine for us. In 2008 Rockwell awarded its version of top performing supplier award to HCL in recognition of the services HCL had provided as part of the Dreamliner project. Moreover in February 2009 HCL was awarded the gold standard (the highest level) Boeing “Performance Excellence” award for exceptional services rendered to Boeing for the Dreamliner project. HCL was the only company to receive this award from among the 86 suppliers that were recognized by Boeing. HCL achieved this standard by maintaining a gold-level performance composite rating for each 12-month performance monitoring and measurement period starting from October 1 2007. Ultimately HCL went on to become the first Indian company to acquire the stringent industry-specific AS9100 quality standard certification awarded by the U.S.-based standards-developing organization SAE International. HCL HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND BOEINGApart from Rockwell HCL had close ties with Hamilton Sundstrand (Hamilton) a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) with headquarters in Windsor Locks Connecticut. HCL had collaborated with Hamilton since 2002. Hamilton was a major contractor to the commercial aviation industry as well as the defence and space sectors. The firm supplied electrical power generation and distribution systems engine accessories and control systems flight control systems and pilot controls and auxiliary power units (among other important systems) to OEMs like Boeing and Airbus. Further Hamilton had a history of successful engagements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spanning the preceding five decades. In 2005 HCL strengthened its relationship with Hamilton by establishing a dedicated design centre in Bangalore India with the aim of supporting Hamilton in its civil aviation projects by providing high-quality product engineering services. The leadership of both the companies duly acknowledged this development and the news was carried in most of the major national newspapers in India. In 2009 Hamilton had a total turnover of $6.5 billion while UTC’s was $52.9 billion. Hamilton employed a total of 16469 individuals and earned an operating profit of $857 million in 2009. As a tier-one supplier Hamilton supplied nine major systems—including the crucial onboard electrical system (ES)—to Boeing as part of the Dreamliner project. Hamilton subcontracted a part of the software development work pertaining to the ES to HCL. The main functionality of the ES involved distributing power to all other systems and components running on electricity onboard the Dreamliner. The ES was a vital component for the Dreamliner given that the Dreamliner represented a major change in aeronautical design wherein the legacy pneumatic systems that were powered by compressed air from the aircraft’s jet engines (also known as “bleed air” in aerospace parlance) were replaced by electrical systems guided by the overarching objectives of reducing fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency. This no-bleed ES architecture resulted in almost 3 per cent savings in fuel consumption efficient power distribution significant reduction in maintenance costs improved system reliability and thus greater operational efficacy and passenger safety. Due to its importance the ES was designated as a “Level A” system a system mandated for stringent testing before certification by the FAA. However in 2008 problems with the ES were reported: the FAA refused to certify the ES and instructed Hamilton to rewrite the software code relating to it. HCL’s role in developing the ES was also unfavourably highlighted in this context. Nevertheless Boeing refuted claims of any such major issues with the Dreamliner’s ES at that time. Later in 2008 at Boeing’s Everett facilities Hamilton announced the successful start-up of its APS 5000 the auxiliary power unit system (a major component of the ES) onboard the Boeing ZA001 a prototype of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.BUILDING TRUST AMONG PARTNERS AND MITIGATING RISK AT HCL Trust constituted the essential basis of long-term partnerships especially in the A&D industry given the complexity scale and scope and duration of projects typical of the industry. As compared to its closest competitors (e.g. Infosys Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro) HCL laid greater emphasis on forging deep long-term relationships with its partners; the company did this by looking beyond individual projects and consistently participating in larger projects that provided the scope for establishing long-term engagements. Though this practice carried greater risk it also increased the chances for securing repeat business. Investments in building trust remained a continuous endeavour for vendors like HCL given the inherent apprehension among tier-one suppliers about outsourcing larger and more complex work to their outsourcing partners. The suppliers’ concerns were mainly driven by quality concerns and the increased difficulty in monitoring outsourced projects. In order to alleviate these particular concerns HCL came up with a pricing and joint investment model: the Global Risk and Reward Partnership model (GRRP). As part of this initiative HCL agreed to share the financial risk associated with a given project by developing solutions on its balance sheet without having its customers pay anything upfront. Further HCL agreed to link its rewards to the final sales of products and services thereby sharing the demand-side risk with its customers as well. For OEMs GRRP presented additional benefits over and above risk mitigation and confidence building—the model enabled them to substantially reduce or even avoid the fixed and sunk costs associated with design and development. Avoiding these costs in turn allowed the OEMs to allocate their financial and managerial resources towards strengthening their core competencies. At the same time deciding what part of the development effort to outsource was not a trivial decision for the OEMs; such decisions were often a matter of extensive deliberations requiring foresight and a deep understanding of the OEM’s specific business. In such circumstances protection of intellectual property became a major concern for these companies. Unless otherwise stated the clients owned the intellectual property pertaining to any project thus commissioned; the vendors were bound by tight non-disclosure agreements. HCL was not an exception in this regard.THE GLOBAL ENGINEERING SERVICES OUTSOURCING INDUSTRYThe global engineering services outsourcing (ESO) industry was valued at approximately $1.8 billion in 2009 and was expected to grow to about $50 billion by 2020. Global engineering R&D spending grew from $980 billion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion in 2009 and was expected to reach approximately $1.4 trillion by 2020.There was a steady change in the portfolio of services and processes being outsourced: while in 2006 simpler and standardized services constituted almost 70 per cent of the portfolio of business for companies like HCL the share of such services dropped to 50 per cent in 2009. This share was expected to drop even further to 40 per cent by 2020. Specifically the commercial aviation industry witnessed a slow but steady value migration from OEMs like Boeing and Airbus to their suppliers (see Exhibit 3).In 2009 HCL was second only to Wipro but ahead of TCS and Infosys in terms of revenues. In the last quarter of 2009 HCL ERS had a turnover of approximately $121 million while Wipro achieved revenue of $163 million from its ESO business; during the same period the corresponding figures for TCS and Infosys were $76 million and $25 million respectively. Wipro and HCL dominated the ESO market with 72 per cent market share between them (Wipro: 42 per cent; HCL: 30 per cent); TCS and Infosys retained a market share of 20 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. While the ESO market grew by a compound annual growth rate of 10.7 per cent from 2007 to 2009 HCL ERS grew by approximately 14 per cent year-over-year since 2007. Though affected by the 2008 financial crisis the global ESO industry was expected to revive in the near future according to NASSCOM the trade association representing the Indian IT and business process outsourcing industries.THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRYThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner was the fastest-selling aircraft in the history of civil aviation. With a list price of $162 million per aircraft and the number of orders on book at 671 aircrafts Boeing had almost $109 billion worth of business in the pipeline in 2009. However sluggish market conditions in 2008 and 2009 saw net orders of aircraft dipping sharply from the pre-crisis level due to cancellations or deferrals (see Exhibits 4A and 4B). In addition the economic crisis resulted in a dramatic decline in industry profitability and put increased pressure on manufacturers as well as airliners to optimize costs and focus on higher-growth emerging markets (see Exhibit 5). The industry also witnessed concomitant decline in air travel during the same period though the long-term projections were positive (see Exhibit 5). Production of aircraft was relatively unaffected given the characteristically long lead times in this industry (see Exhibit 4A). Overall analysts remained positive about a quick recovery given the industry’s historical resilience against economic crises.Further labour cost as a percentage of the total operating cost of an aircraft continued to decline and fuel costs as a percentage of the same continued to increase (see Exhibit 6). At the 2008 average price level of crude oil in the international market fuel expenses represented almost 34.2 per cent of the total operating cost of a passenger airline. In comparison labour costs represented 21.5 per cent of the same. On the one hand industry profitability was highly sensitive to fuel costs and airlines tried to actively hedge against the risk of fluctuating international crude prices (see Exhibit 7). After the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 2001 crude price volatility increased manifold due to subsequent geopolitical developments. On the other hand climate change activism spearheaded by notable personalities like Al Gore continued to put significant pressure on airliners and manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprints. Partly because of this environmental pressure aircraft manufacturers began to gravitate towards cleaner and efficient propulsion technologies as well as electrification of flight control systems and actuators. Overall R&D spending by major A&D contractors was expected to rise despite a decline of 3.7 per cent in 2009. This decrement was supplemented by a sharp increase in investments in manufacturing in 2009 (see Exhibit 8). Boeing continued to make technological advancements with the Dreamliner and other next-generation aircraft as part of its ambitious “Yellowstone” project which was aimed at replacing all Boeing commercial aircraft with technologically advanced fuel-efficient next-generation ones over time. Public investment in R&D played a crucial role in achieving technological advancement and leadership in this industry. While the Government of India planned to invest heavily in upgrading and developing infrastructure pertaining to the A&D sector public spending in R&D in science and technology continued to dwindle below 1 per cent of the national gross domestic product. Naturally this was a matter of concern for both scientists as well as industry veterans like Rao. FIRST FLIGHT INTO THE FUTUREIn the technology-intensive engineering R&D services industry change represented both opportunity and risk and there remained a high premium on preparedness and quick response. Rao and his ERS division had been tasked with navigating HCL through some difficult and important decisions. Was HCL prepared for what lay ahead? Following the Dreamliner project what should HCL ERS’s next steps be? What implications could these steps have for the long-term profitability of the firm? More specifically should HCL continue to improve upon its existing capabilities or should it venture into building stronger R&D capabilities? The answers to these questions could determine the company’s future.EXHIBIT 1: HCL TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Ltd.’s German subsidiary presented a strategic co-operation proposal to Hisense’s headquarters. However after six months of heated debate Hisense’s decision makers still found it difficult to decide whether they should establish a strategic alliance with the German high-end television (TV) maker Loewe AG (Loewe). Loewe a 90-year-old company with a good reputation was suffering severe financial distress and preparing to file for bankruptcy protection. Loewe thus urgently needed both a new investor and a technology infusion to ease its huge financial pressure and help restructure its TV business. In turn Hisense despite being the world’s fourth-largest TV producer wanted to improve its brand reputation and believed an association with Loewe could help. Both companies would gain access to the other’s primary distribution networks. No matter the form of involvement Hisense would be risking significant financial losses if Loewe went bankrupt or continued to have unsatisfactory performance. LOEWE: A GERMAN luxury tv brand Loewe Technologies GmbH (Loewe) was a German high-end TV and entertainment system producer famous in Europe for its modern designs sleek user interfaces and high quality. Since it first invented and launched colour TVs in Germany Loewe had kept the promise of “Made in Germany” a business philosophy that was popular and welcomed by the European market. Despite Loewe’s high consumer recognition its luxury-brand positioning limited its product range which was only targeted at high-end customer needs. However fierce market competition and the diversification of customer needs forced TV producers to be both cost-effective and able to respond quickly to technological changes; otherwise they would face bankruptcy. As a result Asian producers had gradually dominated the TV industry. They were more cost-effective than other producers in various aspects of large-scale production in part due to their lower research and development (R&D) costs per product line and to their synergies in a wide range of products. Loewe’s flat-screen TVs even without the most advanced technologies and the best hardware configurations sold for as much as €5000 (US$6650) each. This led Loewe to struggle for survival in such a highly competitive industry. Loewe had suffered heavy losses for years due to its Asian competitors. Loewe’s sales revenue dropped from €374 million ($508 million) in 2008 to €250 million ($340 million) in 2012 (see Exhibit 1). In the first six months of 2013 Loewe’s sales worsened. Its revenue was €76.5 million ($104 million) a decline of 39 per cent versus the previous year and net losses rose to €26.7 million ($36 billion) for the period. If Loewe failed to make significant business adjustments it would go bankrupt. The Ideal New Investor for LoeweInitially the strategy for Loewe had been to negotiate with potential investors to ease its financial distress. Moreover Loewe hoped this new investor could also help restructure its TV business and strengthen its TVs’ competitiveness. In addition Loewe wanted to expand its business to other promising markets. However Loewe soon learned that no investor option could specifically meet all of its requirements and expectations.Among the potential investors who could help Loewe restructure and strengthen its TV business might be the main global TV producers. By 2008 the global TV market was dominated by Chinese Japanese and Korean producers. With the increasing competition between TV producers the market structure soon changed. By 2013 Chinese and Korean producers dominated because many Japanese TV producers had lost their competitive advantage and had withdrawn from the TV market (often by divesting their TV business). Thus it was highly unlikely that a Japanese TV producer would purchase a German TV producer. There were still Korean and Chinese TV producers potentially available. In the European high-end TV market Loewe’s market share prior to 2012 ranked second behind only Samsung. As a world-famous TV brand in its own right Samsung arguably did not need another brand label and did not necessarily want to help a competitor. LG another famous Korean brand was in the same situation as Samsung. The many Chinese TV producers such as Haier Changhong Konka and Skyworth undertook no TV manufacturing in Europe and exported few products from China to Europe. Therefore the possibility of them acquiring Loewe seemed low. Only two Chinese TV producers TCL and Hisense adopted localization strategies and might have the capabilities and interest to purchase Loewe. In the case of TCL in 2004 it acquired the French TV producer Thomson but subsequently encountered unanticipated integration difficulties. Therefore it seemed unlikely that TCL would quickly commit to purchase a German TV brand. Hisense’s Possible Role: Technical SupportHisense certainly had the potential ability to provide technical support to help Loewe strengthen the competitiveness of its TVs. In Hisense’s view the design and development of a new top-class product should be the priority for Loewe. Only if newly designed products attracted more consumers would Loewe be able to materially increase its sales. It was also difficult for Loewe to decide whether it should establish strategic co-operation with Hisense. If Loewe decided to co-operate with Hisense for technical support Loewe still needed to find another new investor within a short period of time and ensure that this new investor would support its restructuring proposal and the long-term strategic co-operation with Hisense. Hisense: A Chinese cost-effective TV BRANDHisense was founded in 1969 in Qingdao China. It was a leading global company producing consumer electronics household appliances information technology equipment and mobile communication devices with 69000 employees worldwide. Hisense was best-known for its smart TVs and had been the Chinese flat-screen-TV champion since 2004. After gradually accumulating technological capability international experience and overseas distribution channel resources Hisense began in 2007 to adopt its own brand internationalization strategy and give priority to overseas market expansion. The effect of this strategy was obvious: by 2013 Hisense had become the world’s fourth-largest TV producer.Though Hisense had a large sales volume it was not yet a globally prominent brand. For example Hisense had a relatively small market share in Europe and North America. Thus if Hisense wanted to become a truly global brand it needed to further improve its market share in these two regions.To increase its limited European market share Hisense could expand and strengthen co-operation with local distribution channels. In addition co-operation with well-known European producers such as Loewe could potentially help Hisense expand its brand awareness and enhance its European sales volume. If Hisense was to establish some form of strategic co-operation with Loewe it would have to be based on comprehensive consideration of four aspects: market demand brand demand technology demand and channel demand.Market DemandIn 2004 Hisense began to expand in Europe choosing Germany France Italy Britain and Spain as its focal markets. It soon encountered great challenges such as the complexity of products’ design and development the lack of local business experience and professional talent and cultural and language barriers. Regarding product design and development for example despite their geographic proximity to each other these five European countries differed greatly in their TV formats certification standards and TVs’ local intelligent applications. If Hisense wanted to expand its TV business there it would have to adjust its products to match various local technical standards and meet different consumer usage preferences on a country-by-country basis. These high market-entry barriers presented great difficulties for Hisense.Despite these difficulties Hisense was making strong efforts to expand there. David He Hisense’s European sales director said:We have a lot of opportunities in Europe and this market is Hisense’s blue ocean.’ Why? Currently only a few Asian TV brands are active the European TV market. Japanese brands have exited or are preparing to exit this market. And except for Hisense and TCL other Chinese TV producers who are very competitive in China and many other overseas markets have not expanded their businesses in Europe yet. European TV brands such as Loewe and Metz [Metz Consumer Electronics GmbH] with both long histories and good reputations only focus their TV businesses on the high-end market segment. Although the number of TV producers is declining European consumers still need to buy TVs and it is highly unlikely that they would want to select TVs only between the Samsung [Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.] and LG [LG Corporation] brands. Therefore as long as we can overcome the initial entry barriers and difficulties we are confident we can achieve good sales performance in the future. In contrast the Chinese market has too many brands competing there. Almost every day we are forced to face “barbaric” price wars and only have “paper-thin profit margins.” Our domestic TV market is really a “red ocean.”If Hisense and Loewe could establish strategic co-operation Loewe could provide Hisense its European business experience and a distribution network in the high-end TV market (see Exhibit 2). In turn Hisense could offer Loewe marketing experience in selling TVs in Asia and access to the Asian market.Brand DemandThough Hisense’s brand was famous in China most European consumers had never heard of it. When European consumers selected traditional home appliances they were very unwilling to accept products of little-known brands. However to build a famous brand the company needed unremitting brand construction efforts for a long time. Then the brand could gradually gain recognition by consumers. Hisense had adopted two ways of improving its brand reputation: one was to strengthen its own brand building and the other was to establish strategic co-operative relationships with well-known European companies.First Hisense actively attended global consumer electronics tradeshows and sponsored popular sporting events. The tradeshows with a significant impact provided Hisense with opportunities to meet key retailers buyers and the media. These stakeholders could help Hisense expand in Europe and in other new locations. Sponsoring sporting events could enable Hisense’s brand to become familiar to more people. Indeed these brand construction efforts helped Hisense expand its brand influence.Second Hisense also actively looked for technical co-operation with many well-established European companies. Though such partners might present high requirements such as product models and production standards Hisense would gain the benefits of co-brand advertising. If Hisense was to establish a strategic co-operative relationship with Loewe for example it might be able to “stand on the shoulders of a giant” and be more easily accepted by European consumers and distribution channels.Technology DemandIn 2007 Hisense founded a European R&D centre in the Netherlands in order to gain a better understanding of European consumers’ needs and be able to provide them with the most suitable products. The main task of this R&D centre was to help Hisense’s China-based R&D centre collect information on product features technical requirements consumer usage habits certification standards and so on. Based on this information Hisense’s domestic R&D centre could then design new products or make functional adjustments to the existing ones to cater to the European market’s needs. With sufficient technological and marketing experience in Europe Hisense would then be able to provide TVs that could meet local preferences.Among global TV producers Hisense had its own advanced panel-display technologies and was a leader in drafting international light-emitting diode (LED) backlight standards. Moreover Hisense held a lead in Internet and intelligent application technologies and had launched the first personal smart TV globally. Hisense also excelled at hardware design and had developed and built China’s first mass liquid crystal display (LCD) module production line. If Hisense was to apply its own advanced display technologies to Loewe’s products and help Loewe design its TVs’ hardware it would help Loewe increase its TVs’ competitiveness. Furthermore by co-operating with Loewe Hisense could expand the application range of its TV technologies.Channel DemandThe traditional TV distribution channels mainly included appliance retail chains supermarkets and independent retailers. With the development of the Internet more and more consumers had begun to shop online. Thus most distributors had gradually developed their online business. As a result TV producers had to arrange and balance product categories and pricing not only between different distribution channels but also between each distribution channel’s online and offline sales. Moreover due to differentiated consumer shopping habits and behaviour the business scale proportions of channel types and the proportion of online and offline sales also differed greatly in each European country. This made it quite difficult for TV producers to manage such a complicated distribution network across countries. For example for each of Hisense’s TV products which distribution channels were suitable and willing to sell it? How should Hisense price it for the different distribution channels? Should this product be sold online or offline or both? If both should the prices of the same TV product be the same or different? It was quite hard to arrange its distribution channels because TV producers first needed to possess in-depth knowledge of distribution channels and consumer consumption characteristics. They also needed to adopt different co-operation strategies with various types of distribution channels in different countries. They further needed to arrange and coordinate product prices product models time to market logistics and after-sales services in different European countries. All these issues were very difficult and time-consuming for Hisense to learn and adapt to. If Loewe could provide relevant experience to Hisense Hisense would save time and avoid at least some missteps.Conflicting Views from Hisense: Worthwhile or Not? Hisense’s German subsidiary presented the co-operation proposal to Hisense’s headquarters in early January 2013. This proposal was discussed at length and not approved. Hisense’s decision makers had conflicting viewpoints in terms of Loewe’s sales potential difficulties in designing and developing Loewe’s new TVs the two parties’ strength in terms of resources and management Hisense’s potential gains and Loewe’s potential bankruptcy risk. Detailed discussion followed.Loewe’s Sales VolumeLoewe was positioned as a luxury TV brand with many people marvelling at its unique designs and quality. However only a few consumers could afford its TVs at such high prices. Because of its low unit sales volume Loewe had been slower to update its TV technologies than other mass TV producers. Loewe’s product competitiveness had thus declined. In the TV industry sales volume was a very important indicator of a producer’s survival. Youhai Yu Hisense’s former European general manager said:Loewe usually just sells hundreds of thousands of TVs globally each year while Hisense sells tens of millions of TVs. Therefore Hisense has obvious competitive superiority over Loewe in terms of bargaining power over suppliers production efficiency ability to spread R&D expenses over products and other perspectives. Scale is a magic weapon for winning in the TV industry. The strengths and weaknesses of Loewe according to Yu were as follows: One Loewe TV creates much more profit than one Hisense TV. Profits from the co-operation with Loewe will better support Hisense’s expansion in Europe.However Loewe’s scale is too small and its products are quite different from ours. This will cause us a lot of trouble. For example the guaranteed period for our TV parts is five years but Loewe requires a 10-year guarantee. Given Loewe’s requirements we would have to obtain specialized procurement from our global suppliers for its TV parts. This procurement quantity is so small that only a subset of our global suppliers would be willing to accept such a small order.Difficulties in Designing and Developing Loewe’s New TVsIf Hisense and Loewe decided to jointly design Loewe’s new products they might encounter at least two major challenges: product development time and complex product development co-ordination. If they decided to combine the two companies’ R&D advantages Loewe would be primarily responsible for software design and Hisense for hardware design. However Loewe’s new product development required a long time. It was unknown whether new products would be successful. To launch new TVs rapidly Loewe and Hisense would need to quicken their development speed. However the two companies had different R&D management principles and processes and would need time to adapt to each other. David He also Hisense’s leader for strategic co-operation in addition to his European sales director role said:If we want to jointly develop Loewe’s new products we would have to coordinate between Hisense’s R&D partners in China the Netherlands and the United States Hisense’s Chinese and German R&D centres and Loewe’s headquarters in Germany and subsidiary in China. You can imagine how complicated the coordination of this project would be as hundreds of engineers from different companies would take part. Another problem is that you cannot ensure that everyone has enough initiative to undertake this project. The most difficult thing is that Loewe still requires a very high standard for all its new products though it is encountering severe difficulties. One supporting argument according to He was that: Hisense has established many strategic co-operative relationships with various global leading high-tech companies and has also founded several overseas R&D centres. Therefore we need to further optimize our global R&D efficiency and accumulate more international R&D co-operation experience. Strategic co-operation with Loewe would be a good opportunity to improve ourselves.One opposing argument according to Xiaofeng Lin Hisense’s R&D director was that: Every company’s R&D resources are limited. We export our products to more than 130 countries and regions every year. Because each has its specific requirements for our products our R&D staff have to make adjustments according to different requirements. Moreover our R&D staff also need to develop new technologies and new products for our global market. Therefore considering our limited R&D resources our R&D staff should focus more on our own products.Analysis of the Two Companies’ Resource and Management Superiority Loewe’s strengths were embodied in its luxury brand strict quality-control system prestigious design capabilities well-established distribution network and marketing experience in selling TVs in the high-end TV market. Comparatively Hisense’s strengths were embodied in its high R&D efficiency and capacity innovative display and intelligent application technologies large-scale procurement and manufacturing cost control system and marketing experience in selling TVs in highly competitive markets. If Loewe and Hisense could establish strategic co-operation Hisense would help Loewe design its TVs’ hardware and provide Loewe with marketing experience in Asia; in turn Loewe would provide Hisense with Loewe’s European marketing experience in the high-end TV market and Loewe’s distribution network. The strengths and weaknesses of Loewe according to Lan Lin Hisense’s vice president were as follows:Though we have been striving to improve our brand image our top-class products can only be accepted by consumers who are willing to purchase at medium prices. We still lack sufficient marketing experience and available distribution channels in the European high-end TV market. If we co-operate with Loewe distribution channels and consumers will accept our products at higher prices more easily. The advertising effect of this co-operation will be very helpful for us to improve our brand reputation and expand our business in the high-end TV market.However Loewe is a luxury TV brand. Because of its long history consumers will pay a premium for its products. Because Loewe is unique it cannot be imitated or replicated by other TV competitors. It is currently unrealistic for Hisense to position itself as a high-end TV brand and we need to improve our brand image step-by-step. If we use Loewe’s marketing experience and distribution network and then think that we can sell Hisense’s same products at higher prices in Europe it will be a big strategic mistake. Enhancing our brand image will take a long time.Hisense’s Potential GainsBy 2013 Hisense had been expanding in Europe for nine years. Before considering the strategic co-operation with Loewe Hisense had established not only its European headquarters in Germany but also a European R&D centre and several subsidiaries in many main consumption regions in Europe. Hisense’s Czech TV factory was also under construction and planning to manufacture TVs in 2015. Therefore the first step of Hisense’s strategic approach to Europe was nearly complete. Hisense’s next step was to improve its European sales volume and its brand reputation. Hisense’s decision makers who supported the co-operation with Loewe said that: It can help us enhance our brand reputation in Europe. When people talk about Loewe Hisense will be mentioned as well. Moreover Loewe can help us extend our distribution network in the European high-end TV market and provide us with the relevant marketing experience. The potential profits from the joint development will be satisfactory. We really need to accumulate international R&D co-operation experience. Product design co-operation with Loewe is a good opportunity.Hisense’s decision makers who objected to the co-operation with Loewe said that:Firstly co-operation with Loewe will increase the pressure on Hisense’s R&D system and procurement system. Secondly this joint development project needs a long period of time. Thirdly it is uncertain whether this project will be successful and how much Hisense can benefit from this co-operation. Hisense will deviate from its consistent business philosophy of steady management if co-operating with Loewe.Loewe’s Potential Bankruptcy RiskAs Hisense considered the issue of co-operation with Loewe Loewe was on the verge of bankruptcy. It needed to find a new investor and also to make significant adjustments to strengthen the competitiveness of its TV business. However Hisense was not particularly interested in making an equity investment in Loewe—only in possibly providing Loewe with technical support. It was beyond Hisense’s control whether Loewe could find a suitable new investor and a feasible restructuring scheme. These issues also played an important role in determining whether Loewe would survive.One positive view at Hisense was that:Loewe’s decline in recent years is caused by its slower response to new technologies and hardware updates especially its hardware updates. The design and development of high-tech hardware is exactly our strength. If we can integrate the two companies’ complementary R&D capabilities the new products will be very popular and Loewe will survive.A more negative view at Hisense was that:The TV industry is a sunset industry characterized by production overcapacity a slow increase in consumption demand and relatively low profit margins. So I think it is difficult to find some investors who would like to invest in the highly competitive TV industry. Moreover Loewe’s scale of sales is small and Loewe always persists on the promise of “Made in Germany.” Both of these two points deviate from the TV industry’s two general principles of large-scale production and outsourcing manufacturing to lower-cost regions. Thus it will be even more difficult for Loewe to find a new investor let alone find an ideal new investor within a short period of time. If Loewe cannot find the new investor everything is over!Loewe’s New Product PlanningOne objective of any new co-operation would be to jointly design and develop Loewe’s new products. To a large extent these new products would determine whether Loewe would be able to retake its lost market share and survive its bankruptcy crisis. However with regard to Loewe’s future product planning Hisense’s decision makers held different concerns. One Hisense decision maker said that:It is better for us to help Loewe design a wider TV product range spanning medium-end to high-end products which can subsequently attract more consumers. However if Loewe also provides medium-end products it may compete with part of our higher-end products. This will negatively influence Hisense’s high-end products’ sales. This effect should be taken seriously. Another problem would be whether we should provide our best designs to Loewe or keep them for our own use.Another Hisense’s decision maker said that:If Loewe begins to provide TVs with mid-range hardware configurations in the market because of its luxury brand positioning these products may be even more expensive than Samsung’s products with the highest hardware configurations. In this case I think consumers will prefer to purchase Samsung’s highest-end products than Loewe’s medium-end products. In my opinion it is more reasonable for Loewe to develop only high-end TVs that are as good as or better than Samsung’s highest-end TVs. For the same high-end level of TVs Loewe could sell its high-end TVs at prices much higher than Samsung’s because of Loewe’s brand premium. Consumers will find it relatively easier to accept Loewe’s high-end TVs at the highest prices in the market. Therefore Loewe is only suitable for selling the best TVs at the highest prices in the high-end market segment. Hisense’s technical support for Loewe is critical because only by combining Loewe’s traditionally outstanding software designs with Hisense’s best hardware designs could Loewe then provide TVs that are at least good enough to compete with Samsung’s.For Hisense’s decision makers it was unclear how to proceed.EXHIBIT 1: KEY FINANCIAL DATA FOR LOEWE AG 2008–2012 (€ MILLION)Note: EBIT = earnings before interest and tax; DVD = digital video discSource: Created by authors using data from www.morningstar.com.EXHIBIT 2: lcd tv market in western europe and loewe’s shareNote: LCD TV = liquid crystal display television; € = EUR = European euro; €0.76 = US$1 on January 2 2013.

In September 2015 Pascal Réty vice-president of sales for Logset Oy (Logset)—a privately held specialized forest machine manufacturing firm in Koivulahti Finland—was reviewing the latest sales estimates for the year. The forecast for 2015 was €30 million. Sales had plummeted in 2009 but since then they had been steadily increasing year over year and were now almost back to where they had been in 2007. With sales on the rebound Réty wondered if it was time for Logset to rethink its strategy for Canada an undeniably appealing market with 42 per cent of its land mass covered by forest. Nordic manufacturers such as Logset had been struggling to establish themselves in North America since the 1980s with mixed results. While other manufacturers chose to focus on the much larger American market Logset had focused its efforts on the Canadian market. Quebec and Ontario represented about 10 per cent of Logset’s annual turnover; however despite 15 years’ effort there had been no appreciable increase in company sales or significant interest among potential customers in Atlantic or Western Canada. The need to push forward into new markets was important to Logset as it had been in a break-even and/or slightly profitable position for over 10 years. For Logset profitability depended not only on remaining competitive but also on staying ahead of the competition with innovative product developments. For a small firm maintaining this position was a challenge. Despite low profitability Logset had managed to as Réty put it “Stay on top of its class with the full product range.” Logset had registered as an exhibitor for the upcoming Canadian Woodlands Forum in Maple Ridge British Columbia. This event could be the opportunity the firm needed to make inroads into the Western Canadian market for specialized forestry equipment. Company BackgroundLogset was founded in 1992 by Gustav Frantzén Seppo Koskinen and Kristian Stén who acquired the forest machine business assets of Oy Norcar Ab (Norcar) when the estate of Norcar was forced into receivership. The sales agreement gave Logset access to Norcar’s spare part and trade-in machine inventory allowing Logset to maintain the distribution network with refurbished machines and spare parts. To become a manufacturer rather than just a re-seller Logset needed functional harvester technology. In 1996 the firm entered into a cooperative agreement with Jukka Kivipelto and Kari Mikkilä at Oy Fomac International FI Ltd. (Fomac) to develop both a new line of forwarders (F Series) and its first harvester (the Logset 8H Titan clear-cut harvester). In 2002 Logset formally merged with Fomac. In 2005 Logset’s owners sold 70 per cent of the company to a group of Finnish investors represented by Primaca Partners. In 2006 Logset became part of the PiloMac group and in 2012 the two firms merged under the name Logset Oy.By 2015 Logset’s product line included seven forwarders six harvesters and seven harvester heads (see Exhibit 1). Its distribution network covered 20 countries and Logset machines were operating in more than 25 countries. COMPANY approach to InternationalizingLogset’s mission was to provide logging professionals with forest machines that were reliable productive and functional. It had adopted a functional organizational structure. The sales department was divided into two geographic units: Finland Area and International (see Exhibit 2). From its Finnish location Logset provided equipment and spare parts as well as direct customer support to customers in Europe and to dealers elsewhere. The firm’s strengths were its build-to-order business model dealer network and highly personalized customer service. Logset’s approach to internationalizing was to establish one exclusive importer/distributor arrangement per market (see Exhibit 3). The importers/distributors were typically independent agents who bought the machines outright and then resold them to the end customer. The firm provided training and after-sales product/technical service support to both dealers and customers. In the 1990s Logset began to internationalize with exports to Russia. Although Russia remained an important market for the firm sanctions imposed by the European Union on the sale of logging equipment to Russia in 2015 temporarily halted exports. Along with Russia Germany became an important focus for Logset and had a 10 per cent market share—in a market where the top three brands held more than 50 per cent. Entry into France followed in 1995. Sales were slow in the beginning but by 2015 France was Logset’s largest market outside of Finland. In spite of Norcar’s long-standing relationships with its Swedish dealers it was not until 2005 that Logset was able to deliver its first machine to a Swedish customer. In 2010 Logset began expanding into South America with sales to Chile Brazil and French Guyana. In 2015 a customer in Australia received the largest forwarder ever made by the firm a Logset 12F with a 20-tonne capacity. By 2015 international sales represented 80 per cent of total revenue (see Exhibit 4). The challenges Logset faced differed by region. In Europe where the comfort of the operator was the principal concern the firm mostly sold replacement machines. In North America where safety was the main concern the firm’s machines were too small to safely remove large trees. In Brazil and Russia where timber was still being felled by hand and hauled out by horses persuading operators to mechanize was the biggest hurdle.Forestry in CanadaCanada’s forestry industry like many other industries was undergoing structural change due to (a) changing consumer preferences particularly for print materials; (b) new markets in Asia for forest products; and (c) technologies that reduced carbon emissions and energy use. In 2013 Canada held 9 per cent of the world’s total forest resources and 24 per cent of the world’s total boreal forest. Forty-five per cent of Canada’s land mass (417.6 million hectares) was forested 56 per cent was considered commercial forest (234.5 million hectares) and less than 0.5 per cent was harvested each year. The forested areas managed for timber production were 94 per cent publicly owned and primarily located in the Boreal Shield Atlantic Maritime Montane Cordillera and Pacific Maritime ecozones. Canada’s forest resources were expected to remain stable as losses to deforestation were at 0.02 per cent. At the same time climate change was affecting Canada’s forests: the northern tree line was moving further north and aspen were being lost along the southern edge of the boreal forest.The annual allowable cut was regulated by the governments in the provinces with commercial forest resources but the amount harvested was often less than the allowable cut. The amount harvested had been declining since 2006 due to reduced demand for newsprint reduced demand for lumber in the U.S. housing market and the global economic downturn. In 2012 148 million cubic metres—out of an allowable annual cut of 277 million cubic metres—were harvested. In addition all areas harvested on provincial lands had to be regenerated by re-planting and/or seeding.The principal harvesting methods used in the forestry industry were clearcut or shelterwood for stands of trees of roughly the same age and single-tree selection for uneven-aged stands of trees. The trees could be sectioned in one of five ways: cut-to-length tree length full length whole tree or complete tree (see Exhibit 5). Of these methods tree length was historically the preferred method; however as the cut areas became smaller and more distributed the cut-to-length method was attracting increased attention. The tree-felling methods were typically separated into three categories: (a) hand felling with a chainsaw and a cable skidder; (b) a feller buncher with a grapple skidder delimber and slasher; and (c) a cut-to-length harvester with a forwarder. Hand felling was best suited for large-diameter trees or precision logging. Feller buncher logging which made use of a mechanized harvester head was well suited for harvesting large volumes of low-grade wood for pulp or chip markets. Finally the harvester used in cut-to-length logging did the work of three machines (feller buncher delimber and slasher); coupled with a forwarder it caused less environmental damage and could operate on softer ground which extended the logging season.THE Forestry Equipment IndustryWorld demand for forestry equipment was expected to increase 4.5 per cent annually to US$9.3 billion in 2019 but primarily in developing countries. In the developed markets where Canada and the United States accounted for almost one-third of global demand growth was expected to be more modest (2–3 per cent annually) be driven by improving economic conditions and have a continuing focus on using technology to reduce operating costs and increase outputs. Technological improvements to ground-based logging systems (rendering them suitable for steep terrain) and the development of autonomous machines were two key equipment trends. Other trends included the use of wireless communications and global positioning systems to monitor and manage equipment. Forestry equipment was a sub-classification of the “construction and forestry machinery” industry classification as equipment suitable for the construction industry (i.e. road-building equipment) was often used in forestry operations and certain types of construction equipment could be modified to serve specific forestry operations; for example a harvester head could be attached to an excavator thereby extending the utility of the base equipment. Not surprisingly the top five global construction equipment manufacturers (Caterpillar Inc. Komatsu Limited Hitachi Ltd. Volvo Construction Equipment and Terex Corporation) offered a full range of standardized equipment for road building along with specialized machinery for harvesting extracting and loading operations. Hence they were formidable competitors for firms focused only on harvesting equipment. Equipment designed solely for harvesting extracting and loading operations was developed initially in Sweden and Finland and the leading manufacturers of such equipment were still the Nordic firms—Ponsse OYJ (Ponsee) Rottne Industri AB Eco Log Sweden AB Gremo AB and Logset. Of these Ponsse was the largest with sales of over 700 specialized machines per year (see Exhibit 6). There was little to differentiate the products of one manufacturer from another although the Nordic equipment was preferred because the machines were technologically more advanced lighter and more economical to operate. Nonetheless all of the manufacturers tended to focus their design efforts on improving (a) reliability to reduce the number of breakdowns and the cost of maintenance (b) engine efficiency to reduce fuel consumption and (c) operator training to allow for troubleshooting in the forest. Two new developments were being pursued: equipment for mechanized re-seeding (scarifiers planting machines silviculture and biomass heads and felling heads) and tethered or winch-assisted logging systems for steep slope logging. Suppliers to the industry were numerous as most of the components were standard off-the shelf items (e.g. tires tracks diesel engines drives and control systems). However the installed computer system that handled all of the machine operations including management reporting was a custom application.Buyers had little control over price but they did have choices. Buyer considerations included increasing production reducing fuel consumption durability and ease of operation. Ease of operation was a consideration because of a shortage of skilled operators. In support of this need for skilled operators all of the major manufacturers had developed forest machine simulators for enhanced operator training on harvesters and forwarders. For Canadian buyers two other considerations were import duties and safety. With the exception of machines purchased from Tigercat International Inc. (Tigercat)—the only Canadian manufacturer of harvester equipment—all other machine purchases were subject to import duties. The Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 eliminated import duties on machines imported into Canada from the United States and it was hoped that the implementation of the 2014 Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement would do the same for machines imported from the European Union. Removing the import duties on forestry equipment from Europe would make Nordic equipment more attractive to buyers in terms of price and would also improve the attractiveness of the industry for suppliers. Machines with remote control capability were of interest for safety reasons. Injury rates in the forestry industry were a concern because they were typically higher than in other industries. In British Columbia for example the injury rate in the forestry industry was almost double that of all other industries (in 2012 the injury rate per 100 workers was 5.0 compared to 2.3 for all other industries). Operators of feller bunchers and harvesters for example worked from the safety of an enclosed cab which reduced the chances of injury from falling trees or branches. The most common substitutes for specialized forestry equipment were in the form of modifications to standard construction equipment or used equipment (e.g. as noted attaching a harvester head to an excavator mechanized the tree-felling process and turned an excavator into a dual-purpose machine). Used machines were often used as trade-ins on the purchase of a new machine creating a ready supply of previously owned equipment. An inventory check of a major North American used equipment supplier over a four-month period showed the stability of this market (see Exhibit 7). Logset’s Canadian PresenceLogset began investigating the potential of the Canadian market in 2000. The firm signed an agreement with Wajax Equipment (Wajax) a heavy equipment supplier to the mining industry to provide forwarders in Eastern Canada. Corporate changes at Wajax ended this relationship within a year or two of signing. In 2015 Logset had one Canadian dealer who was responsible for the Quebec market and had been with the firm since 2009. Five agents had been added to the dealer network since 2009 to service the Ontario and New Brunswick markets. Some 15 machines a year were sold by the dealer/agent network of which 80 per cent of these were new. Forwarders typically cost CA$450000 to $650000 and wheel-based harvesters cost CA$800000 to $1000000 including delivery. The Canadian customer base represented 150 to 200 operators many of which were small contractors with one to three machines. The most cost-effective solution for small operators was to mount a harvester head on an excavator rather than purchasing a full machine. The excavator could be used for other purposes such as road building or snow plowing. The nature of the harvester head was such that it could fit on a harvester provided by Tigercat or TimberPro Inc. the two biggest competitors to Logset in the Canadian market. Customers would typically trade in their machines at the five-year mark thereby creating a supply of used machines. Réty believed customers sought out Logset machines because they were reliable and economical to operate and they provided a comfortable ergonomic working environment for the operator. In addition the relationship between Logset the dealer and the end user was one of trust that had been built over a number of years. Logset employees prided themselves on recognizing their customers’ faces. To ensure the firm’s equipment met the continuing needs of its customers 12 employees were working with suppliers on a variety of research and development initiatives. The firm’s latest addition to its product portfolio the 12H GTE Hybrid Harvester (a combination of a diesel engine plus a generator/electric motor) was the only one of its kind. Logset wanted to increase its sales by an additional five to ten machines each year; the principal impediment to this goal was the lack of a dealer for Western Canada. The ideal dealer was difficult to source especially from a distance as this dealer would need good connections within the logging industry and a commitment to the Logset product line along with significant financial assets. Canadian dealers had to have at least four new and one or more used machines on site as well as €300000 worth of spare parts in order to service the local market. (Delivery time on a new machine was upwards of four months so dealers would sell from inventory. Spare parts could be delivered within four to five days out of Finland.) Dealer relationships were further challenged by the lack of direct contact with end customers (although personnel from Logset made regular visits to customer sites whenever they were in Canada) and the limited control Logset had over customer buying decisions particularly as dealers could carry competing products. Recognizing that the lack of a dealer for Western Canada was an important problem for Logset Réty was planning to attend the next Canadian Woodlands Forum. He hoped that by participating in this event he might be able to recruit a Western Canada dealer from among the visitors and/or other exhibitors. Failure to recruit a dealer would probably mean the firm would need to look elsewhere for its next opportunity.

Ltd. (JIT Technology) was sitting in his office in Longhua District Shenzhen China. He was reading the company’s 2011 statement of financial position which the director of finance had given to Li. The company had a high level of accounts receivables (AR) in 2010: a total of ¥20637946 accounted for 60 per cent of the company’s working capital. In 2011 the AR figure had risen to ¥27977006 accounting for 63 per cent of working capital. Meanwhile profit after tax for the years 2010 and 2011 were ¥4654176 and ¥4748265 respectively. Moreover the number of turnover days for AR a very important index was not promising. As the AR figure increased the time it took to settle them was also increasing—from 45–60 days to 90 and sometimes even 120 days or more. (The average AR turnover rate for the manufacturing industry was about 4.08 and the average AR turnover days overall was about 90 days.) These factors made the company’s operation and management of funds difficult. The company was a small sole proprietorship and Li had recently had to borrow money for the company using his own property as collateral in order to solve the cash-flow shortage. At that time the one-year loan rate was about 6.5 per cent. What should Li do to solve these problems? BackgroundJIT Technology was established in 1999. The company provided a range of electronics chemical materials ancillary equipment and precision adhesive products for the electrical and electronics industries. The core products included insulating materials glue coating equipment adhesives and organic silicon materials. JIT Technology was a small private company established solely by Li who was Singaporean. The company had only ¥1 million in registered capital and fewer than 100 employees some of whom were Li’s relatives or friends. Its organizational structure included four main departments under the general manager’s office: finance human resources marketing and inventory (see Exhibit 1).Evolution of AR Policy at JIt TechnologyThe sales and financial staff explained that there had been fewer than ten staff members when the company was first established. As was the practice in most Chinese companies sales staff at JIT Technology who were authorized to extend credit to customers were also responsible for collecting accounts receivable. However there were no rewards or penalties associated with collecting these receivables. JIT Technology management staff were unaware of the serious problem of high AR until 2002 when the collection period for AR became longer and longer with increasing sales volumes and an increasing number of sales personnel. A new regulation was established that kept salespeople responsible for collecting AR but asked senior leaders to urge the marketing staff to collect AR as soon as possible. However at that time there were still no specific quantitative terms that associated the AR collection period with any reward or penalty.General RulesWhen the problem of AR became more serious JIT Technology finally formulated a written reward and penalty policy for the marketing staff based on its own situation and the methods of other companies in the same industry and introduced this to the marketing staff at the end of 2009. This policy was developed by the company and the marketing staff and was intended to provide incentives and motivation to the marketing staff and eliminate their concerns about the future. The policy was formalized in writing and applied to all staff members involved with marketing.The policy included the salary system (a basic salary plus commission) the assessment system the payment collection requirements and the relevant rules and used the following formulas:Note: Costs included material costs customs duties and freight costs for delivery to Hong Kong and outside the province.Note: Miscellaneous costs included entertainment costs and commissions; delivery costs included delivery to Hong Kong and outside the province.The maximum commission was 2 per cent for transactions under ¥5000 regardless of the gross profit margin. Salespeople would be paid a fixed salary of ¥1500 if sales were less than ¥100000 per month and this base salary would increase as monthly sales volumes and profit rates increased (see Exhibit 2).Here are some examples of how JIT Technology’s sales commission policy was applied:If salesperson A’s monthly sales volume was ¥150000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 30 per cent the sales commission would be (¥150000 × 30% × 2.2%) = ¥990.If salesperson B’s monthly sales volume was ¥210000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 35 per cent the sales commission would be ¥1764.If salesperson C’s monthly sales volume was ¥260000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 50 per cent the sales commission would be ¥3510.If salesperson D’s monthly sales volume was ¥500000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 22 per cent the sales commission would be ¥2200. If salesperson E’s monthly sales volume was ¥920000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 77 per cent the sales commission would be ¥35420.The commission structure would be revised yearly or whenever the managing staff thought that it was necessary to do so. The board of directors of JIT Technology reserved the right of final explanation. Performance Assessment and Calculation The probationary period for new sales staff was three months. For those who sold few orders or none (that is those whose sales revenue was less than ¥50000) the basic salary ranged from ¥500 to ¥1000 depending on the individual’s marketing experience and the company’s needs at the time. New sales staff who achieved monthly sales over ¥50000 received the same basic salary and commission rate as established salespeople.New staff members were not assessed in the first month but their performance was assessed each month beginning in the second month. The company paid commission bonuses month-by-month. Travel expenses were claimed at cost.Rules for Payment Collection The confirmation of clients was an essential step in the sales and payment process. When they concluded their first deal with the client salespeople asked each client to fill in an application form outlining company profile details. These details were entered into the client information system. Salespeople needed to ensure that all basic client information was documented including the exact address the amount of registered capital the legal representatives the business scope the size of the manufacturing field the relationship of JIT Technology’s products to the client and the potential amount of business that could be expected from the client. The final steps in the procedure for client confirmation included obtaining approval from the marketing manager and the executive manager. After these approvals the client would be entered into the salesperson’s business client list and the salesperson would receive the total commission from managing all of the client’s sales activity with the company. Payments for goods delivered were to be collected as specified in the sales agreement excluding the month when the goods were delivered. For example if the payment term was 30 days the payment for goods delivered in January had to be collected before March 2 with postponement possible if the due date fell during a holiday.Sales staff would still receive their commission when payment collection was delayed due to product quality problems but the staff member needed to submit a written application to delay collecting the payment. This application had to include the date the problem would be solved confirmation from quality control (QC) and permission from the manager and executive manager.The responsibility of the sales staff to collect payments was established and emphasized in the policy previously mentioned and in the following rules which were also intended to strengthen the capital turnover rate and protect the company from bad debts. Sales staff would receive 90 per cent of their commission if they collected payment for goods within one month after the payment collection date. They would receive 80 per cent of the commission if they collected payment within two months after the payment collection date but this commission payment would be postponed until the payment date for the next month’s commission. Sales staff would receive 70 per cent of the commission if they collected payment within three months; this commission payment would also be postponed until the payment date for the next month’s commission. For payments that were not collected within three months the sales staff would receive only 50 per cent of the commission which would be released the month following the collection of the final payment for goods. For payments that were not collected after three months the relevant supervisors and managers would take action to solve the problem and would decide who would take responsibility for managing the payment collection. These rules were listed separately.Rewards and Penalties The general rules for rewards and penalties applied to the sales staff. Every salesperson had to collect payments for goods on time and would receive feedback about the payment collection from the financial staff. Rewards such as promotions went to sales staff with remarkable performances. Sales staff could also be downgraded and would have to take responsibility for the consequences caused by poor business performance—especially for not collecting payments for goods for causing bad debts and for losses to the company because of fraud. The marketing staff had to claim responsibility for any outstanding payments still uncollected two months over the AR recovery date. They would be penalized by being required to return 20 per cent of the sales commission awarded to them. If their supervisors succeeded in collecting their overdue AR then that 20 per cent sales commission would be paid to the supervisors. In the case of bad debt 30 per cent of the bad debt based on the company’s basic cost would be deducted from the salesperson’s earnings; another 10 per cent would be deducted from the supervisor’s earnings; and 5 per cent would be deducted from the earnings of the manager the finance manager and the executive director respectively. The company would assume 45 per cent of the bad debt. The commission for each salesperson for the previous month had to be accurately calculated before the 12th day of each month. Each salesperson’s commission from two months prior would be released on the 15th day of each month (for example the commission for July would be released on October 15). The financial staff would inform the sales manager and salesperson in advance if the commission could not be released on that date. If this was not done a penalty of ¥300 would be issued to the involved financial staff member and managing staff member.Members of the sales staff could enjoy the same remuneration package as other staff members by submitting applications to become regular staff members within the probationary period if they met one of three criteria: (1) they had achieved remarkable marketing performance by doubling the basic marketing performance target in any of the first three months; (2) they had exhibited excellent marketing performance and contributed constructive ideas and advice to the management of the company; or (3) they had exhibited high-quality talents and skills and employed these in special circumstances to benefit the company.The response of the Sales StaffThe new rules did not improve the problems of AR. As a result Li decided to ask a consulting company to investigate the situation and the implementation of the marketing policy. Only through careful investigation could the next steps for improvement be developed. resultsSales Staffs’ Attitudes toward MarketingThe investigation determined that the sales staff came mainly from two groups of people. The first group included individuals from companies in the same field as JIT Technology; they had related work experience in the area and business relationships that were based on those experiences. They were familiar with the clients’ internal operations and had established social networks in the area. Some of them also had prior management experience. These people quickly adapted to their jobs and easily achieved their goals. For example Li the manager of one department came from the client company ZTE Corporation and he sold JIT Technology’s products to his former company. This group of salespeople were usually well educated and had related expertise and social networks in the field. Thus they performed better and achieved higher commissions; their average salary was over ¥10000 per month.The second group of sales staff were individuals who had been promoted or transferred from other staff positions in the company by the executive staff. They included former drivers clerks secretaries and warehouse staff. Members of this group had no previous systematic training an average educational background (a high school diploma) inadequate professional knowledge and no established relationships with related industries. Thus these people usually achieved an average business performance at best and had lower incomes as a result. It was very difficult for these salespeople to locate clients particularly large ones or to sign them to contracts. For example Luo—who as the driver for the chief executive officer had received an average salary between ¥2500 and ¥3000—was encouraged by the chief executive officer to enter sales and became a professional salesperson for the company. He was very depressed because he could only earn a salary of ¥1500 as a salesperson which was much lower than his former salary as a driver.Satisfaction with SalariesThe investigation found that the salaries of the sales staff fell into two extremes. The difference between the lowest and highest incomes was substantial with the highest being as much as 10 times more than the lowest and the average gap representing a difference of from 5 to 7 times. There were two distinctly different groups with contrasting feelings. High-income salespeople thought that their salaries were reasonable and they had higher expectations while low-income salespeople were generally depressed had lower spirits and saw no promising prospects in their futures. They had no passion for their work and thought there was an unfairness in the salaries of the high-income salespeople. The low-income salespeople believed they worked just as hard as the high-income salespeople and had poorer business performance simply because they had less information and fewer network advantages. ConclusionLi sank into deep contemplation after hearing the investigation report. His mind was awash with questions. Where did these problems come from? Did they come from the oversight of the rewards and punishments policy or from something else? He knew that the causes needed to be found or the situation would become worse and possibly cause the ultimate collapse of the company. Li summoned the company management to find a solution. At the meeting the marketing director Lin suggested that the problem lay in the marketing incentive policy. There were only rewards and no fines and this was the reason why the number of AR had become larger and larger. The financial director Ding suggested that the company should use a quantitative approach to determine the penalty. He wondered if the aging analysis method or the days sales outstanding (DSO also known as “days receivable”) could be taken into account. Of the two methods he preferred DSO because the DSO index was calculated based on a single person’s business. If the marketing staff were to be penalized by having to return some of their sales commission for overdue AR collection the amount of the penalty would depend on a calculation of the salesperson’s DSO the uncollected AR and the opportunity cost (based on the treasury bill rate or a one-year loan rate depending on whether the funds belonged to the company or were borrowed). Even if the amount of the deduction greatly exceeded the sales commission the policy would still be executed in order to maintain a strict reward or penalty.Exhibit 1: SHENZHEN JIT’s Current Organizational Structure Source: Created by the authors based on observation.exhibit 2: commission plan for the sales and marketing staffNote: The market value for die-cutting processing products = Cost (1 + 55?).Source: Company documents.,"[{""start"":945,""end"":952,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1191,""end"":1193,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2018,""end"":2020,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2221,""end"":2223,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2641,""end"":2643,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12600,""end"":12602,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13382,""end"":13384,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16080,""end"":16082,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1075,""end"":1080,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1082,""end"":1084,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13464,""end"":13466,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":14633,""end"":14635,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":14663,""end"":14665,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15944,""end"":15946,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":16471,""end"":16473,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":16628,""end"":16630,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1035,""end"":1038,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2076,""end"":2079,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13501,""end"":13504,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":14743,""end"":14746,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15778,""end"":15781,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Needless to say Kalbfleisch developed something akin to a coffee obsession as a university student—due in part not only to his area of study but also to his focus on achieving academic excellence.Kalbfleisch often faced long lines waiting for coffee at school but he felt the habit was necessary if he was going to keep doing late-night study sessions. He wondered if there was a better way to get the quality coffee he craved without having to endure the typical wait-times at a premium coffee shop. Making premium coffee at home did not work for him as he liked to drink his coffee while he worked which was rarely at his residence and travel mugs negatively affected the flavour of his cherished brew.“There’s no doubt I’m a coffee snob” said Kalbfleisch. “It’s a passion of mine and many others but I simply can’t find the combination of portability and premium quality coffee available anywhere in the crowded coffee products marketplace.” As Kalbfleisch began to design the travel coffee press that would meet his needs he realized he had a worthwhile business idea but needed funding to make the business a reality. In 2015 he wondered what form of funding was available to him. Would crowdfunding be a realistic way of raising the money he needed for this venture?Home Is Where The (Good) Coffee Isn’tSeveral methods were available for making coffee at home. The first traditional drip coffee was invented by Melitta Bentz in 1908. The process of making drip coffee involved drawing hot water from a reservoir and letting it seep through a waiting pocket of ground coffee drawing out the flavour of the beans through a paper or mesh filter and into the pot below. This method was popular largely because of its efficiency not because of the quality of the finished product. The maker could brew an entire pot of coffee in minutes with little effort but the taste of this coffee was poor to those who valued quality coffee.In the 1990s John Sylvan created a new type of coffee brewing similar to the drip coffee maker; this type of brewing became known as Keurig. Sylvan worked as a low-level marketing manager before inventing Keurig. Among his unofficial responsibilities was collecting money from his co-workers to pay the coffee vendor. He admitted it was like his full-time job most days. Not only did the chip-in system create headaches the coffee itself was lacklustre. On the rare occasion a co-worker got the coffee-to-water ratio right the half-full carafe would sit on the burner for hours getting stale and bitter. Sylvan envisioned a single-serve coffee system that would eliminate his trivial day-to-day coffee money shakedown and so the Keurig was born.In his quest to create a new brewing method Sylvan actually gave himself caffeine poisoning by taste- testing 30–40 cups a day. Unlike the drip models already on the market Sylvan’s machine was designed to brew single cups using sealed capsules of ground coffee. The Keurig process involved plastic capsules or pods of coffee grounds that when punctured released shots of nitrogen that kept the coffee from oxidizing. When a plastic capsule was closed into the Keurig brewer needles pierced its foil top and plastic bottom. The brewer then pumped in hot water turning the capsule into a miniaturized version of the filter basket found in a traditional coffee maker. This accelerated process took just 45 seconds to produce a steaming cup of coffee. Aside from being extremely time efficient a Keurig also saved users clean-up time. All they had to do was insert another pod into the machine and wait 45 seconds for another hot cup of coffee. For those who valued the flavour of their coffee above all else the French press was the method deemed to generate the purest flavour possible. Making coffee using a French press involved boiling water to precisely 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius). Whole coffee beans were measured and coarsely ground and the newly ground beans were placed into the press and gently shaken to settle them into place. Finally half the required amount of perfect-temperature water was poured evenly over the grounds. This step was called the bloom. Hot water forced the ground coffee to release trapped gases leading the coffee to expand and release wonderful aromas for coffee purists to enjoy. During the bloom a thick crust of coffee grounds also formed. After 30 seconds the grounds were stirred gently for five seconds and the remaining half of the water was poured into the press. The lid was placed on the French press with the plunger pulled all the way up and the coffee was left to steep for four minutes. When the time was up the plunger was pressed all the way down to filter the grounds from the coffee which was poured immediately to avoid bitterness. The aroma the French press created and the view of the coffee oils floating on top were cherished by those who took pride in their coffee. When drinking a pressed coffee it was typical to actually taste the tiny bean particles. The reason the French press reached a higher flavour threshold was the absence of a paper filter which absorbed much of the oil in the grounds. Instead of soaking this up the press added tiny bits of coffee grounds to the coffee which actually percolated flavour. Steeping as opposed to filtering also increased the rich flavour. Ultimately the Keurig machine was far more efficient at coffee production but it undoubtedly lacked the high-value flavour that a French press was capable of producing.More Money More ProblemsAfter founding Keurig in 1992 Sylvan and his partner Peter Dragone hashed together prototype after prototype working in small offices and doing most of the taste testing themselves. For the first few years they drew no salaries and they were turned down for funding by scores of venture capitalists. For years their meetings with potential investors ended in various lectures as to why their invention would never catch on. Often they would be kicked out of the offices in which they met. After years of continuous rejection they found a Minneapolis-based investor called Food Fund which agreed to contribute US$50000. Subsequently MDT Advisers raised US$1 million for the company. An increasing number of investors yielded an increasing number of opinions. Sylvan disagreed with the majority of the investors’ strategies and he did not take well to receiving direction from those outside the day-to-day operations of the business he was so passionate about. In 1994 after three years and a lot of energy passion and commitment Sylvan was forced out and demanded the company buy his stake which totalled US$50000. In fiscal 2017 Keurig was expected to make US$2.5 billion in revenues.Some Disassembly RequiredKalbfleisch sought high-quality coffee on the go. He tried travel French presses but found that the freshness suffered as the grounds remained in the bottom of the coffee spoiling the taste by the time he had taken it to school. Discovering no product on the market to suit his exacting requirements he began applying his knowledge of thermal fluids engineering to design his own all-in-one travel coffee press. As a child Kalbfleisch had been curious about how everyday objects worked. He would often take his toys apart to learn about the mechanisms that made them run. He was also a big fan of Lego like most future engineers and he often opted to build his own creations rather than follow the instructions. In high school Kalbfleisch learned how to use 3D modelling software through a technical designing course which helped to foster his interest in product design and eventually led him to become an engineer. During his undergraduate education Kalbfleisch took a year off to complete an internship at Ehvert Mission Critical an engineering consulting firm that specialized in the design of data centres. The small firm was owned and operated by a mechanical engineer who took an interest in developing Kalbfleisch’s talents. This positive experience showed Kalbfleisch that an engineer with no formal business training could own a business. While working in data centres Kalbfleisch was amazed at the inefficiencies in the heating and cooling equipment of otherwise high-tech buildings. This led him to pursue a master’s degree in thermal fluids engineering where his goal was to learn to develop more efficient solutions for heating and cooling. The curriculum in the master’s program was heavily experiment-based; students built and tested many prototypes while making improvements along the way.When Kalbfleisch began his first foray into designing his coffee product his goal was to press fresh coffee within the travel mug itself. The unique design feature of separating the coffee beans from the liquid such that the maximum amount of flavour would be extracted while the beans were kept separate from the coffee itself seemed to Kalbfleisch a worthy way to differentiate his product from those that were currently available in the market. Accomplishing this design goal would insure a great-tasting brew with a consistent taste to the last sip. Kalbfleisch’s product concept now called the Pascal Press would be the only product on the market with this separation feature. Combining his tireless pursuit of coffee perfection with the university’s capacity to develop physical prototypes contributed greatly to Kalbfleisch’s ability to design the world’s best travel coffee press.Once Kalbfleisch had a rough draft of his design it was time to build a prototype. The experienced he had gained through his education made the process relatively quick and a prototype was made and perfected by September 2015. Constructed out of CA$20 worth of plumbing material the prototype visually showcased the plunge feature of his design so that anyone could easily see the unique process Kalbfleisch had created.Kalbfleisch met with a professor at Western University’s Ivey Business School and discussed the potential of Pascal Press. At the time Kalbfleisch had no intention of starting a business but the meeting exposed him to the possibilities and rewards of becoming an entrepreneur and selling his product. The professor suggested Kalbfleisch join the Propel Entrepreneurship Centre (Propel) a student-focused support group at Western University to develop his business. He joined Propel in mid-October 2016.In early December Kalbfleisch began designing and manufacturing his second major prototype using the machine shop provided through his school program. This resulted in an upgraded version of his product concept late in January 2017. By then Kalbfleisch had received a $2000 grant from Propel for a patent search and other forms of development support that enabled him to continue refining his vision. In spite of these various streams of financial support Kalbfleisch recognized that he had further work to do before he would have a product that could be manufactured and sold to consumers. Traditional sources of capital funding were difficult to obtain because the business to this point had achieved no sales. Kalbfleisch had the uncomfortable sense that his venture had effectively stalled. He needed money to further develop a product he believed strongly would be popular but he was unable to generate any sales without having a finished product. The idea that all his hard work and passion might go unrealized left Kalbfleisch desperately looking for new financing alternatives.Two’s Company Three Thousand’s A CrowdAt that time some of the support staff at Propel suggested Kalbfleisch should consider crowdfunding his venture. He had heard of this relatively new entrepreneurship phenomenon where new business product concepts could effectively be pre-sold to those visiting a site as a means of effectively bridging the product–finance gap that had previously prevented new products from reaching the marketplace. Anyone with a product concept could pitch it on a crowdfunding platform and if enough pre-sales were achieved the funds were released to the entrepreneur who could then use them to finish and deliver the product to those who had purchased it.Several popular crowdfunding platforms had emerged—including Kickstarter PBC Indiegogo Inc. and GoFundMe—all of which were designed to address the product–market gap Kalbfleisch was experiencing with Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set about learning how they all worked so he could determine which platform was the best fit. The concept of crowdfunding initially began in 1997 when the British rock band Marillion funded a previously cancelled tour of the United States by pre-selling tickets online to a group of hard-core fans. The success of this innovative method of financing tours and then record productions inspired the creation of the first online crowdfunding platform ArtistShare in 2000. Shortly thereafter more platforms began to emerge and the crowdfunding industry grew consistently each year. Crowdfunding made use of the vast networks and accessibility of social media to bring entrepreneurs and their ideas for new products together with the prospective buyers of those products. Traditionally capital funding sources for new products were limited by the orientations and preferences of small groups of investors who decided themselves whether a new product would be successful or not. Among the key virtues of crowdfunding was that it dramatically reduced investment risk by demonstrating through presales whether there was sufficient market demand for a new product. It also greatly expanded the pool of buyers from whom funds could be raised resulting in a greater volume of valuable products in the marketplace. In addition it was important to note that people who pledged money to crowdfunding campaigns would not actually pay for the products unless these had secured enough pre-orders to make production feasible. Perhaps most importantly crowdfunding greatly reduced the barriers involved in becoming an entrepreneur. By 2009 crowdfunding had emerged as a popular option for entrepreneurs to gain exposure funding and secure validation for their ideas. Revenue in the crowdfunding industry tripled from US$530 million in 2009 to US$1.5 billion by 2011. The explosion of crowdfunding cushioned the blow dealt by the decreasing availability of other funds such as small business association loans.According to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation’s 2016 index of start-up activity data the number of new entrepreneurs rose in 2014. It increased again in 2015 boasting roughly 550000 new ventures every month. The number of women starting businesses hit its highest level in almost 20 years (40 per cent) while minorities and immigrants represented a significant portion of new entrepreneurs (28 per cent).Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter generated revenues by taking a percentage of the funds raised usually 5 per cent of the funding total as well as payment processing fees of 3–5 per cent. Fees were taken only if the funding venture was successful. If the target was not reached no fee was taken and pledgers were not charged. To encourage investors to pledge their money many crowdfunding projects were reward-based. Pre-buyers participated in the launch of a new product and some received additional purchase benefits or pricing discounts. (Re)Search And Ye Shall FindKalbfleisch’s approach to crowdfunding as a means of advancing his venture was typical for him. He broke down and analyzed everything he could about the subject such that he knew exactly what he would have to do to maximize his chances of success. One of many insights he gained from this research was that developing a pre-launch marketing campaign would be crucial to success. Kalbfleisch learned that he needed to create excitement and anticipation for his product prior to launching it in order to secure crowdfunding support. He knew most forms of marketing would cost money—which he did not have—so instead Kalbfleisch posted images of his constructed prototype on free online forums such as Reddit and began to slowly build up a following. Kalbfleisch’s pre-launch goal was to identify and locate his target market based on reactions to his posts. He quickly learned that tea lovers had no interest in his product concept whereas the majority of coffee fans showed instant enthusiasm for it. His posts soon became among the top-ranked on the forum and Kalbfleisch took this as validation of his idea. He sought feedback on these posts and continuously modified and reposted his design to seek additional ideas from forum users. For example one user suggested a spill-proof lid which Kalbfleisch incorporated into his final design. He also began collecting email addresses in preparation for his Kickstarter launch. Kalbfleisch used the recognition he had cultivated on various online forums and directly contacted relevant blog sites to solicit their support in spreading awareness of his upcoming Kickstarter campaign. By the month before his campaign launch Kalbfleisch had gathered over 1100 email addresses which he intended to use as the base of the communications efforts for his Kickstarter campaign. After consulting with his selected production partners in China Kalbfleisch estimated that he needed approximately $80000 in capital to cover the tooling required to manufacture the Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set the Kickstarter campaign’s goal at $40000 to be raised within a 30-day period. He believed that a lower goal would encourage more pledges from buyers and prove to traditional sources of capital that his idea had sufficient traction with the masses making them comfortable with providing the $40000 difference.Kalbfleisch had reviewed many successful Kickstarter campaigns but even after doing so he was not fully confident about which incentive structure would work best for Pascal Press’s Kickstarter campaign. “I had an immense amount of feedback and input from my online discussion groups as well as my own research and it wasn’t clear at all what would work in terms of getting someone to cross the threshold of interested supporter to actual customer” he said. He set up a proposed incentive structure: the first 200 pledgers would receive 20 per cent off their press as an “early bird special” and remaining buyers would receive 10 per cent off their purchase. Another vital detail to determine was the right price for a Pascal Press. The initial proposed production run of 2000 units would result in a cost of $12.50 per unit. Kalbfleisch would also have to pay for the tooling costs which were estimated at $55000–$60000. Kalbfleisch’s instinct was to simply use his costs as the basis for an acceptable price for Pascal Press: “As long as there’s a reasonable profit per unit I’m comfortable with it though I am curious as to other possible pricing approaches” he said. Ultimately Kalbfleisch intended to utilize a wholesale distribution system where coffee houses and other retailers would purchase his product with an eye to marking it up and selling it to their customers. Kalbfleisch wondered whether he should offer a deal to his Kickstarter buyers selling the initial production run for what would effectively become the wholesale price. He also wondered what his overall distribution approach should be. He had more or less assumed that the traditional manufacture-wholesale-retail approach was best for Pascal Press but he wondered if selling on Kickstarter was proof that a direct-to-consumer approach might be more valuable. He also had to consider whether he should try to sell through wholesale and online—and what the implications of those

In response two seller associations with memberships of around 1800 Flipkart sellers out of the total of 90000 registered with Flipkart protested against the new policy expressing their resistance by not processing new orders and campaigning on social media using the hashtags “#OnlineDharna” and “#SellerQuitFlipkart.” Sanjay Thakur a spokesperson for an online sellers’ trade union with around 1000 sellers said The changes on return shipping policy will impact sellers heavily. Flipkart used to charge a fee from sellers only if we were at fault which would be less than 1 per cent of the order (value). Now Flipkart will deduct shipping charges and collection fees from sellers (in case of returns) which will be huge since return percentage ranges from 8 to 10 per cent [of] (deliveries) in most of the categories.Another group All India Online Vendors Association which had 800 members stated “Due to the new policy sellers will be forced to increase prices by around 10 per cent and will also charge shipping fees to customers.” Although the number of disgruntled sellers was relatively low in the context of Flipkart’s massive merchant network the protest against the new policy created an opportunity for Flipkart’s competitors. Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) which boasted a seller base of 85000 merchants in India reduced sellers’ commissions to lure these resentful sellers to its platform. Snapdeal another home-grown rival with more than 300000 sellers also decreased commissions for select sellers. Troubled with its falling market valuation (from US$142.24 per share in June 2015 to $87.9 in March 2016) Flipkart was forced to take steps to check this fall. Curtailing the number of returned items could help the company reduce its losses but Flipkart was apprehensive of taking measures that might alienate consumers even though it was clear that many customers had been misusing its “no questions asked” return policy. How could Flipkart reduce the losses resulting from these excessive returns while pleasing both its sellers and customers?COMPANY HISTORYIn 2007 two ex-Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal began selling books on an online platform in India with an initial fund of $6000. Their initiative resulted in the establishment of Flipkart which was registered in Singapore due to the fact that Indian foreign direct investment norms capped foreign investment in retail companies. The company developed various subsidiaries such as Flipkart Marketplace Private Limited Flipkart Logistics Private Limited and Flipkart Payments Private Limited all of which were also registered in Singapore. These companies in turn held stakes in five Indian entities: Flipkart India Private Limited (the wholesale cash-and-carry entity) Flipkart Internet Private Limited (which owned Flipkart.com) Digital Management Services Private Limited Flipkart Payment Gateway Services Private Limited and Digital Media Private Limited. Flipkart raised funds from several investors over the years receiving its first major investment from Tiger Global Management ($10 million) in 2009. Later Flipkart attracted other large investors including South African technology firm Naspers U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley and Russian investment firm Digital Sky Technologies Global (DST). In total by June 2016 Flipkart had successfully raised more than $3 billion (see Exhibit 1).Flipkart adopted the marketplace model which saved it from holding any inventory. The company worked as an online platform for sellers and buyers sourcing goods from manufacturers and supplying them to third-party sellers who in turn sold these products to online shoppers. Flipkart provided its logistics services and technology platform to sellers and levied a commission for these services by charging fees on each sale made on its platform. The company charged commission under the following heads: commission fees (which varied across sub-categories/verticals) shipping fees (which varied with weight) collection fees (for use of payment modes) and a fixed fee to its sellers for the use of its platform (see Exhibits 2 and 3).Although it had started by selling books by 2016 Flipkart had successfully transitioned to selling 30 million products across more than 70 categories divided across seven product lines: electronics appliances men’s apparel women’s apparel baby and children’s goods home and furniture and books. Earlier in 2012 Flipkart had launched its private labels because these allowed the platform to earn a higher margin (compared to selling other established brands). After beginning with its first private label “DigiFlip” for digital accessories the company later in 2013 launched “Flippd” for products in the apparel and footwear category and “Citron” for home appliance and personal health products in 2014.As a pioneer in the online retail space in India Flipkart encountered and overcame several challenges. For instance to overcome the mistrust that many Indian consumers felt about online transactions Flipkart launched the “cash on delivery” (COD) payment option in 2010 which was virtually risk free for customers. Similarly to attract and encourage sellers from small cities in 2015 Flipkart ran the initiative “FlipStars” which celebrated and honoured the success of sellers from small cities. To keep sellers motivated the company classified them into Gold Silver and Bronze categories and awarded the top sellers (i.e. Gold sellers) gifts and foreign trips. Flipkart also introduced “Flipkart Connect” to create awareness and promote online shopping among its customers. From 2010 to 2016 Flipkart further expanded its business by way of acquisitions. In 2014 it acquired online fashion shop Myntra.com in a $330 million deal. Later in 2016 this acquired entity in turn acquired another rival Jabong.com (Jabong) for approximately $70 million.During the Indian festive season of 2016 Flipkart sold 15.5 million units and achieved sales of around $300 million in just four days. By March 2016 it had roughly 75 million registered users and more than 90000 sellers across India. Flipkart employed more than 45000 employees all over the world as of February 2016. The company attracted talent in top management by offering high salaries and other lucrative benefits even when its losses had been increasing over the years. The company was named “E-Commerce Company of the Year” at the Golden Carts Awards in 2016. Yet since its inception in 2007 Flipkart had yet to register a profit in any fiscal (FY) year. The company reported net revenue of $290 million in FY 2015–16 but also registered a loss of $343 million—more than double its losses of $170 million in FY 2014–15.THE Online Retail MarketIn 2016 globally $861 billion sales took place in the online retail place. Although China and the United States ranked as the first- and second-largest markets in terms of online sales respectively India emerged as the fastest-growing market in the world. The sale of physical goods via online retail sites in India was valued at $16.07 billion in 2016. It was projected that the growth of global online retail sales would increase to $1426 billion by 2021.The Indian MarketIn 2002 online retail (also known as “e-commerce”) was introduced to Indian internet users when Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation began offering online ticket booking for its trains. Online shopping gained increasing popularity with the deep discount model used by most online retailers including Flipkart. Soon the opportunity in this space attracted other platforms like Amazon Jabong and Snapdeal.SizeIncluding both online and offline shopping the Indian retail market was valued at $750 billion in FY 2015–16. The opportunity in the online space was immense as the e-commerce market touched $14.5 billion in 2016 and was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 31.2 per cent to reach $64 billion by 2021. The COD payment option easy return policies huge inflows of funds from venture capitalists and fast-growing internet penetration all contributed to this growth. CustomersWith the annual addition of 25 million internet users the number of internet users in India had grown to 400 million in 2016. Of these users 75 per cent were between the ages of 15 and 34 which meant that India had the youngest target market for e-commerce in the world. Growth across all retail categories online saw 65 million unique visitors per month and all categories achieved a 55 per cent annual growth rate. Most of these online shoppers were in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Although most online shopping initially occurred on desktop computers experts believed that mobile platforms generated up to 70 per cent of online retail revenue in 2016. Moreover 75 per cent of online retail traffic came from metropolitan cities.Goods SoldA wide variety of goods were sold on e-commerce platforms in India. While mobile phones were the most sold product on these platforms electronic and fashion items together represented around half of all spending on online retail sites. By 2020 fashion e-commerce was expected to generate $35 billion. The online market for consumer durables like kitchen appliances and other accessories was valued at $530 million which equalled 14 per cent of online retail transactions in 2015. Home furnishing products and books garnered $165 million and $102 million respectively in the same year.Competition AmazonEstablished in 1994 Seattle-based Amazon was Flipkart’s strongest competitor. After entering the Indian market in 2013 with the launch of Amazon India the corporation attracted customers with its 24/7 user support and 100 per cent purchase protection guarantee. With its aggressive marketing in India Amazon quickly gained a majority of the market share. By July 2015 it had more than 25 million products for sale in India. To build customer loyalty the firm launched its Prime service in July 2016 in which customers paid a yearly subscription fee of approximately $7 to enjoy free delivery of most online purchases along with access to streamed movies and television shows. In 2016 Amazon India reported a net revenue of $340 million with a net loss of $531 million. It had around 10000 employees working at its Bengaluru office in 2016.SnapdealFounded by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal in 2010 Snapdeal emerged as a major e-commerce competitor with 20 million products across 500 diverse categories in 2015. With around 200000 sellers the firm served a huge customer base of 100 million. This “home-grown” company received its primary funding in 2014 ($627 million) and 2015 ($500 million) from investors Softbank Telecom Corp and Alibaba Group Holding Limited respectively (see Exhibit 1). Facing stiff competition from Amazon and Flipkart Snapdeal struggled to retain its market share and lost a large percentage of this share between 2015 and 2016. The company posted net revenue of $216 million with a net loss of $493 million in 2016 and had 800 employees as of February of the same year. Since their inception e-commerce firms had been reporting significant losses due to their discount-based business models (which engendered cutthroat competition) and large numbers of returns. Changes in Customer BehaviourFree and easy returns and COD payment resulted in new consumer behaviours on online shopping platforms. First due to an increase in mobile penetration there was an increase in “window shopping” especially among younger consumers who often carelessly ordered items without seriously planning to keep them. Moreover some buyers replaced original products with replicas before returning them which might not be noticed immediately; one buyer caused Amazon losses of ?10 million over two years by returning the ordered products after replacing them with cheap replicas. Second in certain product categories like clothing and footwear a lack of standardized sizes led to high return rates because the products looked or fit differently than expected. Globally the return rate for online purchases was over 30 per cent. In comparison the average return rate for offline purchases was 8.89 per cent. For online purchases made using COD payment the return rate touched 40 per cent.Common reasons that customers cited for returns included “I no longer need this product” and “I intentionally ordered more than one size of wearables with the intent of returning extra items.” For some products manufacturers refused to accept returned items from sellers if the seals on the products were broken at the customer’s end. In these cases sellers were forced to sell those items at second-hand/used product prices through a separate channel for such goods. For wearable items the 30-day return window gave unethical buyers the option of wearing the clothes for some time before returning them. Sellers reported that the return rate had increased by around 50 per cent in many categories including electronics and mobile phones since July 2015. This higher return rate distressed small and medium-sized sellers. Yet Amazon Flipkart and Snapdeal all denied any increase in the number of returned products and contradicted reports of this trend.The New Return PolicyWith the addition of hundreds of new sellers joining the platform every month sellers on Flipkart had to compete with each other on pricing discounts and delivery costs. Further Flipkart’s “no questions asked” return policy made it easy for customers to misuse the policy. As a result even though sellers found the platform attractive because of its vast number of active customers the increasing costs associated with returns gradually became a nightmare for many of them. In June 2016 Flipkart released the announcement of a new policy for sellers using its platform which was met with outrage. The new policy stated that sellers would be charged up to 5 per cent more commission fees than before on certain categories of products (see Exhibit 4). To reduce the impact of these increased commissions on sellers the company offered a 50 per cent discount on the commission fee for those sellers who used the company’s warehousing services which could enable sellers to source cheaper products from China and within India. To retain existing sellers and attract new desirable sellers Flipkart also offered to give licence to its internal brands to select vendors. A Flipkart spokesperson described the revised policy: “The new structure [will] enable sellers to have predictability and better control over payments. Our return policy and process continue to be the best and the easiest in the industry.”Moreover a few of Flipkart’s changes to its return policy were intended to benefit sellers. For instance in several product categories the company reduced the window for returns from 30 days to 10 days and only allowed the product to be replaced if a defect was identified. Notably the larger return window of 30 days was still in place for clothing and accessories.Regardless these offerings did not pacify the agitated sellers who already paid a high shipping fee reverse logistics fee and collection fee on return logistics. Sellers complained about having to pay the commission fee for all returns where the customer had opened the package; only when the package was returned without being opened could they avoid paying this fee. They were unhappy with this aspect of the policy and viewed it as being charged “the marketplace commission” despite the cancellation of a sale. A seller shared his concerns on the e-commerce sellers’ forum:At present [Flipkart is] not charging for colour/fit/size issue returns but after June 20 2016 [it] will charge on that too earning from those increased commissions [and from] useless returns too. More returns and more replacements equals more profits for [Flipkart]. [The company] is in a hurry to raise its valuation in one shot which was recently devalued by earning profit from this sale and return game.Sellers were also unhappy because the platform did not seek their consent before approving a return. In a survey conducted by eSeller Suraksha 57 per cent of sellers noted that they would reconsider selling on Flipkart and 42 per cent reported they would increase the price of a commodity by 15–20 per cent. One seller commented on the impact of the newly revised return policy: As per the calculations we need to increase our selling prices on Flipkart by at least 20–25 per cent to make sure we’re not [operating at] a loss; this is in addition to the shipping charges from customers. The majority of [seller union] members will be quitting Flipkart since it will no longer be profitable to sell [there].Because of the new policy for the first time in India a union of sellers revolted against an e-commerce platform in June 2016. Two of the online sellers’ unions eSeller Suraksha (which had about 1000 seller-members) and All India Online Vendors Association declared a strike against Flipkart’s new policy. In protest against the return policy changes these sellers made their products unavailable on Flipkart and showed an “out of stock” message to buyers on the product listing page. This message was shown for about 1 million stock-keeping units on the portal. Competitors RespondThe changes regarding Flipkart’s return window for certain items occurred after Amazon India made similar policy changes reducing the replacement period to 10 days for most electronic items. The reduction by both companies was an attempt to make online shopping more like brick-and-mortar shopping where customers were responsible for returning products promptly and for good reason. At the same time Flipkart’s return policy still allowed for refunds on most product categories which made a dent in sellers’ profit margins.Even in terms of platform usage commission compared to its rivals Flipkart had an overall higher marketplace commission on all categories (see Exhibit 5). Basic calculations showed that selling on Amazon was more profitable for sellers in the mobile phone and mobile phone accessories category which was one of the largest e-commerce categories overall (see Exhibit 6).Accordingly when Flipkart changed its policy Amazon India saw an opportunity and reduced its commission rates for various product categories by 2–7 per cent to attract disgruntled Flipkart sellers (see Exhibit 7). The company’s return policy limited the return window to 10 days for electronic items and 30 days for other product categories. Snapdeal also changed its policy to appear more seller friendly. The platform allowed returns within just seven days after delivery for most product categories and each refund was processed only after a defect had been verified by the brand manufacturer of the product. WHAT NEXT?From June 2015 until March 2016 Flipkart saw a massive cut in its market valuation by Morgan Stanley falling from $142.24 to $87.9 per share. The company accounted for 43 per cent of all e-commerce shipments in 2015 a figure that fell to 37 per cent in 2016. In contrast its close competitor Amazon recorded a leap in market share from 14 to 21 per cent between March 2015 and March 2016.Flipkart was facing a persistent dilemma among online marketplaces: should it prioritize the needs of its customers or those of its sellers? Traditional wisdom suggested that the company side with customers as it had done already with its deep discount model and “no questions asked” return policy. However now that the company needed to reduce the losses it was incurring due to a high volume of returns it feared that denying refunds or further reducing the window for returns could displease customers. Flipkart management needed to take immediate steps to pacify its sellers and recoup its losses without disappointing its 75 million registered customers.Exhibit 1: Funding for ONLINE REtailers in India (US$ million)Source: Sumit Chakraborty “The Flipkart Story: A Timeline of Funding from 2007 to 2017” Financial Express March 20 2017 accessed November 1 2017 www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/the-flipkart-story-a-timeline-of-funding-from-2007-to-2017/595740/; Mihir Dalal “Amazon Increases India Investments to $5 Billion to Take on Flipkart Snapdeal” Livemint June 9 2016 accessed October 25 2017 www.livemint.com/Companies/InTrpA1lX6EFAfbAcLCIgM/Amazon-to-invest-3-billion-more-in-India-ops.html; “Snapdeal > Funding Rounds” Crunchbase accessed October 25 2017 https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snapdeal/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list.Exhibit 2: Flipkart Fee Structure for SellersSource: Shweta Singh “Flipkart Changes Fee Structure & Policies; Sellers Consider Closing Account” IndianOnlineSeller.com June 6 2016 accessed June 1 2018 http://indianonlineseller.com/2016/06/flipkart-changes-fee-structure-sellers-consider-closing-account/.Exhibit 3: Comparison of Shipping Charges on Different PlatformS (Before June 20 2016)Note: gm = grams; cm = centimetres; kg = kilograms; approximate commission calculated from Browntape for comparison; INR = Indian Rupees; ?1 = US$0.02 on March 31 2016.Source: “ECommerce Seller Fees Calculator” Browntape March 26 2016 accessed November 1 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160326033317/http://browntape.com/ecommerce-seller-fees-calculator/.Exhibit 4: Flipkart’s Old and New PolicIES: EFFECTS ON Buyers and SellersNote: ?

Founded in India in August 2012 as a casual wear apparel brand TDC had grown rapidly. The company featured three main business lines: electronic dance music (EDM) fashion apparel and accessories sports gear and affordable fashion wear. Singh had adopted a house of brands strategy for the company’s three brands: TDC Fieldgear and Koolho. After six years one of the three brands had started generating profits but none had achieved recognition outside a niche circle. However confident that the various brands were aligned with TDC’s vision and encouraged by the company’s success Singh was considering expanding into international markets. Because of limited access to funds synergy among the company’s house brands and the impact of macro-environmental factors on his growth plans Singh had to choose the best branding strategy for the company’s future. TIKTAULI DE CORPSGenesis and GrowthFounded as a casual wear apparel brand in 2012 TDC had grown rapidly into multiple product categories. Its unique identity was derived from music influences such as hip hop and EDM and from subculture genres such as swag rap dope rave noir and techno. TDC was unapologetic about its image proudly proclaiming on its website “We sell Music inspired Trend setting Fashion … and ‘No Shit.’” By mid-July 2018 the brand’s Facebook page had 52813 likes and 52625 followers. TDC’s vision was to develop 360-degree retail with a global online business foundation. Similarly the company’s mission statement outlined a drive for profitability market hold and customer delight through multiple business verticals. Singh was striving to achieve his vision directly through the company’s brands and indirectly through business-to-business (B2B) supplies. In the near future he planned to target the markets of Brazil Russia India and China (known as the BRIC countries) and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The company had set a deadline of 2021 to make the brand global. Singh planned to achieve this goal by setting up and building multiple independent brands simultaneously.TDC started its journey as an aggregator and supplier of apparel and footwear brands to the giant e-commerce platforms Flipkart and Amazon.com. The company then started an online marketing campaign for its range of apparel and accessories inspired by the hip hop and EDM genres. It also began supplying athletic apparel under the Fieldgear brand name to become an official outfitter for various national sports leagues in India. Singh also had plans for a new online music channel called Tiktauli Air with nearly 50 EDM disk jockeys (DJs) from around the world streaming EDM on the website. With TDC’s head office established in Nevada United States Singh planned to expand into the United States as well as entering Brazil Iran Kazakhstan Nigeria Romania Belarus and the United Kingdom within the next three years. His foreign market expansion strategy was to follow the same path he had taken in India: penetrate popular fashion e-retailing portals and then leverage their reach. This meant introducing TDC products in these foreign markets through popular e-commerce websites such as Zalora to reach the Asian countries of Malaysia Singapore and Indonesia; Next Brazil to enter the Brazil market; and Wildberries.kz to reach Kazakhstan.Core Businesses TDC’s core businesses comprised of two business verticals: B2B fulfillment and company owned brands. The company had already realized some success in the first segment as Singh confirmed:B2B was kind of unorganized earlier wherein e-commerce companies did not have any direct relationships with brands. TDC forged excellent relationships with several brands after those initial years of learning and had signed agreements with brands like Fila Adidas and Reebok in India. B2B fulfillment had been the major bread-and-butter vertical for the past four years at the group.TDC had three currently active company owned brands: TDC which marketed apparel footwear and accessories; Fieldgear which sold sports apparel and equipment; and Koolho which provided affordable premium quality apparel (see Exhibits 1 and 2). A fourth brand—the soon-to-be-launched Tiktauli Air online music channel—was still in a conceptual stage. Although its launch was still more than a year away the music channel formed an integral part of Singh’s music-apparel vision. TDC’s StrengthsFrom the beginning Singh had hired talented designers from design schools in the United States and the United Kingdom as well as from India’s own premier National Institute of Fashion Technology’s apparel design and production school. TDC’s policy to hire from the best schools created excellent design and product development strength for the company’s brands. With his own background in product marketing and fashion Singh had the necessary expertise to manage the brands successfully. Singh also instilled and nurtured a close-knit culture in his organization. Despite the company’s fast growth in both revenue turnover and size employees rarely left the organization. In the six years the company had been in operation only two employees had left the firm—both of whom later returned to TDC though one could not be suitably re-accommodated in the organization (see Exhibit 3). The TDC PhilosophyFrom a brand positioning perspective Singh believed in forging his own path rather than following others. “When others were trying to make cool fashion we craved for something known as ‘my way.’” This philosophy led TDC into its own brand vision and mission. The company designed everything with “swag” in mind. Accordingly TDC purveyed products that aimed to build stylish confidence in its target audience while efficiently developing and maintaining strong ethical stakeholder relationships especially with suppliers.Business ModelTDC’s business model revolved around four key activities: operating a successful online apparel business identifying and exploiting two major revenue sources identifying three target customer bases and tightly managing finances. TDC generated revenues from B2B fulfillment for big-brand e-commerce retailers like Amazon.com Flipkart Jabong and Myntra. TDC’s focus on financial management always aimed for positive results in revenue and profit from the company’s brands as Singh explained:From the beginning our B2B business was profitable and we were able to support company owned brands with low-hanging revenues from the B2B fulfillment business. In 2012 the share of company owned brands in the total business had been approximately 10 per cent only. By 2018–2019 we plan to increase that share in the total turnover of the company to 45 per cent and by 2020 move it up to 50 per cent or more. Company owned brands will fetch more profit and bring more consistency since for B2B brands at the end of the day . . . you are dependent on others . . . and as I believe in 360-degree vision I would prefer to mitigate the business risk and invest more in company owned brands in the future.Supply ChainHaving started in 2012 TDC’s B2B fulfillment vertical had become successful by 2013. At first e-commerce platforms did not have a relationship with individual brands and found it challenging to work with them. The portals wanted to buy low numbers of items at infrequent rates whereas the major brands required high-number purchases (e.g. half a million pairs or pieces of apparel) and signed agreements to buy more products throughout the year. The portals realized that they needed help in procuring products from major brands. As Singh explained:They approached us [to see] if we could help them connect with brands. That’s how the supply chain side started. We converted unorganized into organized supply systems. At first I used to procure from distributors and others and supplied to the e-commerce platforms. Later I started procuring products directly from the company as an affiliated business partner and started supplying to these e-commerce platforms as their authorized agent. TDC signed business supply agreements with multinational corporations like Fila Inc. Adidas Inc. and Reebok International. TDC’s supply side agreement required the first deal to always be in cash. TDC also invested heavily in the supply chain system of these operations—up to ?40 million or even ?60 million at a time. TDC’s supply chain operated a global network sourcing and manufacturing products from around the world. The company considered its supply chain partners important collaborators. Therefore TDC focused on building strong and respectful long-term relationships with both major brands and e-commerce portals. Singh believed that these relationships were critical to the company’s continued success.TDC established several international franchises and so-called “shop-in-shops” with a presence in multi-brand outlets in the Middle East West Africa South Africa Europe and South Asia. TDC successfully managed its relationships with back-end suppliers while promoting a front-end point-of-sale network across the globe making it possible for customers to easily access its products. MUSIC INSPIRED CONSUMER BRANDSHip Hop and EDMHip hop music originated in the 1970s in the poorest inner-city African-American neighbourhoods of New York City. Youth unemployment was high when rapping deejaying breakdancing graffiti art and hip hop music were discovered and new deejaying techniques such as using two turntables and a mixer to play music non-stop developed. This was the beginning of rap music. EDM was the base for TDC’s range of products. EDM was a percussion-based range of music genres created specifically for festivals raves and nightclubs. These music styles were mixed seamlessly from various album tracks by DJs. Throughout the 1980s and up to the mid-1990s mainstream media distanced itself from this genre of music because of its association with illegal drugs. The events were often a target of law enforcement agencies across North America and continental Europe. In the early 2010s the American music industry embarked on a rebranding of the rave culture. Despite attempts to create a specific music genre EDM continued to be an umbrella term for different music styles such as house techno trance drum and bass dubstep and respective subgenres of these styles. According to Singh “Hip-hop is macro—like a continent—while EDM is micro—like a country. Hip-hop is not just about dance but about a lifestyle—the way you walk what you wear what you listen to including your hairstyle . . . it is a bigger domain.”Apparel and FootwearFor its fans EDM was more than music—it was a way of life and EDM apparel was a must-have because it accentuated and embellished the unique EDM musical experience. EDM apparel ranged from “everyday wearables to unique festival fits.” Many EDM brands called the apparel wearable art claiming that EDM fans’ bodies were a canvas for expression. Globally EDM had a history of high-profile apparel brands that included Hous Billionaires Apparel Shrapnel Streetwear Neffmau5 JoJoElectro CLVB Life Bassdrop NGHTBRND and LBD (Little Black Diamond). Most of these brands were endorsed by popular DJs. For example CLVB Life was endorsed by Tiesto JoJo Electro by DJ Dan and Neffmau5 by Deadmau5. These brands produced music-inspired products such as shirts hats slogan T-shirts backpacks cell phone cases necklaces caps and shorts with the premise to give “ravers” everything they needed to “keep calm and rave on.” Typing the phrase “EDM apparel brands in India” into Google’s search box would return “Tiktauli De. Corps. Hip Hop EDM Swag Rap Dope Rave Noir and . . .” as the top search result. Other EDM apparel brands such as Acid Apparels United Colours of Benetton Pepe Jack & Jones Fighting Fame and SFYNX were available in India on online platforms such as Myntra Koovs and uBuy. However Singh believed “They do not have the same presence as TDC.”Rave Culture: Socio-political Milieu in IndiaIn 2014 India’s thriving EDM scene was identified as a global EDM hot spot with the arrival of EDM stalwarts like Steve Aoki Diplo Major Lazer Carl Cox Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buren. Mumbai and Delhi were popular spots but it was the Indian state of Goa that took centre stage with its Goa Trance music parties that had originated in the 1990s. Later the popular festival Sunburn which had started in 2007 evolved into a three-day musical extravaganza with 150000 attendees and 120 artists. It was billed as one of the biggest EDM events in South Asia winning numerous accolades including 2017 BW Applause awards for Best Music Event (gold) and Best Social Media Amplification (silver). The EDM music genre started fully blossoming in India from 2007 when DJ Nikhil Chinappa from the American MTV music channel collaborated with Percept Company’s Shailendra Singh to launch the Sunburn festival in the laid-back state of Goa a favourite destination for Indian and foreign tourists. The movement quickly grew with the meteoric rise of the Internet and burgeoning smart phone sales. From 2012 to 2015 more than 60 of the world’s top 100 DJs performed to sold-out crowds in India which boasted a growing middle class with disposable income and where Bollywood (the Indian film industry) was extremely successful. The new post-1991 economy and booming night life of metropolitan cities helped EDM’s spectacular rise in a culturally-conscious country like India despite occasional brushes with the law. EDM’s popularity in India was not without strong voices of dissent which considered it an attack on Indian religion culture and values. Various right-wing parties and organizations opposed the EDM music wave which they associated with propagating promiscuousness drugs and a hedonistic lifestyle among India’s youth. In 2016 the popular Sunburn Festival had to be moved out of Goa for the first time in the 10 years since its inception because of police raids and the seizure of banned drugs such as ketamine. When the festival was shifted to Pune local protests demanded that it be stopped for reasons including ecological harm sound pollution drug abuse and vulgarity. MARKETING AT TDCTDC spent ?296.64 million on marketing activities with major expenses on sales force digital marketing event sponsorship and DJ sponsorship (see Exhibit 4). In October 2016 Singh and his team surveyed 75 TDC customers on the perception of its brands (see case Exhibit 5). The company then produced a basic mapping study using price and quality as the two parameters. Brands and Product PortfolioAccording to Singh “The various company owned brands of TDC are all well aligned with the company’s vision of 360-degree retail . . . you will see our brands everywhere we find TDC deep into music dance and movies.” The TDC clothing fashion brand offered a wide range of apparel including T-shirts vests shirts joggers sweatshirts shorts long capes hoodies sweatpants sneakers and light-emitting diode (LED) shoes. It was positioned as a super-premium brand categorized as party wear lounge wear or simply relaxed wear but definitely not “street wear.” TDC footwear included high ankle shoes gold lace shoes LED shoes studded shoes joggers and classic gold shoes among other dance music inspired footwear. Priced between ?1999 and ?3999 TDC footwear truly captured the spirit of hip hop and EDM with its colour schemes design elements and material type. Singh often claimed “If it’s the EDM spirit you want to feel you’ve got to slip into TDC shoes and turn up the music to ‘are-you-crazy?’ levels!” Under the Fieldgear brand name there were four product categories: apparel footwear equipment and accessories. According to Singh the Fieldgear brand was positioned as “fair price technical sports performance wear.” The equipment category featured helmets gloves cricket bats treadmills and gym cycles. The site was launched in April 2017. Fieldgear had entered the sports apparel business in India by becoming the official kit supplier to many sports federations and leagues in India including the Pro Kabaddi League the Hockey India League and the Premier Futsal league. Koolho was a brand conceived by Singh to offer an ambitiously good quality product “as good as a Louis Philippe but at unbeatably amazing prices.” He proposed to do this by selling Koolho products at a pricing multiple far lower than what the big brands employed (usually four to five times the cost of goods sold). The driving value proposition for Koolho as stated by Singh was captured by the Indian phrase “isse sasta aur achcha kahan?” (where can you get it cheaper and better?). Singh’s goal was to offer “good quality products at very good prices.” Tiktauli Air the music channel was Singh’s brand pinnacle where it would “all come together.” The apparel the footwear the Fieldgear products and the music would make a heady mix. The interactive music radio channel would connect millions of TDC’s followers with 50 EDM DJs across the world each of whom endorsed the Tiktauli brand. The business arrangement was simple: Tiktauli would sponsor the DJs’ apparel footwear and accessories. In return the enrolled DJs would endorse the brand and provide music content for airing on Tiktauli Air which would become the world’s first EDM Top 20 DJs ranking platform. It also planned to sell EDM concert tickets worldwide. Tiktauli Air would be a “plug and play” EDM music listening post for customers. By 2020 Tiktauli Air would organize electronic music festivals on a larger scale than the Sunburn Festival and the Electric Daisy Carnival. The Role of Digital Marketing TDC had been aggressively leveraging digital marketing for its brands. Facebook campaigns had been the mainstay for marketing company owned brands although Twitter Instagram and Pinterest were also used. The marketing campaigns promoted new product launches product previews cross-selling special discounts countdowns to launches EDM events and ensemble creations. The two TDC team members responsible for digital marketing activities were Akhil Sharma and Puneet Chauhan. Singh used social media platforms regularly to keep in touch with customers and ensure that product and service grievances were expeditiously addressed. Effective use of search engine marketing and search engine optimization ensured that TDC’s web pages loaded in less than three seconds to reduce the bounce rate as much as possible. Separate search engine optimization strategies were created for desktops and mobile devices. The entire team provided input for content creation which was the most important factor for customer stickiness. All members of the TDC team were deeply committed to a digital thrust in their business’s marketing strategy. Singh had decided to spend approximately 50 per cent of TDC’s digital marketing budget of ?10 million on content marketing alone. Of this amount 60 per cent was spent on mobile video content. Convinced that digital services on mobile devices were the way of the future Singh concentrated TDC’s efforts on marketing activities such as experiential events and business-to-consumer activations. Despite the industry-wide lacklustre performance of influencer marketing on social media Singh was proud of the high level of customer engagement and business growth resulting from EDM DJs’ influence which extended beyond the launch and throughout the life of a product line. Singh claimed that almost 25 per cent of TDC’s incremental business flowed from influencer marketing. Leveraging Events and SponsorshipsTo deepen the company’s relationships with its target customers TDC had chosen to sponsor events involving celebrities college festivals and collaborations with DJs and choreographers. To strengthen the Fieldgear sports brand TDC pursued associations with league controlling bodies and participating teams managing to sign contracts with all teams of the Central Reserve Police Force as well as various leagues in sports such as kabaddi hockey table tennis and futsal. Sponsorships included a wheelchair cricket tournament in Bangalore the Chennai half marathon (Happy Runners) and the Pro Kabaddi League. Other agreements were planned with teams from Kenya and Iran and with American Kabaddi teams.CHANGES IN INDIA’S PAYMENT ECOSYSTEMOn November 8 2016 the government of India announced a demonetization policy and the Digital India initiative. Until this time almost 65 per cent of transacted business had been based on a cash-on-delivery system (COD). Therefore the new government initiatives dealt a severe blow to the e-commerce apparel industry including TDC to some extent as Singh explained:After the drop in business owing to government-curtailed cash transactions we decided that the business model needed to be changed immediately. Even if customers regained their confidence I as a manufacturer-marketer could not take a chance on what might happen again in the future. As a result of digitization of business transactions the Indian e-commerce space saw a shift away from COD as a payment option.Within five months re-monetization occurred and consumers resumed using cash which had the effect of considerably lowering the level of business confidence in the system. For TDC however the impact was less pronounced because almost 90 per cent of its offerings were purchased by customers using mobile phones who were already comfortable with online transactions. Most TDC mobile customers used Apple’s iOS operating system which was an indication of the company’s high-end customer base. This fact further confirmed the relatively low effect of the demonetization initiative. Nevertheless TDC decided to move its brands entirely away from the COD system. The company’s shift away from cash-based transactions was expected to have negative results for the Koolho brand which was considered a value-for-money offering. Singh worried that the brand’s largely COD-friendly clientele might abandon the brand altogether but he managed to avoid negative effects: Here our strategy was very different as the prices that we offered were low. We did not offer a free-return pick-up facility for COD customers. If we did that we would have been at a loss since the volume for Koolho was very high and therefore returns were proportionately high too. Koolho customers were required to pay through any online mode of payment such as credit cards debit cards electronic payment wallets or net banking. However this did not mean that we wouldn’t accept any returns. We have a very good return policy in effect. However our belief has been that when somebody receives a pre-paid shipment it resulted in an almost 90 per cent acceptance whereas with a COD facility there was a fifty–fifty chance of the product being returned often on insufficient grounds. So we were not going to sell through COD. Our exciting prices and excellent quality were strong enough incentives for our customers to buy by paying up front.THE CUSTOMER PERSONATrue to its music-inspired philosophy TDC offered trend-setting fashion apparel footwear and accessories that catered to the unique requirements of its core consumer groups a niche group of music enthusiasts (particularly hip hop and EDM listeners) who believed in making a statement with their appearance. These consumers identified strongly with like-minded people and were motivated by a desire to belong to the community of so-called “swaggers.” Singh had a clear vision of his target customer (see Exhibit 6):[The target is] youth in the age group of 14–24 years. When you find someone wearing earphones and listening to some music constantly they usually listen to hip hop. You see them in tight brightly coloured clothes with matching accessories. They are our target. They could be anybody. Whatever they do after work or when they take a break they listen to music mainly hip hop. Certainly the young are our potential target even a boy of 13 years who listens to Justin Bieber Meghan Trainor or Kanye West.Globally EDM listeners had specific easily identifiable demographic characteristics. They could be almost equally male or female; were mostly white African-American or Hispanic; had high school and some college education; were between 14 and 24 years of age; and had an annual household income between US$25000 and US$74000. In India EDM’s explosive growth coincided with the rise of the Indian middle class and one of the world’s youngest populations.Singh had a non-traditional approach to determining customer needs. He believed market research was for those who did not understand their market. For business leaders who worked very closely with musicians music producers DJs apparel designers and customers on the street—as he did—market research was an “unnecessary expense with doubtful usefulness.” He did not use big data or analytics to mine information or glean insights. He usually followed his instinct which had led to a turnover of ?1.18 billion and had commanded a significant brand followership on Facebook—for a niche brand. Target Customer BehaviourEDM fans had a great need for uniqueness a personality trait that valued being different from others and that was more accentuated among adolescents. The EDM genre differed from the music styles that were generally popular with Indian youth. The EDM fan base was a subset of the Indian youth that was willing to pay ?4000 to ?15000 for an EDM festival ticket and dress as if disinterested in the opinion of others wearing tight clothes LED shoes and “bling-infused” accessories. TDC remained cautious to ensure that design and pricing fit perfectly within this youth subset’s zone of acceptance. THE DILEMMATDC had been successful in 2016 and 2017 with sales figures matching Singh’s expectations and employees keen on getting work done. Singh’s informal and friendly leadership approach was well received by employees. However Singh could not help but worry that TDC might not improve by continuing to lead by instinct and without a plan despite his ability to remain knowledgeable of marketplace trends without formal market research. A bigger issue that bothered Singh was the question of what brand strategy to follow. He wondered if he should continue promoting a house of brands strategy or if he should instead switch to a branded house plan. What would be the implications in terms of funding one strategy versus the other? With TDC as the umbrella brand he also wondered if the Fieldgear brand should be renamed TDC Sports and if the Koolho brand should become TDC Lifestyle. What would be the long-term implications of any of these branding decisions?EXHIBIT 1: Tiktauli De Corps BRANDS SALES FIGURES (in ? million)Note: ? = INR = Indian rupee; ?1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; TDC = Tiktauli De Corps; B2B = business-to-business; NA = not available.Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: Tiktauli De Corps BRAND and BUSINESS PROFITABLITY (in ? million)Note: ? = INR = Indian rupee; ?1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; TDC = Tiktauli De Corps; B2B = business-to-business Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: Tiktauli De Corps ORGANIZATIONal CHARTSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 4: Tiktauli De Corps MARKETING SPEND ACROSS ALL CHANNELS (in ? million)Note: ? = INR = Indian rupee; ?1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; DJ = disk jockeySource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 5: PERCEPTUAL MAP OF Tiktauli De Corps BRANDSNote: TDC = Tiktauli De CorpsSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 6: TARGET CUSTOMER PROFILESource: Company documents.ENDNOTES,"[{""start"":952,""end"":964,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1319,""end"":1324,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1866,""end"":1871,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1664,""end"":1669,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2677,""end"":2682,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3040,""end"":3045,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3574,""end"":3579,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3795,""end"":3800,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4571,""end"":4576,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5479,""end"":5484,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5879,""end"":5884,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5948,""end"":5953,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6396,""end"":6401,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7366,""end"":7371,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8627,""end"":8632,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9708,""end"":9713,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12927,""end"":12932,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13892,""end"":13897,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15392,""end"":15397,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15628,""end"":15633,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16469,""end"":16474,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16739,""end"":16744,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17220,""end"":17225,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17558,""end"":17563,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19133,""end"":19138,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19784,""end"":19789,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20053,""end"":20058,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20265,""end"":20270,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20452,""end"":20457,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21672,""end"":21677,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22920,""end"":22925,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":24471,""end"":24476,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":25489,""end"":25494,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26938,""end"":26943,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27176,""end"":27181,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1094,""end"":1099,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2885,""end"":2890,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3567,""end"":3572,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4043,""end"":4048,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12589,""end"":12594,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12862,""end"":12867,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13769,""end"":13774,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14205,""end"":14210,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14485,""end"":14490,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14552,""end"":14557,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17008,""end"":17013,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17144,""end"":17149,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17094,""end"":17099,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":21361,""end"":21366,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":21417,""end"":21422,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25365,""end"":25370,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2835,""end"":2837,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4027,""end"":4029,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17335,""end"":17337,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":23021,""end"":23023,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":25557,""end"":25559,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":25843,""end"":25845,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":25765,""end"":25767,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":25919,""end"":25921,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":27233,""end"":27235,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":27310,""end"":27312,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":27473,""end"":27475,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1849,""end"":1852,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2707,""end"":2710,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3961,""end"":3964,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5827,""end"":5830,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6006,""end"":6009,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6422,""end"":6425,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":15402,""end"":15405,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":24499,""end"":24502,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":25939,""end"":25942,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":27057,""end"":27060,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Beyond the Lemonade Stand focused on enabling teen entrepreneurs through advisory work access to markets and project execution. Mjo was exhausted and frustrated by the challenges of working in Johannesburg’s townships. For the last few years she had successfully run a number of projects but she questioned whether she and her organization could sustain themselves serving kids in these tough urban environments. The sky was blue and the sun was in her eyes as she turned for home reflecting on the organizational and personal implications of the immediate choice she faced. Mjo thought to herself “Maybe I should focus less on the poor townships and more on functional middle-class and private schools where there is a huge demand for my services and funds to support it.” This choice would cut deep into her value system though requiring her to reflect on what was most important going forward.An entrepreneurial childhoodMjo was born in 1983 in Ezibeleni outside Queenstown Eastern Cape South Africa. It was the height of apartheid a legal system of enforced racial segregation and oppression. It was a violent time across the country as the authoritarian white minority government suppressed democratic social movements and political parties. Black people had few rights: they could not own land their education was limited and they were denied the right to vote. Mjo’s father was an insurance broker her mother a nurse. From an early age Mjo watched her parents strive against the odds for a better future for themselves and their family despite the challenges in society. When Mjo was nine South Africa began to change politically and socially for the better. The walls of apartheid began to come down Nelson Mandela was released from prison and laws began to change. Mjo was among the first group of black children to enrol in a boarding school that had historically been exclusively for white students. When Mjo was a teenager the family moved to the small nearby village of Dordrechat and her mother relocated to Cape Town to study psychiatric nursing. Mjo was left at home with her father and two younger siblings. She had to take on greater responsibility for her younger sister and brother. She felt an internal impulse to step forward and do what needed to be done. Mjo was a good student and enjoyed studying. As far back as she could remember she always had an entrepreneurial streak. In high school she and a friend ran a small tuck shop (small convenience store) selling sweets and biscuits to other students. In the boarding hostel the students were only allowed to go shopping once a week but Mjo had such demand for her stock that she and her friend would change out of their school uniforms put on ordinary clothes and sneak into town. She recalled that “the thrill of getting away with all of that and never getting caught was addictive.” And Mjo learned that sometimes rules needed to be broken in order to respond to the basic realities of people in need.With her good marks from high school Mjo was accepted to the University of Pretoria one of the continent’s leading universities to major in accounting. “When I matriculated my dad lost his job as an insurance broker. At the time my mom was a psych nurse. In order to pay for my varsity fees and put my 14-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother through school they decided my mom would move to Dublin Ireland to work as a nurse.” Mjo’s mother would be paid better in Ireland and could send money home. Mjo knew she needed to succeed so she could also help her younger siblings and family. She was not nervous about her ability to excel at varsity thinking “I cruised through high school; surely I can handle varsity.” But the reality was different: university was much more difficult. The move from a small town to the big city was difficult for Mjo to manage. Through most of her first year she was enthralled by the pull of parties on and around campus. She often skipped classes assuming she would be able to easily pull everything together at year-end but Mjo had a rude awakening when she failed her first year of accounting. “There was my mom in Dublin working hard as a nurse to pay my university fees and I was pissing it all away.”Encounters with Social IssuesIn her second year Mjo changed course and decided to specialize in informatics which combined computer science and commercial subjects. She managed to pass her first year and found her study rhythm. She worked hard and graduated a few years later. Then she did her honours an optional fourth year of undergraduate study with a focus in finance. While completing her honours Mjo managed to start two new businesses with friends. The first was a clothing brand and the second was a café and shop for an office block where Mjo interned during the holidays. Also during her honours year Mjo encountered Crossroads Kids Shelter a non-profit organization working with street kids. The head of the project mentioned that what the boys needed most was someone to spend time with them. “I didn’t have money and I had no boys’ clothes to donate but I had a lot of time so I started volunteering” Mjo recalled. “Initially my idea was to just go and hang out on Saturdays” she said. “The shelter’s intention was rehabilitation and [sending] the boys back to school but I soon realized that the schools were not set up to deal with the complexities of boys who had lived and worked on the street for many years. Some boys were 17 and simply chucked into a regular grade 11 class. So a lot of boys struggled.”Seeing an opportunity to help Mjo recruited retired teachers and peers from her church to start a tutoring program offering basic numeracy and literacy skills. “If you can survive on the streets you are very smart” Mjo said. “So a lot of the boys caught on very quickly. But they couldn’t connect the importance of completing high school with their future career prospects. The only jobs they had seen first-hand were police and security guards and they were not interested in those jobs.”So Mjo began an informal career guidance program asking young professionals to share their stories. “[N]ow the boys could see how applying themselves to their studies could help them become a graphic designer or marketer or whatever” she said. The career guidance program grew expanding into other centres working with young people at risk such as girls who had been abandoned or abused. Over the next three years Mjo worked for the project as a part-time volunteer.From Finance to Youth DevelopmentIn January 2008 Mjo started her first formal employment working at the International Finance Group an asset management company in Pretoria. Mjo had never envisioned herself behind a desk in an office job in a large corporation so the International Finance Group appealed to her as a small company that did not have the trappings of corporate life. It was still a desk job but it offered more creativity than a large corporation could.In 2009 Mjo met Jonathan Cook a senior lecturer and director at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) and started volunteering with the GIBS high school leadership program Spirit of Youth. Cook then told Mjo about the social entrepreneurship program at GIBS a six month part-time course that inspired and equipped social change makers. Although the course could be studied part-time when Mjo reflected on her first career moves and the volunteer work that gave her life meaning she knew she wanted to quit her job and find full-time work in the social sector. She had already sent her resume to a number of organizations but without a positive response. The GIBS course provided Mjo with a way to justify leaving work without seeming irresponsible. She hoped the course would help her better structure her ideas for a youth empowerment initiative that would create a positive social impact.Mjo faced a turning point in her life and a dilemma. She had saved enough money to move to Johannesburg and pursue her new career dream but she wondered how she could tell her parents that she was leaving the security of her full-time office job without devastating them. Mjo had been sent to the best schools—well beyond what her parents could afford. They had sacrificed everything to make it happen. She was set up to climb the corporate ladder. In South Africa at the time the pressure on a new generation of young black middle-class professionals was especially intense. They were expected to contribute financially toward a range of immediate and extended family commitments. Mjo’s employment provided her family with a way out of ongoing financial stress. If Mjo quit her job her mother would need to stay in Ireland longer to earn an income and support Mjo’s siblings.In late 2010 Mjo made the difficult call. She quit her job and enrolled in the GIBS social entrepreneurship program. She recalled thinking “I am going to find work in the youth development space. That is where I feel most alive. I know this from my time at Crossroads.” But when Mjo told her mother she was livid. “What are you doing!” her mother had exclaimed. Although her parents were upset Mjo pointed out to them “You raised me to believe we are here to serve a purpose. I am practising what you taught me.” She recalled thinking “Am I going to make choices because I am afraid or because I have been called to pursue something bigger than myself? If you step out in faith God will come to meet you.”A short while later Mjo sat in the GIBS classroom on the first day of class in early 2011 with about 50 other new students. There were many new concepts being discussed. The first class focused on the concept of social entrepreneurship. There was some nervousness but generally it felt good. It felt right. “I felt like it was a clean start . . . a little bit exhilarating and an opportunity to pursue what I really enjoyed and what I was made for” she recalled. As a student again Mjo could think properly about her next move without any pressure. She knew what she did not want for her life; now she could pursue what she wanted. Mjo was new to the idea of social entrepreneurship but something about it drew her in. She had only an idea of what was involved in the youth development field but she had some brief experience starting a number of small businesses. She had also mentored young people for a number of years. She wondered if she was in the right place and if she was how she might even begin to start a new social venture.Finding the pathThe course comforted and reassured Mjo. This was a recognized formal path of study and it gave Mjo time to think through her first steps in the social sector. The course also showed her that she was not alone and exposed her to a range of new ideas in social entrepreneurship and non-profit leadership. Mjo gave herself the year to find her direction but as the end of the year approached and the course finished she did not feel ready to launch her own venture. Therefore Mjo applied for a number of positions in the youth development field to gain more experience.None of the organizations she applied to replied. The end of the year came and went. Time passed. Then in early 2012 Mjo heard back from Junior Achievement a well-respected organization that ran entrepreneurship support programs for young people. Junior Achievement would employ Mjo on contract as a part-time facilitator. She could now buy groceries and basics. Then Mjo found other short-contract facilitation work. This was progress but she barely managed to pay the rent. Nothing was solid. But as another year passed Mjo learned a few things and was gaining some respect in the youth development field. She still believed she was on the right path and her faith guided her but she also still occasionally worried about letting down her parents who had invested so much in Mjo’s education.Then in 2013 Mjo got a break with the opportunity to run career guidance for the Maths Centre a well-known organization that ran high-quality support programs for mathematics and science education mostly in schools. Mjo loved this work and she found meaning and value in the workshops. It built on volunteering work she had done while in university. The students had so little exposure to different careers; they only knew about the people they saw around them—nurses policemen and teachers. Mjo could make a real difference and significantly broaden the students’ horizons. One of the ways she did this was to organize a number of visits to diverse large companies to show students what the world of work was really about. But these did not always go well. On one visit to a top law firm the first 30 students hungrily took all the food that was intended for 100 students. Then a group of girls somehow blocked the toilets. A plumber had to be called. It was all very embarrassing for the learners and for Mjo. Mjo realized in moments like these that the broader situation students faced was dire. Their needs were extensive including food books transportation and help understanding the informal rules of the world of work. She would often react spontaneously to these needs taking the money she earned and spending it on supporting the poorest children. “There were so many needs and I wanted to meet all of them” she recalled. She was trying to be strategic about her impact but often found herself reacting to the immediate needs of her environment. As the end of 2013 approached Mjo realized she had spent three years in the social sector. In some ways she was still no closer to a clearly identified path but in another way she was learning about a range of challenges and possibilities for impact. When a number of the young learners came to her to say that they wanted to apply for further studies but did not have the money Mjo had an “aha moment.” She began to dream of an entrepreneurship program through which the young students could earn an income. This would help them to study further. Mjo had run her own successful tuck shop in high school and then run two businesses at university. She wanted to draw on this experience and provide a platform for others to learn to support themselves.Beyond the Lemonade StandIn early 2014 Mjo registered a non-profit company Beyond the Lemonade Stand. The name pointed to Mjo’s passion for using entrepreneurship projects to help students learn how to run a business and realize their true potential. This initiative was hugely needed in the country. Despite South Africa’s high unemployment rate the rate of entrepreneurial activity was very low. Entrepreneurial intentions in the African region were more than three times higher than in South Africa. Higher levels of entrepreneurship were seen as a way to create jobs and build the economy.The first program Mjo created was based in high schools. Participating learners would run a business and sell their products to the rest of the school. The businesses were prescribed by Mjo and included a gift shop stationary store and book store. “In the first week 30 kids signed up” she remembered. “All the kids were initially excited but then in the second week they had to find clients and sell things. . . . [T]heir friends were not flooding the stalls anymore. And I lost half the group.” Many of the students who signed up were academically smart. The business was the first thing they had struggled with at school and it was a struggle on a very public stage in front of their peers. The students could not manage the embarrassment created when non-participating students harassed the participating learners and laughed at them. After a few weeks the participating learners would give excuses such as “I have to quit. My mom does not want me to do this.” But Mjo knew the learners’ decisions had nothing to do with their parents; rather their decision was a result of peer pressure to conform and fear of public embarrassment.This feedback tested Mjo’s assumptions. She realized that “people don’t care about an idea; it means nothing.” Mjo had to abandon her innovative ideas and begin to identify and focus on the real problems and how she could solve them. While thinking through her next steps Mjo continued with the career guidance work but this was proving less and less satisfying because her participating learners could not access the funds to study further. After four years along this new path Mjo realized that her passion and skills were truly in developing young entrepreneurs despite its challenges. A Revised Entrepreneurship ProgramIn 2015 Mjo started her second new schools-based program. This time students would be required to start their own newspaper secure advertising write the stories and demonstrate their ability to achieve something they could never have envisioned doing. The program gave under-resourced students experience in working together to achieve something extraordinary. It helped them build grit—a value associated with life success. The program also gave students digital experience and improved their English and writing skills. And because the newspaper was sustainably financed by advertising it was an example of how to start one’s own business. Mjo started getting calls from the media and she was profiled by Lead SA a well-respected leadership initiative. This was an exciting time; the new program met many objectives and needs. But Mjo again faced many of the same hurdles associated with working in township schools. English proficiency was low and while improving it was a goal of the project non-participating students would buy the newspaper and ridicule any errors. An underlying culture existed that opposed success. Mjo was frustrated that “people believed it was better if we all stay[ed where we were and didn’t] get better.”When the newspaper covered a story about the school teachers not doing what was required the school shut the newspaper and the program down. Mjo was devastated. By July 2015 she was finished. She had nothing left to give. For four and a half years she had pursued her dream of working in and facilitating youth development. She had made an impact through her facilitation and the first two programs of Beyond the Lemonade Stand. She had also learned a lot. She knew from experience that participating learners and young people had to pay for the service she provided. “If they don’t have skin in the game it is so easy for them to walk away” she said. She told people “You do them [young people] no service by giving them things for free.”Despite her short-term success and learning there was nothing sustainable. Mjo felt like she had been ill-equipped for the challenges of the entrepreneurial journey she had chosen. She noted “There is the assumption that because you are smart you are supposed to ‘get it’ and work things out faster. It is embarrassing to be struggling.” She knew she had to pick herself up and start again.Finding a sustainable business model Disheartened Mjo took a break to reconsider her options. She realized deep down that the development of young entrepreneurs was still her passion and her calling. She also realized that despite the challenges her programs were having impact. But the not-for-profit path had its problems. Mjo had learned that an organization could attract sympathy support but that this was not sustainable because “it creates a false sense of progress where you feel like you are getting somewhere. But it keeps you on the wrong track. You need to rather articulate how organizations can benefit from funding you.” Toward the end of 2015 Mjo abandoned the non-profit dream and re-registered Beyond the Lemonade Stand as a for-profit business. She hoped a stronger focus on financial sustainability would help her build a larger organization and have more impact. She re-positioned herself for new funding and support. In November 2015 during Global Entrepreneurship Week Mjo began reaching out to teenagers who were already running businesses. From her experience she knew the value of supporting those who were already helping themselves. She developed and ran Johannesburg’s first teen entrepreneurship festival. The festival was sponsored by the city government Red Bull GmbH Levi Strauss & Co. Enke (an aligned non-profit) Old Mutual plc (a large South African financial services company) and Wits Business School (one of the country’s top graduate business schools). Mjo had over 40 teen business owners participate in the festival and she selected the top 20 to compete for cash prizes. It was a very successful and well-publicized initiative. In early 2016 Mjo settled on three core offerings that she would take to the market. These included advisory work in the youth entrepreneurship development field access to markets for teen and youth-led companies and project execution for sponsors interested in youth entrepreneurship. This focus helped her build new momentum. In July 2016 as Mjo focused on marketing and expanding her business she hired her first full-time employee. She had a number of key clients and a group of experienced part-time facilitators working across different projects. Beyond the Lemonade Stand was now in a strong position for growth.Strategic choicesAs Mjo left Alexandra that day in August 2016 she knew Beyond the Lemonade Stand was in a stronger position than a year earlier when the school newspaper project had closed. Although she had built an innovative social business with a strong reputation with funders communities and other stakeholders she could feel the personal and organizational tension around some strategic choices.Mjo was worn down and frustrated by the challenges of working in Johannesburg’s townships. These isolated neighbourhoods were where black South Africans had been forced to live during apartheid. Despite the democratic changes in the country these areas were still mostly poor. Youth unemployment averaged over 50 per cent. Alexandra was one of the very few historic urban areas where black South Africans could own property under the segregation of apartheid. Alexandrians were proud of their neighbourhood but it was a harsh place. Since the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy in 1994 and as the country normalized hundreds of thousands of poor immigrants from around South Africa and the region had made Alexandra their home. But Alexandra was small covering an area of only 6.9 square kilometres and many people lived crammed into shacks and the backrooms of established houses. The area was noisy vibrant and filled with a wide mix of cultures. Mjo’s day in Alexandra was particularly illustrative of the challenges of working in townships. Attendance at the workshop had been disappointing. Only a quarter of the 40 children who registered showed up and the teacher who had agreed to support the program was nowhere in sight. This typified Mjo’s extensive experience with many township schools. She wanted desperately to disrupt the status quo and make an impact on these students’ lives. They needed it most but she felt that the students did not appreciate what she had to offer and the peer pressure to “play it cool” subverted Mjo’s efforts. Working in such highly dysfunctional contexts made her consider alternatives. Over the last year better-functioning and private schools in middle-class areas had been phoning Mjo; they were willing to pay for her services and provide all the support she needed to be effective. In these environments nothing would get in the way of her having a real impact. In addition her work with established teen entrepreneurs offered Mjo an opportunity to leverage their success and take them to new levels.Now as she drove out of Alexandra Mjo wondered about shifting focus to better paying and potentially more impactful school groups. Just a few miles in front of Mjo as she drove out of Alexandra was Sandton the sanitized suburban home of almost all of the large corporate head offices for South Africa. It was known as the richest square mile on the African continent. South Africa had some of the highest rates of economic inequality in the world and the short drive that Mjo took that day starkly demonstrated this.The choice facing Mjo cut deep into her personal value system. She had left a high-potential corporate career in financial services to follow her calling. Sustaining that calling was crucial in the long term. Mjo wondered how best to sustain herself and use the organization to have the social impact she desired.,"[{""start"":945,""end"":956,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1002,""end"":1014,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2223,""end"":2235,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2829,""end"":2841,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":9550,""end"":9562,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15704,""end"":15716,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15884,""end"":15896,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23482,""end"":23494,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25148,""end"":25160,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25228,""end"":25240,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1361,""end"":1364,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1808,""end"":1811,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2157,""end"":2160,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2601,""end"":2604,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2676,""end"":2679,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3007,""end"":3010,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2816,""end"":2819,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3149,""end"":3152,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3295,""end"":3298,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3512,""end"":3515,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3845,""end"":3848,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4098,""end"":4101,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4249,""end"":4252,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4642,""end"":4645,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4714,""end"":4717,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5058,""end"":5061,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5272,""end"":5275,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5500,""end"":5503,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6001,""end"":6004,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5855,""end"":5858,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6064,""end"":6067,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6367,""end"":6370,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6806,""end"":6809,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6991,""end"":6994,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7268,""end"":7271,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7679,""end"":7682,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7780,""end"":7783,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7904,""end"":7907,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8206,""end"":8209,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8412,""end"":8415,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8596,""end"":8599,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8887,""end"":8890,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9098,""end"":9101,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9370,""end"":9373,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9780,""end"":9783,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9864,""end"":9867,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9959,""end"":9962,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9987,""end"":9990,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10253,""end"":10256,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10368,""end"":10371,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10699,""end"":10702,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11161,""end"":11164,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11311,""end"":11314,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11766,""end"":11769,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11826,""end"":11829,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12034,""end"":12037,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12204,""end"":12207,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12414,""end"":12417,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12576,""end"":12579,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12665,""end"":12668,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12819,""end"":12822,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13074,""end"":13077,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13103,""end"":13106,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13306,""end"":13309,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13582,""end"":13585,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14097,""end"":14100,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14102,""end"":14105,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14675,""end"":14678,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15024,""end"":15027,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15193,""end"":15196,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15434,""end"":15437,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15517,""end"":15520,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16006,""end"":16009,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16174,""end"":16177,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16957,""end"":16960,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17145,""end"":17148,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17235,""end"":17238,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17396,""end"":17399,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17603,""end"":17606,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17755,""end"":17758,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18389,""end"":18392,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18580,""end"":18583,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18871,""end"":18874,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19123,""end"":19126,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19796,""end"":19799,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20161,""end"":20164,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20436,""end"":20439,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20770,""end"":20773,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21103,""end"":21106,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21796,""end"":21799,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22126,""

(EuropaCorp) announced a historical record loss of €119.9 million. The next month the company released France’s most expensive film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (Valerian). Earlier between 2001 and 2010 the company had almost doubled revenues operating through what it called an “integrated studio model” but then incurred substantial losses and nearly went bankrupt in 2011. To effect a turnaround the company formed distribution and co-production deals with Shanghai Fundamental Films Inc. (Fundamental Films) based in China. EuropaCorp also formed a joint venture with Relativity Media LLC (Relativity) based in the United States to market and distribute both EuropaCorp’s and Relativity’s movies in the United States. These efforts had increased EuropaCorp’s revenues in 2015 to the highest level it had ever reached. Then unexpectedly in July 2016 EuropaCorp announced the lowest revenues since 2008 and operating losses. It tried to effect a second turnaround by selling non-core assets refocusing on the founder’s historical successes of core businesses raising funds restructuring debts and reducing overheads. The subsequent capital increase that resulted from issuing new equity stakes to Fundamental Films brought about a major shift in EuropaCorp’s shareholding structure. However in November 2017 EuropaCorp still anticipated a continuing loss in 2018 (see Exhibit 1). Given the recent events and financial results the company appeared to be still in need of a second turnaround. How could EuropaCorp achieve its needed turnaround and continue to grow?THE FOUNDER OF EUROPACORP: FROM FILM PRODUCER TO ENTREPRENEURBorn in Paris in 1959 Luc Besson the founder of EuropaCorp discovered the film industry when he was 17 years old and on the film set of a short movie. He took many jobs in film production being second and then first assistant to film directors all while writing his own projects. Besson’s first full-length feature Le Dernier Combat—which Besson wrote directed and produced himself in 1983—earned several awards in France. His next film Subway which was distributed by The Gaumont Film Company (Gaumont) in France was a great success in France with almost 3 million viewers (see Exhibits 2A and 2B) and was the seventh most successful movie of 1985. In 1988 Besson’s next film The Big Blue sold 9.1 million tickets becoming Besson’s greatest box office success to date in French cinema. Almost 30 years later The Big Blue remained in the top 50 of the highest grossing films of all times in France. Besson directed and released Nikita in 1990 and Léon: The Professional in 1994. The two movies made $6.7 and $45.3 million respectively in worldwide box office sales with 3.8 and 3.5 million tickets respectively sold in France. Nikita became the most successful French movie in the United States making Besson famous on the international stage. In 1997 the release of The Fifth Element the most expensive European film ever made became the most successful French movie in the United States with $264 million in gross revenues worldwide. After a decade of international successes Besson started a new project Taxi. Gaumont was not convinced that this project was worthwhile therefore Besson and Gaumont’s former distribution director Pierre-Ange Le Pogam joined in November 2000 to create EuropaCorp which would produce Taxi and other projects. Besson was scriptwriting action movies at that time focusing on creating movies with popular appeal such as sequels to the original Taxi as well as The Dancer Exit Yamakasi and Kiss of the Dragon. The movies received poor reviews. Nonetheless the Taxi franchise achieved popular success earning $238.5 million in revenues worldwide and attracting 27.5 million viewers in France.By 2002 EuropaCorp had become a well-structured company generating €98 million in revenues and employing about 50 people (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Besson owned 73 per cent of the company’s shares through his wholly owned company Front Line and was chair of EuropaCorp’s board. Le Pogam owned 16 per cent of EuropaCorp’s shares and was the chief executive officer (CEO) (see Exhibit 5).EUROPACORP: A HISTORY OF VERTICAL INTEGRATIONSEuropaCorp adopted an integrated studio model—a studio system that brought many or all aspects of film production under one company. Creative talent was usually employed on long-term contracts (see Exhibit 6). EuropaCorp vertically integrated value-creating activities through acquisitions partnerships and greenfield investments aiming to consolidate its competitive position along the value chain of the film industry.Alongside EuropaCorp’s production business the company also sold television broadcasting rights and international rights. In 2001 the company set up several subsidiaries to extend its involvement in various stages of the film business in France—from theatrical distribution through EuropaCorp Distribution to video publishing and distribution through EuropaCorp Home Entertainment and EIG Fox Pathe? Europa. The film distribution involved selecting a movie acquiring the needed copyrights marketing and programming. The company could produce movies internally or acquire copyrights for movies from other companies. Marketing activities included selecting a release date and method of promotion and organizing previews. Depending on the criteria for releasing the film programming involved negotiating with independent or networked movie theatres.During the same period EuropaCorp created EuropaCorp Home Entertainment to edit and distribute EuropaCorp’s own movies. This subsidiary then joined with another French producer and distributor Pathé Frères (Pathé) and with the American film studio Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (Twentieth Century Fox) to create Fox Pathé Europa. The group distributed movies from the catalogues of all three companies in video format (DVDs). In April 2002 EuropaCorp invested a 35-per-cent stake in EuropaCorp Japan which was created in partnership with Japan’s leading media players to exclusively distribute EuropaCorp’s films in Japan. In April 2010 EuropaCorp increased its stake in EuropaCorp Japan to 100 per cent; however the entity was liquidated in February 2012 after recording revenues of €129000 but with net losses of €98000 in fiscal year (FY) 2010/11. In May 2002 EuropaCorp acquired Intervista a book publishing company and The Dog Productions a producer of advertising films. Intervista had published the Arthur and the Invisibles book series written by Besson and Céline Garcia with more than 400000 copies sold of the first three in the series. The books were the basis for EuropaCorp’s Arthur and the Invisibles movies; with the success of the first film released in 2006 movies of the second and third episodes were subsequently released in 2009 and 2010 respectively.In 2005 apart from its core film production EuropaCorp created another subsidiary EuropaCorp Music Publishing to increase profitability of its own original music works. Until March 2017 the catalogue of approximately 1500 original works had been acquired by collecting societies all over the world. In June 2017 EuropaCorp sold its catalogue of music copyrights to Sony/ATV Music Publishing and signed an agreement with it to administer its music royalties for future film and television titles.In 2007 EuropaCorp fully acquired a long-term partner Ydéo which specialized in consulting and creative marketing creation for €670000. In 2008 EuropaCorp acquired 100 per cent of Roissy Films for €28 million strengthening EuropaCorp’s asset base and expanding its offering in the video and television market. Roissy Films was one of very few independent companies that owned a large catalogue; Roissy had about 500 quality movies.In 2009 EuropaCorp partnered with Euro Media Group S.A. Quinta Communications S.A. and Front Line to launch La Cité du Cinéma a cinema hub near Paris France. The project included nine film sets costing over €170 million to construct. The hub finished in 2012 became EuropaCorp’s headquarters in August of that year attracting local permanent and temporary employees who worked together on each production project.Penetrating the Television Drama IndustryIn April 2010 EuropaCorp acquired a 75-per-cent stake in Cipango Ltd. (Cipango) a producer of French television dramas. Targeting French and international markets Cipango was ranked as the seventh French television drama producer with revenues of €14.6 million. The acquisition was a significant step towards increase the value of brands EuropaCorp had developed over the previous 10 years while strengthening its reputation and position among large American distributors as a leader in the European film industry. Cipango was renamed EuropaCorp Television in 2011 and fully acquired by EuropaCorp in July 2014. Producing television series was considered less risky than producing movies because television projects were usually fully financed before production started. EuropaCorp’s entry into this market was also timely: the emerging SVoD (subscription video on demand) platforms like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video were transforming how people consumed television series.The Initial Public OfferingIn July 2007 EuropaCorp announced a successful initial public offering (IPO) with a stock price of €15.5 and funding of about €77 million. Besson retained majority control with 63.2 per cent of the shares and voting rights. The goal of the IPO was to increase the number of high-budget production projects and attract well-known American actors. Agents of these actors usually looked for financially strong production companies. Besson and Le Pogam aimed to reach sales of around €300 million within four years of the IPO. Despite the fact that the IPO was heavily oversubscribed the company’s first trading day was relatively quiet. After the IPO the share price had continued to drop until the global financial crisis. Within a year the global financial crisis had pushed the price down by 60 per cent to around €6.40. Based on the company’s risk and return profile the IPO valuation might arguably have been too high. EuropaCorp’s shares reached their lowest level at €1.17 in May 2012 and then climbed fluctuating between €3 and €5. Compared to other film and entertainment companies such as The Gaumont Film Company in France and the American companies The Walt Disney Company (Walt Disney) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. EuropaCorp had underperformed in the market since its IPO in 2007 (see Exhibit 7).THE FILM AND CINEMA INDUSTRYIn FranceThe film production and distribution industry in France accounted for 3.2 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product worth €58 billion in 2014. France’s population of people six years of age and older in 2014 was about 59 million; about 67 per cent of these people went to movie theatres at least once a year. Movie attendance at the theatre was the main driver of the French cinema market. In 2015 France’s box office sales were over 205 million tickets or €1331 million (see Exhibit 8). Record high sales in 2011 were linked to successful films like The Intouchables which was produced by Gaumont. The movie theatre was one of the final links in the value chain closest to the final viewer. In France the main theatre companies included Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé CGR Cinemas Group and Cineworld Cinemas Ltd. representing 13.4 per cent 8.1 per cent and 7.0 per cent of the screens respectively. In 2015 there were 5741 screens in 2033 establishments in France showing 654 movies which included 322 French-initiated projects. Movie theatres generally kept 50 per cent of the after-tax ticket sales and transferred the remaining 50 per cent to the distributor. In 2016 major film production companies Walt Disney Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. held 15.0 per cent 13.3 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively of the market share in France (see Exhibit 9). These market shares were volatile depending on the number of movies the company distributed.In 2015 investments in France’s film production reached €1224 million of which French-initiated production accounted for €4.4 million. Film producers often aimed to minimize their own investment capital by securing additional funds from co-producers including television channels distributors and subsidies. In general producers still had to invest approximately 15 per cent of the production costs. The major French production and distribution companies were Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé StudioCanal Cineworld Cinemas Gaumont and EuropaCorp. The French “Cultural Exception”The concept of French “cultural exception” referred to the use of legislation to protect French cultural creations. One measure was an additional tax of approximately 11 per cent charged on all cinema tickets and 2 per cent on all DVD sales. The revenue approximately €700 million per year was used as a subsidy to support French original content such as all French movies. In fact American movies which represented 45–55 per cent of ticket sales in France were helping to finance the production of French movies. French television channels were also committed to investing some revenues in cinema production in exchange for the right to broadcast the movies on their television channels nine months after the release in theatres. The French government also imposed quotas on French content played on radio and television.In the United StatesIn 2016 box office revenues in the United States reached $10.6 billion representing 28.5 per cent of the world’s market share. However movies produced by American companies represented an overwhelming share—79 per cent—of all movies in the worldwide box office. The American cinema industry had six major studios including Walt Disney (holding 26.3 per cent of the global market share) Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (16.7 per cent) Twentieth Century Fox (12.9 per cent) Universal City Studios Productions LLLP (12.4 per cent) Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (8 per cent) and Paramount Pictures Corporation (7.7 per cent). Together they accounted for 84 per cent of the global market share worth about $9.6 billion.Before 1948 major American studios were fully integrated from production through distribution to exhibition in movie theatres owning their own theatres and exclusive rights to dictate which theatres would show their films. However a landmark anti-trust court case in 1948 forbade studios from being both distributor and theatre operator. Major studios were therefore relegated to production and distribution. The six major studios in the United States had their own subsidiaries in France to distribute their movies in that country. In ChinaThe Chinese film market had seen a very high growth rate from 2012 to 2016 compared to the market in the United States and France (see Exhibit 10). China’s international box office had grown from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $6.2 billion in 2016 representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.9 per cent. With growth of 49 per cent from 2014 to 2015 China was the first market outside the United States to achieve box office revenues of over $5 billion. Its box office revenues were expected to reach $10.7 billion with a market share of 23.2 per cent by 2021 or a CAGR of 11.6 per cent from 2016 to 2021. This forecast was only $500 million less than that of the United States.China had become the most attractive market for French movies. However the Chinese government was also trying to boost its own film industry over Hollywood by implementing tax breaks for local cinema operators and requiring that to enter the market foreign films be co-produced with Chinese companies. In 1994 when it first allowed foreign titles in China the Chinese government limited the number of foreign films (i.e. films produced by a non-Chinese film producer) to 10 per year to preserve its own growing film industry. After entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 the government increased the quota to 20 titles then to 34 titles in 2012 and in December 2016 to 39 titles as “cultural exchange projects.” EuropaCorp was well established in China producing seven out of 10 French movies distributed in the country since 2000.CHRISTOPHE LAMBERT ERA: 2010–2016 EuropaCorp had almost doubled its revenues from €98 million in 2001 to €181 million in 2010 through vertical integration; Jean-Julien Baronnet was the CEO (until November 2008). However EuropaCorp’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) struggled decreasing from a profit of 14 per cent in FY 2004/05 to a loss of 9 per cent in FY 2009/10 (see Exhibit 11). Christophe Lambert CEO of Front Line—EuropaCorp’s parent company holding 62 per cent of EuropaCorp’s shares—was then appointed CEO of EuropaCorp effective July 7 2010. During FY 2010/11 EuropaCorp nearly went bankrupt with disastrous operating losses of €47 million. To recover the company launched a new strategic plan in May 2011 focusing on overseas expansion by targeting the Chinese market and the production of English language films. In October 2013 EuropaCorp strengthened its competitive position by opening a 12-screen multiplex movie theatre in the Aéroville shopping centre near Paris. This theatre activity generated revenues of €5.8 million in FY 2014/15 and €7.46 million in FY 2015/16 with 770000 tickets sold. The company planned to open a second theatre La Joliette in Marseille with construction to start in 2017.In February 2014 EuropaCorp formed a joint venture with Relativity the American production and distribution company—Relativity EuropaCorp Distribution (RED). The new venture marketed and distributed films from both EuropaCorp and Relativity in the United States. EuropaCorp was to pay Relativity $130 million over the next six years for 50 per cent of the shares of the venture. Both companies were to seek opportunities to produce and finance movies together while sharing their profits. Being already present in the U.S. market EuropaCorp expected to use RED to fully control EuropaCorp’s distribution and maximize its visibility in the United States. Relativity also expected to increase its use of RED’s strong distribution and marketing abilities while continuing to expand its own film production.These efforts renewed EuropaCorp’s profitability between 2011 and 2015 with EBIT between 4 per cent and 16 per cent and revenues increasing from €168 million in FY 2011/12 to €227 million in FY2014/15 the highest level the company had ever reached. The release of Lucy a film produced by EuropaCorp and directed by Besson in August 2014 was a main driver of EuropaCorp’s success. Lucy became the most successful French film ever with the highest worldwide revenues and number of tickets sold to date (see Exhibits 2A and B).PARTNERSHIP WITH China’s FUNDAMENTAL FILMSAs part of Lambert’s turnaround plan which included gaining a larger presence in China EuropaCorp announced a three-year deal with Fundamental Films in China in July 2012. Fundamental Films was founded in 2008 with headquarters in Shanghai and offices in Beijing and Los Angeles. A prominent distributor of Chinese and foreign film in China Fundamental Films was listed on the Chinese NEEQ stock exchange with revenues of €25.7 million in 2015 (see Exhibit 12). Through the deal with EuropaCorp Fundamental Films was given exclusive rights to distribute all films produced by EuropaCorp (at least 15 titles) in the Chinese market and the two companies committed to co-producing three of those films. EuropaCorp already had a large number of well-known top-tier films in China particularly Transporter 3 and Adèle: Rise of the Mummy. With Fundamental Films’ knowledge and market position in the country EuropaCorp planned to significantly expand the presence of both Chinese and French films to fully benefit from the extraordinary growth in the Chinese market. The partnership also made Fundamental Films an international player in funding and producing international film projects. After the success of this initial partnership the deal was extended in May 2015 for an additional five years. In the extended deal Fundamental Films committed to investing $50 million in Besson’s new Valerian project adapted from a comic book and embodying EuropaCorp’s history. Valerian was by far the most expensive French movie to that point (€197 million) overtaking other films directed by Besson including Asterix at the Olympic Games (€78 million) and The Fifth Element (€75 million). Valerian was filmed at EuropaCorp’s Cité du Cinéma. Its post-production effects were done by a subsidiary of EuropaCorp Digital Factory. Fundamental Films and EuropaCorp would each be responsible for distribution of the movie in the company’s respective territory and Fundamental Films claimed a substantial part of the international box office.THE END OF LAMBERT’s ERA AND CRITICAL STRATEGIC DECISIONS 2016–2017Lambert unexpectedly resigned in February 2016 and Marc Shmuger an American and a former chairman of Universal Pictures was appointed the new CEO. Lambert’s sudden departure raised speculation that EuropaCorp might soon be sold off—a conclusion drawn by linking Lambert’s departure with his overly ambitious Valerian project and overseas expansions. In July 2016 EuropaCorp announced very disappointing results for FY 2015/16 including revenues of €147.3 million the lowest level since 2008 and operating losses of €22.3 million. In September 2016 EuropaCorp announced the sale of its multiplex theatre activities launched earlier in 2013 and of the La Joliette project in Marseille still under development to Les Cine?mas Gaumont Pathe? for $21.2 million indicating that it wanted to refocus on its core production and worldwide distribution of films and television series. In November 2016 EuropaCorp announced a reserved capital increase of €60 million by issuing new equity stakes of 27.9 per cent to Fundamental Films at a share price of €5.25 corresponding to a premium of 38.5 per cent (see Exhibit 13). This capital increase would enhance EuropaCorp’s ability to produce and distribute English-language films and series worldwide. The capital increase was also a major shift in EuropaCorp’s shareholding structure reducing Besson’s ownership from 44 per cent to 32 per cent and making Fundamental Films the second-largest shareholder (see Exhibit 14).In June 2017 EuropaCorp announced its FY 2016/17 results which included revenues of €151.7 million—a marginal increase of 3 per cent driven by foreign sales—but with a historical record loss of €119.9 million. The operating cash flow was also enormously reduced to €2.4 million from €81.7 million in FY 2015/16. Accordingly EuropaCorp’s stock price decreased by 8 per cent. The company attributed its loss to the poor performance of English-language films and disappointing box office revenues in the United States—the result of RED the joint venture with Relativity—which failed to offset the significant distribution costs of over €100 million. In response to this failure in January 2017 EuropaCorp outsourced some theatrical distribution and marketing of Valerian and other upcoming films in the United States to STX Motion Pictures Group with a multi-year agreement. This decision had immediate and dramatic effects on RED which included a large number of RED employees being laid off. FY 2016/17 also marked a high level of investment of €133.7 million in world-class films like Valerian and television series like Taken. In October 2017 EuropaCorp anticipated a continuing loss for FY 2017/18 again due to disappointing box office revenues for Valerian in the United States. In November 2017 Shmuger announced his plan to leave EuropaCorp at the end of his contract on December 31 2017. Besson would assume the position of interim CEO on January 1 2018. The company also announced the sale of the French television activity it had acquired earlier for €11 million; the sale would decrease yearly overheads of approximately €2.5 million–€3 million. EuropaCorp kept its U.S. television business continuing to produce and distribute English-language television series that had strong international potential. Also in November 2017 EuropaCorp reaffirmed its priority strategic objective to focus on what had been EuropaCorp’s successful core business: production of English- and French-language feature films and English-language television series and distribution and international sales of films. Valerian’s box office revenues were still disappointing at $225 million as of November 28 2017. The revenues would cover the production budget of $200 million but were far below what was needed to pay the marketing expenses of around $200 million. Given the cost of debts and the maturity of credit lines the company was considering additional recapitalization as well as cost cuts and asset sales related to post-production or film catalogues. EuropaCorp’s stock price continued to fall from €4.19 on June 26 2017 before the announcement of the historical record loss of €119.9 million to €1.15 on November 28 2017—a drop of 73 per cent.It seemed that EuropaCorp’s future would be decided by the box office success of the ambitiously big Valerian project and its distribution in the U.S. market. However press reviews of the movie were negative not leaving much hope for its success in France and abroad. Was EuropaCorp doomed or was there some way to turn the company around? Indeed given all the past and present challenges was a second turnaround even possible and if so what strategic financial and operational actions would be necessary?Exhibit 1: timetable of EUROPACORP S.

Singh the chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Networks India (Sony) was sitting in his office in the Malad suburb of Mumbai India wondering what to do about some impending problems. Singh was concerned about the future of the television show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah (TMKOC) which aired on the television channel Sri Adhikari Brothers Television (SAB TV) a general entertainment channel (GEC) owned by Sony. TMKOC was a flagship family-friendly comedy show that had enjoyed top ratings for years. However new comedy shows that featured edgier and less family-oriented content with jokes at the expense of characters rather than at situations were gaining new viewers. Current viewers were also using mobile devices rather than traditional television sets to watch content; SAB TV’s online platform was less popular than those of their competition. Singh was concerned about how to sustain SAB TV as a market leader despite the growing popularity of unsavoury content from new comedy shows and emerging digital platforms (see Exhibit 1). What steps could Singh take to ensure that SAB TV’s high ratings would continue?OVERVIEW OF INDIA’s MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYIndia’s media and entertainment (M&E) industry was among the fastest-growing in the world with television radio film print and the Internet among the various platforms available to 1.324 billion potential consumers. To date television had been the top revenue-generating platform. In 2016 India’s television industry was worth ?588 billion of a total M&E industry valued at ?1.262 trillion.Television was introduced in India in 1959 under the monopoly of the public broadcaster Doordarshan. In 1991 during the Gulf War the US Cable News Network (CNN) started transmitting television content to India via satellite thus giving the country its first taste of private television. With globalization becoming a trend during that time India allowed private television to grow without stringent regulations which led to a tenfold growth in the consumption of television content. During this first phase Indian television was flooded with foreign programming. However in October 1992 Zee TV began providing Indian viewers with local content on private satellite channels. Zee TV had established a 50/50 joint venture Star TV to make this possible. By 2017 India’s television industry had 877 granted satellite television channels. During that same period the industry catered to 183 million television households roughly equivalent to 870 million individuals. The television industry in India was expected to grow to ?1.166 trillion by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 per cent. In 2016 an average Indian viewer spent three hours and 16 minutes per day watching television.In 2008 India’s television industry was worth ?245 billion and was growing at a rate of 9.3 per cent compared to 17.4 per cent annual growth between 2004 and 2008. Of the total revenue in 2008 61 per cent was generated from distribution and 34 per cent was earned from advertising. Total revenue from cable and satellite television households amounted to ?118 million.The 2008 financial crisis had an adverse effect on the television industry—especially in regard to advertising revenue. Television channels realized that to remain in operation they had to increase consumption despite severe challenges including rising production and marketing costs restricted funding investment in both analogue and digital distribution retrenchments and the addition of four new GECs: 9X Colors TV New Delhi Television (NDTV) Imagine and Real. Although the share of viewership was being divided among even more channels greater competition was helping raise the overall quality of programming. As a result viewership for GECs increased from 900 gross rating points (GRPs) to 1200 GRPs in less than a year for 33 per cent growth.In 2017 the M&E industry grew at a rate of 11.2 per cent for a total revenue of ?660 billion. Cable and satellite penetration of the country reached a high of 64 per cent with access to 780 million individuals in 183 million households while television penetration was at 52 per cent in rural areas. Each day Indians were spending an average of over three hours and 44 minutes watching television and 77 per cent of total viewership came from GECs and film channels. Government initiatives such as demonetization and the introduction of a goods and services tax complicated the industry’s attempts to recover losses from slower periods but content creators experimented with new genres and ideas to increase viewership. Sri Adhikari Brothers TelevisionSAB TV was founded by Gautam Adhikari the current chairperson and director. The television channel was incorporated in December 1994 and listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 1999. Since April 2000 the Doordarshan channel ran syndicated content such as comedy shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Shrimaan Shrimati and Zabaan Sambhalke (see Exhibit 2). With 1305 hours of content and related assets SAB TV was acquired in March 2005 by Sony Entertainment Television (later renamed Sony Pictures Networks India) which eventually owned 31 channels. The network positioned SAB TV as a channel for young people and broadcast International Cricket Conference World Cup 2007 matches in Hindi. However when India failed to qualify to the group stage in cricket that year Sony’s plan to expand the viewership of the channel did not go as expected. Singh said “When we came back with the second season of all the shows—SAB had taken a season break on all its successful shows during 45 days of World Cup—the loyalists had moved on.” In June 2008 SAB TV was repositioned as a comedy GEC as was originally intended before Sony’s purchase and Sony looked for a cost-effective show to help it increase viewership over the long run. TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH In 2006 Asit Modi proposed a new show TMKOC to Singh. Modi was the founder of Neela Tele Films Private Limited. Modi pitched TMKOC as a show about the comic interplay between multicultural residents of a residential society called Gokuldham (see Exhibit 3) in their day-to-day lives supplemented with social commentary. TMKOC was inspired by the 1970s popular magazine column “Duniya Ne Undha Chasma” written by humourist Taarak Mehta for the Gujarati magazine Chitralekha. Singh offered to commission Modi’s show specifically for SAB TV rather than for the entire Sony network which Modi found disappointing because SAB TV had only 25 GRPs at the time. However Singh stressed that the show would be a good fit because SAB TV was being reinvented as a comedy channel from the former youth-based content. Modi had previously pitched the show idea to Sony six times without success. On one occasion the creative team suggested that Modi include a female protagonist in the show but as Modi had always visualized the main character Jethalal as the focus of the show and was not prepared to change he turned down the offer. After a proposal to Disney Channel the entertainment giant asked that the grandson character Tapu be portrayed as less mischievous but Modi refused that offer as well. Zee TV and Star TV had also rejected the show proposal. Modi would narrate stories from his show idea to his family for their feedback. His seven-year-old son enjoyed listening to the stories. Eventually with persuasion from his wife Modi accepted Singh’s offer to air the show on SAB TV. Singh’s team drafted an agreement for 104 episodes of TMKOC; however Modi asked for a base agreement of at least 208 episodes. “I was thinking that 104 episodes will get over in six months and so artists will feel insecure” Modi said. He was asked by SAB TV to keep to a low budget for the show’s set but Modi opted for more permanent construction which would last at least two years in case the show became successful. This plan required Modi to invest more of his own funds without a long-term commitment by SAB TV. Despite uncertainties Modi believed in the show enough to endure the high initial investment. After Singh approved the contract for 208 episodes TMKOC aired on July 28 2008 as a daily (Monday to Friday) comedy sitcom. THE BEGINNING For the first six months TMKOC garnered less than 0.5 television rating points (TRP). The low ratings coincided with SAB TV’s operation during a recession. Still Singh upheld his conviction in the show. Modi was also learning along the way. During the first two months of the show an issue would be covered over two consecutive episodes. Around episode number 40 the storyline revolved around Janmashtmi an annual Hindu festival that celebrated the birth of the Indian god Krishna. During that time the show’s TRP increased to 0.7 from the usual 0.3 or 0.4 rating and viewers expressed a desire for more episodes on the same theme. Realizing that people were interested in stories Modi decided to run each storyline for more than two episodes. “I got a grip on storytelling” he said. After six months of airing episodes TMKOC had arrived at its inflection point a significant change in the situation as Singh realized: “If we stay true to the core Indian values of joint family and community living this show will appeal to the masses.” Modi also believed in incorporating core family values as well as joint family systems in his show’s content.CONSUMER INSIGHTS Modi had been a regular reader of Mehta’s writing during his high school years. For his show he altered some of the characters in Mehta’s magazine column which was written in 1972 to suit the current times. For example he replaced the “Himmatlal master” character with a Marathi-speaking teacher to attract more Marathi viewers to the show. He also included Punjabi and Tamil families in the show to attract a wider viewership.Mehta’s column was originally based in a low-income tenement neighbourhood (known as a chawl in India) but Modi moved the setting to a more appealing housing co-operative (known as a residential society in India) where many different families lived and interacted regularly. During the show’s development Modi had visited various chawls in the Mumbai suburbs of Bhuleshwar Kalbadevi and others to see how people lived but he realized that chawls had changed over time from the setting Mehta had depicted in her column in 1972. Modi decided instead to creating a housing co-operative for the show where different families lived like one large family which he thought would appeal to everyday people. He applied the insights he had gathered and an Indian mindset to the show’s joint family system.Modi created relatable and innocent characters like Tapu Sena (a mischievous group of children); Daya (Jethalal’s wife) who broke into dance (the Indian Garba) on any happy occasion; and Popatlal with his characteristic umbrella. He highlighted the bond between grandfather and grandson in the show. Moreover he visualized Gokuldham society itself as a character.Modi also adapted the show to reflect viewer feedback. For example when a particular ghost storyline had covered four episodes of TMKOC Modi planned to get to the story’s climax over the next three or four episodes. However after a viewer told Modi that he was curious how Daya would engage with the ghost which Modi had not yet considered he asked the show’s writers to extend the storyline over 16 episodes to accommodate more character interactions.Regarding some aspects of the show however Modi was inflexible. For example he insisted on having a narrator in the show despite some viewer reactions that the narrator slowed the action in the show.Modi brought to life everyday situations through actors who portrayed lovable people-next-door characters. The episodes were based on events that viewers found familiar. “We had to think what people would expect in terms of story on this Ganesh Chaturthi” stated Modi referring to the 10-day festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesh. “What is the political environment? How is the husband and wife relationship changing?” The scenes of celebration such as Janmashtmi and Ganesh Chaturthi that Modi included in the show where portrayed as larger-than-life just like in a mega-budget show. TMKOC also addressed current events like the Indian government’s demonetization initiative. Other stories from the show that sparked viewer attention included the ghost in Gokuldham the Gokuldham Premier League Tapu’s child marriage and Jethalal in Pakistan.Throughout the journey of developing the show over the years Modi was in constant touch with key stakeholders. At gatherings parties and social visits at home or in public he was constantly seeking consumer insights. CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHANNEL Although TMKOC’s TRP ratings were only at 0.3 at the start all other SAB TV shows had lower ratings (around 0.2 TRP). At the show’s first party SAB TV staff members worried that no one was interested in the channel but Modi reassured Singh: “I believe that if the program is good people will come searching for the channel.”TMKOC eventually became important to the channel for more than just viewership as Singh explained. “When you have a driver like this it also gets a lot of revenue riding on it.”TMKOC’s success helped SAB TV hold its position in the industry much like the hit show Kaun Banega Crorepati was influential in the success of Star Plus. In fact TMKOC kept increasing its viewership beyond the show’s 10th season. According to data from the Broadcast Audience Research Council of India in 2017 TMKOC topped the rating charts between June 17 and June 23 surpassing some of the biggest shows on Indian television including Naagin 2 and Kumkum Bhagya (see Exhibit 2).According to Modi TMKOC was the number-one show in the 4–14 age group surpassing both Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. The show was also popular among those aged 35 and over. Modi admitted however that viewership for the show was low in the 15–35 age group which was the main viewership of Star TV and Colors TV.In 2016 Jethalal and Daya were among the top 10 fictional characters on Hindi television which reflected the popularity of the show in its 10th year (see Exhibit 1). Modi advised the actors that their characters would remain popular as long as they did not allow vanity to affect their work. Modi was also concerned about the actors growing older which had to reflect their characters. However Modi was pleased with the show’s success to date:The show not only grew in the last decade it also fetched better time spent than many other shows in the 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. slot on Indian television. Constant innovations in storytelling look-feel and characters as per the changing times could have helped us achieve this. ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS CASE Modi thought back to the ideation of TMKOC around year 2000 when the television environment was changing. “Most of the weekly shows stopped and the era of daily soaps began” he said. Shows like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ki were launched around that time (see Exhibit 2). Within the comedy category other shows also suffered; for example Sarabhai vs Sarabhai lost viewership when it ran as a weekly show. Modi had produced many successful weekly comedy shows such as Hum Sab Ek Hain (for Sony) Yeh Duniya Hai Rangeen Meri Biwi Wonderful and others (see Exhibit 2). He felt that a daily show was needed to fit the new trend but demand for comedy was declining. “Whenever I would pitch comedy the other person would put the phone down as there was a demand of typical family drama that revolved around saas-bahu (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law) conflicts.” But he found that humour was a missing element in day-to-day life so he wanted to deliver a light-hearted show to viewers in a daily format. In 2008 when Singh was trying to relaunch SAB TV as a comedy channel the recession was forcing television channels to keep costs under control. SAB TV’s content had not been successful so far and financial pressure was increasing. Singh had to ensure that TMKOC was produced at a reasonable cost even though top management had confidence in the show as he explained:The viewership was not very strong and therefore revenue was also slow to come by. There was that initial phase of six to nine months (after the show was launched) when everything was iffy and that was right in the middle of the recession and keeping your head above water was more important for everyone.Singh believed in the channel’s new strategy and was confident about the content of TMKOC which made him support the show. Singh was ready to suffer losses for one or two years because he believed that TMKOC was going to be successful. TMKOC soon became a household name in Hindi-speaking homes of India. Hindi was only one of 22 major languages prevalent throughout India but TMKOC managed to also gain popularity across non-Hindi-speaking markets because the show incorporated characters and references representing India’s diverse cultures. Modi’s efforts to bring positive attention to social issues through humour helped TMKOC become the preferred platform for a progressive India. The show was nominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent and contribute to the government’s Clean India (Swachh Bharat) Mission which was one of several government initiatives intended to encourage participation by the Indian people. The show was also one of the most desirable programs on Indian television for the promotion of Bollywood films. The success of TMKOC helped other channels realize the potential of the comedy genre which led to the launch of shows with similar appeal such as Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai (see Exhibit 2). TMKOC was the only daily show airing on a GEC within India where the intellectual property rights to the story and characters were held by the production house rather than by the channel. Modi treated each of his characters as a brand with trademarks for all characters. To ensure that TMKOC remained at SAB TV the channel provided regular incentives over the course of the show’s first 10 years. Modi also had the demanding task of keeping the show’s 26-member cast together over that decade which he was able to do successfully for all but one character. Modi was able to keep his cast intact by providing generous remuneration and understanding their whims and emotions. Most crew members had also stayed with the show all that time. TMKOC had started out with a lower budget than most other shows on Hindi GECs and Modi was prepared to wait for a long-term breakeven point. However positive results began appearing by the end of the first year. JOURNEY OF COMEDY Shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Hum Sab Ek Hain and Shrimaan Shrimati which were popular in the 1990s led the way for shows like Khichdi and Sarabhai vs Sarabhai in the early 2000s and with Comedy Circus making its debut in 2007 a new brand of comedy was emerging. The new shows featured edgy content with double meanings and louder characters. One of these new shows Comedy Nights with Kapil aired from June 2013 to January 2016 and ruled the non-fiction comedy category in 2014.Modi saw the new trend as being more accepting of questionable content. “Now if a vulgar joke is playing on TV people would see it with their daughters. Previously they used to switch it off” he said. SAB TV seemed to be the only channel to avoid featuring “in-your-face comedy” and TMKOC was becoming the only show that parents felt comfortable allowing their children to watch without supervision.DIGITAL FORMAT Singh recalled how episodes of TMKOC were distributed among viewers before digital streaming of content became common. Pirated copies of television shows including TMKOC’s shows on digital versatile discs (DVDs) were sold outside railway stations the same night that they aired on television. Viewers had the opportunity to catch up on the missed shows at their preferred time.By 2016 TMKOC was viewed by 2.5 to 3.0 million people in digital format according to Modi. After the launch of the Indian mobile network operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited many more people were watching the show on their mobile devices than at a fixed time on their television sets. Modi wondered how the viewing habits of his loyal audience would change in the future. Research suggested that adults in India were expected to spend an average of one hour and 18 minutes per day on digital media. In 2016 there were 412 million Internet consumers in India. For all online videos viewed by consumers in India 47 per cent used Facebook and 42 per cent watched videos on YouTube where TMKOC episodes were available. The remaining 11 per cent of online viewing was on online video streaming platforms such as Hotstar VOOT Netflix Amazon Prime Video and Jio TV. Although SAB TV had its own video streaming platform called SonyLiv on which TMKOC episodes could be viewed it was not among the most popular online video sources in the country. Star TV’s platform Hotstar was one of the more popular sites and streamed the second season of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai starting in May 2017.WAY FORWARDTMKOC had been successful in attracting viewership to SAB TV but general comedy content on television was diverging away from the typical content on TMKOC. Singh worried about potentially negative effects on the channel’s viewership and wondered what pre-emptive steps might be necessary. He also had to consider how extending SAB TV content on digital sources would require changes in programming time advertising models and other areas. In general Singh wondered how he could ensure the growth of viewership for SAB TV content.EXHIBIT 1: TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH SHOW PERFORMANCE 2008–2017Note: TVT = television viewership in thousands;

The management of SaskPower had requested the approval of its 2003 foreign exchange strategy to manage the long-term currency risk exposure in the utility’s U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower issued US$619 million of debt in the early 1990s with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Canadian dollar had since increased (i.e. the Canadian dollar rate had depreciated) increasing the effective burden of the debt and reducing the utility’s net income. By the end of 1999 SaskPower had hedged US$112 million through foreign currency swaps. By the end of 2001 the translation value of the U.S. dollar debt had increased to CA$986 million and represented more than 50 per cent of SaskPower’s long-term debt.A change in accounting practices was implemented in 2001 in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. SaskPower was required to recognize as a gain or a loss in the current year any translation differences in the value of its outstanding U.S. dollar debt resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate during the year. This policy change led to a significant reduction in net income in 2001 followed by a significant increase during the first eight months of 2002. The volatility in earnings had complicated the task of setting rates for electricity and had proved politically difficult to justify. An overarching objective of the proposed foreign exchange strategy was to eventually eliminate all currency exposure in the outstanding U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower: The Company SaskPower was a Canadian power company established in 1929. This crown corporation was owned by the provincial government of Saskatchewan and governed by a board of directors. It was the main producer and supplier of electricity in the province with an installed generation capacity of 4281 megawatts. In fiscal year 2001 SaskPower serviced 432000 customers spread over 652000 square kilometres across Saskatchewan. Around 68.3 per cent of the generated power was sold to industrial users. The company’s distribution network was also tied to the grids of Alberta and Manitoba and to the U.S. state of North Dakota (although no notable sales were recorded across the border).SaskPower’s revenues in 2001 were CA$1.126 billion 88 per cent of which came from sales within Saskatchewan. Its expenses were CA$1.097 billion. The cost of fuel and purchased power represented 43 per cent of expenses. Finance charges which included foreign currency translation losses related to the U.S. dollar debt represented 16 per cent. Expenses increased by 10 per cent relative to 2000 driven primarily by a 22 per cent increase in the cost of fuels namely natural gas and purchased power which was required due to low river flows and reduced electricity generation (see Exhibit 1).Origins of U.S. DebtSaskPower was a capital-intensive vertically integrated electric power utility. Asset replacement was required even during slow economic times. Like most crown corporations SaskPower sourced debt through the provincial treasury.In the 1990s Saskatchewan was in poor financial health. Canadian financial institutions showed little interest in buying Saskatchewan debt and the province faced relatively high credit spreads over Canadian treasuries. Therefore the province deemed it advantageous to borrow in the United States where its debt was better received and interest rates on long-term debt were significantly lower. SaskPower made five U.S. debt issues between 1990 and 1993 totalling US$619 million in principal and maturing 10 to 30 years later (see Exhibit 2). The exchange rate at issue averaged CA$1.22 per U.S. dollar or US$0.82 per Canadian dollar and the debt was worth CA$755 million. SaskPower’s all-in cost of its U.S. debt was much lower than the typical equivalent Canadian dollar debt. On average it was 160 basis points lower or 17 per cent lower than what the Canadian dollar debt’s all-in cost would have been. Therefore the U.S. dollar would need to move up a long way before the Canadian dollar cost of servicing the U.S. debt exceeded what the cost would have been if SaskPower had chosen to borrow in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 2). The U.S. dollar debt carried semi-annual coupon payments. The debt was non-callable and non-convertible. Being primarily held by institutional investors it had little to no market float. Accounting Policy Change and Exchange Rate UncertaintyAt the time the accounting standard that SaskPower followed was the Canadian version of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Foreign exchange translation adjustments that resulted from year-end revaluation of the U.S. debt were amortized over the remaining term of the debt. The Canadian dollar’s value deteriorated for most of the 1990s which meant that the U.S. dollar appreciated in value (see Exhibit 3) creating a build-up of unrealized foreign exchange losses. A portion of these losses was amortized annually although these were non-cash charges—no additional funds were required until the debt matured. The amortization was an amount of multi-million dollars per year; however it was offset by significant reductions in actual finance charge payments as SaskPower’s debt declined sharply over the 1990s. The amortized exchange losses were CA$8 million for 1999 and CA$9 million for 2000. At the end of 1999 unamortized foreign exchange losses were CA$97 million.In 2001 SaskPower adopted a new accounting policy in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. The new policy required all foreign currency translation differences to be recognized and recorded as a gain or loss in the current year. The purpose of this policy shift was to bring Canadian accounting practices in line with those of Europe and the United States. This change had a significant effect on SaskPower’s financial results in 2001 increasing finance charges by CA$31 million and reducing net income to CA$29 million (see Exhibit 4). Repercussions of the accounting policy change were rather fundamental. Stakeholders started questioning why SaskPower had U.S. debt in the first place. Some of the unrealized foreign exchange losses were reversed during the first eight months of 2002. The Canadian dollar increased from US$0.6279 on December 31 2001 to US$0.6415 on August 30 2002 (i.e. the U.S. dollar dropped from CA$1.5926 to CA$1.5588) resulting in a year-to-date foreign exchange gain of CA$15.5 million. Estimates for foreign exchange gains for the year were approximately CA$15 million based on a forecast closing rate of CA$1.00 = US$0.64. However this estimate was highly unreliable due to the recent volatility in the exchange rate the disagreement among foreign exchange analysts on the value of the Canadian dollar and past forecast errors. With each US$0.01 change in the value of the Canadian dollar translating into a change of approximately CA$12 million (increase or decrease) in SaskPower’s net income possibilities were wide-ranging (positive or negative) for the year’s results. These foreign exchange gains or losses complicated the setting of electricity rates. In most utilities the total asset base was allowed to earn an approved rate of return referred to as a “return on rate base.” SaskPower used a less formal process but still required approval from the government. The process focused on the expected net income that would result from the approved rate adjustment. Finance charges would normally be predictable if they were based on long-term fixed rate debt. However the significant exposure to the U.S. dollar generated large unpredictable swings in net income which could not be accommodated in the rate-setting process.Plan of Action Market sentiment about the Canadian dollar was negative towards the end of 2002 with expectations of additional weakness. There was extensive discussion in the business press of the differences between the Canadian and American economies where the focus was tax policy and general fundamentals. The tone of the discussion on the Canadian economy seemed bearish. Given this outlook and in order to manage the volatility in net income caused by the U.S. debt SaskPower’s treasury group entertained and then promoted the strategy of hedging all the U.S. debt. Currency swaps emerged as the most appropriate hedging tool. Currency SwapsForeign currency swaps were derivative instruments that allowed an entity to change the currency denomination of its assets (cash inflows) or liabilities (cash outflows). A company for example could swap the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt for equivalent interest and principal payments in another currency effectively transforming the existing debt into a comparable-value debt that was denominated in the other currency. Currency swaps were over-the-counter contracts negotiated between a company and a financial institution. A currency swap could be structured in several forms. For example it could involve the swapping of a newly-issued debt for an equal-value debt in another currency. In this case the counterparties at the outset exchanged the debt issue proceeds for an equivalent amount in the other currency. Then they exchanged interest and principal payments over the term of the debt. A swap could also involve the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt or it could involve swapping only interest payments.Plain vanilla currency swaps called for the exchange of fixed interest payments in one currency for fixed interest payments in another currency (with or without an exchange of the principal). Currency swaps could also involve the swapping of fixed interest payments in one currency for floating or adjustable payments in another currency. The floating payments in this case would be indexed to a benchmark short-term interest rate in the respective currency. Given the nature of SaskPower’s assets management considered swapping its outstanding long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar debt for Canadian dollar debt with equal term and similarly fixed interest rates. Hedging OptionsSaskPower’s management recommended a hedging program to its board of directors as part of the company’s 2003–2007 business plan. Convinced that the status quo or simply doing nothing was not an option management provided two possible hedging options for the company to pursue in regard to managing its U.S. debt. Option 1: Lock In All Remaining U.S. Debt NowThis option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk by converting all future U.S. debt payments starting at the beginning of 2003 to fixed Canadian dollar payments. In return SaskPower would give up the upside potential if the Canadian dollar were to appreciate. Even though market conditions had changed drastically since the U.S. debt was issued the hedged all-in costs based on swap rates in December 2002 would have been near the costs that SaskPower would have paid if it had originally borrowed in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 5).Option 2: Phase-In Hedges Over the Period Remaining Until December 31 2005This option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk before the end of the five-year business plan. SaskPower would be susceptible to currency movements in the interim—the exposure would decrease as swaps were gradually entered into—but could benefit from a strengthening of the Canadian dollar. The key elements of this strategy were as follows:During the phase-in period the company’s treasurer was to set a target range for the quarterly foreign exchange rate based on a consensus forecast which incorporated forecasts from a number of different agencies. Swaps would then be executed when the market exchange rate (Bank of Canada mid-noon rate) traded outside of the range. For added flexibility the treasurer had the discretion to execute a swap if the exchange rate was within the target range depending on the time remaining in the quarter current market conditions and the amount hedged to date. The unhedged principal amounts of the first three debt issues (maturing in 2003 2008 and 2013) totalling US$207 million would be fully hedged by the end of 2003. Priority would be given to these debt issues for two reasons: dealer spreads were tighter for swaps with shorter maturities; and the hedged all-in costs for these issues at the swap rates in December 2002 would be near the original equivalent Canadian dollar costs for these issues (see Exhibit 5). Thereafter an annual hedging target would be set to ensure that the remaining US$300 million debt issues were covered by December 31 of 2005.Whichever option was chosen SaskPower would structure the swaps in sums of US$25–50 million solicit quotes from multiple dealers and spread the deals over many banks to reduce credit risk. the decisionHaving read the management team’s recommendations and reviewed the data provided James agreed with management that a course of action needed to be taken—doing nothing was not an option. He pondered the details of a proposed swap for US$25 million of the 2008 debt issue. The U.S. dollar principal amount would be swapped for CA$35.6 million and the 7.125 per cent coupon rate on the U.S. dollar principal starting with the payment on September 15 2003 would be swapped for an 8.875 per cent coupon rate on the Canadian dollar principal (see Exhibit 6). However to ensure the most effective financial position for SaskPower James had to decide between hedging option 1 or option 2.Exhibit 1: Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year 2001Exhibit 1 (continued)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Breakdown of U.S. Dollar DebtNote:* This is the estimated all-in-cost if SaskPower had originally issued Canadian dollar debt.

Ford announced that it would recall more than one million vehicles worldwide as a result of faulty airbags that had failed to deploy upon collision causing multiple deaths. It turned out that Ford had been aware of these faulty airbags but had not taken proactive measures to mitigate potential damage. This information was uncovered by the U.S. regulators who were investigating the multiple deaths in Ford vehicles. Because of the investigation Ford’s share price dropped from US$13.10 to US$12.18 per share on January 17 2018. Smith was trying to anticipate the future of Ford as the holding of the Ford equity represented a significant portion of his investment portfolios. Investors had already started contacting him about the future of the company and the state of their investments. Smith anticipated that given the recent announcement Ford’s share value would drop drastically so he needed to act fast to mitigate the loss of value for his investors. Smith wondered whether Ford could recover from this disaster in the long term and whether its product safety would continue to be an issue and negatively affect its shareholders. While exploring different companies as potential places to reinvest the money Smith wanted to remain in the automotive industry to maintain the portfolios’ diversification. He had thus explored other companies such as Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) General Motors Company (GM) and Honda Motor Company Ltd. (Honda) as possible alternatives to Ford. FORD MOTOR COMPANYFord Motor Company headquartered in Dearborn Michigan was an American multinational automobile manufacturer founded by Henry Ford in 1903. It was the second-largest automobile manufacturer based in the United States and employed approximately 202000 workers worldwide. The company had been publicly incorporated since 1956; however the Ford family continued to retain 40 per cent of its voting rights. Ford sold automobiles under the Ford brand while its luxury automobiles were sold under the Lincoln brand. Ford specialized in large-scale manufacturing by using an industrial workforce. It had incorporated moving assembly lines into its plant operations and used modern economic and social systems to facilitate mass production. This method of production became known as Fordism and was widely applied to improve productivity within the industry. In addition Ford aimed to maintain a lean inventory by adopting just-in-time inventory management. INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONSGlobal automotive sales had increased by 5.6 per cent in 2016. Asian-Pacific markets had seen the highest growth and volume of automotive sales in 2016. The key contributor to the increase in sales was the Chinese market given its high double-digit growth. In North America the United States had seen a growth rate of 0.4 per cent in 2016 with 17.55 million cars sold—a record number. It was good news for the shrinking industry in the United States. The slowly improving economy and the increasing demand for trucks and SUVs seemed to finally turn the business around at least for the time being. Global automotive unit sales continued to grow and reached 86.05 million units in 2017. The growth rate of the global automotive industry was expected to be about 3 per cent annually in 2017 and 2018. Sales of electric cars were expected to take up a larger share of the overall market with most of the growth coming from China and Europe. Overall the 2017 year-end conditions were positive with both global and domestic conditions showing improvements. Analysts and consumers expected these positive trends to continue into the near future. The World Bank forecasted global economic growth to increase to 3.1 per cent with advanced economies expected to grow at a more conservative 2.9 per cent. Overall consumer confidence increased; however this consumer confidence was accompanied with the risk of overinflated asset prices and heightened equity prices. The auto manufacturing industry had seen a trend toward electrification and digitalization solutions. In addition autonomous driving was just becoming another key trend expected to continue into the long-term future. In both technologies Tesla Inc. had been a market leader but other major players were also ramping up their investments by partnering with non-traditional technology companies to introduce new car models powered by new technologies. In January 2018 Ford pledged to spend $11 billion on electric cars by 2022 which doubled its original investment estimate. Regional start-ups were also entering the electric vehicle market spurred by the $2 billion that had been invested in these start-up companies. The share of diesel engines in Europe was declining and expected to continue shrinking due to tightening regulations. Besides Europe countries across the world including major markets such as China and India were planning to introduce bans and regulations on diesel cars. As a result automotive companies saw a rise in environmental regulations increasing their overall costs while the increasing cost of fuel had reduced the demand for fuel-engine cars. THE ALTERNATIVESSmith and his team identified Ford’s main competitors to be GM Toyota and Honda. These companies competed directly with Ford and thus represented viable alternatives to the Ford stock. GM was an American multinational corporation headquartered in Detroit’s Renaissance Center. The company designed manufactured and distributed vehicles and vehicle parts and was the second-largest automobile manufacturer in the world and the largest in the United States. GM had a strong position in the U.S. automotive market. The company’s best-known auto brands were Cadillac Chevrolet GMC Holden and Wuling. Toyota the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world was a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota Japan. Toyota was by far the world’s leader in the sales of hybrid electric vehicles having successfully applied its mass-production strategy to its line of hybrid electric vehicles. According to Toyota 80 per cent of Toyota cars sold in 1998 were still on the road. Honda was a Japanese public multinational conglomerate corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles aircraft motorcycles and power equipment. Since 1959 Honda had been the world’s largest motorcycle manufacturer. Furthermore Honda was the world’s largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume. In 2013 Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter to the United States. THE ANALYSISThe team at Uria Investment had all of the information available to make their decision. They had the comparative financial information—balance sheets (see Exhibit 1) income statements (see Exhibit 2) and statements of cash flow (see Exhibit 3)—for the four companies as well as the financial ratios (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Smith had also reviewed Ford’s stock price and was taking into consideration analyst forecasts for the stock price as compared with its competitors (see Exhibits 6 and 7). Ford’s stock had fluctuated slightly during 2017 but the closing stock price was within the same range as at the beginning of the year. When Smith initially invested in Ford he believed it would translate into long-term growth and profits for his clients. However as he analyzed the situation Smith was unsure whether Ford could recover from the numerous safety scandals while simultaneously catching up to competitors in terms of innovation. Smith and his team wondered what this information would uncover and how it would lead to the final decision.

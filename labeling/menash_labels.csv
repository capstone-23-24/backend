Suveer the 29-year-old chief executive officer of Sushma Industries Private Limited (SIPL) warmly welcomed 48-year-old G. Padmanabhan the head of human resources (HR) at SIPL. Suveer said to Padmanabhan:A lot of people questioned my wisdom and judgment in hiring you a year back but I knew that you would be able to pay back your cost multi-fold which you certainly have done. I needed strategic talent interventions to transform this two-and-a-half decades old organization shake it out of its somnolence and set it on the growth path that I had envisioned. I didn’t know if we had the right people in place for the right jobs and if we were paying them appropriately to motivate and retain them. We needed to revisit these things and build a culture of performance here. I know it has been an uphill task for you to change the way things have been done here for the last two decades but if we didn’t start the change a year back we would have perished!Padmanabhan had worked for multiple engineering and services organizations through the various domains of HR and had over 25 years of experience. Accustomed to professional systems and processes Padmanabhan had been challenged by the complete lack of structure within SIPL when he had joined the company in June 2015 but he had also been excited by the possibility of designing and implementing systems that could take the organization to the next level of growth. The problem appeared as complex as the Gordian knot and he had not been sure where to start unravelling the informal structures and processes that had become the norm for SIPL.ORGANIZATION AND INDUSTRY CONTEXT SIPL was started by Sadananda Murthy in 1986. After graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1971 Murthy worked for a few years with the National Aerospace Laboratory a government organization that supported the Indian aerospace industry. As he acquired experience Murthy realized a gap existed in Indian manufacturing for precision instruments that supported the work of quality functions within organizations. With quality systems and processes slowly creeping into the manufacturing ecosystem in the 1970s most companies at that time relied on expensive imported machines to support their fledgling quality practices. There was limited training offered and negligible post-sales support once the imported machines were installed. The reliability of these machines was contingent on regular calibration which was difficult to arrange and extremely costly. Murthy saw this undeveloped space as an opportunity to provide economical machines of high quality augmented by strong post-sales training and regular calibration services. Supported by his wife a science graduate who took on the responsibilities of administration and accounts Murthy started SIPL with three employees in a small shed in Peenya an industrial belt on the outskirts of Bangalore. The initial client base of three clients slowly expanded to cover manufacturing organizations across the breadth of India. Client acquisition happened more by word of mouth with considerable value being seen in the customized offering and in the strong calibration and after-sales services provided. With calibration services increasingly contributing to SIPL’s revenue stream Murthy decided to open a dedicated calibration centre in 1995 as a separate profit centre. The calibration centre was established as a world-class lab that met stringent national and international standards and provided services in the area of testing and measurements both for SIPL and other companies’ products. The calibration centre contributed nearly 35 per cent of the total revenues for SIPL.SIPL had started as a technology company and focused its product portfolio on the field of torque force and pressure sensors. The products it manufactured found application in all industries requiring testing measurement and calibration services which encompassed engineering automobile pharmaceutical and process manufacturing organizations as well as government and defence institutions. SIPL offered complete design development and manufacturing of standard products. Much of the business was generated by SIPL’s ability to create customized products tailor-made to a specific client’s needs. This customized work required a strong research and development (R&D) team that excelled in delivering customized solutions for force torque and pressure sensors; gauges and display units; spring testers crimp testers and torque tool testers; motor testing systems automotive component and performance testing systems and more. SIPL also offered standardized product ranges that included torque tool testers with its main competitors being Norbar Torque Tools Ltd. and Crane Electronics Ltd. from the United Kingdom and Tohnichi Mfg. Co. Ltd. from Japan. By 2010 SIPL’s market share in this product category was 30 per cent. For sensors and display units another standardized product SIPL held a market share of 5 per cent competing against Honeywell International Inc. (in the United States and India); Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik (HBM) GmbH of Germany; FUTEK Advanced Sensor Technology Inc. of the United States; and Syscon Instruments Pvt. Ltd. from India. For a newer standardized product offering of force testing systems SIPL held a market share of less than 1 per cent and competed against Instron Corporation MTS Systems Corporation and Zwick Roell Group all U.S.-based firms (see Exhibit 1).By 2000 with nearly 80 per cent of SIPL’s revenues coming from customized solutions the company had a strong need for a robust R&D team. The customized solutions also resulted in relatively longer product development and go-to-market times and comparatively less net profitability (see Exhibit 2). In 2014 the organization transitioned from being a proprietorship firm to a private limited company.SIPL’s INITIAL DECADES OF GROWTH: TALENT ACQUISITION COMPENSATION AND MERIT INCREASESIn the early days of SIPL’s growth during the late 1980s and through the 1990s talent was normally acquired through known references; the employees were hired based primarily on a contingency basis. Compensation decisions for new hires were done on an as needed basis by Murthy. Most of the talent recruited by SIPL were needy people without any work experience or with experience in non-relevant domains. Murthy made the hiring decision predominantly relying on intuition informed by the emotional connection the candidate established with Murthy and a combination of a candidate’s perceived attitude to life aspirational levels and expressed socio-economic needs. Until 2012 SIPL had done no competency-based role-based or needs-based recruitment.In 1986 Shiv a fresh diploma graduate from the Industrial Training Institute approached Murthy through a relative. The company did not have any active requirement for staff; however Murthy created a new position justifying his decision by saying “An extra pair of hands is always useful. He is a humble and needy person and comes across as a quick learner. We need people like him.”Shiv stayed in the same premises as Murthy and his family and worked late hours and all weekends. He gathered experience across all roles within the factory and in 2016 had risen to the level of production head of the factory. Speaking about his experience with Murthy Shiv said “I was in a shipwrecked situation and Murthy Sir threw me the lifeline. I owe him everything. Murthy Sir is the only god that I know; I would give my life for him.”Over the years Murthy rewarded Shiv’s loyalty through significant financial support for Shiv’s marriage by purchasing him a plot and by helping him build a house. Personal loans were offered at no interest to help Shiv achieve his financial milestones. Other employees had similar experiences and they remained staunchly loyal to Murthy. Attrition was negligible at SIPL during these years. A few of these employees developed the R&D skills required to support the frequent demand for customized products that SIPL supported until 2010.In a few instances people were hired at a salary lower than they had earned at their previous employment. The value proposition for these hires was the envisaged growth and learning opportunities available at SIPL which Murthy passionately believed in and promised to all prospective hires. In contrast to other emerging organizations in this space SIPL allowed its technicians to work the product cycle from end to end thereby increasing their exposure and learning opportunities. While SIPL recorded a growth in revenue from ₹0.11 million in 1986 to ₹67.2 million in 2016 (see Exhibit 2) annual merit increases were disbursed in a discretionary manner and not evenly for the entire organization. While a few employees were given increments ranging from 2 to 10 per cent some remained exempt from the process. A few of the exempted employees may have taken soft loans for asset building or for personal expenditures such as marriage; and they understood that they would receive no increment. A few were deprived of any increment due to perceived poor performance; because SIPL had no culture of dismissing non-performers the absence of a merit increase was quietly accepted. SIPL had no structured performance management system. Instead goals were tacitly understood and periodically changed due to business exigencies; Murthy subjectively evaluated employees’ performance against goals. Occasionally some employees expressed dissatisfaction with the compensation to Murthy who would arbitrarily revise the compensation. This correction could happen any time during the year usually only for a select few employees and without a formal process of revision. A few newcomers to the organization who had prior experience with structured performance management systems were silenced by the ethos of the organization and the odd few who could not adjust left within a year of joining.CHANGE OF GUARDIn 2010 Murthy transferred management of the business to his 23-year-old son Suveer an electronics and communication engineering graduate. Suveer was a relatively familiar figure at SIPL having spent summer holidays and free time within different departments where his presence was indulgently tolerated. An overlap period until 2012 allowed Suveer to learn the business engage with the employees and begin to assume Murthy’s position. Handing over the charge the boundaries of change were defined by Murthy:Don’t change the people philosophy and the people-centric approach which are the core of SIPL’s values. I would not like to see old-timers let go; there should not be any employee unrest and people should be kept happy. I would be happy to implement any other changes you may deem necessary so long as you don’t change this DNA.Suveer was a second-generation entrepreneur who had vision passion ambition and aspiration combined with a commitment to growth. He wanted to grow SIPL from a revenue of ₹36 million in 2012–2013 to ₹500 million by 2020 and firmly believed that putting in formal systems and processes was required to achieve this growth vision. He defined the revenue milestones that SIPL needed to achieve as ₹200 million by 2017 ₹350 million by 2018 and ₹500 million by 2020. The business strategy to support and enable this growth was to leverage the top 20 products of the 200-odd product portfolio expand into new industry sectors such as food and gain a stronger position in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Apart from these plans Suveer also wanted to establish a presence in international markets. Core business capabilities required to catalyze this vision were talent with strong sensor and machine designing skills enhanced overall domain knowledge among the workforce and a solution orientation for the sales teams to facilitate increased customer satisfaction. However Suveer faced multiple challenges on all fronts. In June 2015 to put the people processes in place Suveer took the unprecedented step of hiring a professional HR manager G. Padmanabhan. Padmanabhan was a respected professional and a veteran in the field with 25 years of experience. It was a relatively steep cost to put the company in order.Padmanabhan started by looking at the organization’s structure and reporting hierarchy. He found many overlapping responsibilities within the team with work allotment based on employees’ perceived capacities. When he assessed the capability of the existing workforce Padmanabhan found a clear gap in competencies and technical skills. For instance the sales teams were comfortable growing and maintaining existing client accounts but they neglected or did not understand business development as a specialized focus area. To help SIPL achieve its growth targets searching for new business was critical and Padmanabhan felt this strategy required the right talent and focus. Since replacing the employees was not an option the workforce would need to be augmented and clear non-conflicting responsibilities would need to be defined. Padmanabhan proposed a new organizational structure. The major changes included consolidating manufacturing operations under one head who would be responsible for cost inventory management and on-time deliveries. Purchasing would be consolidated under the finance function to ensure stronger controls on vendor selection and management. Sales teams were segregated into the “hunters” to bring in new business and “farmers” who retained and serviced existing customers. The key responsibility areas were sharply defined for each function and cascaded down the teams.COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS RESTRUCTURINGPadmanabhan knew that SIPL needed to adopt a structured approach to compensation and benefits (see Exhibit 3). He recognized that those organizations that had well-crafted compensation structures and reward philosophies were able to enhance trust loyalty and sense of fairness among their employees. To develop the total rewards philosophy for SIPL Padmanabhan looked at SIPL’s strategic positioning to propose a reward strategy that aligned with the industry dynamics which he combined with the organization’s focus. Padmanabhan defined and evaluated the jobs within SIPL which he believed was the first step toward establishing and evaluating internal equity in the organization. He felt that defining and evaluating the jobs would provide the required clarity both to the job holder and the organization and allow for the correct compensation decisions to be made. The erstwhile overlap of responsibilities resulted in 35 differentiated job roles for the small workforce of 54 employees. Over a couple of months for the key roles in the organization Padmanabhan developed job descriptions that encompassed the job purpose and its desired deliverables. The job descriptions also outlined the competencies and abilities required of the job holder to successfully deliver on the role (see Exhibit 4). In October 2015 to better define the pay elements and priorities to be given Padmanabhan conducted an employee survey to evaluate how the workforce felt about the existing compensation system (see Exhibit 5). The survey feedback indicated that employees felt the compensation and benefits were significantly below the market standards. Informal feedback also disclosed a perceived lack of parity among similar functioning roles. In 2012 the salary structure was on an ad hoc or as-needed basis (see Exhibit 6) and certain statutory compliances such as paying minimum wages not observed. Additionally components such as the production incentive had in fact become a guaranteed wage. While SIPL paid an annual bonus of one month’s salary around the festival period of Diwali (the festival in India that was culturally associated with financial windfall) variable compensation both for the production and sales staff was done on an ad hoc or as-needed basis.Reviewing the insurance benefit offered to SIPL employees Padmanabhan discovered that group medical insurance and term life insurance for the employees had not been renewed since 2012. The lapse appeared to have been inadvertent due to the absence of a dedicated HR person accountable for the benefits administration. Additionally a lack of claims from the employees did not alert the senior management to the problem. Padmanabhan reintroduced the insurance coverage but had to pay a penalty to the insurance provider to take advantage of the no-claims benefit. A similar concern emerged when SIPL was unable to make a gratuity payment to a tenured employee who left the company in October 2015. SIPL had entered into an agreement with a leading national insurance organization wherein the company made annual gratuity payments to the insurance company which in turn paid out the gratuity to eligible employees as required by the government statute. However SIPL had not made the gratuity payments to the insurance provider for 2014 and 2015. To renew the benefit the company would first need to pay both the pending gratuity amount and the accumulated interest. Padmanabhan realized that failing to adhere to the basic regulatory requirements was a compliance risk and would limit SIPL’s ability to attract new talent. It would also dilute the credibility of the organization with both internal and external stakeholders.Compensation disparity between old and new employees remained a point of contention. This difference was highlighted when some of the long-time SIPL staff interviewed some newcomers. The established managers were shocked to see the compensation that the professionally qualified newcomers were expecting—and attaining. Manjula a veteran of 21 years was deeply affronted by the changes she saw in the recent recruitments. She exclaimed “I am getting ₹28000 a month as the manager of the department and now have just made an offer to my new team member an executive hired at ₹22000 per month. I am double his age and this is the price of my loyalty?” Padmanabhan realized that he needed to quickly put in place a revised compensation structure with a supporting performance management system.DEVELOPING THE ROADMAP FOR CHANGE IN COMPENSATIONBy March 2016 Padmanabhan had designed the compensation revision process (see Exhibit 6). However multiple implementation challenges threatened to derail implementation of the revisions. While he had created the job evaluation and grading structure for SIPL he still needed to complete the external market benchmarking (see the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for students).The practice of equating compensation for the organization’s jobs to that paid by representative external comparator organizations was commonly adopted to review the competitiveness of rewards. This comparison helped to establish the market rate for comparable jobs or skill sets and served as critical input for the total rewards strategy. The normal practice involved obtaining salary analyses an industry study market pricing and job matching reports. These data reports were obtained from national and global compensation survey market leaders that invested in building the research and data with reliability and consistency. However these reports were expensive and Suveer was not convinced that this investment was merited at the current stage and for the present scale of operations. But without accurate benchmarking Padmanabhan ran the risks of having inaccurate market competitiveness data. He wondered how he could obtain accurate data at an economical cost without diluting the reliability of the data. As an economical step to evaluate the competitiveness of each job family Padmanabhan looked at sample sets of nearly 50 data points obtained from top job portals and reference points provided by his contacts in the HR fraternity to develop an estimate of the market positioning. Seeing SIPL’s disparity with the market rate Padmanabhan realized that a one-time correction would significantly strain the salary budget. An informal discussion with Suveer identified which key talent to retain. Padmanabhan proposed a three-year plan to revise compensations across the board with the first year’s corrections applicable only to the key talent.An estimate indicated that the proposed revisions in compensation were likely to increase the organization’s cost base by about 80 per cent. The proposed restructured compensation affected different employees in different ways. A few would see an increase in their statutory payments requiring that their salaries be increased to buffer their statutory deductions and protect their net pay. Re-aligning the variable compensation and linking it instead to the newly developed performance management system meant managing a huge change and educating the entire workforce which was accustomed to seeing variable compensation as a deferred but guaranteed pay.Padmanabhan had some sense of the resistance that would be forthcoming. Some small changes he had made in the HR policies and processes were creating a high level of discomfort. Padmanabhan had started formally documenting HR policies but he faced considerable resistance from the workforce even for the small changes to more basic policies such as leave attendance and reporting systems. Paradoxically while employee feedback indicated the absence of discipline was a concern the established employees objected to the introduction of formal working hours and the discipline of clocking attendance:In earlier days Murthy would come in with us by 8:30 a.m. and work with us till lights out. I used to come in early go home for lunch and worked till whatever hours were needed to get the job done. Now I am being asked to swipe my attendance and log my hours. So operation successful but patient dead!Padmanabhan introduced an attendance management program (Time Office Function) to limit people wandering around the building and outside of work premises unexplained during working hours and to increase accountability and availability for productive outcomes during working hours. Padmanabhan explained the concerns:There was no accountability of who was in the factory or office premises and where and why they were going. The informal environment allowed a lot of easy mingling but this was counterproductive to efficient working resulting in unnecessarily long hours. As I saw the need to adhere to Factory Act requirements I did not want to increase wage costs due to overtime charges which were actually not merited. I wanted the workforce to be efficient and productive during the regular hours go home at the stipulated time and maintain a healthy work–life balance.Making the changes to compensation would be a huge challenge. Padmanabhan needed to develop a talent strategy and establish a compensation structure that aligned with the financial viability and strategic direction of the organization and that appeased employee preferences. He might also need additional people processes to complement the salary restructuring for a more effective implementation and there was the additional challenge of communicating and gaining acceptance for the proposed changes. Was the organization even ready for this kind of change and when would be the correct time to make the changes? How would Padmanabhan unravel this knot and where should he start?EXHIBIT 1: Sushma Industries Private Limited’s PRODUCT MIX AND REVENUE SALIENCE 2015Source: Sushma Industries Private Limited.EXHIBIT 2: Sushma Industries Private Limited’s FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE selected years 1985–2016 Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹67.45 on July 1 2016; All financial years end March 31.Source: Sushma Industries Private Limited.EXHIBIT 3: DEVELOPING Sushma industries private limited’s COMPENSATION STRUCTURENote: SIPL = Sushma Industries Private Limited; Shaded boxes indicate steps completed by Padmanabhan.

Rubicon Minerals Corporation was just one of Lac Seul’s many development partners or potential partners and it had suffered a couple of serious setbacks: an environmental chemical spill and more serious a devaluation of its estimated gold reserves. Described as “one of the worst Canadian mining meltdowns in years” this was a vivid demonstration of the risk and cyclicality in the mining industry.The Chief wondered about the future benefits from agreements with other mining companies such as Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp) and the junior company AurCrest Gold Inc. (AurCrest) which was partially owned by Lac Seul. Lac Seul also had business interests in timber and hydroelectric power the result of negotiations with the government to ameliorate past wrongs. Goldcorp was a large player and its agreement with Lac Seul in 2013 included financial contributions to community development. Bull was confident the contributions would continue but less confident about benefits from the many smaller players in the market. As chief it was Bull’s job along with the band council to lead Lac Seul in its stewardship of the land individual and community development; and relationships with neighbours industry and government. The band had a long history of relationships with other groups that shared the land on which they lived. Since the First Nations came into contact with explorers to Canada many of these relationships had become one-sided. But more recently with the government’s support and increasing public awareness of Canada’s past opportunities for balanced partnerships were arising. The situation was improving but there were still many challenges. One difficulty was the community’s capacity to take advantage of subcontracting offers from mining companies. Lac Seul had a mining liaison office in Red Lake Ontario that was sitting empty for lack of qualified personnel to staff it.Bull looked at his watch and realized he had a meeting at the training centre a converted school in nearby Hudson Ontario purchased by Lac Seul with assistance from Goldcorp. As he departed the office he drove by the new arena and conference centre a tangible benefit from a settlement of past inequities. Bull reviewed the meeting agenda which concerned negotiations with yet another resource company. He wondered how receptive the company would be to sharing benefits with First Nations and respecting the lands on which his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years.The communityDemographicsLac Seul First Nation was an aboriginal community located in remote northwestern Ontario 1200 kilometres northwest of Toronto. The land area of 26800 hectares was approximately 10 per cent of the size of Manitoulin Island. Lac Seul comprised three settlements on the shores of Lac Seul: Whitefish Bay (including Canoe River; total population 100) Kejick Bay (population 400) and Frenchman’s Head (population 400). The total reserve population in 2015 was approximately 3400 with 900 people living on the reserve. Of the three communities Frenchman’s Head had the closest road access and was a 40-kilometre drive from Sioux Lookout Ontario. A chief and seven councillors three each from the two larger communities and one from Whitefish Bay governed the band. The chief was elected at large.Of note was the off-reserve population. This had significance for band elections and for other votes required to approve agreements with resource companies. A court decision in 1999 confirmed the right of off-reserve community members to vote in elections. This ruling had implications for how resource companies communicated with the community.HistoryThere was ample evidence that pre-historic peoples had occupied the lands in the region. Excavations at the Ballynacree site near Kenora Ontario (170 kilometres southwest of Lac Seul) revealed evidence of a Laurel culture village including three houses numerous ceramic sherds and projectile points. According to radiocarbon dating of charred wood found in the excavation Laurel people lived in the area sometime between 1200 and 1300 CE. They were subsistent hunter-gatherers congregating at a central summer location with ample resources of spawning fish and wild rice. Winters would be spent in smaller family groups at traditional locations to exploit the scattered animal resources.Wenasaga Rapids was a known historical gathering point of First Nations people likely because of prolific fish stocks. The rapids were at the bottom of the four-kilometre long Wenasaga River which flowed south into Lac Seul. This was 80 kilometres northwest of the community of Kejick Bay or approximately two days’ paddle as it would have been expressed. An excavation of the site revealed ceramic sherds typical of Laurel culture dated as late as the thirteenth century. Also found were materials from Blackduck and Selkirk occupations thought by some to be ancestors of the Ojibwa and Cree people respectively. Analysis of carbonized food residue from these sherds indicated the presence of maize which was not likely grown in the area. This supported the presence of trade networks between early societies involving maize wild rice lithic (stone) tools or points and other goods. What was not clear was if there was a direct link between the archaeological record of habitation and the current inhabitants. At the time of contact with explorers to Canada Lac Seul ancestors would have been hunters living in the same area northwest of Lake Superior. They may have ranged as far north as James Bay or Hudson Bay in summer spending their winter in their traditional family areas to trap and hunt. Speculation was that shortly before the time of contact Lac Seul’s ancestors might have begun travelling to Sault Ste. Marie for summer ceremonies and inter-tribal trade. While there they encountered and traded with other First Nations people from the shores of Lake Superior and Huron.Toward the end of the seventeenth century the need to travel for summer trade declined as the French and English traders built posts for trade on Hudson Bay Lake Superior and points inland. By 1803 a Hudson Bay post was established on Lac Seul; it operated until the mid 1900s. At that time the summer gatherings took place on Lac Seul because of its central location. Summer gatherings were a time for celebrations marriages trade and dispute resolution.The Community’s Land and ResourcesTreaty with the Canadian GovernmentCanada’s government was motivated to sign treaties with First Nations people to establish a cooperative relationship and improve communication and transportation links with the western part of the country. There had been some friction with the Métis people living west of Lac Seul and this was no doubt part of the urgency to begin negotiations. There were delays in negotiating the treaty due to the personalities of those representing the government the discovery of silver and gold in the territory and misunderstandings on both sides regarding what rights were being conveyed with a treaty. After several approaches and false starts Treaty 3 was signed on October 3 1873. Chief John Cromarty of Lac Seul signed an adhesion to Treaty 3 on June 9 1874.Terms of the treaty were meant to encourage farming and included an area of reserved land not exceeding one square mile per family a one-time payment of CA$12 per person and an annual payment of $5 per person. The band as a whole received $1500 per year for group purchase of ammunition twine for fishing nets and farming implements as well as farm animals and seeds for planting.During the treaty negotiations a Métis named Nolin was paid to interpret and take notes of the treaty details for the First Nations people. Those notes initially written in French formed what became known as the Paypom treaty. Its content was similar to the terms of Treaty 3 but also contained terms that had been discussed but were not included in Treaty 3 specifically with respect to mineral rights:If some gold or silver mines be found in their reserves it will be to the benefit of the Indians but if the Indians find any gold or silver mines out of their reserves they will surely be paid the finding of the mines.It was clear the parties were aware of resources related to the land in question and discussed the issue. It was also clear that the government was trying to promote farming which would tie the community to its reserved land.Timber ResourcesIn keeping with the management approach of the day the band was convinced in 1919 to surrender their rights to timber to the government to sell “upon such terms as the Government of the Dominion of Canada may deem most conductive to our welfare and that of our people.” The principles seemed appropriate: the land and timber would be measured an agreed upon amount of land and timber would be estimated fees would be set the timber harvested and fees paid and distributed to the band. The Department of Indian Affairs (as it was called at the time) hired Harold J. Bury as its timber inspector and it was he who did the timber cruise—a process of measuring the type and size of trees within a bounded area—to assess the value of timber present. The reserve was divided into northern and southern portions. A license for the southern portion was awarded to Keewatin Lumber in 1923. Bury had identified the northern portion as too remote for economic harvesting; however in 1926 Charles Cox was awarded a license for that very portion.Cox already had timber permits of a similar nature for the Gull River reserve (home of the Gull Bay First Nation) approximately 250 kilometres southeast of Lac Seul. Between 1923 and 1925 the Department of Indian Affairs had received numerous complaints regarding the way Cox was cutting the lumber. Bury was also responsible for the Gull River reserve. The two of them colluded the illegal activity resulting in financial damage to the Ginoogaming First Nation (then the Long Lac [alternatively Long Lake] 77 First Nation). Bury it seemed acted at least unethically and perhaps illegally in allowing Cox to cut more timber than allotted and pay less than was contractually required. Bury also renewed agreements without tender and generally acted outside the law. Cox for his part was unethical and acted illegally taking more than was contractually agreed upon without paying for it.Ginoogaming filed a claim in 1990 specific to Cox’s illegal behaviour. Canada settled the claim in 2002 with a payment of $13.8 million. At that point Mark Kuhlberg an historian who specialized in forest history contacted then Chief David Gordon and Bull who was then councillor of Lac Seul to inform them of his findings regarding Cox and the settlement obtained at Ginoogaming. After conferring with their colleagues the chief and council decided to proceed with their own lawsuit against Canada claiming the government had a fiduciary duty to manage the band’s timber assets for the band’s benefit.The band hired lawyer Will Major to pursue the suit. Major recruited expert researchers and witnesses including Kuhlberg and another historian a forester an economist and two accountants. The trial involved 15 days of hearings between September 3 and October 24 2008. The court held that Canada had indeed failed to share revenue protect the timber resources and manage the timber asset to the advantage of the First Nation. The court acknowledged that Canada did not monitor or measure the amount of timber harvested. The harvested amounts documented by the logging company amounted to approximately one-fifth of the estimated amount available for harvest. Therefore the compensation amount was less than legally required. The measure of the occupied area was also under-reported resulting in further reduction of legally available rent. In addition there was no retendering process at the end of license periods to ensure competitive compensation. It seems Cox had been up to the same illegal activities at Lac Seul as he demonstrated at Gull River and the Long Lac reserve while Bury was at minimum incompetent and acting either unethically illegally or both. The evidence was compelling: in total the court noted six different breaches of fiduciary duty. The judge summarized his findings in an understatement: “The Crown did not act in a prudent manner and in the best interests of the band.” The band was awarded a settlement of $27 million which they used to further their economic development goals including the purchase and operation of a Tim Hortons franchise in Sioux Lookout.Additionally and somewhat ironically Lac Seul received a license to manage the Lac Seul forest. The band had prepared a business plan for a wood supply competition held by the Ministry of Northern Development Mines and Forestry for the Lac Seul forest. In a controversial process the band lost to a larger company in the competition held in 2011. That winning mill subsequently went bankrupt and Lac Seul was awarded the contract based on their previously prepared plan. These were positive outcomes from negative historic experiences.Water ManagementIn the mid-1920s gold was discovered at Red Lake; by 1926 thousands of people had converged on the area. At the same time the Canadian Department of the Interior had concluded surveys on the English River system to determine its potential for generating power and to evaluate control issues that affected the Winnipeg River. With the population influx and prospecting and mining activities electricity was needed. The decision was made to store water in Lac Seul with the construction of a dam at its Ear Falls outlet. Construction of the dam and a powerhouse began in 1928.There were of course indigenous people living in the area specifically on the reserve. Some were farming as encouraged by Canada in the treaty. Lac Seul had learned through trade and communication networks that a dam was being considered for the English River. In 1923 an industrialist from Minnesota Edward Backus had constructed a dam at Lac des Mille Lacs 200 kilometres southeast of Lac Seul. That dam had also been constructed to control water and generate electricity. The result however included flooding of the Ojibwa settlement adjacent to the lake.Then chief of Lac Seul Paul Thomas visited the Indian agent at the time Frank Edwards to alert him of their concerns about a plan for a dam at Lac Seul. Edwards sent a letter to Ottawa in 1924 (see Exhibit 1). In it he voiced the chief’s worry about the possibility of losing hay fields gardens timber and housing. Edwards also noted the concern that the cemetery and burial grounds could be destroyed. The letter and the band’s concerns were paid little heed. Construction commenced on the Lac Seul dam in 1928. The band was assured that flooding would be minor.The Keewatin Lumber Company previously licensed to cut the south portion of the reserve was awarded a contract to cut the Lac Seul foreshore. They were meant to clear that part of the shore that would soon be flooded make use of the lumber and minimize organic material and obstructions on the new lake bottom. Instead the company cut a different area equivalent to the size of their license but much easier to access than the foreshore. This was indicative of the care and supervision the band could expect from the government.The Lac Seul people continued their traditional lifestyle which included summer gatherings at the lake meeting area and winter living at their clan territory. The events that subsequently unfolded were described on a plaque commemorating the event (see Exhibit 2):In 1934 without knowledge or permission of the Obishikokaang Anishinaabeg the dam was activated and the lake rose by 12 feet. The people of Obishikokaang returned from a winter of trapping to find their summer settlement along the reserve shoreline under water.The effect was devastating. Eighty-two homes were lost as well as food storage tools agricultural land 3300 acres of wild rice beds and other resources vital to the band’s livelihood. Hundreds were forced to leave the reserve to find a way to survive. Negotiations for construction of the dam had included compensation for the band. In 1928 Canada and the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario ratified the Lac Seul storage agreement for cost sharing. Anticipated damage was calculated in advance to compensate for land resources and housing that would be lost to the dam project. The anticipated damage was valued at $120000 and the capital cost of the project was set at over $750000. Compensation for Lac Seul was set at $50000 ($700000 equivalent in 2016). “Ontario and Canada considered the figure of $120200 as compensation to the band to be excessive.”In 1941 the valuation for lost resources was raised to over $280000; in 1943 it was reduced to $72000. Still in the end only $50000 was paid to the band. Lac Seul had been pursuing appropriate compensation ever since. In what was an illustrative irony the band itself did not get electricity until 1980.In 1985 the band filed a flood claim under the government’s Specific Claims Policy. Canada introduced the policy in 2007 to facilitate grievances resulting from an alleged failure to meet basic treaty obligations. (If there was no treaty in place bands were to use a “Comprehensive Claims” process.) The Specific Claims Policy was an update of an old policy that was inefficient and had created a backlog of cases. The process featured independent judges who could award up to $150 million in compensation. Canada maintained a record of Specific Claims with negotiated agreements. Settlements ranged from $100000 to millions for a variety of issues from improper surveys and easements to compensation for flooding and fiduciary obligations.Canada offered to negotiate Lac Seul’s claim in 1995. Thirteen years later the government offered Lac Seul a settlement of $7 million. The band rejected the offer and launched a lawsuit which was scheduled to begin in September 2016.Related to the flood claim was negotiation over expansion of the power station at Ear Falls. In 2004 Ontario Power Generation (OPG) a Crown corporation responsible for about half of the electricity generated for the whole province of Ontario was planning to expand the dam to capture water flow that spilled past the existing generating station. In typical fashion the band was the last to hear of the project. In fact Gordon still chief at the time only learned about the project by hearing about it on the radio. The band organized a bus and went to protest the province’s actions.A series of negotiations followed forced by requirements of the Ontario government for OPG to obtain a permit to take water. Lac Seul was awarded a financial settlement based on past hydro activity and sales. By reinvesting $4 million from the settlement Lac Seul became a 25 per cent owner of the new 12.5 megawatt Obishikokaang Waasiganikewigamig/Lac Seul Generating Station. The dam began commercial operation on February 18 2009. It featured a first-on and last-off the grid demand meaning the dam’s output and Lac Seul’s investment were maximized.Minerals Records show that the Red Lake area had been sporadically explored since 1893 but nothing was sustained at the time. E. L. Bruce a professor of geology at Queen’s University in Kingston visited and explored the area in the summers of 1922 and 1923. His report published in 1924 indicated the geology was similar to that at Kirkland Lake where a gold deposit was found. An investment group from Haileybury Ontario sponsored two prospectors brothers Lorne and Ray Howey to look for gold. They discovered gold-bearing rock in 1925; by 1926 the rush for development was on.Since 1925 mines at Red Lake had produced 28 million ounces of gold. Two-thirds of the gold (66 per cent) came from Goldcorp’s Red Lake mine formerly known as the Dickenson mine (1994) and before that the Arthur White mine. In 2006 Goldcorp acquired the Campbell Mine and began operating it and the Red Lake mine as a single project. Together they produced over 500000 ounces of gold in 2012. The Red Lake mine was the larger mine by far producing more than 400000 ounces of gold in 2014. Plans for the mining complex included continued production and exploration. As of 2014 Goldcorp estimated the mines would produce over 2 million ounces of gold. Although Goldcorp was the major player at Red Lake other mining companies were also exploring the region.Other First Nations also had experience with mining companies. A northern neighbouring band Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation (KI) clashed with Platinex Inc. (Platinex). KI was located on Big Trout Lake approximately 400 kilometres northeast of Lac Seul. Platinex was a junior mining company that began exploring in the area in 1999. KI and Platinex had initial discussions and negotiations but talks broke down. In August 2005 KI sent a letter to Platinex ending negotiations:It was decided that effective immediately August 30 2005 all previous Agreements and Letters of Understanding between all affected parties . . . related to your proposed work around the above mentioned area both verbal and written will be null and void.Subsequently to acquire a listing on the TSX Venture Exchange Platinex falsely reported “[KI] has verbally consented to low impact exploration.” A drilling team was then sent in and the band blockaded the road and airstrip. The drilling team departed and KI and Platinex each filed for a court injunction against the activities of the other. The matter resolved unhappily with a temporary halt on both parties and a directive to both parties to “begin [communication and honest and open dialogue] again.” The court pronounced that “the parties must continue to seek their own resolution of their issues and concerns.” Instead both sides took further actions. In 2008 KI members protested and were jailed. Platinex tried to land a floatplane at the community in August 2009 but was blocked by protestors. Finally Ontario settled the dispute with a payout of $5 million to Platinex in exchange for Platinex dropping all lawsuits against the government and KI. This unhappy episode was unfolding while Lac Seul was negotiating with a number of companies; clearly KI’s experience informed Lac Seul’s negotiations.GoldcorpThe Lac Seul chief and band were well aware of mining that was going on in the area. The remote area—160 kilometres northwest of Sioux Lookout but a four-hour drive by road—was part of Lac Seul’s traditional territory for time immemorial and had been the site of mining for more than eight decades. In 2006 talks were initiated with Gold Eagle Mines Limited a junior mining company in the Red Lake mine trend looking to develop a deposit of up to 6 million ounces. Initial meetings with the exploration manager seemed to be progressing if slowly. Lac Seul was interested in a small percentage of the exploration budget—approximately 2 per cent. This would have provided resources for the band to become more involved in the mining process.In the summer of 2008 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited invested $50 million in Gold Eagle for a 7.2 per cent stake in the company. This was intended to support Gold Eagle’s exploration program. Goldcorp which owned the larger mines in the area reacted to Agnico’s investment by offering to buy out Gold Eagle for $1.5 billion a premium of $500 million over the Agnico valuation. Gold Eagle sold immediately and the Lac Seul band was left without an agreement. The band recommenced negotiations with the local Red Lake mine manager and seemed to make some headway. However that manager left the company soon after and was replaced by a new manager. Relations seemed to be “less cordial” simply as a result of a change in personalities at the table.Goldcorp however was willing to negotiate and so discussions progressed. A negotiation protocol agreement was signed in April 2002. Goldcorp demonstrated goodwill by providing the band with $500000 for a new training centre before negotiations were complete. A new local person for Goldcorp relieved the tensions that had been building and negotiations continued. The major stumbling block was environmental issues which were a concern to the band. A typical gold mine used cyanide and arsenic which could find their way from the mine tailings into nearby lakes and rivers with obvious negative effects. Past practice had been less than ideal when considering environmental impact so the band wanted to prevent further damage to the environment and ensure recovery measures were in place.After years of negotiation through ownership and personnel changes an agreement was signed on August 16 2013. Legal precedents the need for water-taking permits and additional power were factors that would have motivated Goldcorp to negotiate. The agreement covered yearly financial support for community infrastructure as well as employment training and contracting and permits for environmental issues such as water and tailings. A $500000 equity fund was established to support new business development. This was a great asset for the community and helped them build their capacity in dealing with resource companies.RubiconRubicon Minerals Corporation (Rubicon) was a mining company formed in British Columbia in 1996. It had been exploring in the Red Lake area since the late 1990s. Rubicon and Lac Seul engaged in preliminary talks and in January 2010 Lac Seul signed another exploration accommodation agreement. The intent was to continue negotiating to reach an impact benefit agreement. There were difficulties when Rubicon’s purchasing department failed to follow through with their commitments. Then in 2012 Lac Seul learned that individuals formerly with Goldcorp had been hired into positions of power at Rubicon. Again personalities clashed. In spite of the challenges negotiations continued and a joint venture was established; Outland Camps would provide Rubicon’s workers with camps and food services.Rubicon had recently had its own difficulties: an ammonia spill in the fall of 2015 forced a closure of its mill causing a drop in share price. Then in January 2016 Rubicon reduced its gold reserve estimate from 2.2 million ounces to 300000 ounces an 86 per cent decrease. The correction was a result of Rubicon going straight from a preliminary economic assessment to construction skipping the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies that would have helped the company understand the structure of the deposit. Once in production in June 2015 Rubicon realized that the deposit was more complex than estimated; they were not mining gold in the expected concentrations and thus had to decrease estimates. The impact for Lac Seul was that all negotiations and potential agreements were on hold as the company tried to maintain solvency or find a willing buyer.AurCrestTribute Minerals Inc. (Tribute) was a Canadian gold miner with a property at Richardson Lake part of the Red Lake gold complex. Tribute’s chief executive officer was Ian Brodie-Brown. In 2006 Brodie-Brown sent a letter to the Lac Seul community to introduce himself and his company. Receiving an introductory letter was a first for Lac Seul; they were impressed. Although nothing materialized from those first interactions the two parties kept in touch over the years. When Lac Seul wanted to form a junior exploration company they asked Brodie-Brown for help. After considering several options they decided to rename and repurpose Tribute as AurCrest Gold Inc. In 2011 the community invested $500000 for a 9.9 per cent share and acquired a non-rotatable seat on the board of directors. Chris Angeconeb Lac Seul’s flood claim coordinator was appointed director. Subsequently Angeconeb was made general manager of economic development for Lac Seul; then in July 2015 he was hired by AurCrest as executive vice-president.Hiring Angeconeb into an executive position had interesting implications for Lac Seul given that the first sentence of AurCrest’s mission statement was “Create and maintain important relationships with the local indigenous peoples and share the benefits the industry has to offer.” AurCrest was attempting to honour their mission by having Angeconeb with all of his development experience as an executive of the company.Additionally in October 2015 AurCrest incorporated Wiigwaasaatig Energy Inc. to develop renewable energy projects including wind solar and biomass in partnership with First Nations communities proximal to AurCrest’s mining properties. This included Lac Seul. Cat Lake First Nation was also close to AurCrest’s Richardson Lake gold property. AurCrest signed an agreement to develop power with Cat Lake who had some experience and an Ontario license for electrical power transmission—keys for this kind of project. Although exploration and development slowed as part of the mining cycle developing renewable energy infrastructure showed potential for future benefits and developing relationships.Current statusLac Seul had made significant progress in recovering from past injustices committed by the government and private parties. The community had used past settlement money from the timber claim to improve infrastructure build an arena and provide resources for community members. A number of joint ventures had been established in construction food services and exploration services. A Tim Hortons franchise was purchased in partnership and was successfully operating in Sioux Lookout. The band owned a 25 per cent share in the Lac Seul Generating Station. Obishikokaang Resources Corporation established in 2012 was awarded a license to manage and harvest the local forest on behalf of the First Nations communities. A training centre had been established in a converted school in the nearby village of Hudson. The agreement with Goldcorp included training community members for work in mining. These were all positive exemplars for other communities.Developing the capacities of members in the community was an area of potential development. The most recent statistics revealed that the community’s level of education was much lower than the Ontario average (see Exhibit 3). Sixty-four per cent of the population had no degree certificate or high school diploma. Only 19 per cent of the community had a high school diploma compared to 27 per cent in Ontario. Convincing students to stay in school and complete their secondary education then go on to university would be a laudable and valuable goal. Financial resources combined with promotion and counseling would help the community realize this goal.In spite of the band’s economic development they still faced a higher than average unemployment rate. Census data indicated the unemployment rate for Lac Seul was 29.6 per cent compared to 8.3 per cent for Ontario. As well it had recently come to light that the government was underfunding children’s services for First Nations. In addition to education employment and children’s services there were health and housing issues to deal with. The market for timber harvesting was depressed and awaiting an upturn in the economy. Mining was also in a down cycle. The band was constrained by geography and personnel capacity issues limiting the number of initiatives they could develop or concurrently manage. Their immediate focus was the anticipated resolution of the flood claim and the benefits the settlement might provide for the community.

(Patanjali) stated its intentions to introduce swadeshi jeans to the Indian market. Established in 2006 Patanjali had experienced dramatic growth by stressing traditional Indian values of wellness and naturalness and offering low prices. The company quickly became a significant player in the Indian markets for Ayurvedic medicines personal care products and consumer packaged foods. The growth of Patanjali not only unnerved many multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in India but also unsettled many large Indian-owned companies. Launching jeans would be the company’s first foray into clothing.Clad in saffron robes and adorned with a flowing beard yoga guru Baba Ramdev Patanjali’s charismatic co-founder and brand spokesperson explained some of the key premises underpinning the company’s strategy and its entry into clothing: “World-class quality low price and giving away our entire profits to charity are the three main reasons for the boom seen in Patanjali products.” By having a yoga guru as its spokesperson and employing traditional ingredients and formulations in most of its products Patanjali also appealed to Hindu antiquity tradition and spiritualism. When promoting Patanjali Ramdev regularly called upon Indian nationalism with statements such as “In India food cosmetics and medicines are mostly made and sold by foreign multinational companies that take the country’s money abroad. They invest less money but their profits are huge. . . . We want that India’s money should stay here.” Patanjali’s unique combination of Indian nationalism yoga spiritualism and traditionalism along with its low prices had proven to be a successful formula in India’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) markets. However some observers doubted whether this recipe could be successfully applied to jeans. One skeptic noted “Patanjali products . . . [do] well because of purity of formulation and quality at the right price which are the narratives but that cannot be extended to fashion. . . . This [move into jeans] is to my mind a stretch.” Other observers felt the jeans initiative was problematic not because it was necessarily a bad idea but rather because Patanjali had other more compelling growth opportunities such as increasing sales of its existing products within India or perhaps selling more of those products outside of India—in the Indian subcontinent in countries where the Indian diaspora had a large presence or in Western developed countries where natural products were increasingly popular and could command a premium.Founding and HistoryPatanjali was the product of the unique talents long history and special relationship of its two co-founders. Ramdev was the flamboyant public face of the organization whereas Acharya Balkrishna was the more reserved behind-the-scenes operations-oriented member of the duo. Born in 1965 Ramdev studied Indian scriptures Sanskrit and yoga; quite early in life he renounced worldly possessions and become a sannyasi. Balkrishna was born into a Nepalese family of modest means in 1975. He was educated at various Indian gurukuls and met Ramdev in 1988 while attending Kalwa Gurukul in Haryana India. They established a strong relationship keeping in touch by letters over the next few years while Balkrishna travelled India studying plants and their medicinal properties—a key aspect of Ayurveda. The two reconnected in 1993 while Ramdev was living in the Himalayan caves of the Hindu pilgrim town of Gangotri. Commenting on this time in their lives Balkrishna said:When we were students we never thought we wanted to become very big businessmen or make a lot of money that was never our mind-set. . . . We didn’t come from any major family background. Had that been our thought we would never have gone to a gurukul. Everyone knows going to a gurukul and studying Sanskrit no one becomes rich. We went to the gurukul thinking we’ll become experts in our ancient texts and philosophies.In 1995 the duo founded a charitable trust dedicated to bringing Ayurvedic therapies to neglected parts of the country. After first focusing mostly on natural herbal medicines they then added more complex medicines from traditional Ayurvedic formulations and eventually established Ayurveda clinics. At about this time Ramdev started hosting free yoga camps. His accessible style and personable demeanour proved popular and attendance at these events grew. Ramdev would extol the benefits of yoga and Ayurveda to his followers complaining of various ailments. Meanwhile Balkrishna made Ayurvedic medicines and doctors available at these yoga camps.A turning point came in 2003 when Aastha TV a spiritual TV network in India featured Ramdev in its morning yoga slot. He quickly developed a huge following and the demand for Balkrishna’s Ayurvedic therapies grew in step and provided the base for expanding to larger-scale production. Balkrishna explained their motivation: “There was no commercial planning. It was all driven by demand from people that we responded to.” To fulfill this demand Patanjali was formed in 2006. The company was named after Patanjali a scholar from the period between the fourth and second centuries BC credited with writing the first treatise on yoga principles. Ramdev and Balkrishna contributed 20 hectares of land they already owned and with several of Ramdev’s followers as backers they secured a $40 million bank loan to register the company and begin construction of what eventually became Patanjali Food and Herbal Park at Haridwar in northern India. As part of its operations Patanjali was committed to helping India’s rural farmers working with them to supply its production facility. Because of his commitment as a sannyasi Ramdev took no ownership interest in the newly formed company; Balkrishna owned over 90 per cent of the shares and the remainder were held by two of the original financial backers. Because of his equity stake in Patanjali Balkrishna was listed by Forbes as India’s 46th-richest person in 2016. Despite Patanjali’s success both founders lived modestly and reportedly took no monetary compensation from the company. Moreover while Patanjali was registered as a private company the espoused purpose of its founders was not profits. Ramdev stated “Our profits are small because unlike multinationals like Coca-Cola or Nestlé our main aim is not to make profit but to benefit others.” He also often stated that all profits from Patanjali’s products went to charity. What constituted charity was subject to interpretation but as currently espoused Patanjali’s vision and mission were different from those of most businesses: VisionKeeping Nationalism Ayurved and Yog as our pillars we are committed to create a healthier society and country. To raise the pride and glory of the world we are geared up to serve people by bringing the blessings of nature into their lives. With sheer dedication scientific approach astute planning and realism we are poised to write a new success story for the world.MissionMaking India an ideal place for the growth and development of Ayurveda and a prototype for the rest of the world.Unsurprisingly Patanjali’s operations were not limited to commercial activities but also included education research cattle protection poverty eradication and health. These objectives were served through a host of related organizations (see Exhibit 1).Patanjali focused on natural herbal products and Ayurvedic formulations at the time of its founding but it expanded quickly into personal care products (e.g. toothpaste hair care and skin cleansers) and food (e.g. ghee or clarified butter; noodles; biscuits; edible oils; and juices). As of 2015 about 85–90 per cent of all production was still done in-house mostly at the company’s original but much expanded 60-hectare complex outside Haridwar. By 2016 Patanjali had extended its original sales network of yoga camps and Ayurveda clinics to include approximately 10000 retail stores nationwide. The company directly employed nearly 20000 people and had supply relationships with over 100000 farmers.By 2016 Ramdev had become a very influential public figure in India commanding unparalleled star power. His actions and words were a staple for the Indian media; a comedy talk show in which he participated held the distinction of garnering the highest ever viewership in Indian television history. Ramdev’s Facebook page had accumulated 7.3 million likes and his Twitter handle had six million followers. Sales Profits and ProductsPatanjali’s sales revenues had grown dramatically since 2012 (see Exhibit 2). To enable this growth Patanjali had developed and launched a wide range of products in several categories of the FMCG sector: natural healthcare (44 products) natural food products (49 products) herbal homecare (14 products) and natural personal care (93 products). These products adhered to Patanjali’s principles of using natural and Ayurvedic ingredients and offering high-quality products at a cheaper price than most competitors. Patanjali’s best-selling product was ghee which contributed 30–35 per cent of revenues making food the largest share of Patanjali’s revenues (see Exhibit 2). Healthcare including traditional medical products was the second-largest product category at 19 per cent followed by toiletries (15 per cent) dental products (11 per cent) hair care (11 per cent) and cosmetics (7 per cent).Patanjali was a private company with limited financial reporting requirements. Its profits for the March 2016 fiscal year end were reportedly $105 million on sales of $758 million—a substantial increase from its $11 million profit in 2012. According to Balkrishna profits were being reinvested to better serve the Indian people with more Patanjali products. He said “We want to use this wealth [profits] to serve others and not ourselves. But at the same time we don’t believe in giving things for free because if we did that within a year we’d be . . . going around with a begging bowl. We need the wealth to serve the people.”Food and BeveragesGoing beyond its popular ghee Patanjali had greatly expanded its food products to include instant noodles flour biscuits and honey. During 2015 Patanjali announced the launch of Patanjali Atta Noodles after market leader Nestlé’s Maggi noodles were temporarily banned from Indian store shelves because lead had been discovered in the products. Patanjali took advantage of this opportunity to launch its own instant noodle brand. According to Ramdev these noodles were healthier than others on the market and free of toxic ingredients. Similarly Patanjali marketed its ghee as being a higher-quality healthier alternative to regular butter. Although Patanjali’s products were mainly priced lower than competitors’ products its ghee was priced higher. Patanjali had experienced some controversies. In one instance products with manufacturing dates six months in the future were found in retail stores. In another fungus was detected in some bottles of ghee. Patanjali Atta Noodles were also found to be substandard containing a high level of ash. Ramdev denied that Patanjali products contained any harmful ingredients and claimed these allegations had been made to ruin the reputation of the brand. In any event Patanjali’s sales continued to grow. In addition to ghee wheat flour and honey were some of Patanjali’s best-selling products. Other products in this category included breakfast cereal pickles ketchup spices and fruit juice. Within the food category Patanjali stated its intention to launch additional dairy products in the future. HealthcareHealthcare products were one of Patanjali’s original competencies. The company’s produced more than 300 healthcare products including digestives Ayurvedic medicines and oils. Patanjali’s medical preparations promised to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions including diabetes anxiety arthritis Parkinson’s disease high blood pressure and even infertility. Patanjali integrated its healthcare product offerings with treatments at the Patanjali Ayurved Hospital and with medical and Ayurvedic research at several centres. The Ayurved Hospital had the capacity to offer free consultations to 6000–10000 patients a day. Patanjali also provided free Ayurvedic consultations at the Patanjali Yogpeeth yoga institute and in Patanjali stores. These steps contributed to Patanjali’s success and also expanded the market for over-the-counter and other Ayurvedic products. Cleaning Products and ToiletriesRamdev’s effective marketing created awareness of Ayurvedic herbal and natural ingredients and opened the door for the company to enter other FMCG segments such as toiletries cosmetics and skin care. Patanjali’s products in the toiletries category included personal-care products such as body oils soaps and cleansers for body face and hands; its cleaning products included detergent powders and dish wash bars. All were based on natural and herbal ingredients. In 2016 Patanjali entered the baby-care market and launched a whole new product range including hair oil massage oil body lotion and body wash gel under a sub-brand called Shishu care. Patanjali sought to increase its presence in the baby and child-care markets. Dental ProductsPatanjali’s toothpaste Dant Kanti (meaning “tooth shine”) contained herbs and some Ayurvedic ingredients and claimed to prevent cavities and bad breath stop bleeding gums and pain and strengthen teeth. Dant Kanti one of Patanjali’s best-selling products forced Colgate the market leader to launch its own natural and herbal line of toothpastes. Balkrishna voiced strong opposition when Colgate named one of its new herbal toothpastes Cibaca Vedshakti saying “We worship and respect Vedas like our gods we don’t use them in our products. This is not a toothpaste but a direct attack on our culture.” Dental care in India had traditionally used herbal and natural materials. For example people in India once chewed plant twigs (neem and miswak) and turned them into brushes to clean teeth. Also salt and coal powder were once used as teeth-whitening agents. These practices receded most notably in urban areas with the advent of toothpaste and savvy marketing by toothpaste manufacturers. Facing competition from Patanjali and similar companies Colgate introduced salt- and coal-infused toothpastes. Ramdev denounced the “lies and deceit of MNCs” by placing an old 1985 ad from Colgate (highlighting the harmful effects of coal and salt on teeth) next to its 2016 ads (underscoring the benefits of coal and salt).The battles in the toothpaste market were expected to continue because the herbal toothpaste market was estimated to account for 13–14 per cent of the total toothpaste market. Patanjali had achieved a 2 per cent share of the oral-care market by the end of the March 2016 and Patanjali’s toothpaste brand generated revenues of $67.4 million in the fiscal year 2015–16 according to Ramdev.Skin and Hair CarePatanjali’s hair-care products included shampoo conditioner hair oil and hair colour. These hair products were mostly based on natural ingredients such as coconut gooseberry and almond and promised to have positive effects on hair health—for example preventing hair loss and stimulating hair growth. Almost all of these products were offered at a lower price than those offered by competitors. Being able to produce a cheaper better-quality product was a good reason for entering a new product category; but that ability alone was not enough. As Balkrishna said “The decision to enter a new category is triggered by a controversy or when Ramdev is approached by people.”Patanjali’s latest product category in the personal-care segment was cosmetics or skin care. Patanjali offered kajal (eyeliner) cooling oil shave cream and shave gel. The company’s makeup products were marketed as being better for the skin than competitors’ products which may contain chemical ingredients. Patanjali’s CompetitionNo player in the Indian market exactly matched Patanjali’s breadth of products and the company confronted different types of competitors across its product range. These competitors included the Indian subsidiaries of such MNCs as Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and India-based companies such as Dabur India Ltd. and Marico Ltd. (see Exhibit 3).  In addition other Indian enterprises associated with Indian spiritual gurus were emerging as potentially significant competitors to Patanjali. (see Exhibit 4).Among this latter group the most notable was Sri Sri Ayurveda started by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar a spiritual leader and founder of The Art of Living Foundation. As India was a diverse country with many different ethnic language and religious groups (see Exhibit 5) the relative strengths of these players differed regionally. Patanjali was strongest in the Hindi-speaking north of India where it was founded and had its principal production facility; however it was less well-established in the south where organizations such as The Art of Living Foundation and Isha Foundation had a more substantial presence. Although some of the other gurus had larger numbers of dedicated followers Patanjali was the first mover of this type and the largest in terms of sales revenues. Patanjali’s AdvantagesPatanjali followed a cost-plus pricing strategy adding a small margin to costs to calculate the price instead of focusing on market-based pricing or profits. Thus Patanjali offered most products at a significant discount compared with its competitors. Balkrishna stated that the low prices would firstly benefit consumers and secondly force MNCs to reduce the prices of their products.One main reason Patanjali was able to offer high-quality products at relatively low prices was its cost-effective business model which differed from that of its multinational competitors. By way of comparison the cost structure of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd. was typical. Its costs and profits as a percentage of revenues included raw materials at 36 per cent labour at 6 per cent depreciation at 2.6 per cent advertising and promotion at 17 per cent general and administrative costs at 17 per cent profits before taxes at 20 per cent and taxes at 6 per cent (about half of after tax profits were paid out as dividends).Patanjali kept its costs low by sourcing products from its own manufacturing park; many raw materials came directly from farmers thus eliminating the involvement and markup of intermediaries. However Patanjali had recently begun using more third-party suppliers for some products. Further its human-resource costs were believed to be low; the company claimed to pay low or no executive compensation and wages for all employees were kept low because the people who worked for Patanjali joined more for the cause than for the monetary compensation. While the private nature of the company meant these assertions could not be verified it was not uncommon for people in India—particularly those following a guru or supporting a movement—to sacrifice personal benefits and comforts. Patanjali kept administrative and overhead costs low by marketing all products under the umbrella Patanjali brand rather than developing multiple brand names for different categories. It also appeared that its marketing expenses were low because it did not conduct any market research for new products. Even before Patanjali was founded Ramdev had millions of followers in India and worldwide through his yoga classes and TV shows. By 2016 Ramdev appeared on five TV channels that aired globally. His social media presence and media exposure meant that Ramdev reached millions of people at no direct cost to Patanjali. This marketing advantage could have been dissipating as Patanjali had recently enlisted other celebrity endorsers: wrestler Sushil Kumar for ghee and actress and Bharatiya Janata Party member of Parliament Hema Malini for biscuits. Patanjali had also started to use conventional marketing channels such as TV advertisements. Market analysts estimated that Patanjali was spending about 10 per cent of its 2016 turnover on advertisements. (This expenditure compared with a 10–15 per cent industry average and a 13 per cent spend by Hindustan Unilever Limited.) However Patanjali claimed that its advertising spend was much lower at only 2–3 per cent. Patanjali’s ads were played an average of 20 hours every day across 161 TV channels predominantly in the news genre making Patanjali one of India’s top 10 advertised brands. Ramdev’s prominence in public life made him popular with politicians. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several chief ministers were among his students and followers. These associations meant that Patanjali did not face some of the costs and delays confronted by typical businesses when for example seeking approvals acquiring land and other assets securing state subsidies or forging relationships with suppliers and distributors. For example many state governments (e.g. Andhra Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Haryana and Rajasthan) courted investments from Patanjali and offered land and other facilities at subsidized rates. Patanjali distributed its products directly through 5000 Patanjali franchise stores and 3000 health centres in India. It also had a presence in 5000 other retail outlets serviced through 80 super-distributors and 700 distributors. Partly as an effort to achieve more nationwide distribution Patanjali had recently established indirect distribution arrangements with several large Indian retail chains including Future Group Reliance and Tesco and it planned to add 20 Walmart wholesale cash-and-carry outlets to this list. Further Patanjali products could be ordered online or through a mobile app with free shipping for orders over ₹499 (about $7). Patanjali’s strategy aligned well with the preferences of many Indian consumers. Ramdev’s followers and many Patanjali customers were health-conscious and practised yoga meditation and natural living. Health consciousness was rising in India as was the demand for natural products. Traditional herbal and natural ingredients were regaining popularity in India and globally. Purchase decisions regarding personal-care products for over half of Indians were influenced by the use of natural and organic ingredients which many considered a safer alternative to products containing chemicals.In addition to Ayurvedic and natural products some Indian consumers also preferred swadeshi products—products made in India. Swadeshi had its origins in the Indian independence movement and India had recently seen a rise in populist patriotism. Sixty-two per cent of Indian consumers preferred to buy Indian rather than foreign products. The nationalistic movement in India was promoted by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who launched the “Make in India” campaign in 2014 to encourage local and international companies to manufacture in India. During October 2016 some politicians supported a social media campaign to boycott goods made in China which coincided with a 10–20 per cent drop in demand for Chinese goods across India; retailers reported that customers were asking for Indian-made products. One survey asking Indian consumers their reasons for purchasing Patanjali products reported the following results: price (65 per cent) health (63 per cent) quality (57 per cent) trustworthiness (20 per cent) and swadeshi (20 per cent).Growth OpportunitiesWhile the Indian market had been Patanjali’s primary focus the company also had a modest international presence exporting to the United Kingdom the United States Canada and Mauritius which were all home to large Indian-origin populations. The company had established three organizations to cater to Canada Nepal and Mauritius (see Exhibit 1). Although non-resident Indian populations and people of Indian origin were spread around the world the developed countries with the largest populations were the United States the United Kingdom and Canada (see Exhibit 6). In addition to Patanjali’s products being attractive to many people of Indian origin Patanjali also found a considerable consumer segment for yoga wellness and natural products in Western countries. These consumers tended to be affluent more educated and open to new products and services. Indeed Ramdev had expressed global aspirations for yoga and perhaps Patanjali. “My vision for the next 50 years is that all [the] world do yoga” he said with a smile and a sweeping flourish of his arms. “I will go everywhere . . . Western country Eastern country Muslim country Christian country. I will do yoga for all!” The Indian government also promoted yoga and related practices both domestically and internationally and had persuaded the United Nations to declare June 2 2015 as the first International Yoga Day. Indeed yoga was growing in developed countries. The number of yoga practitioners in the United States had increased to more than 36 million up from 20.4 million in 2012. Reportedly these practitioners spent $16 billion on yoga classes clothing equipment and accessories. Perhaps with an eye on such potential Patanjali was reportedly in discussions with Amazon to sell its products through Amazon’s e-commerce portal in nine countries including the United States the United Kingdom and Japan which together accounted for 300 million Amazon shoppers.The market in developed countries also included consumers living in poverty who might be a good target for Patanjali’s low-price and high-quality products. The poverty rate in the United States stood at 13.5 per cent in 2015 (i.e. 43.1 million people living in poverty) and income inequality in the United States had been rising for nearly 30 years. Rising income inequalities in developed countries had been noted by many agencies including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the World Bank Group and the World Economic Forum.While these trends appeared to favour Patanjali’s expansion into American or other Western countries these markets differed vastly from India’s markets. Perhaps Patanjali’s strengths were better aligned with the Indian subcontinent. Commenting on Patanjali’s international aspirations Ramdev said “We have already set up our units in Nepal and Bangladesh and our products have reached the Middle East and became popular in some of the countries including Saudi Arabia.”  Reports also indicated that Patanjali was setting up a unit in Jharkhand to export to China Myanmar and Bangladesh. Revealing what could be Patanjali’s strategy for the international market Ramdev said “We should be concentrating in poor countries as the profits from those countries will be utilised for development work there itself.” Swadeshi JeansBy 2016 most of Patanjali’s growth had come from adding more products for the Indian market. Ramdev saw the next step for Patanjali as entering the clothing and textile segment with the introduction of blue jeans. He said “We will make men’s and women’s wear not just traditional Indian clothing but also modern wear like jeans for example. Just because I am a baba does not mean we cannot marry modernity with spirituality we can make let’s say desi jeans.”While details about Patanjali’s swadeshi jeans were still emerging Balkrishna said:Jeans is a western concept and there are two things we can do with western concepts. Either boycott them or adopt them but customise them to suit our traditions. Jeans have become so popular that they cannot be taken away from the Indian society. Swadeshi jeans will be Indianised jeans in style design and fabric. . . . Denim jeans that people wear these days come from abroad or are manufactured here by western companies. They are all based on designs and cultural patterns of foreign countries. These are not suited to Indian culture. Our jeans will be similar to many Indian clothes. This will make Indian women feel comfortable too.Reportedly Patanjali planned to employ a team of designers specializing in Indian wear. Because textile manufacturing was scale-sensitive it was unlikely that Patanjali would fabricate its own denim or contract directly with cotton farmers. Patanjali could fabricate their jeans in-house but had already been approached by several companies interested in manufacturing their swadeshi jeans. Where the jeans would be distributed and sold had not been announced.The retail sales value of the Indian jeans market was growing at over 15 per cent per year and had reached $2.3 billion with projections of $3 billion for 2020. The market for women’s jeans represented 24 per cent of the total market but was growing more rapidly than the market for men’s jeans. Jeans in the super-premium segment and branded jeans were experiencing the fastest growth while sales of cheaper economy jeans had decreased approximately 6 per cent in the five years between 2010 and 2015. The market was highly fragmented with the leading brand Levi’s achieving a share of only 5.8 per cent (see Exhibit 7). Other popular brands included Killer Lee Wrangler Zara and Flying Machine. India was a major producer of cotton and denim and all the major brands were made from Indian denim and fabricated in India. Of the top 10 Indian jean brands four were from MNCs five were from Indian companies and one was from a joint venture between a major Indian company and a foreign corporation.The popularity of yoga pants and leggings was increasing which led to the launch of stretch jeans and jeans that combined high quality or style with comfort. Some of these new jeans gaining in popularity were Shape Keeper by Wrangler with stretch denim; Magma Fusion by Lee which contained volcanic crystals; and classic Slim Fit jeans by Levi’s. Jeans were expected to remain popular in India due to a trend of Westernization among urban youth rising disposable income and growth of the organized retail sector and e-commerce. Blue Jeans and BeyondAccording to Ramdev jeans might only be the start: suits shirts pants and other clothing were also possibilities for Patanjali. If Patanjali could turn blue jeans into swadeshi jeans it might enter other consumer goods businesses such as shoes personal accessories or even the home furnishings and furniture market. It seemed there was no end to the businesses Patanjali might enter in India. In addition it seemed there were many other countries Patanjali might expand to. With little or no effort it had already seen its products reach distant international markets. It might not be far-fetched for it to actively enter those markets and fulfill its global ambitions.Exhibit 1: Patanjali-Affiliated Charities and other OrganizationsNote: Panchagavya referred to five cow products: three directly obtained from cows (i.e. milk dung and urine) and two derived from cow’s milk (i.e. curd and ghee).

The upcoming Medibank initial public offering (IPO) was set to be one of Australia’s largest and was expected to generate more than $4 billion from shareholders who were keen to snap up a piece of the country’s largest private health insurer. Because Gardner was new to the deal her supervisor gave her access to his notes and directed her to her business school’s Bloomberg terminals. As she read through this material Gardner wondered about some important questions: What was Medibank worth? Which valuation methods should she use? Introduction to the DealIn November 2014 the Australian government was in the process of selling Medibank Private Limited through an initial public offering of all common shares. Medibank was Australia’s largest private health insurer with a 29 per cent share of the $19 billion market. Investors were eager to get a piece of what was predicted to be one of the biggest IPOs in Australia since Telstra and Queensland Rail National. Highly anticipated pricing of Medibank was underway and consumers were awaiting the final results before the arrival of the release date. With demand set to be strong the retail offer opened with projections of more than 750000 pre-registrations by members of the Australian public bringing increased competition to the private health insurance (PHI) industry. For the past few weeks Gardner had been collecting her data and key valuation assumptions based on how the company had been performing under the government’s watch. Medibank was a leader in a market that was just starting to tap into its scale advantage. For the success of the selling strategy and for the future success of the company in the current market it was important to present potential investors of the IPO with a fair value for Medibank and Gardner was eager to provide a reasonable price. Company overviewMedibank was Australia’s largest private health insurer providing services to a total of 3.9 million people. The company was established in 1976 and was operated through the government-run health insurance commission. The Fraser government had initially established Medibank for a combination of reasons including bringing greater competition to the PHI sector. When the Australian government initially announced its intention to sell Medibank questions arose concerning legal issues related to the fund but an Australian parliamentary report determined that while the government “clearly ‘owns’ Medibank the fund itself is best characterized as a government-controlled not-for-profit entity (not strictly owned by either the Commonwealth or the fund members).” Medibank’s aim was to provide competitive health insurance coverage and create a reliable brand that consumers could trust among the various options in the private health industry. Dominating the oligopoly market in 2014 Medibank had a 29.5 per cent share in the national PHI market. The company had a strong capital position and a well-rounded reputable brand supported by the government after acquiring AHM Health Insurance (AHM) in January 2009. Medibank had a strong focus on customer acquisition and retention competitive pricing customer service product innovation and sustaining its competitive advantage in the market. Employing more than 3400 people the company operated throughout Australia with a limited presence in New Zealand and Singapore. Medibank was owned and operated by the Australian government’s Health Insurance Commission until 1998 when it was transferred to Medibank Private Limited which had the government as its sole shareholder. Operating in a heavily regulated industry Australian health insurers typically produced stable and defensive earnings and Medibank looked to be heading in the right direction to produce solid long-term earnings and growth potential. Beginning in 2009 Medibank made a number of acquisitions both to provide an alternative to its premium-brand Medibank offering and to aid its expansion into adjacent health services. First in January 2009 Medibank acquired AHM an affordable PHI offering that catered to a different demographic than did Medibank’s premium product offering. In 2013 Medibank repositioned AHM to utilize fast-growing comparison website distribution channels that would deliver Medibank a younger demographic. In July 2012 Medibank and AHM merged into a single unit. Second in April 2009 Medibank merged with Health Services Australia which was also government-owned thereby bringing Medibank into the health management sector. The main component was the immigration contract which provided pre-migration visa health screening. However in February 2014 Medibank lost this contract to a competitor and the division had to be handed over to a new supplier. Finally in July 2010 Medibank acquired McKesson and Carepoint which developed and evolved into the company’s main complementary services division. McKesson and Carepoint was one of Australia’s largest tele-health and rehabilitative health services. Medibank business modelMedibank’s core business involved the underwriting and distribution of PHI policies through its two brands Medibank and AHM. This dual brand strategy was meant to help insulate market share by appealing to different market segments. Medibank was forecasted to generate 90 per cent of its pro forma fiscal year (FY) 2015 revenue from its health insurance business (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3) which offered hospital coverage and extra coverage to customers in Australia as well as health insurance to overseas visitors and students. Policyholders paid premiums for insurance coverage for which Medibank would provide reimbursements for qualifying healthcare costs under the holder’s policy. Aside from its insurance operations Medibank further served the healthcare industry by providing a limited range of complementary services that accounted for approximately 10 per cent of its FY 2014 revenue. These offerings encompassed a range of ancillary services that were seen as beneficial to Medibank’s health insurance business such as online and telephone-based health services and alternative insurance products including pet coverage travel coverage and life insurance coverage. Like most insurance companies Medibank was also able to generate significant income from its portfolio of investment assets. In becoming a publicly listed company Medibank’s objectives would inevitably involve the maxim of shareholder value creation. In light of this goal the company revised its strategy to emphasize five key focus areas: expanding revenue growth improving underwriting margins enhancing operations building and utilizing core competencies and investing in its people (see Exhibit 4). Medibank’s revised strategy which centred around cost and claim efficiencies was starting to deliver claims initiatives thus enabling Medibank to buck the industry trend of declining gross margins and to increase its health insurance net margin to 4.4 per cent. MEdibank Private: Private Health InsuranceIn Australia public healthcare was free to all eligible Australian patients; however those who held PHI could choose between being treated in a private hospital and being treated as a private patient in a public hospital. PHI also gave these patients their choice of practitioner and the chance to avoid or reduce any waiting periods. Further policyholders were entitled to ambulance services which were not provided free of charge to public policy holders as well as dental examinations and other therapies. The PHI industry faced strict regulation under the National Health Act 1953 with the Private Health Insurance Administration Council supervising 38 market providers. While it was a market leader in the PHI market Medibank’s administrative expenses remained above the industry average from 2012 to 2014 with a management expense ratio of 8.7 per cent in FY 2014 (see Exhibit 5). With strong industry growth in the PHI sector projections of five-year growth of 8 per cent were expected to reach $147 billion in healthcare costs as healthcare costs outpaced tax revenue. Policyholder growth for the PHI sector continued to increase steadily at 8.4 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2003–2014 exceeding the 7.9 per cent CAGR rise in healthcare expenditures over the same period (see Exhibit 6). However claims on PHI policies kept pace and grew at 8.3 per cent largely eroding the gains produced by an expansion in policyholders. Medibank itself exhibited a claims expense representing 87.4 per cent of FY 2014 revenue.Australian healthcare IndustryThe Australian healthcare industry was an integral part of the Australian economy representing approximately 9.5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011–2012. The Australian healthcare industry consisted of public and private organizations that provided healthcare services to consumers. Historically the Australian private health insurance industry had been subject to a high degree of subsidization at a national level notably through a national private health insurance rebate. Because they were heavily subsidized by the Commonwealth government insurance premiums for consumers could be kept low and coverage could be expanded to larger populations. As of September 30 2014 the PHI industry comprised 34 private health insurers which were generally categorized by membership criteria and profit status. Such services included medical treatment hospital services medications and other related services. The key drivers of PHI premium revenue included policy volumes premium rate increases and coverage downgrades. Rising policyholder volumes had increased alongside a significant rise in average premiums with approximately 55.2 per cent of all Australians possessing some form of PHI in June 2014. Medibank Private accounted for roughly one-third of this number. The PHI industry generated approximately $19.3 billion in PHI premium revenue in 2014 and had grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.4 per cent since 2004. Australia’s high PHI participation rate stemmed from the government’s use of financial incentives that were administered through the tax system such as the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) and the Lifetime Health Cover (LHC). Australia’s population had been one of the fastest growing among the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This population was also aging with a high proportion of people aged 65 and older representing approximately 14.7 per cent of the population in June 2014. This structural shift in the population was supported by increasing wealth per capita; Australia had a relatively high GDP per capita and its median wealth rate was one of the highest in the world.The PHI industry was relatively concentrated and competitive with the top three private health insurers accounting for 67 per cent of principal policyholders nationally (see Exhibit 7). The structure of the industry had changed over the decade ending in 2014 when the industry had experienced consolidations demutualization and conversion of not-for-profit to for-profit private health insurers. The industry faced some other key concerns including government objectives health policies technology advancements and consumer needs and trends.The government put these incentives in place to lessen the healthcare costs that it had to fund directly. In 2013 total healthcare expenditure stood at approximately $147 billion of which around 68 per cent was funded by the government (federal and state) with the balance accounted for by individuals and organizations (24 per cent) and the PHI industry (8 per cent). Looking ahead it seemed reasonable to expect that funding pressures would continue to rise as the population aged and people lived longer.With around 90 per cent of Medibank’s pro forma FY 2015 revenue expected to come directly from the PHI market this longer-term thematic was very much applicable to the company and provided the basis for future growth. To that end the extent to which the company sustained or increased its market leadership position would ultimately depend on its ability to acquire and retain policyholders at a rate in excess of the underlying market.In this regard the company’s PHI growth strategy involved the operation of two distinct brands: the premium brand (Medibank Private) and the budget brand (AHM). While the premium brand was distributed through the company’s retail locations call centres website and third-party brokers the budget brand was distributed through comparison websites Medibank’s own website and a call centre. The company generated its PHI revenue from insurance premiums paid by policyholders for hospital coverage and from extras coverage. The balance (around 10 per cent) of Medibank’s revenue was derived from the provision of services that were complementary to the core business. These offerings included contracted health management services for government and corporate clients online and telephone-based health services and the distribution of travel life and pet insurance products provided by third parties. Economic and MArket conditionsThe Australian market had experienced its ups and downs in the three years preceding 2014. Over the same period despite higher volumes of listings several IPOs had failed spectacularly—for example education provider Vocation Limited “VET” on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). However the health industry had strong potential for future success and long-term growth given the prevailing market environment. The nation’s aging population promised to generate sustained demand for secure health services. With respect to demographics over the two-decade period ending June 2014 the median population age had increased by four years to reach 37.3 years. This changing population structure could foreseeably bring with it higher demand for health services from individuals in higher age brackets from which Medibank benefited both as an insurer and to a lesser extent as a provider. In periods of low interest rates as an alternative to fixed-income instruments investors could turn towards investments that provided steady yields through dividend payments; Medibank itself proposed to offer a dividend between 4.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent. In 2014 the market saw a brief resurgence in Australian government bond yields from 2013 levels; however a declining trend emerged that could increase the appeal of dividend-paying stocks if it persisted. Economic conditions in Australia could have encouraged an increase in competition either from domestic or overseas competitors. These factors in turn could affect Medibank Private’s financial performance and growth prospects due to the increased ability the company might have to access capital markets. Pre-SaleIn going public Medibank’s goal was to become a publicly traded company on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX: MPL) and provide an opportunity for the Commonwealth (the government) to sell down its entire shareholding in MPL. In turn Medibank would be afforded commercial independence through privatization and would gain access to capital markets for future capital raisings through the stock exchange. At the same time the Commonwealth would retain its role as a regulator of the PHI industry but relinquish its ownership role. The proceeds from the offer would be reinvested back into the company for productivity enhancement. The pre-sale included offers for both retail and institutional investors worth nearly US$660 million. Offering a pre-registration made Medibank appear more attractive to prospective investors an aspect that represented a concern for Gardner who wondered whether all the hype from the media would result in an oversubscription in the stock. The pre-sale presented many unknown factors to investors who had no idea how many shares were going to be offered at what price or what the likely return would be on those shares. That level of uncertainty would be cause for concern for prospective investors.Medibank Price TalkMedibank decided that 2754 million shares would form the offer through the ASX a total of 100 per cent of total shares on issue. The federal government placed an indicative price range on the offer of $1.55 to $2 per share. On the forecasts for Medibank’s FY 2015 earnings an earnings multiple of 16.5 to 21.3 times and a dividend yield of 4.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent were implied by the price range. This price band was fairly wide (i.e. 30 per cent) and brought with it some noteworthy implications given the uncertainty over the price that investors would end up paying.The offering price was to be determined following a book-building process by agreement among the underwriters the vendor and Medibank on the price discrimination date which was expected to be November 25 2014. Medibank had forecasted fully franked dividends of 4.9 cents per share to be paid starting September 2015 with an implied FY 2015 dividend yield of 4.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Based on the indicative price range provided the Commonwealth could expect to raise between $4269 million and $5508 million for 100 per cent of Medibank’s equity. Additionally going public provided a way for Medibank to position the company within the current market and get its name out to potential investors. It was also a strategic way for the company to increase customer loyalty and its overall public image through brand recognition. Going public gave Medibank an opportunity to attract other companies to evaluate it for potential mergers and acquisitions as a way to achieve synergies and increase overall shareholder value. ValuationTo determine the worth of the business in relation to the price range specified Gardner had to perform a valuation. The equity valuation encompassed both a fundamental valuation using a discounted cash flow model and a relative valuation using multiples from listed Australian health insurers (see Exhibit 8). Gardner also made some further assumptions concerning weighted average cost of capital inputs (see Exhibit 9).Making a DecisionOnce Gardner had collected all the necessary information and data she had some difficult choices to make. Although the company’s future appeared promising it was unclear how the company would be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the current market while at the same time managing to please shareholders and customers. Could the necessary changes be made to the company simply because of its listing on the ASX? The government faced a difficult position by having to price the securities in a manner that balanced investor demand against the need to generate satisfactory returns for the state. The government obviously wanted the float to be successful and in order for that to happen a reasonable valuation price would be required. As well Medibank was looking at expanding into travel pet and life insurance to provide its clients with a variety of options and also to serve as a potential growth strategy. Although Medibank currently dominated the market share Gardner had her doubts about the investment largely because of investors’ high expectations of future performance and the company’s aggressive growth strategy. Gardner was skeptical about the hype surrounding the IPO but she felt that the state of the current market and Medibank’s market position might provide a basis for the success of the company after its listing. However she questioned the firm’s ability to maintain a sustainable position in the long term in the face of increased demands and scrutiny from shareholders. For these reasons Gardner wondered whether Medibank constituted a worthwhile investment.Exhibit 1: MEDIBANK BALANCE SHEET AS AT JUNE 30 2014 (amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand; APIC = additional paid-in capital.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 2: Medibank’s HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENTS FOR YEARS ENDED JUNE 30(amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand; * “Other operating expenses” includes depreciation and amortization figures as per cash flow statement.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 3: medibank’s HISTORICal CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2014(amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 4: MEDIBANK PRIVATE STRATEGIC FOCUS AREASSource: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 5: Medibank’s MANAGEMENT EXPENSE RATIOS PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRYSource: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 6: TOTAL AUSTRALIA HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE FY03–FY13Note: All dollar amounts are in Australian dollars; US$1 = AU$1.1796 on November 30 2014.Source: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 7: TOP 10 Private Health Insurance INDUSTRY MARKET SHARE IN AUSTRALIA ","[{""start"":1092,""end"":1107,""text"":""Brianne Gardner"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1550,""end"":1558,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1719,""end"":1727,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2649,""end"":2657,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3079,""end"":3087,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17031,""end"":17039,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19101,""end"":19109,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19331,""end"":19339,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19463,""end"":19471,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20433,""end"":20441,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20593,""end"":20601,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20980,""end"":20988,""text"":""Gardner "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1188,""end"":1198,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2211,""end"":2221,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4597,""end"":4607,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8291,""end"":8301,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6760,""end"":6770,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11990,""end"":12000,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15879,""end"":15889,""text"":""Australia "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1578,""end"":1582,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1598,""end"":1602,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1635,""end"":1639,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1642,""end"":1646,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2677,""end"":2681,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20445,""end"":20449,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Meanwhile the stock price of MSIL kept increasing amidst robust financial performance from the company (see Exhibits 1 and 2). In the annual general meeting of MSIL held on September 4 2015 R. C. Bhargava the chairman of MSIL attributed the delay to amendments in the Companies Act 2013 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India requirements. On October 27 2015 MSIL finally sent a letter to all shareholders asking them to vote on the proposal announced by the board in 2014. The shareholders were given the option to either cast their vote electronically or send a postal ballot form by December 15 2015 at the latest. According to the letter sent to shareholders MSIL would enter into two related-party transactions with Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG). First SMG would manufacture cars and supply them to MSIL on a no-profit-no-loss basis for an initial period of 15 years. Second SMG would pay yearly lease rental of ₹49.9 million to MSIL for using the land owned by MSIL. MSIL management tried reaching out to institutional investors prior to the shareholders’ voting. In August 2014 MSIL hired Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited and Axis Capital Holdings Limited two investment banking firms to persuade the minority shareholders to vote for the proposal. Management also planned roadshows in Gujarat to explain the details of the plan and its benefits to MSIL to institutional shareholders. The proxy firm advisers were still not convinced of the benefits of the proposed structure. Hetal Dalal of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) in a letter dated November 24 2015 urged the minority shareholders to vote against the proposal. Dalal argued that SMC’s earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was lower than that of MSIL and that it had never made any business sense for SMC to operate the Gujarat plant. MSIL also had a large surplus of funds and the company would find it difficult to achieve the same return on equity that it had achieved earlier. According to Dalal’s letter MSIL would lose control of the company to SMC and the proposal was against the interests of the minority shareholders of MSIL. The minority shareholders needed to decide on their course of action before December 15 2015. They could either vote in favour of the proposal—in which case SMC would operate SMG as a 100 per cent subsidiary—or they could vote against the proposal. If the majority voted against the proposal MSIL would operate the Gujarat plant as its own division. This was what the market had expected prior to January 2014. The minority shareholders could also simply vote with their feet by selling their shares. According to the amended versions of Section 188 of the Companies Act 2013 and Clause 49 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India listing agreement MSIL needed the permission of only a majority (more than 50 per cent) of the minority shareholders. While Section 188 was amended in May 2015 Clause 49 was amended in September 2015 (see Exhibit 3).MSIL stock closed at ₹4449 on October 31 2015. The analysts were expecting a long-term growth rate of 21.25 per cent from MSIL around this time (see Exhibit 4).

Cornhill chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of AltaGas Ltd. (AltaGas)—an energy infrastructure business focused on natural gas power and regulated utilities—was looking to expand the company’s operations into the United States. He was specifically interested in entering the U.S. renewable energy market with the purchase of Decker Energy International Inc. (DEI). Cornhill stated:Acquiring DEI will provide AltaGas with an opportunity to enter the U.S. green energy market with fully contracted assets.

The move into renewables and into the United States would be a departure for AltaGas which was primarily focused on traditional energy and infrastructure businesses in Canada. “I’d like to see how well the proposed purchase aligns with our strategic objectives” said Thomas Campbell the financial lead on the project. “Along with our assumptions we need to consider the business environment the competitive environment and whether DEI is a sound fit for us.”Campbell added: “I’m wondering if there are any other potential buyers for DEI. To whom can they sell this asset in the market? I believe that there are only a small number of players in the market able and willing to purchase DEI.” Campbell continued to evaluate the acquisition by taking a look at the latest information on the biomass energy market. Biomass as a Renewable Energy SourceBiomass was a relatively new renewable energy source. Biomass power plants produced electricity by combusting wood waste from sources such as urban construction sites that would have otherwise gone to landfills and forest waste. These waste woods could otherwise contribute to forest fires and greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass as a fuel could be classified as carbon neutral because biomass power plants in producing power burned off the methane component of carbon. Biomass power plants were slowly beginning to emerge in the renewable energy sector. One drawback was that the investment required to build these plants was large. Also with low natural gas prices the most efficient way to harness biomass power production was to locate plants as close to wood waste fuel sources as possible.AltaGas HistoryFounded in 1994 AltaGas was a diverse energy infrastructure firm with a market capitalization of about CA$4.5 billion in late 2011. There were three distinct business units: gas power and utilities. The gas business revolved around field gathering processing natural gas liquid extraction transmission and storage. Its operations managed over two billion cubic feet in Canada per day. The power business encompassed over 560 megawatts (MW) of generation from a combination of fuel types such as coal hydro wind and natural gas. The utilities business was geographically diverse with customers in Alberta British Columbia Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories. A proposed acquisition of SEMCO ENERGY Gas Company (SEMCO) would further diversify the utility business into Michigan and Alaska.Each AltaGas business unit operated independently with the company as a whole benefiting from a diversified portfolio of commodities and geographies. There were complementary effects as well with growth in one business leading to opportunities in adjacent segments. The financial contribution of each business unit was clear (see Exhibit 1). “Our strategy is to capitalize on the supply and demand for natural gas and power by owning and operating assets in gas power and utilities in places that provide a strategic competitive advantage” said Cornhill. “We operate physical assets and provide essential services to customers who produce and consume natural gas and power.” Key to the company’s risk management was signing long-term offtake agreements for its energy products. The agreements allowed it to achieve stable earnings and cash flow which supported its dividend growth strategy.In 2012 AltaGas was focusing its growth on the power business. The intent was to explore increasing the portfolio’s capacity with clean power sources such as gas-fired generation wind run-of-river and biomass. One option was to look at power markets and assets in the United States given the strength of the Canadian dollar. In 2011 all AltaGas assets were in Canada principally in Alberta.Industry AnalysisAltaGas had focused on growing in the Alberta power market. This market consisted of multiple generation companies that owned physical assets or the rights to generation from assets in the form of power purchase agreements (PPAs). In 2001 Alberta de-regulated power generation and was the first province to operate with a spot market and hourly prices. The market structure was such that generators sold into the hourly wholesale electricity market known as the Alberta Power Pool and were paid according to where the market price settled. Alternatively there was an active financial market where forward swaps were traded among generators banks and hedge funds. Consumers were able to purchase power at prices that floated with the hourly market rate or lock in prices at residential load rates. Active companies in the Alberta Power Pool included a range of companies—from Capital Power Corporation with a market capitalization of $1.5 billion to TransCanada Corporation with a market capitalization of $32.1 billion. Many companies in the power pool were also active in gas markets distribution and processing. Others such as ATCO Power Ltd. were focused primarily on power transmission and distribution. In addition many Alberta power companies were beginning to expand their presence not only across Canada but also the United States and in some instances internationally. As legislation around clean energy progressed corporations that had expertise in operating renewable projects saw an opportunity to expand across borders (see Exhibit 2).Decker Energy International OpportunityIn the fall of 2011 a U.S.-based energy business broker contacted AltaGas’s vice-president of Business Development—Power regarding an investment opportunity in the U.S. market. McCauley “Mike” Whiting a Princeton graduate and co-founder president and CEO of DEI was actively looking for a buyer for his company. A recent bid had been approved but the deal did not close due to financing problems on the buyer’s side. Considering the illiquid nature of the market for power generation assets Whiting was willing to sell DEI at the same price of US$34.8 million as long as financing could be quickly put in place. AltaGas learned that DEI had partial ownership in two operating biomass facilities—Craven County Wood Energy (Craven) in North Carolina and Grayling Generating Station (Grayling) in Michigan—as well as a permitted development project in Georgia. As part of the acquisition AltaGas would receive approximately US$4.8 million in production tax credits (PTCs). PTCs were generated by renewable projects but for DEI these PTCs had gone unused due to reduced profits in the past few years. The PTCs could be used to offset project or corporate U.S. income. In the fall of 2011 AltaGas was already moving into the United States with the purchase of SEMCO its U.S subsidiary. SEMCO renamed AltaGas Services (U.S.) Inc. (AGUS) focused on regulated gas distribution in Michigan. AGUS would begin paying U.S. corporate taxes shortly and the opportunity to purchase DEI would allow AGUS to take advantage of the PTCs. “U.S. tax law allows for a consolidated tax return so all of the subsidiaries under AGUS would be treated as a single taxable entity” stated an AGUS finance manager.The AltaGas finance team looked at DEI’s Craven and Grayling assets (see Exhibit 3).Craven County Wood EnergyDEI had a 50 per cent flow-through working interest in a 48 MW wood biomass power facility in Craven County North Carolina. The other 50 per cent was owned by CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy) a Michigan-based firm focused on utility operations. There was a PPA in place through 2017 with Progress Energy Inc. an electric power holding company recently purchased by North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corporation. DEI indicated that there was a high likelihood the PPA would be renewed after 2017. Craven’s chief fuel supply was waste wood. The source for the approximately 550000 tons of waste wood per year would come from a variety of sources around Craven. The fuel included wood chips forestry residue bark sawdust and railroad ties. Craven had been operating with availability above 90 per cent indicating that it was inoperable for less than 10 per cent of the time. Grayling Generating StationDEI had a 30 per cent flow-through working interest in a 37 MW wood biomass power facility in Grayling Township Michigan. The other 70 per cent was owned by CMS Energy. Grayling had a PPA in place through June 2027 with Consumers Energy the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy. As part of this PPA Consumers Energy had the right to economically dispatch the plant—to adjust or turn off the plant as a result of changing demand. As economically dispatching a plant would lead to lower generation output there was a contract feature that allowed for a “capacity payment” to Grayling as compensation. AltaGas estimated that the odds of Grayling being economically dispatched were very low.Grayling’s supply of fuel consisted of approximately 350000 tons of wood waste per year from a variety of sources including forestry products firms such as Weyerhaeuser Company and AJD Forest Products LP and sawmill and forestry residue. The plant also burned approximately 5000 tons per year of rubber-tire-derived fuel. Waste from the plant in the form of ash was disposed of in a nearby landfill. Grayling was included as a renewable energy facility under Michigan’s Renewable Portfolio Standard legislation which was passed in 2008. Under this law 20 per cent of renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated were kept by Grayling and 80 per cent went to Consumers Energy. The benefits of these RECs were included in the projections created for Grayling. Grayling was named Power Plant of the Year in 1992 by POWER magazine and had historical availability of over 96 per cent as well as an exceptional safety record. Fitzgerald (Georgia Development Project)AltaGas would acquire the rights to a permitted site for a 60 MW forest wood biomass development that was 100 per cent owned by DEI. For the purposes of the acquisition analysis AltaGas did not attempt to value the option to develop Fitzgerald.Reviewing the IssuesThe AltaGas finance team was reviewing the various aspects of the deal. In terms of having a brand-name acquisition the team believed that DEI met the criteria. DEI was a known and reputable name in biomass in terms of both operating standards and safety. Safety was an AltaGas core value; therefore ensuring new assets were in line with best operating and safety practices was a key factor in any acquisition and just as important as the financial valuation. Whiting was a well-known executive in the U.S. power industry and was an acquaintance of AltaGas president David Harris. As part of the sale process the energy broker requested a finder’s fee of US$900000 for the exclusive opportunity to evaluate and purchase DEI. Proposed Purchase of DEICampbell noted: “We want to take into account financial metrics such as the value of DEI the payback period and the impact on AltaGas financials especially earnings per share post-acquisition.” As such there were several issues he had to address with regard to DEI’s forecast performance. The first was whether AltaGas should assume that plant availability and operating capacity would remain the same as it had been in the past. Craven’s PPA was about to expire in 2017 and the DEI team believed it could be renewed in 2017 with annual price increases per megawatt hours of 2.5 per cent through 2031. Campbell wondered how conservative he should be with that figure if at all. Second an eight-year major maintenance cycle was anticipated which would result in availability of about 90 per cent on average per year. The financial forecasts for both Craven and Grayling took this 90 per cent level of availability into consideration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Campbell assumed that a similar cycle and availability rate would be maintained going forward. He wondered if this assumption would be reasonable.With regard to both plants assembling a steady flow of biomass materials was key to ensuring that the plant did not shut down. At Grayling fuel costs varied slightly more but were within a reasonable amount. Grayling’s PPA was set to expire in 2020 with a major plant overhaul set for 2020. At Craven which was permitted to burn a range of biomass materials such as waste wood poultry litter and railroad ties annual fuel costs had been consistent year over year since 2011. One of the assumptions in the acquisition price was that Craven would be able to burn railroad ties at US$7.00 per ton compared to approximately US$20.00 per ton for green wood. In addition to costing less railroad ties generated more British thermal units (BTUs) per ton than green wood at 6500 BTUs compared to 4704 BTUs. However no railroad tie agreement was in place as of yet. Campbell wondered how to tackle this point of uncertainty. If Craven was unable to secure railroad ties for fuel the net impact would be lost savings over 19 years assuming an 8 per cent discount rate which was AltaGas’s cost of capital.Craven according to its management team was also forecasting productivity savings—separate from the railroad ties opportunity—to yield reductions in overall fuel costs from 2012 through 2014. These reductions could be seen in the financial forecast. “We’re targeting an after-tax unlevered IRR of greater than 10 per cent” said Campbell. “Can we achieve this with our proposed acquisition of DEI?” Campbell wanted to compare the DEI opportunity with AltaGas’s current power portfolio and consider AltaGas balance sheets income statements and statement of cash flows (see Exhibits 6 7 and 8). While the opportunity to move into biomass power production was appealing Campbell wanted to ensure that AltaGas was making a financially prudent decision.Exhibit 1: AltaGas—Composition by Segment (IN CA$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: AltaGas Canadian competitors (in Ca$ Billions)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 3: Craven county wood energy and Grayling generating stationSource: Company documents.Exhibit 4: Craven—Forecast Performance (in thousands of US$)Note: MWh = megawatt hour; EBITDA = earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization; EBT = earnings before taxSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 5: Grayling—Forecast Performance (in thousands of US$)Note: MWh = megawatt hour; EBITDA = earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization; EBT = earnings before taxSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 6: AltaGas—Balance Sheets (in Ca$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 7: AltaGas—Income Statements (IN CA$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 8: AltaGas—Statements of Cash Flows (in Ca$)Source: Company documents.","[{""start"":994,""end"":1011,""text"":""David W.

Vu who was TEKCOM’s chief executive officer had good reasons to be proud of his company’s achievements. Established in 2005 TEKCOM had moved from being an import company distributing construction materials for the domestic market to becoming a leading manufacturer of film-faced plywood (FFP) in Vietnam. TEKCOM was one of the largest Vietnamese manufacturers of FFP with an export market share of 55 per cent. For over two hours the TEKCOM board of directors had deliberated intensely on the future of TEKCOM with no clear consensus. The business environment in Vietnam had changed and new opportunities were beckoning. As a high performance company TEKCOM was determined to grow. From 2013 to 2016 TEKCOM had seen annual average growth in both revenue and gross profit at 50 per cent and 73 per cent respectively. Expansion opportunities for FFP still existed in Vietnam but its growth was expected to plateau over the next three to five years. Entering new markets with new products would enable TEKCOM to grow but the payoff was uncertain. TEKCOM’s challenge in securing raw materials for FFP production was becoming critical. Obtaining raw materials was a major factor in determining growth in this industry. As Vu walked back to the meeting table he wondered whether TEKCOM should focus on improving its current core FFP offerings or seize the opportunity to enter new markets with new products. The risks and trade-offs involved in pursuing either option could be drastic and complex. He would need the advice of his senior colleagues to reach the right decision.Background of TEKCOMIn 2005 Vu and two partners founded Ky Thuong Company Limited (Ky Thuong) a trading company for insulation products in Vietnam. A new trading line of imported FFP from China was added in 2007 for the Vietnamese market. In 2010 Vu and Ich Tuan Hoang merged several Ky Thuong entities and called the new joint-stock company TEKCOM Corporation. Business was brisk and TEKCOM experienced double-digit growth from 2005 to 2011. By 2010 95 per cent of FFP used in Vietnam was imported from China primarily for the construction industry. Sensing the growth in demand for higher quality FFP to support the local construction boom the founders decided to venture into FFP production in 2011. Raw materials for making plywood were not readily available and there were only two plywood manufacturers in Vietnam. Therefore a key supporting strategy was identifying and cultivating a supplier base of raw materials.Investors were initially concerned with TEKCOM’s ability to transform from trading company to manufacturer. The transition period was indeed difficult. TEKCOM encountered low labour productivity supply disruption high inventory and long lead times. However with discipline teamwork and the mindset of an organization eager for learning and continuous improvement TEKCOM gradually stabilized production and expanded capacity. From 2013 to 2016 production capacity for FFP increased 10-fold from 12000 to 120000 cubic metres. In 2016 TEKCOM’s total sales reached US$30 million with domestic and export markets accounting for 30 and 70 per cent respectively. The founders attributed TEKCOM’s success to its core values of determination integrity teamwork and collaboration.Wood Products Value ChainFrom wood logs (timber) three categories of wood raw materials could be derived: sawn timber wood chip and veneer (see Exhibit 1). Wood logs could either be hardwood (e.g. mahogany birch oak teak or rubberwood) or softwood (e.g. cedar pine redwood or spruce). Veneer was the main raw material for plywood manufacturing.Although Vietnam had large forests to support the manufacturing of wood products local businesses found it difficult to compete with foreign rivals due to Vietnam’s highly fragmented wood-product supply chains. Disjointed supply chains led to high logistics costs and protracted lead times. More than 90 per cent of local wood-product manufacturers were small- and medium-sized enterprises. Most wood-products manufacturers produced raw timber and low-value furniture products for export. Plywood manufacturing constituted only a small percentage of total wood-products manufacturing. Most plywood manufacturers produced low- to mid-range quality plywood for construction applications. Furniture and flooring products required high quality plywood such as fancy plywood (FP) which was not readily available in Vietnam. Therefore manufacturers had to import plywood from overseas suppliers. More than 70 per cent of local wood logs were exported as veneer sawn timber or wood chip. Of the remaining 30 per cent very few were used to make veneer. Therefore local plywood manufacturers such as TEKCOM found it difficult to source local veneer. PlywoodPlywood was commonly categorized by its ability to resist cracking shrinkage splitting twisting and warping. Plywood could be made from softwood or hardwood veneer. Depending on intended use plywood was coated on the surface to give it special properties. For example FFP was commonly used in construction and covered with a special film to increase strength and waterproofness. Other plywood products such as melamine-faced plywood and FP were used to make furniture and flooring.With shifts in the global economy plywood production had moved to new emerging countries due to favourable production costs and increased domestic demand for plywood. Most plywood was manufactured in Asia-Pacific countries such as China Indonesia and Malaysia. Tropical wood species were used as the main raw material in Asian plywood production. China was the world’s largest manufacturer of plywood. European manufacturers tended to focus on producing high-end plywood. The availability of a skilled workforce and large amounts of high-grade plantation forests (in terms of size knots surface smoothness and other factors) in countries such as Finland and Russia were key to advancing the plywood industry in that part of the world. High-end plywood commanded high prices and generated high returns. Korea the Middle East and Europe had leading plywood markets where environmental impact was an important buying factor. For example these markets only purchased plywood with low formaldehyde emissions for flooring and furniture applications. To enter developed markets plywood manufacturers had to provide certifications on quality supply sources and production information. VeneerMost veneer producers in Vietnam were small family businesses. Due to a lack of regulations and forest management knowledge wood-log plantation owners experienced variable harvest size and output quality creating problems for veneer producers in classifying and controlling raw material for plywood manufacturers. Veneer consisted of thin slices of wood usually no thicker than 6 millimetres (mm). Veneer was obtained by peeling the trunk of a tree or slicing blocks of wood. Because the makeup of the wood log varied from the surface to the core of the trunk the peeled veneer would have slightly different properties creating different qualities of veneer. After peeling the veneer slices were classified into A B and C grades and dried. Veneer was graded on criteria such as size smoothness surface quality (i.e. holes or knots) and colour. Multiple layers of veneer were glued together to make plywood. The plywood production process was labour-intensive and required long lead times for pressing trimming sanding film overlay and finishing (see Exhibit 2).Two major considerations in veneer manufacturing were production yield and wood waste utilization. Veneer production yield referred to the percentage of the timber log that could be turned into usable veneer. The remainder of the log or wood waste could be sold to companies to make wood chip products. Otherwise veneer producers would have to incur costs to dispose the wood waste.TEKCOM’s Veneer SuppliersTEKCOM bought veneer from local suppliers in the Binh Duong and Dong Nai provinces. The proximity of these suppliers to the TEKCOM factory helped reduce transportation cost. Most of the veneer supplied to TEKCOM was made from hardwood logs usually rubberwood. Suppliers sold mostly grade A and grade B veneer to TEKCOM and grade C to other plywood producers. TEKCOM used grade A and grade B veneer to make mid-range FFP whereas grade C veneer was used to produce regular FFP which commanded lower prices and offered lower profitability.TEKCOM was a preferred veneer customer for two reasons. First it provided an attractive purchase policy where long-term contracts were signed for the purchase of grade A and grade B veneer with short payment terms. Second TEKCOM had a good supplier development program where TEKCOM provided training to suppliers’ workers and worked with suppliers to improve their management processes. TEKCOM also worked with local banks to support suppliers to upgrade their veneer production facilities. Because wood logs were limited veneer suppliers competed aggressively to secure raw materials which in turn pushed up the price of veneer. Rising veneer prices posed a great challenge for TEKCOM operations and needed to be a key factor in future strategy formulation. To mitigate high veneer prices TEKCOM could raise FFP prices but this would price TEKCOM out of its markets. TEKCOM’s MarketsAlthough FFP came in several different categories TEKCOM offered two variations—mid-range FFP and regular FFP—and sold its product to distributors. In both domestic and overseas markets TEKCOM’s FFP was better known in the mid-range segment because of its higher quality in durability and reusability. TEKCOM avoided the premium FFP segment despite its higher margins because making premium FFP required high-grade veneer which was in scarce supply in Vietnam. In 2016 TEKCOM accounted for 20 per cent of the FFP market share in Vietnam. TEKCOM’s FFP products were also sold in overseas markets such as Turkey the Middle East and South Korea (see Exhibit 3). Entering export markets required high levels of quality safety and environmentally-friendly practices. Therefore TEKCOM worked with independent test organizations to obtain certifications such as ISO 9001 and EU certification of conformity to verify TEKCOM’s use of eco-friendly production practices and responsible forest management.TEKCOM products were widely trusted. Although an anti-dumping tax was imposed on many plywood companies in China and Vietnam TEKCOM was spared because it worked with legal representatives in export markets to provide full information and disclosure to prove that its products were genuinely made by TEKCOM. This enhanced TEKCOM’s competitiveness in export markets.TEKCOM was also an original equipment manufacturer for customers in South Korea and the Middle East which helped TEKCOM not only expand its scale of production and lower production cost but also increase its competitiveness through product and process innovation and market familiarization. TEKCOM also provided value-added services to its customers. Although most FFP manufacturers offered two main FFP sizes (i.e. 1250 × 2500 mm and 1220 × 2440 mm) TEKCOM could deliver FFP to meet specific size requests from customers. This saved customers time and effort to post-process the delivered FFP. Challenges and OpportunitiesA major challenge for TEKCOM was the rising cost of veneer due partly to limited sources of wood logs—70 per cent of Vietnam’s wood logs were exported. In addition recent developments had further reduced the availability of rubber trees for wood log which was TEKCOM’s main source of veneer. TEKCOM’s veneer suppliers who had bought rubber plantations in the southeast and highland areas of Vietnam earned income either by harvesting latex from rubber trees or by cutting down rubber trees for wood log. From 2013 to 2016 global oversupply and limited storage capacity caused natural rubber prices to fall steeply and farmers cut down rubber trees to sell as wood log. During that period prices of rubberwood were relatively low and plywood manufacturers using rubberwood veneer gained advantage from the low cost of raw material. By mid-2016 however most farmers had began to run out of rubber trees that could be harvested as wood log. The suppliers also wanted to keep some rubber trees to hedge against a future rise in demand for latex. Both issues worked together to create a reduction in the supply of rubberwood logs. TEKCOM’s supply problem was also aggravated by increased competition from overseas buyers to purchase wood logs and veneer produced in southern and central Vietnam who used these raw materials to make a wide range of wood products. One strategy that TEKCOM adopted to cope with the limited veneer supply was to redesign production processes to make better use of all grades of veneer. Improvements to the production process allowed TEKCOM to use some grade C veneer to make FFP of a similar quality to grades A and B veneer. This strategy improved the production yield of high quality FFP but it was still not enough to mitigate the general shortage of veneer supply.TEKCOM also looked for new sources for the supply of raw materials. With the scarcity of rubberwood TEKCOM considered making veneer from the Acacia Auriculiformis tree which grew in abundance in the Mekong Delta region. However the veneer manufacturing industry in the Mekong Delta was not well developed. Most wood-product manufacturers there focused on wood-chip and sawn-timber production. Therefore the bulky Acacia Auriculiformis trees would have to be shipped from the Mekong Delta to Ho Chi Minh City in barges and from Ho Chi Minh City to Binh Duong in trucks. This additional transportation raised the cost of making veneer. TEKCOM considered building an FFP factory in the Mekong Delta near the sources of the wood log supply but the lack of veneer manufacturers and suitable labour posed major challenges. Veneer made from Acacia Auriculiformis also tended to be of lower quality. There were also some veneer sources in northern Vietnam but their veneer had more defects and would result in a lower plywood production yield.TEKCOM also considered augmenting local sourcing with overseas supply. Being larger and better organized overseas suppliers from Europe Russia and the United States offered higher quality wood log from which higher quality veneer could be obtained. Grade C veneer from wood imported from these countries was easily as good as grades A and B veneer from local suppliers. Plywood production yields were also better. However importing veneer was expensive. Another option was to vertically integrate by importing wood logs and making veneer in TEKCOM. Initial cost analysis however showed that the higher production yield generated from making veneer this way was not enough to compensate for the cost of importing wood logs and equipping facilities to make veneer (see Exhibit 4). More importantly this option would divert TEKCOM from its core competency in FFP production and would require TEKCOM to build new capabilities.Another challenge TEKCOM was facing was the saturation of domestic demand for FFP. The growth projection of the FFP market in Vietnam over the next three years did not align well with TEKCOM’s growth target especially with the presence of FFP competition. With 70 per cent of total revenue coming from exports TEKCOM could step up its efforts to expand into existing and new overseas FFP markets. Overseas FFP markets were expected to grow steadily but without a stable and reliable veneer supply base it was difficult for TEKCOM to increase production and expand sales. TEKCOM noticed that markets for certain plywood applications like furniture and flooring had been growing rapidly in Vietnam. However these applications used FP made from high-grade veneer which was available only from overseas suppliers and required automated production processes that TEKCOM did not have. A March 2017 incident had forced TEKCOM to seriously review its corporate and market strategy. A sudden surge in back orders triggered by a shortage of veneer had rattled several of TEKCOM’s key customers. Normally back orders could be filled by running the factory at full capacity over a specific period. However the factory’s supply of veneer at the time was so low that it could only operate at a maximum of 50-per-cent capacity. The build-up of back orders was the worst case that TEKCOM had seen in years. Some key customers were so upset that they complained directly to Vu and threatened to take their business elsewhere. Vu realized that the recurring problem of supply disruption required a fresh look and a more robust solution. Because veneer supply was related to the larger issue of growth and sustainability Vu decided to gather senior management to review its strategy and deliberate on how TEKCOM should move ahead.The first strategy meeting was a brainstorming session. Vu raised the possibility of using market and sourcing diversification to mitigate the reliance on local veneer suppliers. Marketing representatives suggested entering the new premium FFP segment in current markets where profit margins were higher. The idea was opposed by the Research and Development and the Operations departments who felt that the order-winning criteria of these markets required TEKCOM to incur additional investment in research and development and acquire more sophisticated production processes and controls including a requirement for special veneer (e.g. veneer made from birch) from overseas suppliers. Conforming to these standards would take time and it was unclear if the higher margins could offset the higher production costs. Operations representatives suggested that TEKCOM should continue to do what it did best—make FFP to serve its current markets. Operations would continue to improve on its production process to increase yield from grade C veneer and look for new veneer sources within Vietnam and the region. Furthermore market consolidation of local FFP players was likely to happen which could allow TEKCOM to increase market share. Vu and the business development department pointed out that it might be an opportune time for TEKCOM to venture into new markets and new products namely FP and medium-density fibreboard (MDF). The FP and MDF markets were already large and continuing to expand compared to the FFP market and the FP and MDF margins were relatively more attractive. Operations representatives raised the concern that FP production required high-grade veneer that could only be sourced from overseas suppliers and would require some automation. MDF production would need an enormous amount of investment in automated production processes. TEKCOM currently focused on labour-intensive operations where it had an advantage in understanding and managing local workers. There were already some companies in Vietnam with large-scale MDF operations who had extensive experience in automation so it would take TEKCOM a long time to catch up to the competition. The first strategy meeting ended with more questions than answers. More meetings were planned to help resolve these questions.THE PATH FORWARDA few meetings later in June 2017 Vu was looking to his senior colleagues across the large mahogany table for advice. Knowing the TEKCOM culture he was aware of the need for buy-in from senior management to influence the rest of the company. He had earlier argued that TEKCOM would need to move beyond a single-product strategy to sustain growth. Entering the FP market with its higher margins could be a good start for TEKCOM to develop its capabilities of introducing new products in new markets. He was aware that TEKCOM’s experience was based only on FFP production. Therefore selling and producing new plywood products was a risky proposition. He was also unsure if TEKCOM could develop the engineering expertise needed to reconfigure its production processes for the manufacture of FFP and other new products. Given the risks Vu wondered how he could convince the investors that this was the right strategy for the company. What if it took so long to build up internal capabilities that the markets changed? How could TEKCOM ensure that it could compete in markets with well-established manufacturers? Could TEKCOM’s culture embrace change? The status quo seemed unsustainable and likely to limit growth. So how should TEKCOM proceed?Exhibit 1: Wood Products		Source: Company files.exhibit 2: Production Process for Film-Faced PlywoodSource: Company files.exhibit 3: TEKCOM’s MarketsDistribution of Markets (in Percentage of Revenue)Market ShareNote: m3 = cubic metreSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: Raw material and product informationPurchase prices and production yieldsNote: All currency amounts are in US$; m3 = cubic metre; FFP = film-faced plywood; * percentage of wood log on average that could be turned into useable veneer; ** percentage of veneer on average that could be converted into FFPSelling prices and marginsNote: All currency amounts are in US$; m3 = cubic metre; FFP = film-faced plywood; MDF = medium-density fibreboardSource: Company files.","[{""start"":987,""end"":999,""text"":""Quang Huy Vu"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1126,""end"":1128,""text"":""Vu"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2343,""end"":2346,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2724,""end"":2727,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2943,""end"":2946,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17619,""end"":17622,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17671,""end"":17674,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17864,""end"":17867,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18029,""end"":18032,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19204,""end"":19207,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20314,""end"":20317,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21112,""end"":21115,""text"":""Vu "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1422,""end"":1429,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1689,""end"":1697,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1991,""end"":1999,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2835,""end"":2842,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3174,""end"":3182,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3508,""end"":3515,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4741,""end"":4749,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5542,""end"":5549,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7569,""end"":7577,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10884,""end"":10891,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10961,""end"":10968,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11542,""end"":11550,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12803,""end"":12811,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13694,""end"":13702,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15145,""end"":15153,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16288,""end"":16296,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16850,""end"":16857,""text"":""Vietnam"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19054,""end"":19062,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19987,""end"":19995,""text"":""Vietnam "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1023,""end"":1026,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":21128,""end"":21131,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20929,""end"":20932,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20779,""end"":20782,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20522,""end"":20525,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20425,""end"":20428,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2618,""end"":2621,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2379,""end"":2382,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

The report indicated that although the company had grown it had grown slowly. However Infosys had set an ambitious goal for the coming years which it referred to as “Vision 2020”—achieve US$20 billion in revenue at a 30 per cent net margin and revenue of $80000 per employee. If Infosys were to realize this goal by 2020 (which had been depicted in the media as a “far-fetched” goal) its 8–9 per cent annual growth had to be improved. To scale up quickly Infosys would need to leverage inorganic growth opportunities such as acquisitions. Infosys had already made nine acquisitions between 2000 and 2016 (see Exhibit 1) but of these two had led to controversy. Lodestone Management Consultants had been bought for $345 million then acknowledged a few years later to have been a bad acquisition. Panaya acquired for a value of $200 million raised questions about the price paid for the acquisition: the month before acquisition Israel Growth Partners valued Panaya at 20 per cent less ($162 million) when they invested $20 million for a 12.31 per cent stake in Panaya. Infosys’ growth plans were also challenged by labour and revenue uncertainty due to changes in the United States’ foreign workers visa policy. The policy had allowed U.S. companies to employ skilled foreign workers to fill certain occupations but the Trump administration had recently changed the system to protect the jobs of U.S. workers by limiting the number of foreign workers with visas. The change was a blow to the U.S. information technology (IT) sector which was particularly dependent on workers from overseas. A drop in output from the American IT sector would affect Infosys because it relied on North America for 65 per cent of its segmental revenues. Infosys had improved its client base and technical knowledge and had expanded geographically with its acquisitions but if Infosys was going to use buyouts and acquisitions as inorganic paths of growth it needed to reconsider its strategy. Which business and geographical segments should the firm invest in and what should be the key determining factors that drive the acquisitions: increased clientele enhanced technology or extended geographical reach? Information TECHNOLOGY and IT-enabled SERVICES IN INDIAIndia was the prime outsourcing country for the IT industry accounting for a market of $154 billion in revenue. Growth in the Indian IT sector was evolving driven more by services than software and that involved human capital and automation. As of 2016 the Indian IT industry employed about 10 million people.Business process outsourcing IT consulting and cloud-based services were becoming more important with every passing day. In a recent press release Gartner Consulting estimated that the cloud services market in India would grow at 35.9 percent and reach a value of approximately $1.3 billion. The improved diffusion of Internet and mobile connections in India’s urban and rural areas coupled with the swift rise of electronic and mobile commerce were driving continued demand for hosting and IT-enabled services in India. The telecom regulatory authority was also planning a rapid expansion based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G (fifth generation mobile services infrastructure) bringing standards on par with those in the developed world. The Indian healthcare IT market was also growing at an unprecedented rate; it was estimated that by 2020 the market would be 1.5 times the size of its then valuation of $1 billion. The IT-enabled finance and payments sector was also undergoing great growth especially after the Indian government demonetized specific currency denominations and invested in resources to upgrade unified payment interfaces. This augmented demand in the IT-enabled finance and health sectors meant increased demand for services and platforms. International players in platform-based businesses and innovative IT tools were entering India and the competition from these international companies (both start-ups and larger firms) was becoming a threat to the domestic Indian IT sector. These international companies included some of the pioneers of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Head Hunters India founder and managing director Kris Lakshmikanth observed this trend and commented:Amidst fears that Indian tech companies haven’t kept pace to make the shift from traditional to cutting-edge technologies to meet customer demands I firmly believe that our top companies including TCS and Infosys just as they made India the outsourcing global giant will lead India in the digital business too.The reach of venture capital private equity angel investments and foreign direct investment had increased significantly in India with a focus on IT-enabled sectors. Foreign investors were motivated to invest in India’s growing digital economy by increased transparency and clear taxation policies. For example a goods and services tax (GST) was introduced as an indirect tax levied throughout India to replace the complex structure of taxes imposed separately by the central and state governments. International technology firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Robert Bosch GmbH were establishing corporate start-up accelerators in India to tap Indian IT talent and the market. Indian IT firms like Tech Mahindra Limited Wipro Limited Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Limited were expanding their offerings beyond their existing capabilities in on-shore and off-shore services. They were using innovation hubs and research and development centres to showcase their leading ideas in natural language processing blockchain technology social media cloud computing analytics and AI for clients. However the international players were moving at a much faster pace in these sectors than their Indian counterparts.INFOSYS LimitedInfosys was a global consulting and IT services company headquartered in Bengaluru India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The company was founded in 1981 by N. R. Narayana Murthy Nandan Nilekani N. S. Raghavan Kris Gopalakrishnan S. D. Shibulal and Ashok Arora with an initial investment of just $250. The chief executive officer in 2017 was Dr. Vishal Sikka. He held a bachelor of science degree in computer science from Syracuse University and a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University. Prior to joining Infosys he had been employed at SAP SE.As of May 2017 Infosys had a market capitalization of $36.2 billion; yearly revenues for fiscal year 2016–17 totalled $10.2 billion (see Exhibit 2). According to the company’s annual report for 2016–17 Infosys had 17 direct subsidiaries 26 step-down subsidiaries and one associate. Its workforce stood at 200364 as of March 31 2017. The company added 6320 employees during 2016–17 and had an attrition rate of 15 per cent. Infosys along with its subsidiaries provided business outsourcing consulting and information technology services to its clients across the globe. Its primary market business segments included financial services; manufacturing; retail consumer packaged goods and logistics; energy utilities and communications and services; hi-tech; and life sciences health care and insurance (see Exhibit 3). Geographical segments of Infosys including on- and off-site locations spanned North America Europe—including Ireland and the United Kingdom—India and the rest of the world.Infosys ACQUITIONS (2000–2016)Infosys was a cash-rich company able to buy out a number of companies (see Exhibits 2–3). Expert Information Services a Melbourne Australia-based company was Infosys’ first acquisition acquired in 2003. The company earned revenues of $34.6 million and made a net profit of $5.2 million during its fiscal year ending June 30 2003. The company specialized in designing building and integrating business solutions and products for medium and large clients across vertical sectors such as telecom financial services retail and government. Infosys paid $22.9 million to acquire 100 per cent of the Expert Information Services’ equity (a buyout deal). The transaction value included an up-front payment of $14.1 million and an earn-out and transition bonus of $8.9 million payable over three years for achieving key financial targets and retaining key employees over a period of two years. The company was renamed Infosys Technologies (Australia) Pty Limited. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Philips)’s three shared services centres were Infosys’ second acquisition completed at a cost of $28 million in 2007. At that time Infosys had $1.4 billion in cash reserves and the company estimated that the deal would augment revenue by $32 million. This estimated revenue was calculated at $15 per worker hour. The deal included a business contract for Infosys worth $250 million to provide Philips with finance and accounting services and process its purchase orders. McCamish Systems was founded in 1985 and based its 260-employee delivery centre in Atlanta Georgia. It posted earned revenues of $38.2 million for the year ending 2008. Infosys bought it in 2009 for $58 million. According to the terms of acquisition the up-front consideration for the deal was $38 million. Infosys agreed to pay an additional $20 million to McCamish Systems if it achieved set financial targets in the coming years. At the time of the deal McCamish Systems had 39 clients and counted major insurance and financial companies among them including Nolan Financial Group Phoenix Companies Inc. and Heritage Credit Union. The deal helped Infosys’ business process outsourcing subsidiary Infosys BPO develop an evolved pricing-based business model.Portland Group was an Australian sourcing and category management services company founded in 1999. It had offices in Melbourne Brisbane Perth New Zealand and Shanghai. Its revenue was $29.3 million at the end of June 2011 with a workforce of 113. Portland Group was originally a procurement technology company that later expanded into cost reduction consultancy. The company had 42 clients including two of the four major Australian banks. Its other major clients were ASX PepsiCo Inc. Commonwealth Bank of Australia Westpac Banking Corporation and QGC Pty Limited—the Australian coal steam and gas company. Infosys acquired Portland Group in 2012 for $32.05 million in an all-cash deal. Before acquiring Portland Group Infosys had only one client in the natural resources sector: Rio Tinto. The deal helped Infosys establish its presence in several niche segments of the Australian market.Lodestone Management Consultants headquartered in Zurich was bought for $345 million in 2012. Lodestone advised international companies on strategy and process optimizations and provided business transformation solutions enabled by SAP software. Lodestone’s operations were focused primarily in Europe particularly in the United Kingdom Germany France Switzerland the Netherlands and Belgium. Its major clients were BMW Group Deutsche Telekom AG British American Tobacco plc and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Lodestone’s consultants billed clients at a rate of $175 per hour one of the highest rates in the industry at the time of the deal. Lodestone employed more than 850 consultants working in 17 countries but none were working in India. The company also had expertise and experience in the verticals of life sciences automotive and manufacturing.Panaya an Israeli software as a service (SaaS) company headquartered in Ra’anana Israel was founded in 2006 with investment support from Benchmark Capital Hasso Plattner Ventures and Battery Ventures. Infosys bought the company in 2015 for $200 million and incorporated the technology from Panaya’s CloudQuality Suite to bring automation to some of Infosys’ software. Using the agile SaaS model in its software Infosys was able to mitigate risk reduce costs and shorten time to market for its clients. The CloudQuality Suite helped businesses to test changes to Oracle E-Business Suite and SAP and Salesforce software by identifying functions that might break and providing potential solutions including code corrections. At the time of the acquisition Panaya had more than 400 active customer accounts including global marquee names such as General Electric Mercedes-Benz (Daimler AG) Bosch Whirlpool Corporation GlaxoSmithKline plc Siemens AG Apple Inc. the Coca-Cola Company and Johnson & Johnson. Forty per cent of Panaya’s revenue came from the United States and another 40 per cent from Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Panaya earned the remainder of its revenue from other systems integrators such as IBM Computer Sciences Corporation Logica and the Hewlett-Packard Company.Kallidus Inc. operating under the brand name Skava was based in San Francisco and provided digital and mobile commerce solutions. Skava was a cloud-hosted platform for mobile websites and applications (apps) and other digital shopping experiences delivered across mobile tablet desktop in-store and emerging channels to large retail clients worldwide. In 2013 Kallidus had revenues of $22.9 million and logged a three-year revenue growth of 608 per cent. Infosys acquired Kallidus and its affiliate in 2015 in an all-cash deal of $120 million which included retention bonuses and a deferred component.Noah Consulting LLC was a leading provider of advanced information management consulting services for the oil and gas industry established in 2008. It had 122 employees and was headquartered in Houston Texas with an additional office in Calgary Canada. Its solutions consisted of information management strategic services industry solutions analytics and acquisitions. Noah’s deep domain expertise in upstream oil and gas coupled with its tools solution accelerators and proprietary methodologies made it a leader in driving strategic data management engagements. The value of Infosys’ buyout of Noah was $70 million. The acquisition came at a time when global oil prices had fallen steeply resulting in a need for oil and gas companies to improve operational efficiency by using data analytics and smarter information technology solutions. The acquisition helped Infosys gain expertise in providing end-to-end data management services to oil and gas industry clients.In addition to eight other deals Infosys invested $2 million in Airviz Inc. an air quality monitoring start-up that originated at Carnegie Mellon University. The investment was made from an innovation fund Infosys had earmarked for investments in disruptive new technologies. The innovation fund was launched in 2013 with $100 million to further Infosys’ strategic and functional interests. In 2015 the fund was expanded to $500 million. As of January 22 2017 Infosys had invested a little more than $62 million of the fund in various start-ups covering areas such as IoT automation and drones. Sikka was optimistic about the role that the companies Infosys acquired with the fund would play in achieving the firm’s Vision 2020 goals. He noted “The start-up world is incredibly exciting. We have been investing in companies there. We have been bringing these companies to our clients and that rate at which we bring these companies to clients is just exploding. So that’s very exciting.” THE WAY FORWARDThe coming months would be crucial for Infosys and Sikka. The clock was ticking for achieving Vision 2020; shareholder expectations were rising; international competition in the domestic and overseas markets was increasing; and the geo-political dynamics and U.S. visa policies were changing. Infosys had myriad uncertainties to deal with and several critical decisions had to be made. Organic sources of growth were not going to be enough to reach the company’s target of $20 billion by 2020. Infosys had to devise an appropriate buyout strategy if it hoped to scale up rapidly.In the past buyouts had enhanced Infosys’ client base increased its product and service portfolio and enabled its geographical expansion. The buyouts had also enabled Infosys to become agile and better prepared for uncertainties. At the same time some acquisitions such as those of Panaya and Lodestone had also created turmoil and company-wide disagreements for Infosys. With all that in mind it was important for Sikka to strike a balance between risks and rewards in his approach to buying out companies. Since becoming chief executive officer in August 2014 Sikka had brought several changes to the company such as overhauling its organizational structure increasing the focus on design thinking and focusing efforts on AI. But AI was just one facet of the industry’s emerging technologies. Infosys had its business spread across a variety of segments and diverse geographies. To continue its swift growth and leverage the way for acquisitions and buyouts which of these business and geographical segments should Infosys invest in? Which key determining factors should drive the acquisitions: increased clientele enhanced technology or increased geographical reach and what investments were priorities? Sikka knew that the journey ahead would be challenging and that tough choices would have to be embraced.Exhibit 1: Infosys Limited BuyoutsNote: BPO = business process outsourcing.Source: Created by the case authors based on “Acquiring Organization: Infosys” Crunchbase accessed November 24 2017 www.crunchbase.com/organization/infosys/acquisitions; “About Us” Infosys (website) accessed November 24 2017 www.infosys.com/about/Pages/history.aspx.Exhibit 2: Infosys Limited Balance Sheet(in US$ ’000)Source: Created by the case authors based on Infosys Limited Annual Report 2010–11: Powered by Intellect: Driven by Values; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2011–12: Infosys 3.0—Accelerating Growth; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2012–13: Relevance through Innovation; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2013–14: Evolving with Changing Times; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2014–15: Powered by Intellect Driven by Values; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2015–16: Being Infosys.

Bronconnier knew that to achieve this goal Calgary’s downtown core and the areas immediately adjacent would have to be rejuvenated and re-energized through redevelopment. The East Village area in particular was underutilized and often associated with urban blight. Located behind Bronconnier’s office in city hall the East Village had plenty of development potential given its proximity to downtown and the beautiful Bow River. However Bronconnier knew there were economic social and environmental issues that had to be addressed first—he could clearly see most of these from his office. While he believed it was possible to redevelop the area he could not help but be concerned that the most difficult task would be to convince Calgary City Council that it was time to act; and he wondered even if he did convince council members how could they ensure success this time around?  In 2001 the East Village was little more than a zone of containment for homeless shelters high-rise housing for low-income seniors and a wasteland of crime-ridden surface parking lots. The East Village had not always looked like this nor was its current state due to a lack of redevelopment efforts. Somehow half a century of improvement attempts had all failed. In 2007 Bronconnier had the finances in place to revitalize the East Village. With failure in the past how could he ensure that the attempt would be a success?CALGARY In 2017 Calgary in the western Canadian province of Alberta was a city of just over 1.2 million people. It was the third-largest municipality in Canada and had the second-highest number of corporate head offices largely due to its role as an administrative centre for the Canadian oil and gas industry. Although population growth had recently slowed due to an economic downturn the city had been among the fastest growing cities in Canada in recent years. Since 1996 Calgary’s population had grown from 767059 to 1235171—an average of just over 2.5 per cent per year. Calgary’s economy was characterized by boom and bust cycles attributed to the volatility of oil prices but recent booms had ensured that Calgary was generally prosperous. Households in Calgary had the highest median total income in Canada and close to 70 per cent of housing was owner-occupied. However not all areas of the city had participated in the prosperity and the East Village was a case in point.the EAST VILLAGECalgary’s East Village covered 49 acres (19.83 hectares) on the eastern side of the city’s downtown (see Exhibit 1). The neighbourhood was established when the Canadian Pacific Railway built a station west of Fort Calgary in 1883. Maps of the East Village from the beginning of the 1900s show a mixed-use community with commercial residential and industrial uses; it was essentially a small town largely serving the working class and the railway. Apartment and tenement buildings were built for men seeking employment in the city. Despite an economic boom that attracted these newcomers development began to slow down over the next decade and in 1912 a “homeless men problem” was mentioned for the first time. By the 1920s the automobile was competing with the streetcar and the demand for auto-related services increased. Mechanics’ garages and motor and machine shops sprung up in the East Village changing the physical environment toward being more industrial. After the Second World War the growth of the oil industry raised the standard of living in Calgary and suburban expansion away from the city’s core began. During this time many more of the designated residential uses in the East Village were converted to garages and to auto body auto parts glass and paint shops. By the early 1960s the East Village housed a variety of industrial and transportation uses as well as the city abattoir and cattle pens. The few residential uses remaining were overwhelmingly apartments and rooming houses as well as inexpensive single-room-occupancy hotels. In 1964 the area had the highest percentage of welfare caseloads in the city and several social agencies had by then increased their presence. The physical environment of the East Village had adapted to the evolving economy with more industrial sites but had concurrently become a place where the down-and-out could secure cheap accommodation in an undesirable part of town. Amendments to the National Housing Act in 1964 and to the Alberta Housing Act in 1965 culminated in an urban renewal scheme for the East Village. A 1966 report to Calgary City Council claimed that the renewal area comprised 20 per cent of the downtown core yet yielded only 4 per cent of downtown property revenues and contained 54 per cent of condemned buildings. Thus a master plan was put in place to remove “urban ills” from the East Village including what the City considered an undesirable population made up of mostly single unemployed men. Underused areas were to be replaced with parcels for private developers and civic purpose buildings many of which were later built on the western edge of the area. The unwanted population would be pushed out when their homes disappeared but no one gave any thought to where they would go. While a significant number of buildings were torn down for redevelopment they were not replaced by the time the urban renewal scheme was terminated in 1972.In 1978 a new proposed Downtown Plan envisioned the East Village as a residential community within the downtown characterized by a high-quality pedestrian environment and integrated public spaces. This concept for the East Village was next incorporated into the 1981 Downtown Area Redevelopment Plan which ultimately failed to be passed by the city council of the day and left the East Village underdeveloped once again. By 1985 the seemingly final blow to redevelopment of the area was the construction that year of the Calgary Municipal Building which faced west and opened onto a plaza designed for the 1988 Winter Olympics. City hall had—literally—turned its back to the East Village. Compounding this insult (intended or not) was the construction of a safety fence to prevent people from crossing the Light Rail Transit tracks that ran behind the municipal building along the western edge of the East Village leaving just a small passageway through which East Village residents could leave to enter the rest of downtown and return home. Later in 1990 another attempt at redevelopment surfaced through the proposed New Directions for the East Village plan where only 15 per cent of the area included residential uses. The New Directions plan envisioned a low- medium- and high-density residential area with affordable rental and owned housing for up to 5000 people. However this proposed plan was doomed for failure based on assertions that Calgarians’ preference for living in the suburbs combined with the shelters and dilapidated hotels of the East Village would make it impossible to attract residents. The plan had no political backing and never came to fruition. More than 10 years passed before another attempt at redevelopment was launched in 2002. Known as the Canal Project the plan envisioned a mixed-use dense and walkable community featuring a canal and pond. The Canal Project like its predecessors did not present a concrete strategy for the infrastructure improvements needed to spur private investment in the East Village nor did it involve any community engagement. It also blatantly ignored the social and environmental issues present in the area. Questionable land valuation processes further plagued the plan which ultimately also went nowhere. Each plan for revitalization had left the area stagnating and therefore worse off than it had been before. The result of 50 years of incomplete plans and unfinished fragmented development had left the East Village severely lacking vision and cohesion. There was no immediate solution in sight as the Canal Project had divided city council between those who felt that innovative municipal intervention was needed and those who felt the market should take care of itself. Mayor Bronconnier represented the first camp as he was well aware of the area’s complex history and recognized the need for environmental remediation. Bronconnier also knew that the lack of infrastructure made it unlikely that any private sector developer would take on the risk of a project of this scale and cost. The initiative would have to be led by the public sector but Bronconnier had to be strategic about how to approach the matter.POLITICAL WILL AND PLANNING CONTEXT When Bronconnier initiated another effort to develop the East Village in 2004 he received backlash for fighting what many believed was a losing battle. He brushed off the criticism and set himself to the task of creating a plan to finance the redevelopment effort. Bronconnier understood that investing in the East Village would not be popular with many of his colleagues or citizens but he also knew that delivering the best value for the City of Calgary in the long term was a priority. He would need to effectively communicate to council his vision for another try at redevelopment and convince the skeptics that his idea was not just another plan doomed to fail. It would be a long process and the initial scope would have to extend beyond the East Village. Thus Bronconnier embarked on creating a shared vision of a thriving downtown that would benefit all Calgarians with investment in the East Village as a worthwhile commitment to reaching that goal.The first step toward realizing this vision was the resuscitation of the East Village Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP) which dated back to 2001 and the ill-fated Canal Project. An ARP was a detailed planning document created by a municipality and adopted by city council to facilitate development and improvements in a specific area. The renewed version of the ARP for the East Village set out to “ensure that lands within the planning area be made ready and capable for redevelopment at the earliest opportunity.” The ARP was situated within the context of imagineCALGARY the city’s long-range urban sustainability plan developed in 2006. ImagineCALGARY was “a blueprint for a sustainable future . . . a community visioning and consultation process” involving input from 18000 residents. In other words imagineCalgary was a concrete plan for achieving the sustainable growth principles Bronconnier had been advocating for. After several revisions the East Village ARP was approved in March of 2005 (resulting in Bylaw 24P2004). In January 2007 city council also adopted the Sustainability Principles for Land Use and Mobility as set out in imagineCALGARY.Following the formalization of a strategy through the East Village ARP spring 2007 saw the release of the Rivers District Community Revitalization Plan (RDCRP). This plan outlined: 1) a comprehensive redevelopment plan for the East Village and surrounding areas to the south; 2) the economic social and environmental barriers to development; and 3) concrete solutions to deal with these issues. While the RDCRP would extend into two neighbouring areas the Beltline and Stampede Park (see Exhibit 2) primary investment would occur in the East Village. The RDCRP involved a public infrastructure program that would “facilitate the reclamation redevelopment and revitalization” of the area and would involve an innovative method of funding through a community revitalization levy (CRL). FINANCING THE RDCRPWhen Bronconnier and the City of Calgary’s Asset Management and Capital Works department were researching financing solutions used by cities that had taken on similar projects they noticed that many successful examples had involved tax increment financing (TIF). Dating back to 1952 in California TIF involved determining a catchment area that would provide the needed tax uplift to finance infrastructure improvements in a redeveloping area. The existing tax base was determined and scenarios were built to predict future tax revenue based on improvements through redevelopment. The assessed existing tax base became a baseline. Over time as city investment occurred any increments in taxes collected beyond the baseline were used to fund the investment in the area. TIFs were imposed for a set time frame (typically 20–25 years) with taxes reverting to the larger municipal pool when the TIF expired (see Exhibit 3).TIF schemes were long-term investments that could pay off in the appropriate circumstances. In a successful TIF setting the selected area was generally underutilized and it often required environmental remediation. In fact TIFs worked best for downtown mixed-use areas that had been neglected had seen limited (if any) private investment and had vacant land. The East Village met all the criteria. These criteria were also the reason why land developers had lost confidence over time that change could happen in the East Village and were unwilling to invest there. Bronconnier knew that if redevelopment was ever to happen public intervention and funding was needed. In the summer of 2004 he managed to convince council to direct City administration to look at TIFs as a way to finance the East Village. After careful research review of evidence-based case studies and the completion of financial analyses Bronconnier was prepared to argue that TIF was a viable option for the East Village. Bronconnier’s path toward council approval of this new financing tool however was not easy. In April 2005 council approved TIF as an urban revitalization tool and approved in principle the creation of a “special purpose vehicle” to implement it. However the scenario was hypothetical and Bronconnier knew that to succeed with the redevelopment they would need something concrete—and they had no Canadian examples to follow. Despite being used in almost all U.S. states TIF was a foreign concept in Canada. For this reason introduction of this type of financing tool required buy-in and facilitation from the provincial government which oversaw municipal affairs through the Municipal Government Act (MGA). When Bronconnier initially approached then Premier Ralph Klein in 2005 about using the mechanism Klein was open to exploring the idea. Having been a former mayor of Calgary Klein recognized that the East Village required stable funding over an extended period to get it off the ground. However Klein did not like the implications of the word “tax” and maintained that provincial legislation would need to be written and enacted to address this financing option to avoid potential misuse. For these reasons two things happened at the provincial level to facilitate the East Village TIF: 1) the province agreed to forgo a portion of its property tax revenues in the RDCRP to enable the City to leverage funds for infrastructure redevelopment and 2) the Alberta equivalent of a TIF would be named community revitalization levy (CRL). Because the City needed CA$135 million just to begin initial infrastructure upgrades (see Exhibit 4) this was a significant signal of support from the province.This new way of financing major infrastructure projects was possible through amendments to the MGA which the province of Alberta initiated after Bronconnier met with Premier Klein. The actual tool for achieving this was the CRL essentially a “technique for harnessing future revenues to pay for current expenditures.” A successful CRL would need to be supported by its own future cash flows meaning that predicted tax uplifts from redevelopment were critical to the City’s ability to pay back the upfront investment in infrastructure. Using an analysis of the external business environment—including economic trends in residential and commercial real estate interest rates and the strength of the Canadian dollar—the CRL was estimated to generate between CA$725 million (low scenario) and CA$1.166 billion (high scenario) over 20 years (see Exhibit 5). These calculations used for the CRL projected a viable working model even with the most pessimistic forecasting.Yet Bronconnier still had to consider what would happen if the revitalization effort were unsuccessful and the CRL failed to be economically viable a scenario that had not been uncommon south of the border. Bronconnier worried what would happen if this inaugural attempt at TIF through a CRL in Canada failed with Calgary’s East Village project. He knew that a CRL was not a sure win; what if the City had overestimated growth in land values or potential developer interest? The CRL hinged on private investment after the City of Calgary provided the necessary infrastructure for redevelopment. What would happen if there was not enough growth to support the CRL? Even worse what if Alberta’s oil-and-gas-dependent economy faced a disruption and slid into a bust cycle? Despite the careful calculations that had been considered to date Bronconnier felt more assurance was needed. Part of his concern focused on how to determine the geographic area that the CRL should cover. When drawing maps for TIF areas in the United States properties that had maximized their tax growth potential as well as institutional and government buildings were often excluded from modelling. Instead the focus was on the potential for development and the subsequent tax lift from the properties to be built. In the case of the East Village very little property tax revenue was generated from the area itself with it having just a few condominiums and small businesses. The rest of the East Village consisted of social housing not-for-profit organizations’ premises and municipal or provincial government uses which yielded little or no taxes. It would therefore be critical to create a catchment area that would invite interest from the private sector to build properties that would generate the needed tax lift.In this regard the City received a lucky break. In 2006 Encana Corporation announced plans for the construction of a skyscraper—to be known as “The Bow”—to serve as its corporate headquarters which would be located in the east end of downtown. It would be the tallest skyscraper in Western Canada and would produce millions of dollars in property taxes. While Bronconnier was aware that there were no guarantees in redevelopment scenarios he determined that including The Bow in the East Village CRL zone would be the next best thing. After making the case to city administration and his council colleagues The Bow development which broke ground in 2007 was officially included in the CRL zone in the RDCRP (see Exhibit 2). The ARP and RDCRP processes combined with financial modelling and risk assessment had produced a thorough analysis that supported the CRL. The financial groundwork had been laid and political support for the project had been established at the provincial level. Implementation of the CRL required new legislation policies and bylaws all of which were supported by public investment in the project. This signalled confidence that the East Village was worth the effort of redevelopment.As he stood in his office and looked out on the East Village below Bronconnier knew that he now had to educate his fellow city council members on the merits of the plan. In order to get their support he needed them to see not only the financial viability but also how the plan fit with the vision he had for a world-class city. Without their support the plan would suffer the same fate as the redevelopment plans that came before it and the residents of the East Village would be overlooked yet again. He knew this would be a defining moment for the City of Calgary. With one amendment the RDCRP was approved as part of Bylaw 27M2007 on April 16 2007. The approval of the RDCRP was a victory for Bronconnier and a testament to his dedication. He understood the significance of the decision he and his fellow council members had just made. By approving Bylaw 27M2007 they had introduced the first (ever) CRL in an Alberta municipality since the enabling MGA amendment came into place in 2005. The final vote was 12 to three in favour of the CRL with only one minor amendment to the motion. This meant he had strong support from council to revitalize a critical part of the city. With the financing tool in place to create the infrastructure necessary for revitalizing the East Village council’s next task was to determine how this infrastructure project should be managed. Skepticism was high as previous redevelopment efforts for the East Village had failed for a variety of reasons and it was strongly suggested that the City should not be responsible for implementing the RDCRP. With so much at stake financially for the City and reputation-wise for Bronconnier how could Bronconnier ensure that this attempt at redevelopment would be successful without the City’s direct involvement?EXHIBIT 1: LOCATION OF THE EAST VILLAGE RELATIVE TO DOWNTOWNSource: City of Calgary East Village Area Redevelopment Plan 10 2017 accessed July 5 2017. www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Documents/arp-asp/arp/east-village-arp.pdf.

Ltd. (Chatar Patar) was a quick service eatery that was opened in 2012 with the vision of expanding to multiple outlets. Prashant Kulkarni managing director of the company and his team had planned to expand their business by 2018 once the brand was popular and the company had established a name in the market. As with every new venture the team was ready to put in hard work and establish a good reputation. The team had expansion plans and at the top of the list was the option of entering into a franchise model of business. In 2016 it had been more than a year since the franchise offers started coming in and the team had not yet decided what to do next. The team members did their research and consulted people in the same field to learn more with the hope of developing a lucrative solution to the problem. Kulkarni wondered whether he and the team were taking on their expansion plans too early before they were prepared or had a sufficient plan. Should they wait? If they proceeded which method of expansion should they adopt?The EntrepreneurIt was the summer of 1995 when Kulkarni ran to his father with ₹230 in his hand. His father was surprised to see his son with so much money and asked Kulkarni in a firm tone who had given him the money. Kulkarni replied in an innocent and excited voice that he had sold a total of 20 handmade boats. Kulkarni’s father was taken aback and enquired further asking how Kulkarni got the material to make these boats. The boy shared that he had used all the waste material that was kept in the garage. Kulkarni beamed with excitement and happiness pleased that he had sold all of his boats. Like his father Kulkarni was an entrepreneur and that day marked the beginning of Kulkarni’s entrepreneurial journey.Over the years Kulkarni had many ideas. Some worked but others no matter how good they looked on paper were difficult to implement. Two of Kulkarni’s successful ventures were a CD (compact disc) shop followed by a business in tire tubes. But ventures were short-lived and even though Kulkarni’s father saw potential in the boy he asked him to pursue a college program. Kulkarni completed an honours bachelor degree in commerce and was immediately placed with an information technology (IT) firm in Jaipur India after graduation.Kulkarni loved food and his new job gave him the opportunity to try out new dishes every week. One week he had a craving for panipuri so Kulkarni set out to find a street vendor selling the snack. He returned home having enjoyed his dinner only to feel ill. He went to bed nauseated and woke at 2:00 a.m. with sudden abdominal pain. By morning the pain was worse so Kulkarni went to the hospital where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. When he disclosed his diet of the previous few days the doctor immediately identified the panipuri as the culprit. The doctor shared that they had at least two patients every week sick after consuming street food and in almost 90 per cent of the cases panipuri was the cause.After spending a week in the hospital Kulkarni was discharged home with instructions to take certain precautions with what he ate. He resolved that he would refrain from panipuri indefinitely.Kulkarni completed his tenure with the IT company and decided to continue his education and pursue a master’s degree in business administration in his hometown. Indore was known for its delicacies of Indian street food but Kulkarni’s brush with food poisoning had stayed with him. He did however meet with his friends one day and joined them as they went to a street vendor for their favourite panipuri. It was then that Kulkarni noticed for the first time that the vendors prepared his favourite dish with a total lack of hygiene a factor Kulkarni had never considered before when eating his favourite street food. He also noticed that the quality of the ingredients was poor and that the vendors offered a limited choice of flavours. Kulkarni realized that whatever happened to him could happen to anyone. He wondered how many people would refrain from eating the food or stop their family members from enjoying this delicious dish because of its preparation or serving methods or because preparation was not hygienic or healthy.The CompanyKulkarni researched the idea of providing people with healthy panipuri that was an amalgamation of hygiene health and taste. He always believed in the power of ideas although this idea was fuelled by memories of a week in hospital with several painful injections and bitter medicines. He needed to get a brand into the unorganized world of Indian street food. Kulkarni worked on his idea with his younger sister Pallavi and his colleague Arti pushing the idea further every day. After in-depth study over 18 months the trio learned that although panipuri was a favourite food across the entire Indian subcontinent—India Pakistan Sri Lanka Nepal and Bangladesh—it was often frowned upon because of the vendors’ lack of hygiene. Although panipuri was popular and offered health benefits because of the variety of herbs and spices used many people did not consider panipuri to be a healthy eating option. The same was true with a variety of other savoury snacks served by roadside vendors. The trio decided to start their own venture opening an outlet that served the most liked and popular Indian street food. Their plan was to establish a name in this particular segment of the food industry. They did not want to be just another outlet on a long list of random outlets regularly launched to serve panipuri; they wanted their outlet to be different. And so they launched Chatar Patar an eatery store in the quick service restaurant sector that served standardized Indian street food that could be customized with an extensive scope of products all of it hygienically prepared and served. The vision was to deliver Indian street food that was healthy hygienic and tasted good. The IndustryThe Indian quick service restaurants sector a portion of the restaurant industry was estimated to have a market value of ₹68 billion in 2014. The market was expected to grow to ₹150 billion by 2020 providing lucrative opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs to be a part of this growth story. Another report highlighted that changing consumer behaviour and demographics were expected to drive the Indian quick service restaurants to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 for a market value of US$27.57 billion. Approximately 10 per cent of the fast-food market in India was organized. Novonous’s market research estimated that the organized fast-food market in India would grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by 2020. Vegetarian fast food constituted approximately 45 per cent of the fast-food market in India and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 18 per cent by 2020.Casual dining restaurants (CDRs) in the organized fast-food sector in India were projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by fiscal year (FY) 2019/20. Non-casual dining restaurants (NCDRs) or fast casual dining restaurants had gained a tremendous market share over the previous 10–15 years. That sector was also projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent over the next five years. The quick service restaurants market in the organized fast-food sector in India was projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 per cent by FY 2019/20.The Growth PhaseKulkarni brought his signature product panipuri to the customers of Chatar Patar “the house of India’s first branded golgappas (panipuri) Gapagap.” Kulkari and his team were pioneers in introducing the world’s first panipuri brand Gapagap.Kulkari and his team started their venture with an initial capital of just ₹40000. They opened their first outlet the parent store in Indore Kulkarni’s hometown initially offering 18 products on the menu. They leased space next to the university hoping the location next to their primary target market—youth—would give them visibility. They decided that it would be the founding team that handled the operations from procurement of the raw material to preparing and serving the snacks. The store made a profit after the first month so the team expanded. They hired two employees who were trained to prepare the snacks and attend to customers.The venture was an immediate success. Word-of-mouth publicity and the networking skills of the founding team led to increasing sales despite their inexperience. Customers were drawn in and made regular visits. The store was making profits much above the initial expectation of the team. Yet that was not enough for Kulkari. Even though the team had delivered on two of their promises—providing hygienic and healthy street food—they had yet to deliver on the third promise taste. The team took on the challenge and decided to expand the flavours offered. As they did not want to be just any other store in this line of business they chose to establish a niche with their flavours. Starting with seven flavours they developed a total of 60 flavours within two months and then over time expanded to 112 flavours of pani the main ingredient in Gapagap.The team members were proud to be pioneers adding various flavours to an age-old Indian street food. Really they had revolutionized the food. Word of mouth was strong which increased their footfalls and proved to be helpful in taking the next step. Strategic ShiftKulkari and his team were overwhelmed by the customer response but Kulkari still questioned what was next and how they would get there. The answer came when Singh a regular and loyal customer visited Chatar Patar on a day when the team was a little less occupied. Singh was an experienced businessman and liked the team’s concept of multi-flavoured hygienic and healthy food. He congratulated them on their success and asked whether they had considered expanding. Kulkari shared that this was exactly what was bothering him wondering what was next. Singh proposed a franchise business model but Kulkarni wondered whether it was too soon. The team had researched websites dedicated to promoting the franchise business model and they could develop and use their own website to advertise available franchises. They had a brand but the brand was not yet big enough that people would want to invest. And Chatar Patar charged prices that were a bit higher than what street vendors charged. But Singh maintained that franchising was the path and offered to be Chatar Patar’s first franchisee opening an outlet in Rajkot. Kulkarni and his team were surprised by Singh’s offer and requested time to consider it. In the meantime Kulkarni hired a friend to create a company website. Within three days the website was ready and working. With the website live the team began to promote their restaurant on social media platforms sharing their success story and directing people to their franchise business model which was available on the company website.As word spread more franchise offers came in. The team had already prepared a rough draft of a franchise business model offer but had yet to refine it. They did not anticipate such a quick response but they did not want to lose the opportunity. Before discussing business with Singh or looking at the other offers Kulkari and the team did more research and refined their franchise business model.Under their franchise business format Chatar Patar offered the following:The rights to use the Chatar Patar brand trademarks signs and logos to operate a storeThe ability to prepare and sell Chatar Patar’s standardized products by sharing the recipes and transporting the ingredients required for the preparationUse of the strategic business model and systems developed by Chatar PatarSupport with local promotion using well-thought-out campaigns and creative inputsUse of the support training and research used by Chatar Patar’s headquartersFranchisees could choose one of two types of ownerships:A single unit franchise orAn area franchise with the opportunity to develop multiple units within the franchise referred to as a master franchise (see Exhibit 1).CompetitionThe ethnic fast-food market in India was expected to experience considerable growth with a projected CAGR of 31.95 per cent by FY 2019/20. Millions of people were consuming ethnic fast food daily. To leverage this market and customer segment many players had entered the market as organized outlets between 2013 and 2015. The United Nations reported that India had 356 million people between the ages of 10 and 24—the largest youth population in the world. India’s economy was growing and more young people were entering the workforce giving them money to spend. There were also more women in the workforce bringing a need for different tastes and products. Also consumers were more mobile; they needed food on the go so the need for access to quick service restaurants increased. As a result the consumers in the Indian fast-food market were hungry for more availability of quick service restaurants with a diverse menu which paved the way for entry of international brands such as McDonald’s KFC Subway Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts which competed with local Indian fast-food restaurants. Technology and social media gave quick service restaurants the ability to make menus available online and gave customers the opportunity to post their reviews of the restaurants. Customers could also take advantage of online ordering and home delivery of items methods leveraged by many players. Slowly but steadily the competitors were focusing on three areas: quality food ingredients online ordering and home delivery and customized and dynamic menus to match customers’ taste interests. Panipuri was distinct in that it could not be ordered online because the most important part of the dish was its preparation and service on the spot. Consuming it right away accentuated the taste.ChallengesAlthough franchising seemed to be the next logical step for Chatar Patar and the team was elated with the response of prospective franchisees Kulkari wanted to continue to maintain a niche and exclusivity in the market. The challenge was to expand while maintaining and delivering on Chatar Patar’s promise of health hygiene and most importantly taste. The goal was to maintain the exclusive taste so no matter which outlet the customer visited the Gapagap would taste the same. The team planned to travel to all the locations and train the staff to prepare the products the right way but the team had no previous experience with how a food outlet was run nor did they have any experience with distributing to franchisees.The team had made the ingredients the pani of their signature product Gapagap in liquid form. The immediate challenge was how to transport the contents and ingredients to the kitchen teams in the franchises. The company was still in the initial growth phase and its income was limited so whatever method was adopted needed to be cost-effective. At the same time delivery needed to be done with minimal to no damage to the contents. The ingredients in the semi-liquid state had a shelf life of only two to three days and the goods risked being damaged in transit as a result of breakage or spillage. The team wanted the same method of delivery for all franchise outlets and they wanted a method of distribution that was lucrative in both the short and long terms. They were not looking for a stopgap solution; it had to be a permanent solution. The Way ForwardThe franchisee offers were pouring in. The team was already negotiating with seven prospective franchisees who were satisfied with Chatar Patar’s proposal and were ready to take up the franchises. The team again researched and found methods for transporting the ingredients to the franchisees. Their first thought was to emulate the methods adopted by the beverage giants such as PepsiCo Inc. or The Coca-Cola Company. The team worked out an option for transporting the semi-liquid formula from the main store in Indore to the first franchise offer they accepted in a nearby city in Rajkot (see Exhibit 2).The transportation cost involved carrying the goods from the parent outlet in Indore to the receiving location of the first transport agent which would take it from there to a local transportation company warehouse. The team estimated each trip would cost ₹250. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000.From the local warehouse the product would be moved to the transporter’s warehouses in the franchise cities. The cost for that stage would be ₹500 per trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹4000.Finally the product would then be transported from the city warehouses to the franchises. The cost for this stage of shipment was ₹250 per round trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000 (see Exhibit 3).When the team discussed this plan with the transporting agents the agents established that this plan could be used for all the cities that had direct bus links. Whether they transported their material to Rajkot Baroda Jamnagar or Vizag the cost would be the same. However if the weight of the shipped goods was more than 120 kilograms they would be charged an additional ₹10 per kilogram.This method of transportation of semi-liquid ingredients also carried the risk of 30 per cent damage to the ingredients. If the product incurred damages the loss would not only increase the transportation cost due to more shipments to replace the damaged goods but also decrease the profit margins. The shelf life of the product was two to three days and even after transportation there would likely be 30 to 40 per cent wastage because the ingredients did not taste fresh. The next approach the team considered was that used by large fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC. With this model the ingredients would be prepared and frozen which would increase the shelf life of the ingredients. However only 10 of Chatar Patar’s products could be converted to a frozen-food format; eight products needed to be freshly prepared. Planning needed to be more strategic with the frozen format. First a regular route would need to be established then the stores would be opened along the route to optimally use the delivery channel. The company would need to lease cold storage space located centrally on the route and invest in a blast freezing process. Another requirement would be to maintain a large inventory that could meet the product demand. The advantage with this option was that it was damage-proof (see Exhibit 4). The third alternative that the team considered was to convert the semi-liquid formula into a dry format. The cost for the drying process would be ₹300 for 120 kilograms of semi-liquid formula. The cost of transportation would be ₹1000 (see Exhibit 5).Yet another option the team considered was to share with the franchise owner the trade secret—the recipes and the exact procedure for creating their exclusive taste. This option would be the easiest for the parent company doing away with all the logistics hassle of transporting ingredients. The disadvantage was that the team would lose control of their market advantage; franchise owners could give up their franchises at the end of the contract and start their own ventures under another brand name.Another suggestion proposed by Arti and Pallavi was that they first focus on expanding in nearby cities where the material could be transported within a matter of few hours. Kulkarni suggested that they could also focus on opening franchises in Indore itself.Finally the team considered whether they should standardize the five or six key products and leave the remaining products to the discretion of the franchisee. The franchises could customize the panipuri according to local taste and preference.Exhibit 1: Chatar Patar Foods Pvt.

Li’s organization published newspapers that were targeted toward the Chinese community in Toronto Canada. Li was requesting a long-term loan of CA$100000 so his company could fund a salary for a new full-time journalist. Adeel knew this loan would be the first long-term loan to TCG in over 15 years. Scrutiny from her superiors would be high so she had to make the appropriate recommendations for IBoB.TORONTO ONTARIOWith a population of 2.8 million Toronto was the largest city in Canada and was well known as the country’s centre for financial services. However with nearly 90000 businesses in Toronto that provided jobs for over 1.4 million people Toronto was also a technological tourism and media hub for all of Canada. Toronto was home to nine post-secondary institutions including five universities and four colleges and was considered one of the top 10 most liveable cities in the world. Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area were also known worldwide for their multiculturalism and diversity. Almost half the city’s population included residents who self-identified as visible minorities and approximately 50 per cent of Toronto’s population originated from a foreign country. People came to Toronto for many reasons including access to jobs education and the lifestyle the city provided. In particular Toronto was a preferred destination for Chinese immigrants. The Chinese community comprised over 12 per cent of the city’s population and represented the second largest ethnic group.THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING INDUSTRYThe Canadian newspaper publishing industry was made up of large national companies that owned local and national brands and small community print newspapers that operated in niche markets. Canadian newspaper publishers differed by type of reported news and frequency of published papers. In addition to print online content was a differentiator and publishers provided access to this content in different ways. Some offered free online availability; others required subscriptions. The industry produced $3.6 billion in sales in 2016 with an average profit margin of 10 per cent and had over 28000 employees nationwide including publishers editors and journalists. Canadians read news for two main reasons: to stay informed and reading for leisure. Although the number of Canadians who read newspapers was difficult to track the circulation of printed papers decreased from 35.6 million to 30.4 million between 2011 and 2015. The industry was struggling and expected to decline in revenue by a yearly average of 4.4 per cent between 2016 and 2021. Increasing online readership was the biggest driver of these trends. Newspaper publishers were now making approximately $15 less for every traditional print advertisement they replaced with an online advertisement. The news industry in general was also extremely competitive and had seen tremendous proliferation in content media such as blogs YouTube channels podcasts and other social media platforms that were replacing traditional outlets as sources for news. Moreover the trend toward online consumption lowered barriers to entry and caused the industry to become even more competitive resulting in the onset of new foreign competition to the Canadian market. In order to remain competitive in this challenging environment publishers had to cultivate a credible brand and attract good journalists who were capable of delivering high-quality material.THE CHINESE GAZETTE HistoryLi immigrated to Toronto from China with his wife Nancy in 1989 and started a newspaper in 1992. Although Li had no previous business publishing or writing experience he believed his passion for current affairs and his sense of civic duty to make wrongdoers accountable would help him succeed as a publisher. Li was forced to shut down his business in 1994 after being unable to produce profits. He took this time to read meditate and reflect on what he had learned from this failure.Two years later Li gave the newspaper business another try. With no employees Nancy and Li did all the writing publishing and marketing of the newspaper. Revenues grew every year until the global recession of 2008 when TCG once again was on the brink of bankruptcy. However Li’s financial savvy carried TCG through these tough economic times and revenues eventually returned to pre-recession levels.TCG became a leading newspaper for Toronto’s Chinese readers. The company was the third largest Chinese newspaper in Toronto with a weekly circulation of 26000 newspapers. Although Li was content with the business and proud that it had supported his wife and two children he believed he could make the newspaper even more successful. At 55 years of age Li wanted to improve the business so that one day his children would have the opportunity to take it over and provide for their own families. OperationsTCG’s headquarters were located in Scarborough a sub-riding within Toronto. The company acquired six employees who were dispersed across sales writing and editing graphic design and distribution. Li and his wife managed the business together and split the functional workload. Li oversaw sales. Nancy was the paper’s editor. Twenty per cent of TCG’s news was on China 50 per cent on local news 20 per cent on editorial columns and 10 per cent on investigative journalism. The newspaper was published three times a week and distributed at Chinese grocery stores throughout Toronto free of charge. TCG also maintained a website and a social media account on the popular Chinese platform WeChat. Readers could access TCG’s articles through both online sources. The company earned revenues primarily by charging businesses for advertisements but Li found that classified ads were also a strong source of cash for the business.CompetitionLi considered the publications 51.Canada and YorkBBS to be TCG’s main competitors. He believed both organizations attracted a growing reader base because they responded quickly to customers’ changing tastes for online content. While TCG remained focused on print newspapers 51.Canada and YorkBBS won market share as the first Chinese publishers to provide online news in the Toronto market. However neither competitor offered English translations of their Chinese-language articles which Li believed was a key differentiator. Providing articles in two languages—English and Mandarin—allowed TCG to give newly immigrated families the comfort of their native language while practising reading and understanding English.THE PROPOSED EXPANSIONLi also believed his newspaper was different from competitors because he encouraged TCG journalists to write about controversial topics and use their platform to hold public figures accountable which was a journalistic value that he felt other newspapers did not uphold. He told Adeel “I am constantly on the side of my readers. I have a passion for delivery and want them to know the truth.”With sales in 2016 of almost $500000 and strong cash reserves Li’s business was running well but he wanted to increase readership. He felt that several controversial topics went unreported; because he was occupied with operating the business he was unable to write about them himself. Li planned to expand by hiring a young ambitious journalist with a desire to change the status quo a willingness to ask hard questions and the drive to uncover the truth. A fresh journalist on the writing team with a mandate to exclusively report controversial topics could further differentiate TCG from competitors and ultimately attract more readers.With his daughter in university and his son working full time Li felt that their independence gave him freedom to take on more financial risk to support his goals for TCG. Bank funding would allow Li to continue growing the business and pursue his initial vision of TCG as a trustworthy investigative newspaper for the Chinese community. Li also wanted to move away from daily operations by starting and hosting a YouTube extension of the newspaper. He was well respected in the Chinese community and was regularly asked to be a guest speaker on local television news stations. However because of the operational demands of the paper he had to turn down these invitations. With a bank loan to fund a new journalist Li would have time to accept and attend these media appearances.  Historically Li preferred to fund operations with cash generated from the business and personal savings. After a bad experience with a bank when he first started up Li pledged to finance as much of the newspaper as possible with non-bank sources. He eventually took out a mortgage through a bank to fund the purchase of company headquarters but paid it off soon after. Although Li preferred to finance assets with in-house sources he recognized that in order to expand he would again need the bank’s help and was willing to take on debt. Li expected that it would take three months to find a suitable journalist upon approval of the loan. Although he was unsure exactly how much the journalist would increase TCG’s revenues Li estimated that annual sales would increase by 5 per cent (conservatively) to 15 per cent (optimistically). In line with industry trends Li believed that business was moving toward more online publication and expected gross margins to increase to 41 per cent of revenues the next year. He credited this subsequent decrease in cost of goods to reduced variable costs associated with online distribution which was typically less capital-intensive than publishing print newspapers. Li also anticipated delivery and freight to decrease to 3.5 per cent of revenues and utilities to decrease to 0.35 per cent of revenues because of reduced printing and distribution activities. He also expected professional fees to increase by 0.17 per cent of revenue to help make the online publication more reader-friendly and visually appealing. Li wanted to drive growth in readership; therefore he expected to increase the advertising and promotion budget to 0.25 per cent of revenue. If approved the $100000 loan would be paid back over six years with annual principal payments and interest charges of prime plus 2 per cent. Li planned to use the entire $100000 over the next two years to fund the new journalist’s salary with a planned annualized rate of $47500 for the first year (see Exhibits 1 to 5). DecisionAlthough Adeel had met Li only a few times she could tell he was a passionate and charismatic business owner who needed IBoB’s funding support to realize his company’s vision and expansion plans. However she was still concerned about the risks associated with issuing a loan to a company that was in a struggling industry. She also worried about conducting business with a client that had no prior relationship with the bank. Did this $100000 loan request deserve to be approved? Adeel settled in to review TCG’s file.

KLIC was developed by Cinépolis de México S.A. de C.V. (Cinépolis) a private Mexican company owned by Organización Ramirez S.A.. So far KLIC operated only in Mexico.At Cinépolis the core business had traditionally been cinema theatres but the KLIC project was important now because streaming was becoming a bigger and bigger business and Cinépolis suspected that interesting synergies might be found between its theatre business and the new streaming unit. Cinépolis a large multinational might in principle capitalize on its presence around the world to push KLIC internationally.The challenge for Sánchez was to learn from KLIC’s performance in Mexico so far to create a strategy for the product that would make it a success going forward—and perhaps internationally.A BRIEF HISTORY OF CINÉPOLISThough Mexicans loved movies (they were the world’s fourth most avid moviegoers) investing in Mexican movie theatres had not always been an obvious business proposition. At one time the price of admittance was included in the canasta básica (basic basket) of government price-controlled goods. A single union covering the entire movie theatre industry kept labour costs high and the government competed in the space with its own subsidized theatres. But that business ecology changed in 1994 when Mexico Canada and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); price controls on the box office were lifted and the government exited the movie theatre business.Organización Ramírez—founded by Enrique Ramírez Miguel with Cine Salamanca in the Mexican city of Morelia—meant to seize the new opportunity. In 1994 it took the name Cinépolis and began investing heavily in the multiplex model where several screens shared a common roof and a box office. But NAFTA brought foreign competitors. Enrique had an answer to this: his twenty-something grandson Alejandro Ramírez. Enrique sent his grandson newspaper clippings about the arrival of U.S. theatre-chain competitors and a note: “Alex we need you.” Alejandro left his studies at the University of Oxford to become the director of General Operations at Cinépolis in 1996; later in 2004 he became chief executive officer.Under Alejandro’s growth-obsessed management Cinépolis came to own more than half of all movie theatres in Mexico capturing almost 70 per cent of the country’s film-going market. Without price controls time at the movies was affordable to only about one-fourth of Mexicans (contributing to movie piracy) but this was still 33 million people. Mexicans went to the movies almost religiously making the Mexican market surprisingly lucrative—so lucrative in fact that Mexican filmgoers had helped turn Cinépolis into the fourth-largest theatre chain in the world ranked by number of theatres. But other metrics existed: ranked by ticket sales Cinépolis took the number two slot and ranked by average theatre occupancy Cinépolis had become the world champion.The company’s success had spilled over beyond its home base. In addition to theatres in about 100 cities inside Mexico the theatre giant was now in well over 100 cities outside of Mexico spread over 13 countries in the Hispanic world (Latin America and Spain) as well as in the two biggest cinema markets in the world: India and the United States. In 2017 Cinépolis had 5170 screens to its name for a staggering total of 1090942 seats spread across many cities and towns (see Exhibit 1).THE CINÉPOLIS RECIPE FOR GROWTHFrom 1996 under Alejandro’s management Cinépolis had tinkered constantly reinvesting more than 80 per cent of its profits. To make additional investments the company in recent years had taken on debt for the first time (of an undisclosed amount). The company’s mantra was growth and Cinépolis had grown. Dominant in the Mexican market it had only one strong competitor there: Cadena Mexicana de Exhibición S.A. de C.V. (Cinemex) (see Exhibit 2).A Talent for InnovationSome of Cinépolis’ investment went to the construction or purchase of new theatres increasingly outside of Mexico and a significant portion also went to generating technology experience and service innovations which became a big part of the company’s vocation and culture.On the experience and service front Cinépolis amazed those who thought there was not much of anything new you could do with movie theatres. In 1997 the company began building theatres with seating organized on a “stadium” incline so that nobody’s view would ever be blocked by those in front. In 1999 it introduced the more expensive VIP concept: theatres with large fully reclining seats with leg rests that almost became beds and could be “merged” two by two allowing couples to cuddle (customers would get a blanket too) plus catered dinner service. In 2014 it came up with Cinépolis Junior theatres exclusively for parents who went to the movies with small children. These theatres had “puff” seating and contained slides and other amusements where children could expend their energy before the show and during intermission (to give them a break from paying so much attention). On the technology front Cinépolis spent heavily both to transition its theatres to the latest digital formats building new more modern theatres and to refurbish existing ones. In 2004 it began building giant-screen IMAX theatres and it built more of these than anybody in Mexico. Because IMAX theatres were enormously large and costly in 2010 Cinépolis introduced a mid-range alternative: a large 170-square-metre screen for its new Macro XE (Extreme Digital Experience) theatres. And in 2011 it began implementing in some theatres 4DX a Korean technology that enhanced the movie experience by giving viewers jolts in their seats and other physical surprises.Innovative Cinépolis theatres utterly transformed the movie-going experience in Mexico and proved attractive to the country’s relatively affluent moviegoers. If imitation was the best form of flattery then Cinépolis was lavishly flattered as competitors rushed to copy its innovations.Improved experience better technology and outstanding service were important reasons why Cinépolis was enjoying better average occupancy than any movie theatre company in the world but another was analysis which also got its share of investment. Cinépolis had turned its decision-making process for choosing theatre locations into a science studying carefully for example how many people who could afford the movies would be within a 15-minute drive of a newly proposed theatre as well as how many ticket sales a new theatre would cannibalize from other Cinépolis theatres. Its algorithms were so good that Cinépolis now had all of the choicest best-performing locations in Mexico City.The Box OfficeAnalysts were forced to guess at the financials of Cinépolis because the theatre chain—privately owned—did not divulge them. In a 2014 article Forbes did some guessing. According to Cinépolis 119.4 million tickets had been sold in Mexico in 2011 and the industry average price was about Mex$48 per ticket giving a total of Mex$5.7 billion for the year. But the average ticket price at Cinépolis’ VIP theatres was higher than the industry average. Cinépolis claimed to capture 64.5 per cent of total box-office returns. “In that case” said Forbes “its box-office returns might be worth 6202 million pesos.”Cinépolis claimed that 214.6 million tickets had been sold in 2017 in Mexico. Extrapolating from Forbes’ 2014 analysis that would mean revenues of Mex$18.9 billion for Mexico alone. However in 2017 overseas revenues had become significant (see below) whereas in 2014 these represented just 10 per cent of the total.FoodAnd then there was food—the revenue stream with the biggest margin. Cinépolis had innovated there too not only with its catered service but also with gourmet popcorn in a variety of both familiar and exotic flavours.According to Cinépolis its candy and food store was keeping 70 cents for every peso spent at the theatre. Adding this income to the box office “company revenues might be as high as Mex$10.5 billion pesos” the Forbes article stated. Per Mexican ticket then the average revenue was Mex$88.Overseas RevenueForbes was guessing at Cinépolis’ financials based on the company’s Mexican revenues only. That was fine in 2014 when Mexican revenues were 90 per cent of the total but by that year Cinépolis was already aggressively looking to make a much larger footprint in other countries as the Mexican market did not offer too many opportunities for further growth in theatres.Just one year later Cinépolis-owned theatres had increased by 75 per cent in India—an important step towards Cinépolis’ target increase of more than 350 per cent by 2017. Cinépolis was also pushing to grow in Spain the United States and Latin America. By 2017 according to Cinépolis a third of all of its tickets were already sold overseas.Social Media PresenceMexican movie theatre companies seemed to have a special talent for social media. By 2017 of all the major movie theatre companies in the world Cinépolis and its rival Cinemex had the most followers in their main social media spaces—Twitter Facebook and Google+. But Cinépolis was in a class all its own with a combined total of 20492170 followers almost twice the total of Cinemex (see Exhibit 3).KLICDespite all of its success with movie theatres Cinépolis recognized that new winds were blowing and thus decided in 2011 to capitalize on its name its relationship with content makers and its presence in theatres to get into the over-the-top (OTT) content game as well. Its bid to capture a share of the OTT market was KLIC a platform where consumers could rent buy or live-stream content. Though the platform was a small part of Cinépolis the company intended for KLIC to grow.OVER THE TOP: THE WORLD BEYOND THE THEATrEInterpreted broadly OTT content referred to audio video and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product—that is without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television (TV) systems. Netflix Inc. (Netflix)—a company with a tradition of disruptive innovation—had become the world leader in OTT service.The Netflix RevolutionNetflix disrupted the traditional video rental model that had turned Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. (Blockbuster) into the dominant giant. In a defensive move Blockbuster tried to buy the new challenger but Netflix refused the bid and eventually drove the older company into bankruptcy.Netflix’s first idea was to ship DVDs to customers by post saving on bricks-and-mortar costs. But the initial model was pay-per-rent the same as Blockbuster’s with similar due dates. A year later came a second key innovation: the monthly subscription concept. For a monthly fee a customer could watch any number of DVDs with no due dates late fees shipping and handling fees or per-title rental fees. This together with Netflix’s very large catalogue (35000 different films by 2005) resulted in a crushing preference for Netflix by consumers. By 2003 Netflix had turned a profit.In 2007 Netflix went “over the top”—it invaded the Internet-based video-on-demand space. Competitor Hulu and other platforms were already there but Netflix had scale. Its giant catalogue made its streaming service attractive and its subscription model was an obvious match for the new technology.Netflix was disruptive again. It began changing the habits of TV and film consumers (see Exhibit 4) as well as content producers and endangered other established businesses:ComScore reports that 51 million households now receive their television programming through what the industry calls Over-The-Top television. They watch an average of 49 hours of streaming content per month. About a third of these households have dropped cable and satellite programming completely. Looking ahead the streaming services are expected to continue growing rapidly while the cable and satellite numbers decline. Netflix is the biggest driver of this transition. Fully 74 percent of households that stream video watch Netflix. The content giant accounts for 40 percent of all OTT viewing and nobody else is even close.Despite a great deal of competition (others moved into this space including Amazon Video HBO Now and Crackle while original inhabitants such as Hulu hung on) some were expecting that U.S. consumers of Netflix’s streaming service could grow “to over 78 million by 2024.” This guess was based on “the secular trends within the pay-TV industry as consumers increasingly cut the cord in favour of streaming platforms” and thanks to the improved image of the Netflix brand after it began producing its own attractive original content.Spreading abroad Netflix meant to conquer the world. It arrived in Latin America in 2011 and despite the relatively low penetration of high-speed broadband in the region did well there. It had no competitors. That however would soon change.The Mexican OTT MarketIn 2012 Claro a communications services company owned by America Móvil in turn controlled by Grupo Carso S.A.B. de C.V. (Carso) the Mexican conglomerate headed by Carlos Slim Helú (at one time considered the wealthiest man in the world) launched Claro Video as a direct Netflix competitor. Because Carso also owned Teléfonos de México S.A.B. de C.V. (Telmex) and Teléfonos del Noroeste S.A. de C.V. (Telnor) and because Telmex/Telnor served 60 per cent of the Internet broadband market in Mexico with a strong position all over Latin America Carso could get many Latin Americans to try Claro Video by offering the service as a free bundle to Telmex/Telnor broadband customers.Carso businesses were often entangled; Claro Video could be legitimately viewed as a Telmex/Telnor strategy to protect its dominant broadband position rather than as a standalone product. But there was no question that Claro Video was a contender and it had followed the Netflix strategy of producing its own original content (e.g. La Hermandad) in order to lure viewers. In 2017 with Netflix holding onto 63.6 per cent of the Mexican market Claro had managed to carve a 25 per cent stake.The other main competitor in the Latin American market was Televisa S.A. de C.V. (Televisa) the largest TV conglomerate in Latin America with a presence in the United States through its 25 per cent stake in Univisión and a long tradition of content production that had weaved itself into the cultural memory of all Latin Americans. Televisa had been licensing its content to Netflix but pulled it in 2016 and launched its own OTT platform—Blim. A surge of memes on social media criticized Blim as destined to flop a late starter that was too expensive and did not understand millennials. But the mocking game worked as free marketing that put the new service’s name out for all to see and as Blim rushed out of the gates it briefly pulled ahead of Claro Video before settling into third place with 7 per cent of the market in 2017.CINÉPOLIS enters THE over-the-top FRAYAs Netflix landed in Mexico in 2011 Cinépolis decided that it wanted a piece of the OTT market and hired Elizabeth Hopkins to lead the effort. Soon after its product KLIC was launched in early 2014 a Forbes article was headlined “The Cinépolis KLIC Strategy to Defeat Netflix.”Cinépolis expected an edge in synergies between its bricks-and-mortar theatre business and the new Internet venture. Perhaps the product could be launched in the company’s overseas markets too. “We want to fine-tune the business here [in Mexico] first before launching in other countries” Hopkins told Forbes. But she qualified this by saying “The possibility of expanding to other countries is definitely on our radar.”The Mexican ExperienceKLIC’s original ambitions were large. The initial plan was to offer trailers movies TV series and other digital content (documentaries musicals sports fare and film shorts). At a later stage it would add books magazines and video games as well as wallpapers screensavers images and apps. It was even thought that in the long term KLIC might become an Internet hub and a social network. For its first phase however KLIC was launched with a humble dual model: a catalogue of TV series movies and other digital content available on an unlimited basis for a monthly subscription fee plus a separate catalogue of movies that had recently been in theatres available for rent as pay-per-view.Cinépolis soon learned that even with this modest debut it had taken on more than it could handle. For one the content that attracted viewers was so expensive that OTT companies on this model had to wait until they acquired a large user base before they could begin to see profits. This required capital outlays that Cinépolis found difficult to sustain and the user base was not growing as needed due to a psychological and cultural obstacle: Netflix had socialized Mexican users into the view that once they had paid a monthly fee all content on a platform should be available without limits so the dual model (subscription plus pay-per-view) felt to them like double charging.It was hard to communicate to users that some content such as recently released movies or live-streaming events was licensed differently from the rights owners who because of the temporarily high demand for such content insisted on a pay-per-view model. Netflix had avoided such confusion by deciding not to show recently released movies or live-streaming events producing a content catalogue that could be available to consumers in its entirety on a subscription model.Faced with such problems Cinépolis decided relatively quickly that it was best to concentrate more on what it did best: release new movies. Under Marco García de la Cruz who replaced Elizabeth Hopkins in January 2015 as KLIC director the service was rebranded as the place for customers to see recently released films they had missed at the theatre (the overwhelming majority of its listings included what Cinépolis had recently shown on its theatre screens). It added live-streaming events to lure customers to the service: for instance through an agreement with Chivas TV—which broadcast the games of Chivas one of the biggest and most popular soccer franchises in Mexico—it made Chivas games available live on KLIC. It tacked on a curated catalogue of older movies available for a lower price to provide more variety. As a sweetener there were interviews and “behind-the-scenes” content for serious movie buffs. Other than the last item which was offered at no cost everything on the new KLIC was pay-per-view. The subscription model was dropped.Integrating KLIC the Cinépolis life cycle model became as follows: First the movie was shown in theatres and had a 90-day exclusivity window from the premiere. Following this the movie went to KLIC where it was usually sold for a couple of weeks first (electronic sell-through [EST]) and then a rental option was added (TV on demand [TVOD]). Matters would remain thus for three months after which the movie would be dropped from TVOD and remain as EST.This was now an entirely different model than that of Netflix Claro Video and Blim. These other competitors needed huge investments in original content because with a subscription model they were forced to hook users to content available nowhere else and the model was designed with a long horizon to keep users returning—hence the need to produce original TV series (which according to many had consequences even for art in terms of narrative strategy and style). But such investments were so large that a very large user base was necessary for profitability. In 2017 Netflix was still experiencing negative free cash flow due to the huge investments it was making in content creation financed through debt. It expected to recoup this because “the [Netflix-owned] content library can be monetized and amortized over a number of years which should lead to an improvement in profitability over the long run”; however without a doubt this was a very capital-intensive strategy.By contrast KLIC’s capital outlays looked relatively modest. Although it did incur fixed costs to keep its platform running pay-per-view content paid royalties to the content owner—there was no upfront cost. Because of this KLIC could reach profitability with comparatively few users. According to Cinépolis data it already had about one million “registered users” of which about 150000 were “active” users transacting something on KLIC every month. These numbers were nothing compared to those that Netflix boasted but with the right mix and frequency of transactions KLIC expected to be profitable by reaching just 300000 active users (see Exhibit 5).Furthermore KLIC was no longer competing with Netflix. Rather than being a substitute it had become a complement. The Cinépolis numbers bore this out; nine out of 10 KLIC users also had Netflix. The new KLIC however was competing with iTunes. Why would those interested in recent movies not get them from iTunes? After all KLIC was charging similar prices. Cinépolis executives explained that in Mexico the penetration of Apple TV hardware relative to other boxes was quite low. And broadband access to a web page was much more common anyway. KLIC could therefore charge similar prices for its content and still expect a fair number of Mexicans to get recent movies through its service—if only Cinépolis could get them to try it. And that was the challenge.Growing KLICCapturing 300000 active users to achieve profitability may not have sounded like an impossible goal but it was double the number of users KLIC had. And even if KLIC could reach 300000 Cinépolis was aggressive about growth. The company wanted KLIC to thrive and conquer not merely to break even.It was important for Cinépolis to find a way to lure more people to KLIC to turn registered users into active users and to generate more transactions per active user. Naturally Cinépolis was taking advantage of the millions of people who came to its theatres where they would see advertisements for KLIC. Cinépolis also had a loyalty program where theatregoers could gain points redeemable on KLIC. But other opportunities for synergy—or better strategies for existing synergies—between the two businesses likely existed. The challenge ahead was to find a way to exploit these and fine-tune the model.Sánchez was not sure that KLIC was ready for international expansion. What could Cinépolis do to improve KLIC’s performance in Mexico? How should KLIC improve its data gathering on its current users (see Exhibit 6)? Once the model was fine-tuned where should it expand first and how? Sánchez needed to better understand the market in Mexico and abroad and he needed quantitative key performance indicators that would allow him to assess any strategy he chose to recommend. Sánchez had his work cut out for him as he prepared a strategy.Exhibit 1: Cinépolis theatre presence around the worldCinépolis has expanded aggressively around the world. On the American continent in addition to its presence in over 70 Mexican cities and towns Cinépolis is present in cities and towns in other regions including 11 in Central America 19 in the Andes region 30 in Brazil 8 in Argentina and 13 in the United States. It is also present in 19 cities and towns in Spain and in almost 30 cities and towns in India.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Cinépolis and Cinemex market share in Mexico (%)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 3: cinÉpolis social media presence (number of followers)Note: Includes combined totals of Twitter Facebook and Google+ followers.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 4: netflix viewing habits—tv series versus moviesNetflix’s innovation to make all the chapters in a TV series’ season available at once has had a large cultural impact and has resulted in “binging”—consumers watching an entire TV series in a very short period of time. This in itself is an interesting development. But Netflix is always analyzing the consumer data it has to further refine its understanding of viewing habits. This data has answered the following questions: How do Netflix users combine watching TV series and movies? What is the mix of the two? Which is more important? When do they watch one versus the other?Typical Netflix users are heavy TV series consumers. They will watch a movie only in the short break between finishing a TV series—which they likely binged on—and starting a new one. The psychology of this seems to be that they need a break from the heavy commitment—or downright addiction!—that a TV series implies. So before they plunge into a TV series again they take it easy with a movie (or a documentary or a stand-up comedy show). Movies on Netflix work as a kind of “intermission” between strong commitments to TV series.Source: Dana Feldman “Over 30M Netflix Members Have New Binge-Watching Routines Pairing TV And Movies” Forbes December 7 2016 accessed January 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2016/12/07/over-30m-netflix-members-have-new-binge-watching-routines-pairing-tv-movies/#6d4889395411.Exhibit 5: mix of KLIC services and their profitabilityKLIC offers the following three pay-per-view services:TV on Demand (TVOD): This is basically a rental. The user has 30 days to start watching a movie and once they have started playing it they have 48 hours to finish viewing it. During these 48 hours the user can watch it as many times as they want. To view it the user has two options: (1) streaming which means watching it while connected to the Internet or (2) downloading it to their mobile device and watching it online.Electronic Sell-Through (EST): The user acquires the right to reproduce the movie for an indefinite period of time as many times as they want. This applies also to TV series (for which the rental option does not exist). It is tempting to say that the user bought the content but in fact the user has these rights only so long as KLIC continues to have a contract with the content owner. Thus it is more like a very long rental.Live Streaming: This refers to online streaming media simultaneously recorded and broadcast in real time to the viewer. It refers to live events that are watched over the Internet.According to KLIC data with the above mix of transactions KLIC achieves profitability at 300000 active users.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 6: KLIC user data KLIC defines the following user categories:Circumstantial—Flexible with respect to the world of cinema. Not too picky about content or quality. Because they are so flexible they adapt to almost any circumstance for watching movies. They do not look for anything in particular and watch whatever is offered. A consequence of this flexibility is that they can obtain movies through almost any medium.Nesting—These are usually couples with children in school. They do not go to the movies frequently because it is expensive and because having children typically means they must see children’s movies. They prefer affordable entertainment opportunities at home that involve the entire family. Watching movies together at home is fun and generates a good family dynamic. They use several platforms because they want to have a bigger menu from which to choose.Graduate—Has seen a great repertoire of movies. Quite picky about everything having to do with the world of cinema: quality content comfort. Loves loyalty programs. Will not watch just any movie but looks for desired content (thematically). Loves additional and special content about movies and is not easily influenced by what open TV offers because it is a very simple and basic experience. Has multiple platforms for viewing movies because this is the way to get all the specific content this user wants.Trainee—Loves the movies but is not a “film buff.” Is still building a repertoire and is relatively flexible with content. Likes loyalty programs. This user is adaptable to open TV and pay-per-view because they are still building a repertoire. Satisfied with a digital platform and can potentially “mature” to become a graduate.Self-indulgent (Auto complaciente)—Enjoys movies as a way to relax but has no special passion for cinema. Likes to watch movies at home without worrying about a particular theme or genre. Also likes going to the movies but does not do this regularly; this user is just as happy to watch movies at home. In terms of viewing tends to be selfish viewing what they like when they feel like it rather than coordinating with family.exhibit 6 (continued)exhibit 6 (continued)	Source: Company

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-10-31On May 5 2018 Vikram Mehra managing director of Saregama India Limited (Saregama) smiled as he overheard the conversation between a young male customer in his thirties and the salesperson who was packing his Carvaan box at the Reliance Digital store in Mumbai’s Palladium Mall: “My Mother’s Day problems are sorted” the customer said. “I am giving my mother a Carvaan the perfect portable music box. My best childhood memories are when she used to be working and humming these beautiful Hindi songs that played on the transistor. I can’t wait to see her delight when she can listen to all her favourite songs at the press of a button.” Saregama’s share price had reached ₹840 but what excited Mehra was the breakthrough Carvaan had achieved with the Indian consumer. Launched in 2017 the Carvaan was a portable music player with 5000 pre-loaded songs from yesteryear. It came with built-in stereo speakers Bluetooth a USB drive and an FM radio. The device balanced the best of technology with the simplicity of just pressing a button. The product had been a turning point for the 117-year-old music giant. As Saregama converted its conventional copyrighted music into high-quality digital formats and made a rare stretch from the business-to-business (B2B) to business-to-consumer (B2C) markets the firm recorded a revenue jump from ₹2.1 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2016–2017 to its highest revenue so far ₹3. 5 billion in FY 2017–2018. The profit before tax also rose increasing from ₹160.65 million in FY 2016–2017 to ₹411.2 million by the end of FY 2017–2018. The first phase of the change had been positive and Carvaan had played an important role in this success. Mehra now envisioned Saregama becoming the new “₹20 billion IP [intellectual property] content company” in the next five years. To make that happen amid the fast technological and consumer evolution Mehra needed sharply defined short- and long-term strategies for Carvaan and Saregama. THE INDIAN MUSIC INDUSTRY: EVOLVING CONTENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICESIndian consumers’ hunger for entertainment was as large and diverse as the country’s population. PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast that the industry’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in India would reach 10.8 per cent by 2021 more than double the 4.2 per cent growth rate expected globally and that the value of the Indian media and entertainment market would grow from US$27.3 billion in 2016 to reach $45.1 billion by 2021. The largest contributor to the Indian entertainment industry was television at 46 per cent (see Exhibit 1); digital content made up 6 per cent of the market and music 1 per cent. The sectors expected to grow were digital content radio music and films (see Exhibit 1). The media and entertainment industry in India was undergoing dramatic changes (see Exhibit 2).Historically music cassettes had replaced vinyl records in the latter half of the 20th century due largely to cassettes’ advantage of portability. However music cassettes were easy to duplicate and were thus prone to the threat of piracy. S.F. Karim a senior consultant employed with Saregama since 1978 explained:With piracy the legitimate music companies started getting hit. My products were copied and sold at cheaper rates in the market because the market vendors didn’t have to pay for royalty taxes or advertising. Counterfeiting came in as the bigger second problem. The look-alike products were doing rounds in the market and consumers were unable to differentiate. When I sold 2 million 18 million were sold by the market vendors. Moreover this escalated the problem of defective returns. Even if I didn’t sell much I started receiving huge stocks of defective as well as unsellable returns most of which were look-alike counterfeit product.Music companies were equally concerned with noticeable changes in the consumption preferences of music consumers (see Exhibit 3).At the same time the music industry became more cluttered as a number of new firms established themselves in the 1980s (see Exhibit 4). Karim shared his observations:Till then [the 1980s] we had a near monopoly but during that time artists started having other options and moved to companies that could give them a better deal. Similarly firms took a conscious decision to choose the artists. Today things have changed: artists are free to record with different music companies because there is no binding agreement.During this period two kinds of music co-existed—film and non-film music. Film music included a large number of popular movie songs which were produced specifically for Hindi and vernacular movies and constituted an integral part of the movies and their consequent popularity. Non-film music included albums released by independent artists and singers. Thus agreements were of two types. Karim explained:To produce music three things are required: lyricist music director and singer. In non-film the music company has control over all three elements. The company takes care of all promotions and the artist according to the agreed terms earns a royalty that is a certain percentage of the total music sales. However in the case of film music the royalty sharing agreement is between the film producer and the music company. Shortly after 2000 competitive players entered the market and a new business arrangement evolved that guaranteed a minimum royalty paid upfront to the producer irrespective of sales. Ghanashyam Aayeer Saregama’s chief financial officer (CFO) explained this model:Earlier acquisition was on a royalty sharing basis so you sank or swam together but T-Series started offering a minimum guarantee which revolutionized the industry. Producers found the guarantee most convenient because they started getting value up front instead of waiting for a longer payback period. Thus music acquisitions became one of the most important sources of funding films. So today music companies now need huge capital both for IP acquisition as well as for managing music promotions.At about the same time in 2004–2005 the digital era became a reality. Aayeer summarized the change:In this period the telecom companies started introducing digital products like caller ring-back tone IVR [interactive voice recorder] and others. The telecom companies thus became the single biggest revenue earner for all music companies. But slowly fatigue set in and revenues earned by the telecom companies came down to one-third of what they were in the 2010s.However new sources of revenue opened with the entry of over-the-top (OTT) service providers like Gaana and Saavn which operated in India much as their counterparts Netflix and Amazon Prime operated in Western markets. These OTT services provided content directly to viewers over the Internet bypassing companies such as cable or broadcast networks which had traditionally controlled and distributed the content. OTT services distributed streaming media that could be conveniently accessed anytime anywhere. Aayeer explained:OTT is an exciting revenue earner for all Indian music players—including Saregama. A variation of the same OTT service is YouTube. It is by far  the largest music service in the world. It brought down the valuation of music drastically. For one stream YouTube is currently earning anything between one paisa to three paise so it is as low as that. But volumes are huge so earnings are big. The OTT service values one stream at 10–12 paise.In this scenario the other major revenue source for the music company was publishing. Aayeer explained: This means when a song recording gets played in your own house it is for your personal use but if you play it in public say in a restaurant or bar then the music is used for public performance which we refer to as “publishing.” This comes with a cost. In addition the song also has composition and lyrics. Some people can pick up lyrics and give it a tune or some people can add different lyrics to the existing tune. But that tune or those lyrics are again owned by the music company. So for that a licence has to be taken. In this sphere we are one of the biggest because copyright of most of the earlier classics and popular tracks lies with us.SAREGAMA india Limited: India’s OLDEST MUSIC COMPANYThe Company’s LineageSaregama formerly the Gramophone Company of India (Gramophone Company) and popularly known as His Master’s Voice (HMV) was incorporated as a limited company in 1946. As the first overseas Indian branch of Electrical and Musical Industries Limited (EMI) of London HMV’s strong initial inroads into production of music cinema and media content transformed the company into an invincible brand. However increased and aggressive competition around the 1980s led the company into large financial losses. In 1985 legendary business doyen Rama Prasad (R.P.) Goenka of the RPG Group took over the financially ailing Gramophone Company. In August 2000 recognizing that digital media was going to be the future the firm ventured into the digital space and launched HamaraCD.com. The company also strategically acquired marketing rights and licensing agreements from established and successful labels in south India: Sangeetha Music (The Master Recording Company) Sargam Music Private Limited Pyramid Audio (India) Private Limited and Sea Records. In addition with a vision to establish itself as a holistic music and entertainment company Saregama acquired 42.85 per cent of Music World an erstwhile RPG Group–controlled music retail chain. In November 2000 EMI sold off its majority stake to the RPG Group due to the government’s restrictions on transfers of earnings by foreign companies and the company was renamed Saregama India Limited. EMI retained a token stake of less than 10 per cent in the company which was later sold in the open market in 2005. The subsequent years were an era of IP acquisition of new and popular music. Saregama entered the acquisitions market by raising funds from the equity market. Between 2000 and 2005 the company expanded into developing television content and also consolidated and merged a number of its international subsidiaries under the auspices of Saregama India Limited. Aayeer traced these years:We had extensive physical distribution so we approached English studios like Warner Universal Paramount and BBC to use our distribution channels. We offered acquisition backed by minimum guarantee to foreign studios. We also went into film production. However these new expansions did not really take off. Thus in 2013 we liquidated our entire distribution network and we licensed the physical distribution rights to Sony. In 2005 Saregama—the custodian of 300000 songs 23000 artists and 50000 contracts with 13 regional offices and four international offices in London New York Kuala Lumpur and Dubai—was fully acquired by RPG Group. However the volatility in the market and the aggressive competition compounded by changing consumer preferences led the firm into a period of financial stress.RejuvenationIn 2011 the much diversified RPG Group was redistributed among the two sons of R.P. Goenka. The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group a consortium of companies managed by the younger son Sanjiv Goenka was formed. Saregama was now part of this group. Goenka knew that success in the new Indian market needed new and more efficient approaches. Hence he turned to consulting firms McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group for advice on how to lead this transformation. Commenting on his vision and plans for Saregama Goenka saidSaregama is being transformed into a Mumbai-headquartered production house generating content for online consumption. With data getting cheaper on every network we are of the view that the demand for content is only going to grow. So from being one of the richest repositories of Indian music of different genres we are turning ourselves into a production house which will also leverage our strengths from the past.11The vision was exciting but it needed a professional leader who could convert the thought into reality. Thus Goenka handpicked Mehra to lead the next phase of the Saregama saga. Mehra took over the reins in October 2014 as the 17th managing director of Saregama. The company had experienced considerable changes in leadership over its century-old lifespan and was an integral part of the ₹210 billion turnover to RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. Mehra came with impressive academic credentials and a track record in business. He recognized that “on the face of it things may not have been good; but the foundation and the structure was there. Saregama owned the biggest treasure in the country. Practically every piece of music recorded in India from the early 1900s was owned by us.” Mehra took on the challenge and decided that music content would be the key strength on which the new Saregama story would be composed. With a systematic approach based on data-driven consumer insights Mehra got the company back on a growth trajectory. On a lighter note Mehra shared his reason for joining the struggling firm: I had immense faith in the strong foundation and the treasure of yesteryears’ music at Saregama. Secondly it helps that to date the only music I listen to is a Kishore or a Rafi or an Asha. I don’t enjoy new music and this helped me connect more naturally. Third is the genuine free hand given by the promoter ready to take a longer-term view. I feel that in order to do something different there will be success as well as failures and my faith in this goldmine of music is unshakable.To date Saregama had experimented with a certain amount of B2C ventures—HamaraCD.com Music World and others—but had remained largely as a B2B player (see Exhibit 5). This was restrictive according to Aayeer: “The company always had a professional as an MD [managing director]. But the past MDs did not really look beyond the B2B market where you are bound by what your business partner or client wants to do.”Instead of remaining with the conventional and traditional approach of running a music business Mehra decided that a different track was needed:What is convention? If you see the United States right now LPs are making such a big comeback. Premium ones like Bob Marley are selling like hot cakes. You need to keep on reinventing but remember that technology has to be slaved to what consumers want. Consumers may not be able to state in exact words what they want. . . . My firm belief is marketing cannot be done sitting in glass chambers. You need to be sitting in your customer’s home. What we often do is we think that our customers are just like our friends. Our friends drive great cars and live fancy; they think 500 rupees for a drink is nothing. But that’s not India. India is something very different right now.With Mehra’s vision Saregama surged ahead on a two-phased journey. Phase 1: Understanding the Indian Consumer’s Needs In the first quarter of 2015 Saregama conducted a nationwide qualitative study across 23 Indian cities to determine the attitude of Indian consumers toward music and how they used it. Mehra shared:When I joined Saregama the one lesson that everyone in and outside the company starting from my direct reportees to other labels in the industry told me “Customers will not pay you anything. B2B deals will happen. You may license your music to streaming applications TV channels and other movies to use your content but in the end customers will never pay.” And for me this was a huge challenge and the reason behind this study.The consumer insights that the company gained were interesting. Mehra summarized them succinctly: It came out clearly that the older people the crowd aged 35 years and older right now are primary customers of a Kishore Rafi Asha Lata Hemant kind of music. That customer was saying that we had made it very difficult for them to consume our music. Our question was Why? The music is there on so many apps. They said they don’t use the apps; they find them too complicated. People who are 35+ and live in Bombay Delhi and Calcutta—they are more tech-savvy. But a 35+ living in Ludhiana Jabalpur Kochi or Munnar—the belts that are B-level cities—are large consumers of entertainment. They are the people who watch StarPlus television shows today. They are my customers who wait for their sons or daughters to come home do an illegal transfer of 10 songs onto their phones and continue to listen to that music only. Mehra shared three key insights that led him to conceptualize Saregama’s possible offerings. The first had to do with how consumers wanted to access music:I met this lady in Kanpur who remarked “Son our time was good: Vivid Bharti [on AM Radio] was played at my place the whole day. I used to cook the kids used to study and my husband did his work.” . . . For me it was as if someone was talking about my life because that’s how I was exposed to music. My mom was a huge fan of the music. Vivid Bharti was switched on all day literally. And I said maybe there is a case out there. Can I package my music in a fashion so that people can listen to it at the press of a button? People want to be in control of tech objects. There was another man who told me “I want control in my hands; I don’t want to be dependent on my son or daughter and beyond that I just want to enjoy.” There’s a dichotomy in that: I want to have control but I don’t want to have full control. This device [the Carvaan] is not expecting you to do something every minute with it. Turn on Kishore Kumar and for the next 36 hours Kishore Kumar will keep on playing back to back randomly without any advertisement or intervention.The second powerful insight had to do with the purpose of music: This was about nostalgia like going back to those days when life was simpler. Life today is too high-strung. At times one just wants to switch off with no complications. Even a washing machine today has 12 buttons; you have to learn them all which mode I operate in. . . . I go and ask for a normal coffee at a shop—they are going to throw in options half of which I don’t even understand. There are so many choices at any given point of time. But I don’t want to do anything—just lean back and relax. Music is about relaxation.The third insight was how to access the target consumer:Because of nuclear families more and more youngsters are staying away from their homes. Hence every anniversary Diwali [festival] or parent birthday you want to give them something. You will not carry sweets for your parents so you will pick a saree [dress] phone or tie. These are very standard gifts that you can give your parents. But you have given it once now what do you do? Retired Indian parents especially those who retired from the public sector overnight become really stingy and stopped spending money on themselves because they were not sure about pension or retirement income. I might not be able to sell to them a 65+ someone because this kind of purchase might be perceived as an indulgence. However it would be a rational thing for a son or daughter to buy as a gift for a parent.Thus the mandate was clear: there was a large population of those who grew up in the 1980s and earlier and now craved music that appealed to them. But they wanted this to be an easy listening experience in the background with minimum intervention or effort needed from the consumer. Phase 2: Crafting the Value Proposition The consumer insights were key to a revolutionary product that was targeted at the unmet need of a hitherto untapped music market. The targeted users were older consumers 40 years of age or older who were fond of music but the targeted buyer was their children. In May 2017 Saregama had its largest product launch of Carvaan a portable digital music player loaded with 5000 evergreen Hindi songs. The product came in six retro colours and looked like a transistor radio from the 1970s (see Exhibit 6). Mehra outlined the defining components of Carvaan: Firstly convenience. You just press a button and music starts; you don’t have to do anything else. No data connectivity no Internet speed no pirated content. The volume is at a particular level; you don’t need to increase or decrease the volume with every song. Second is nostalgia. There’s a reason why this is being packaged this way. The people who have grown up listening to transistors will remember Murphy’s old transistor. Hence this format. Everywhere nostalgia sells. And we are selling nostalgia and convenience. But it is packaged completely differently so that the consumer is seeing the value.The Bluetooth and the USB [port] are critical. This means that whenever your grandson or granddaughter is coming home the Carvaan becomes your Bluetooth speaker. They can listen to their own English music on this only. What is it doing? It is telling a 65-year-old that what I am buying can also be used by my grandchildren. It just makes our product complete. People often wonder why we have given the Carvaan [the capacity to be] a Bluetooth speaker. There was a lot of thinking that had gone behind everything that is in the product a sort of eureka insight.Carvaan was manufactured in China and was priced at approximately ₹6000 per unit with an almost 20 per cent profit margin. Aayeer confessed “Per-unit profitability is not very enticing for a CFO but this per-unit profit multiplied by a large volume gives us a huge profit. It brings you back into the game.” Launched as a B2C product the Carvaan sold 95000 units just in the first quarter.The content fed into the product was backed by a large repository of Saregama business intelligence data generated every month from its content played on YouTube streaming applications telecom TV channels and radio stations. The playlist was developed using a copyrighted randomizing logic. According to MehraEverything that has gone out there is copyrighted and we will make it very difficult for anyone to do this but you may come out with a different structure altogether. But what will they put inside this? Which music? They can’t put Rafi songs; that’s owned by us. They will have to put a newer singer. Who listens to newer singers? Kids. Will kids go for a physical structure? No they will go for digital. We are very clear in our head who our audience is. Next the company launched a Carvaan Mini in October 2017. This was launched in a lower price category and was positioned more as a Bluetooth speaker that was also loaded with 251 of Saregama’s biggest hits. This was priced around ₹2000. “Actually this was a dealer push kind of a product more for the younger consumer who wants a Bluetooth speaker and gets an added advantage of a select few retro songs” said Mehra. Beginning in early 2018 the firm launched regional variants of Carvaan in Tamil Bengali and Marathi and it had plans for more regional variants.The product was positioned as a nostalgia gift product and made use of selective digital media such as YouTube to broadcast emotion-driven commercials. The launch announcements used traditional print media. The product was sold through Saregama’s own 7000-odd physical distribution outlets and on the Amazon portal. Aayeer described the distribution model: We have set up our own fresh distribution network rather than relying on dealers as was the practice in the past. Then it was all on a “sale or return” model basis which actually killed the music business. The dealers did not have any commitments. Whatever was sold they made 30–35 per cent; the rest they returned to the music company. And then came the time when returns were higher than the sales. Now the basic distribution network has been designed in such a manner that our customers are mainly the electronic stores where cash and carry is the criteria for the sale. So currently the sale is strictly on a cash-and-carry arrangement without any return.The company also developed an organizational structure with clearly defined roles to manage the product verticals (see Exhibit 7). WHAT NEXT?The company sold 95000 units of Carvaan in the first quarter of FY 2017–2018 and expected to sell 300000 units by the close of the fiscal year. According to Aayeer “Carvaan has been the single largest turning point for the financial health of the company” (see Exhibit 8). Aayeer continued “This is a huge advantage as it reduces the reliance only on B2B. Secondly it provides a strong financial shoulder to explore more sustainable long-term strategies.” The journey so far had been extremely satisfying but the road ahead was not without challenges. Karim outlined those: For us Indians music will never come to end. Only the form changed. Earlier there was record then came cassette CD then it went digital; now again with Carvaan we have come back into physical format in a different way. Music survived. But what changed is the consumer and their demands. Their demands increased tenfold and keep changing. So one has to be ready with different ways of reaching the consumer.The company made a clear foray into the B2C market by tapping the needs of the older consumer through Carvaan. At the same time Saregama began producing full-length feature films through Yoodlee Films which created a product that was targeted at the younger tech-savvy consumer. Mehra expressed the need for caution:Right now it is a leap of faith. We challenged the common belief of “no one wants to pay for music” with Carvaan and now we want to challenge the perception that the “movie business is a gamble.” We started Yoodlee Films with a structure that would ensure that every movie at least recovers its cost. The movies are made with smart budgets and selective target-oriented distribution. Now we need to make it into a sustainable business model that does not depend on individuals and would come with a certain profit every time.Aayeer spoke to the financial considerations:Growth can be done in multiple ways. It can be through a platform or through content. We realized that growth with a platform is highly capital intensive. On the content side Carvaan has helped us generate capital with which we can look at IP acquisition now. We have already acquired six or seven new film music as this business needs to be with your own money and not on borrowed capital. Lastly despite being a listed company we were somewhat ignored by the investors as they were never impressed with a B2B kind of business; they think of that as an annuity business. Now once they see a product or a line that can really grow the investors see a promise. With Carvaan we have moved into the United States; we are also releasing in Canada Europe and the Middle East. And the investors are showing confidence. In a year’s span the number of scripts which was about 180 touched around 900. While all of this is good news we cannot remain as a one-product bundle. Of course Carvaan has huge potential and will need to be scaled up and innovated but we need more to keep the business moving and growing. Mehra knew that with success came responsibilities. The previous four years had been extremely productive and Saregama was getting back on the track that Goenka would have envisioned for his company. Yet neither Karim who forecasted ever-changing consumer demands and disruptive technological innovations nor Aayeer who wanted concrete and measurable indices of a robust financial health were wrong when they spoke about a multi-pronged strategy. That being the case Mehra wondered how to balance the B2B and B2C growth engines for Saregama. He saw two alternatives:Option A: Saregama could continue to follow the traditional B2B model where the music company directly produced or procured rights to film as well as non-film music and distributed them through the company’s well-established distributor network. This included distribution through various Internet-based media channels and apps. Could this pure content and IP acquisition focus independent of the platform business bring Saregama back to a formidable growth track or was it too conservative?Option B: Saregama could stretch into its newly-found space in the B2C markets with more innovative variants of the Carvaan product. This was an interesting opportunity if the firm could produce more portable and digitally innovative product variants. Mehra also wondered whether he needed to draw phased business plans—move into one segment and then the other—or explore both the B2B and B2C opportunities simultaneously. He saw a vast range of possibilities and combinations of actionable options. The question was How should Saregama strike the right notes?Exhibit 1: Media and Entertainment Industry in India(a) Percentage Share of Media and Entertainment Sub-Sectors (2016)(b) Growth Current and Projected of the Media and Entertainment Industry Source: Created by the case authors based on “The State of the Media and Entertainment Sector in India” Live Mint October 23 2017 accessed May 6 2018 www.livemint.com/Consumer/Gd1QhKIlEb6kotghQ0ameK/The-state-of-the-media-and-entertainment-sector-in-India.html.Exhibit 2: THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN INDIAThe most interesting and unifying form of entertainment irrespective of consumer demographics or medium was music. However the media and entertainment industry in India was predicted to experience a tectonic shift. Between 1.0 and 1.5 million customers had already moved entirely to digital media consumption and an estimated 4 million Indians were expected to be digital-only consumers by 2020. Over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix Hotstar and Amazon Prime were another fast emerging favoured entertainment channel. This was predicted to be the fastest growing platform with an expected revenue from OTT subscriptions reaching ₹5 billion by 2023.The recorded music business in India was expected to double by 2019 to ₹18.9 billion (US$300 million). While legitimate music consumption still accounted for only 1–2 per cent of the total consumption trends demonstrated that Indian consumers were evolving and responding to entertainment that had a new digital address (see Exhibit 3). Mandar Thakur chief operating officer of Times Music India observed:The “typical Indian mobile consumer” still consumes mobile telco-based products like ringback tones and hence those products will have a long tail whilst the “evolved modern Indian consumer” consumes streaming/subscription services is smartphone-heavy usage savvy and will grow the top end of the market.In either case—the preference by the emerging consumer is not of “ownership” but of “rental.”Frank D’Souza partner in the entertainment and media vertical of PricewaterhouseCoopers India explained:The players in the industry needed to move over from being content and distribution focus to see how a unique user experience can be created for the customers. Strategies that will shape tomorrow’s leaders were . . . extending franchise into an experience building direct to consumer destination aligning operations to fan values.Source: “The State of the Media and Entertainment Sector in India” Live Mint October 23 2017 accessed May 6 2018 www.livemint.com/Consumer/Gd1QhKIlEb6kotghQ0ameK/The-state-of-the-media-and-entertainment-sector-in-India.html; Tim Ingham “India’s Music Business Will Almost Double in 2019 – KPMG” Music Business Worldwide April 23 2015 accessed May 6 2018 www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/indias-music-business-will-double-by-2019-kpmg; Frank D’Souza “Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2017–2021” PWC India accessed May 6 2018 www","[{""start"":1083,""end"":1116,""text"":""Saregama India Limited (Saregama)"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1671,""end"":1682,""text"":""Saregama’s "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2144,""end"":2153,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2725,""end"":2734,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2980,""end"":2988,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8087,""end"":8095,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10407,""end"":10416,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10686,""end"":10695,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10903,""end"":10912,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11161,""end"":11170,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12215,""end"":12224,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13113,""end"":13121,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13203,""end"":13211,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13584,""end"":13593,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13828,""end"":13837,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14141,""end"":14149,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14548,""end"":14557,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15789,""end"":15798,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15916,""end"":15925,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16098,""end"":16107,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20665,""end"":20674,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22569,""end"":22578,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26091,""end"":26100,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28063,""end"":28072,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28485,""end"":28493,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28529,""end"":28538,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28940,""end"":28949,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29020,""end"":29029,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":34900,""end"":34908,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":35001,""end"":35009,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":34956,""end"":34964,""text"":""Saregama"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":40598,""end"":40607,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":40654,""end"":40663,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":41229,""end"":41238,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":41994,""end"":42003,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":42314,""end"":42323,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":42714,""end"":42723,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":43834,""end"":43843,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":43927,""end"":43936,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":44432,""end"":44441,""text"":""Saregama "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3243,""end"":3249,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3791,""end"":3797,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7621,""end"":7627,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":9322,""end"":9328,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10177,""end"":10182,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13681,""end"":13687,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15718,""end"":15723,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15725,""end"":15731,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":29858,""end"":29863,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":30241,""end"":30247,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":30764,""end"":30770,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":29617,""end"":29622,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":33573,""end"":33579,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":33603,""end"":33608,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]}]"

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-03On Monday June 11 2018 intern Jane Smith sat at her desk at a prestigious investment firm looking at the file for the US retail store chain Bon-Ton Holdings Inc. (Bon-Ton). She tried to recall her first-year financial accounting class. Her mentor at the firm had asked her to analyze Bon-Ton’s financial condition as the investment company was managing some client portfolios where Bon-Ton stocks were present. Smith did some initial investigation and discovered that the store was not doing very well. Moreover the US retail industry had been experiencing a systemic meltdown since 2017. More than 15 US retailers had filed for bankruptcy in 2017 the most in the last six years. The 100-year-old company Bon-Ton was no exception. In 2017 it had announced store closures in five states and on January 16 2018 it had entered into forbearance agreements with some of its lenders after the grace period of a US$14 million debt payment expired. On January 31 2018 it announced store closures at 42 locations as part of its rationalization program. The company ultimately filed a voluntary petition for protection against bankruptcy and for reorganization on February 4 2018 under chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Thinking about the risk of retaining Bon-Ton stocks in the client portfolios Smith wondered whether it would be feasible for Bon-Ton to stay afloat and revive its business. How were its competitors faring? Could Bon-Ton survive and if so how? While researching retail companies that had gone bankrupt Smith came across a tool to predict bankruptcy Altman’s Z-score. She planned to complement her analysis with the bankruptcy prediction findings to arrive at a comprehensive analysis of Bon-Ton and recommend a course of action for her firm.ABOUT THE COMPANYBon-Ton Stores Inc. was a department store chain in the United States founded in 1898. The company’s stores offered “fashion apparel and accessories for women men and children.” Its products also included “cosmetics home furnishings and other goods.” As of 2017 the company operated through more than 250 stores in 24 states and the majority of its stores were leased. The company was headquartered in York Pennsylvania which was its administrative and sales support hub. The merchandising and marketing divisions were based in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The company owned and leased distribution centres in Illinois Pennsylvania and Ohio; operated a furniture warehouse in Naperville Illinois; and leased an omnichannel fulfillment centre in West Jefferson Ohio. The company operated under seven retail nameplates across the United States: Bon-Ton Carson’s Younkers Herberger’s Elder-Beerman Boston Store and Bergner’s.BON-TON’S BUSINESS MODELValue PropositionBon-Ton promoted itself as a store that offered “better brands better savings” and it carried a broad collection of quality goods at favourable prices. Bon-Ton stores provided an assortment of nationally distributed brands of apparel accessories footwear cosmetics and home furnishings—for example Anne Klein Calvin Klein Jessica Simpson Kenneth Cole and Under Armour. It also offered exclusive private brands like Laura Ashley Ruff Hewn Relativity and Studio Works. Bon-Ton’s private brands made unique and exclusive fashion products available at compelling price points contributing to competitive differentiation and customer loyalty. The costs associated with in-house private brands enabled Bon-Ton to realize a favourable profit margin.Customer RelationshipThe primary target consumers of Bon-Ton were “women between the ages of 25 and 60 with average annual household income of $55000 to $125000.” The company also targeted a “broader audience” that included men and children.Bon-Ton focused on excellent customer service in order to develop long-standing relationships with its customers. It provided training programs to build an efficient sales force for customers and in addition to phone and online support Bon-Ton had sales associates dedicated to customer sales assistance in selected stores. Many departments had self-service centres for customer convenience. Bon-Ton also implemented a “Let Us Find It” program to assist customers in finding preferred items at other store locations or through the company’s omnichannel assortment which enabled customers to order merchandise for delivery directly to their addresses. Bon-Ton also expanded its order-fulfillment locations to serve omnichannel orders that were directed to store locations. In 2016 Bon-Ton introduced mobile capabilities and provided customers with a “Buy Online Pick Up In-Store” convenience program. To gain customer loyalty it also had a private-label credit card program which offered cardholders rewards including advanced sales notices discounts and event invitations.Vendor ManagementBon-Ton served as a distribution channel that helped merchandise vendors reach their target customers. The company created relationships with vendors by evaluating their sales and profitability and making purchasing decisions based on these analyses. As was prevalent in the industry Bon-Ton received allowances from some of its vendors when sales did not meet specified margins. It also received support from some vendors in the form of allowances and reimbursements for costs incurred to promote and sell on behalf of the vendors. MarketingBon-Ton engaged customers through a multichannel marketing program that included traditional print media broadcasting and digital media. Bon-Ton used localization and personalization strategies in its email and direct marketing to individual customers. Besides advertising and sales promotions it offered purchase incentives and in-store events such as designer appearances and fashion shows to build a solid customer base. Bon-Ton also tried to connect with people by participating in charitable causes and events.Inventory ManagementBon-Ton had a centralized planning and allocation team for all its stores; this team included staff who supported regional and local planning and allocation. The company operated a pre-distribution model “through which we allocate[ed] merchandise on our initial purchase orders to each store. This merchandise [wa]s shipped from our vendors to our distribution facilities for delivery to designated stores.” Bon-Ton had a “reactive distribution technique” for stores with high customer demand. The technique leveraged electronic data interchange inventory management technology to effectively move and deliver prelabelled merchandise to individual stores and it used high-speed automated conveyor systems and hand-held radio frequency devices to track merchandise. Bon-Ton’s third-party carriers distributed merchandise to the stores where most of the merchandise was held. Bon-Ton monitored inventory levels following a seasonal pattern and maintained inventories to support both offline and online sales.ABOUT THE FOUNDER AND chief executive officerMax and Samuel Grumbacher started Bon-Ton in 1898 as S.Grumbacher and Son a one-room store on Market Street in York Pennsylvania founded by Max and Samuel Grumbacher. It had come a long way and now operated in approximately 2.2 million square metres (24 million square feet) in around 260 stores in 24 US states under the different nameplates.Tim Grumbacher had been involved in the company’s management since 1977 and had been the chairman of the board of directors and strategic initiatives officer since June 2013. Kathryn Bufano held positions as president chief executive officer (CEO) and director. After August 25 2017 William Tracy the former chief operating officer took over the CEO role after Bufano stepped down when her contract ended. Although the firm had posted annual losses under Bufano’s tenure Bon-Ton’s press release announcing this change gave no specific reason for Bufano’s resignation. Bufano supported Tracy as he moved into the new role and Tracy stated that he appreciated the board’s confidence and support during his transition.PAST PERFORMANCEBeginning in 2014 Bon-Ton’s downturn was prominent and this was reflected in the company’s share price (see Exhibit 1). Its sales and margin performance were below expectations that year resulting in a greater net loss than that of the prior year. However according to Bufano “It was a year of both challenges and accomplishments.” She felt confident in the long-term potential of the company saying that while the performance was “disappointing we believe the progress we made on our strategic initiatives will contribute meaningfully to future profitability and growth.” In the fall of 2014 the company started a “Voice of the Customer” brand positioning program supported by the tagline “Your Store. Your Style.” According to Bufano this served “as the embodiment of our customer focus and commitment to delivering localized and relevant fashion across our many channels—our brick-and-mortar stores website and app.” Even after executing customer-centric strategies Bufano felt that the company had failed to reflect its accomplishments in the financials (see Exhibits 2–4). In 2016 Bon-Ton realized a “net cost savings of $31 million which was $7 million above the high end” of the company’s target. According to the CEO’s statement in the annual report “2016 was a year of progress for Bon-Ton despite the ongoing challenges that we faced from the retail environment.” The company paid off a $150 million asset-based term loan and $57 million in outstanding principal on its 2017 senior secured notes which slightly improved its liquidity and overall capital structure. However the company still ended up with a net loss of $63 million as of January 2017—around $6 million more than that of the previous year (see Exhibit 2). In 2017 the company continued to meet losses. Sales decreased and the bottom line plunged (see Exhibits 2–7). In the company’s Form 8-K for the first quarter (Q1) of 2017 Bufano stated Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift. That said our omnichannel business once again generated double digit growth and we continued to expand our merchandise offering with highly recognized brands as well as exclusive and private brands that resonate with our customer. Bon-Ton planned to focus on its omnichannel strategy and expand its merchandise portfolio to appeal to customers. Internally Bon-Ton was looking to roll out a profit improvement initiative to achieve additional cost reductions in fiscal 2017. In Q2 2017 as per Bon-Ton’s earnings call the company was optimistic about sales in several categories such as fine jewellery young men’s denim and brands such as Under Armour Tommy Hilfiger and Vera Bradley. According to Tracy the new president and CEO Our cosmetic business performed ahead of our expectations driven by the strength in the fragrance category. We are also pleased with the continued momentum in our e-commerce business which saw a double-digit increase during the quarter. . . .We made great progress on our cost reduction plan as we reduce SG&A [selling general and administrative expenses] by $20.7 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization] was $9.1 million an increase of $6.6 million compared to last year’s second quarter. Second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA includes $12.1 million in benefit from gift card breakage and gains in our real estate transactions.Bon-Ton planned to expand its merchandise offerings “focusing on five core areas” of “gifting cold weather merchandise activewear denim and private and exclusive brands.” Bon-Ton planned to launch FAO Schwarz and expand its Discovery Kids product and its previous success with pantry offerings influenced the company to consider expanding its specialty food business with national and key local brands.RESULTS AND OUTLOOK FOR THE YEARBon-Ton’s third-quarter report of 2017 indicated that there had been progress on a number of strategic initiatives. The report showed that Bon-Ton did the following:Experienced strength in key merchandise categories and brands and drove continued double-digit growth in our omnichannel business (reflecting sales via our website mobile site and our Let Us Find It customer service program) as compared to the third quarter of 2017;Continued to effectively execute on a number of profit improvement initiatives substantially reducing our selling general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for the quarter; andMaintained careful inventory controls as we reduced inventory by 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2016.At the same time the company faced continuing challenges. Sales at stores decreased 6.6 per cent because of warm weather and subdued footfall at malls. Revenue realization was less from proprietary credit card operations miscellaneous revenue departments and gift-and-merchandise return card breakage. Shifts in the mix of merchandise led to a markdown rate that affected gross margins and was in turn intensified by a decrease in the gross margin. Net interest expense increased from the previous year due to a spike in weighted average interest rate and expanded debt.The company’s cash flow from operations and up to $880 million in borrowings provided a source of working capital. The company had planned capital expenditures; beyond these its main cash expenses would be for servicing debt and financing during peak selling seasons.Bon-Ton’s quarter-wise financial performance in 2017 reflected the challenging situation (see Exhibits 5–7). The company indicated that it had started evaluating potential strategic alternatives and engaging consultants for financial restructuring.CHALLENGES In 2017 many retail players closed their stores and planned for more closures in 2018. Many retailers in the United States filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to overburdening debt a decline in footfall and pressure from competitors. Some of the troubled retailers were Sears Payless ShoeSource Inc. Abercrombie & Fitch Toys “R” Us and Gymboree Group Inc. Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were expected to acquire a large amount of the industry’s gains. Amazon had been the chief competitor to all the other retail players. Some other department store industry leaders such as Dillard’s Inc. Kohl’s Corporation Nordstrom Inc. Macy’s Inc. and J.C. Penney Company Inc. were also facing challenges in the current market condition (see Exhibit 8).A Forbes report on retail sales for June 2017 provided “a sobering look at the current state of American retail.” Although year-on-year total sales were up for the first half of 2017 the estimated figures for May–June 2017 were lower. With some exceptions (electronics; appliance stores; sporting goods; and hobby book and music stores) most reporting categories showed monthly declines: “Even non-store retailers . . . reported a 2.8% dip. Overall June retail and food services sales dropped 3.2%” compared to the previous month.Department store and retail companies were affected by consumers’ shifting shopping patterns: from shopping in brick-and-mortar stores to buying through online retail channels and using smart phones and social media. Certainly Internet shopping had been “replacing the hassles of in-store shopping.” Online shopping not only gave consumers “access to more products often at a cheaper price” but it also saved “huge amounts of time when people need a specific item.” Forbes also reported that men were “spending more on clothes. This is an interesting trend especially now that Walmart has acquired men’s clothing retailer Bonobos. Men are paying serious attention to their presentation both at work to advance their careers and in their personal lives when casual attire is called for.”The US retail industry which included mass merchandisers national chain retailers and specialty retailers became highly competitive as online retailers emerged and mobile technology and social media expanded. Competition in the industry revolved around “price quality and selection of merchandise reputation store location advertising and customer service.” While Bon-Ton competed with similar department stores and many other retailers “including store-based mail-order and internet retailers” many of its competitors were in better shape (see Exhibit 8).Moreover prevailing economic conditions and various economic factors affected consumers’ spending habits especially with respect to the merchandise that Bon-Ton stores sold. “Reduced consumer traffic in traditional shopping malls” where most of the Bon-Ton stores were located had caused a decline in the company’s financial condition and operating results.Customer traffic and conversion both in stores and online had important effects on sales and in-store sales were highly dependent on the geographical locations of stores. As demographic patterns changed many of Bon-Ton’s current locations had lost appeal. Financial conditions that affected the operators of some shopping malls where Bon-Ton stores were located had also affected the company’s sales.Declining operating performance and a severe liquidity crisis meant that vendors might demand accelerated payments resulting in “a significant adverse impact” on Bon-Ton’s operating cash flow and liquidity. As of January 28 2017 the company had a total debt of $989.3 million which included capital lease and financing obligations.This indebtedness curbed Bon-Ton’s ability to “replenish inventory at competitive prices and terms generate sales and maintain . . . stores” and price increases for “merchandise raw materials fuel and labour or their reduced availability” threatened to increase the company’s cost of goods further damaging its financial results. To create an online presence Bon-Ton invested in technology and made operational changes which increased customer traffic but did not significantly affect the company’s bottom line. The “cost to ship merchandise to customers and the competitive pressures to offer free or reduced shipping” as well as the “significant cost to provide and maintain the infrastructure and systems necessary to operate [an] omnichannel business” all led to lower margins.The turnover rate in the retail industry was very high. Bon-Ton faced significant costs—for example for wages and benefits such as health care—to attract and retain key employees.Bon-Ton’s real estate exposure was significant. The company owned or leased approximately 260 stores. Its store lease agreements included both a fixed rent portion and a variable portion based on the sales percentage at each location. These agreements also prevented stores from closing before the contracts terminated although some stores that were in economic distress were allowed to close. However leases and other obligations restricted Bon-Ton’s ability to close unprofitable owned or leased stores and forced the company to operate some locations at a loss. Moreover a decline in real estate values posed a risk to Bon-Ton’s borrowing.ANALYSTS’ OPINIONs ABOUT THE COMPANYSmith also went through some analyst reports. Neil Saunders a retail analyst of GlobalData (data and insights solution providers) noted that Bon-Ton’s offerings were undifferentiated and unclear and had become increasingly irrelevant to consumers. “Many of Bon-Ton’s stores were in areas where the availability of branded fashions and home wares was traditionally poor” Saunders said. “However while this once made them a focal point and a destination for local shoppers the internet has done much to change this dynamic and has made the stores less relevant.”Another analyst made a similar comment. “Bon-Ton is kind of a microcosm of the department store industry” said Philip Emma senior analyst for restructuring intelligence firm Debtwire. “Their business model is selling brand-name merchandise that consumers recognize in a mall-based setting—and that’s the segment of retail that’s had the biggest struggle.”ALTMAN’S Z-SCOREOne of the most popular bankruptcy prediction models was developed by Edward I. Altman in 1968. Altman applied a statistical technique called multivariate analysis to a mix of financial variables to detect the likelihood of solvency in times of distress. Each company was given a score (Z-score) calculated through a discriminant function of the five variables weighted by coefficients. The model had been revised several times for different contexts (e.g. for private firms). The Z-score model for non-manufacturing firms and for companies in emerging markets outside the United States was introduced in 1995 (see Exhibit 9). The Z-score model excluded industry-sensitive asset-turnover variables from the last revised model to minimize the industry effect.CONCLUSIONOn February 6 2018 Bon-Ton announced that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware had approved its voluntary petitions for financial restructuring. With existing losses and significant loans what actions might put Bon-Ton back on track? What measures could the company take to fight bankruptcy? Smith prepared to analyze these questions from the perspectives of both Bon-Ton and an investor in order to present her findings to the investment company.EXHIBIT 1: BON-TON—STOCK PRICE CHANGES Source: Excerpted from “The Bon-Ton Stores Inc.

The Academy had just completed its fifth year of operations and Sharp was exploring potential expansion opportunities to grow the business and enhance profitability. He wanted to determine if it was a good time to open a second location in another part of the city and was also considering whether The Academy should invest in new equipment at its existing location. Prior to making a decision Sharp wanted to take a detailed look at current industry trends and the competitive landscape. He also wanted to assess The Academy’s financial performance to determine if now was the right time to make either of these moves. He needed to work quickly to pitch his chosen expansion strategy to the other owners at their meeting in two weeks. He gathered The Academy’s financial statements (see Exhibits 1 and 2) and got to work.  THE FITNESS industryDue to increasing obesity-related health concerns the gym health and fitness clubs (GHFC) industry in Canada was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent from 2017 to 2022. The industry generated CA$3.1 billion in revenues 61.4 per cent of which was attributed to fitness and recreation membership fees. Several population factors played a role in the GHFC industry’s success including per capita disposable income decreasing leisure time the number of adults aged 20 to 64 and the adult obesity rate. Adults aged 20 to 64 tended to have the highest per capita income making them the target consumer for industry players particularly as this age group was continuing to increase. Discretionary spending allocated toward health and fitness was increasing and industry profits were expected to grow from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent. In contrast to traditional gym memberships services such as personal training and individualized nutrition planning were becoming increasingly popular. Further per capita disposable income was expected to continue to grow in the coming years.The decrease in leisure time was another key factor to the industry’s success. As adults were spending more hours on the job or looking after family fitness activities and other recreational pursuits were becoming lower-priority items. However the adult obesity rate was expected to grow over the next five years. To help reduce the strain associated with higher healthcare costs many businesses and health insurance providers wanting to incentivize employees and clients to be more active were subsidizing gym memberships. The GHFC industry was still characterized by its growth phase although increasing variable costs in 2017 had resulted in a slightly declining contribution. The majority of operational costs were comprised of facility upkeep and labour costs but despite the high upfront capital requirements barriers to entry were low. Incumbents were able to increase profits and minimize revenue volatility by offering 12- or 24-month memberships and hiring part-time coaches. Given the low barriers to entry many new facilities established themselves to benefit from the industry’s rapid growth.CrossFitSince its founding by Greg Glassman in 2000 CrossFit had become one of the fastest growing global fitness trends. With over 13000 CrossFit affiliates across 120 countries by 2017 over four million people were participating in the sport. CrossFit combined various elements of fitness including weightlifting gymnastics and cardiovascular endurance. Its aim was to emphasize functional fitness with the goal of improving participants’ health and quality of life. A significant component to CrossFit’s success was in the community it created—CrossFit gyms created a safe space for people of all walks of life to come together to work toward their common goals. Members and coaches were supportive of one another and were often seen cheering each other on to complete workouts. The strong CrossFit community forged through completing challenging workouts together helped the sport gain much of its traction in the GHFC industry.Competition was another tool used to strengthen the CrossFit community. CrossFit headquarters (CFHQ) held three annual competitions: the Open the Regionals and the CrossFit Games. The Open took place over five weeks during February and March and allowed every CrossFit participant around the world to take part. Each Thursday for the five weeks one workout was released and all participants were given until Monday night to complete the workout at an official CrossFit affiliate and submit their scores online. At the end of the Open the top athletes were invited to the next round of competition the Regionals. There were 18 regions around the world each hosting the three-day competition. The top 40 men women and teams were invited to compete at the CrossFit Games in August where thousands of spectators gathered to watch. The Open gave all participants the ability to compete directly with the fittest athletes in the world which was unique to the sport.In order to use the trademarked CrossFit name gyms—or boxes as they were referred to in the CrossFit community—registered and paid annual affiliate fees to CFHQ. CrossFit coaches were certified by the company to administer fitness knowledge in a standardized way though affiliates were run with complete autonomy. Boxes therefore had vastly different environments—from the difficulty of workouts to the competitiveness to number and type of classes offered.In addition to the strong community fostered in the sport CrossFit boxes differed from traditional gyms in several other ways including the distinct physical differences in facilities. CrossFit boxes were typically located in large warehouse-style spaces with significant open areas without typical gym equipment. Instead members could find pull-up bars squat racks rowing machines free weights sandbags tires and a myriad of other functional fitness tools. This allowed for plenty of space to conduct coached CrossFit sessions. The majority of members took part in group classes as opposed to working out alone which also helped strengthen the local community. Members frequently commented on how a CrossFit box felt like a safe space to work toward personal fitness goals and this was not necessarily the case for traditional gyms. Finally boxes offered an element of friendly competition in group classes which helped push members to perform to the best of their abilities—this form of friendly competition was also not typically seen in traditional gyms. ConsumersCrossFit gym consumers considered several factors when determining which affiliate to join. The priority of each of these factors depended on the type of consumer seeking the training facility. The majority of CrossFit members had an average annual household income of over US$150000 and could be categorized into three broad groups: beginners and casuals regulars and competitive athletes. Beginners and casuals consisted of individuals trying the sport for the first time and those attending once or twice per week. This consumer group valued proximity cost and frequency of classes to meet their busy schedules. At most CrossFit affiliates beginners were required to take part in an initial foundations course which showcased the quality of the coaching staff and facility. The course was influential in determining whether a beginner would continue with their memberships or try another gym.Regulars typically attended classes four to six times per week and many of these consumers had experienced attending more than one CrossFit gym allowing them to be more selective. Knowing what other gyms offered these members valued the quality of programming coaching and facility. They were often willing to travel further away for a gym that met all of their requirements. Community and frequency of classes were also key factors for regulars as they tended to spend more time at the gym and had busy schedules. Competitive athletes prioritized facility size available equipment and proximity. These consumers were not concerned with programming and coaching quality as they tended to pay for individualized programs and worked out on their own. They did not participate in group sessions and were not concerned about the frequency of classes. They preferred to work out at official CrossFit affiliates and their gym needed to have enough space and equipment for them to complete their workouts. If multiple gyms in the area offered the same space and equipment proximity and cost became the next most important choice factors.Traditional gyms were typically focused on a different type of consumer; however of consumers falling within the CrossFit niche traditional gyms competed for the beginners and casuals group. CrossFit gyms tended to focus on beginners casuals and regulars as their target consumer groups because they comprised the bulk of revenues. Competitive athletes often did research prior to seeking out the specific gyms they wanted to train at.CompetitionGoodLife FitnessGoodLife Fitness (GoodLife) was the largest health club chain in Canada operating over 385 locations with seven of these locations in Kitchener Ontario. Established almost 40 years ago GoodLife had grown to capture 21.2 per cent of industry market share making it the largest player in the market. In line with its objective to be the most convenient health club GoodLife offered two types of biweekly membership options. The first membership was offered at a cost of $29.99 biweekly with a one-time enrolment fee of $179.99. The second membership option cost $34.99 biweekly waived the enrolment fee and required members to commit to a full year of payments. GoodLife also owned Fit4Less a price-sensitive alternative. Goodlife offered a traditional gym set-up in addition to group classes for a variety of different interests including yoga strength and cardio. It also offered personal training services for those wanting a more individualized fitness program. Planet FitnessEstablished in 1992 Planet Fitness had worked on establishing itself throughout the United States Canada Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico and had over 1400 locations 23 of which were in Canada and one of these locations was in Kitchener Ontario. Planet Fitness offered a traditional gym setup similar to GoodLife although it did not offer coached group classes. Planet Fitness was geared toward beginners and casuals and emphasized its mantra of creating a “judgment free zone.” Memberships started at $10 per month. Planet Fitness had approximately 1 per cent market share in the industry.Central Fitness KitchenerFounded in 2012 Central Fitness Kitchener (Central) was a local fitness facility offering a variety of coached group classes including those focusing on gymnastics strength conditioning and mobility. A variety of membership options was available and tended to average approximately $160 per month. It was also an official CrossFit affiliate gym. Central Fitness was one of the two largest competitors in the local CrossFit space the other being The Academy. Central currently operated out of a 15000 square-foot (about 1395 square metres) facility and was considering moving to a larger facility a few kilometres away from The Academy as the current facility was only accessible by one bus route in the city. In addition to group classes Central offered personal training services. Other CompetitorsSeveral other CrossFit affiliates operated throughout the city. These affiliates typically had smaller facilities (less than 3000 square feet or 280 square metres on average) and offered fewer training times but they were convenient to consumers who lived nearby. Given their limited financial capabilities and differing business objectives they were not primary competitors of The Academy. Many other traditional gyms also operated in the Kitchener area targeting a different consumer group than The Academy and its direct competitors (see Exhibit 3). The AcademyThe Academy began operations in Kitchener Ontario in 2012 and was founded by four partners who had a common passion for fitness and improving the health of their community. Over its years in operation The Academy had expanded to offer 50 group classes per week and was constantly looking to add new classes based on member demand. The gym was open for 52 weeks of the year. The gym’s popularity could be seen by how full the classes were particularly during weeknight evenings. Coaches offered personal training and were CrossFit Level 1 certified and were or had been competitive athletes throughout their lives. Coming from a variety of backgrounds including gymnastics powerlifting Olympic weightlifting and functional fitness the coaches shared one common goal—to help The Academy’s members improve and work toward their personal fitness goals. The Academy operated in a 5500 square-foot (about 511 square metres) facility and was continuing to grow rapidly with over 400 current members. After graduating from Fanshawe College in 2012 with a diploma in Fitness and Health Promotion Sharp spent over two and a half years coaching at GoodLife Fitness prior to joining The Academy where he served as head coach and co-owner for over three years. Sharp spent years competing in athletic disciplines such as martial arts hockey and functional fitness before pursuing a career in coaching and was still a competitive CrossFit athlete. Sharp’s talent for fitness programming allowed him to successfully launch his own personal training business two years ago through which he personally coached several athletes to compete at a regionals level. Sharp was dedicated to the fitness process and passionate about helping his clients reach their health and fitness goals.The community aspect of CrossFit was important to The Academy and was embodied through community events annual intra-gym competitions and the daily support members and coaches shared when milestones were achieved. These factors led to the gym becoming one of the largest CrossFit communities in the city. It was important to Sharp that any future growth experienced by The Academy fostered the community that had been created. The Expansion OpportunityWith the increasing number of competitors setting up CrossFit gyms within the city Sharp was keen to implement a strategy that would allow The Academy to continue to grow and remain one of the top training facilities. He believed that opening a second location would allow The Academy to capture a segment of the market that was at present limited by distance and travel time. Sharp also considered that a second location would provide The Academy with a competitive advantage as Central also had only one location in the city. However Sharp was not sure how successful a second gym would be and he knew it would require a significant amount of his time. He was concerned that this might affect the quality of coaching at the existing location.With or without any expansion Sharp expected The Academy’s sales to grow by the same percentage as the prior fiscal year. He expected the second location would generate 40 to 80 per cent of The Academy’s projected 2018 sales. As with the existing location he expected all the new sales to be made on credit. Under both scenarios he expected 5 per cent of the existing location’s projected fiscal 2018 sales to be lost to cannibalization as existing members would benefit from a closer location and transfer their memberships. Sharp located a facility space in the east part of the city which was available to rent for $40000 per year. He also planned on hiring a part-time administrative assistant for an annual salary of $30000. All other cash expenses for the new location would remain at the same percentage of sales as The Academy’s fiscal 2017 expenses although Sharp expected to realize several cost synergies. Expenses including interest and bank charges professional fees meals and entertainment and conventions and courses would not be incurred by the second location and 50 per cent of business taxes licenses and memberships expenses would be allocated to the new location.The initial investments required to set up the new facility included renovation and installation of fixtures totalling $30000. The fixtures comprised one third of the investment and had a useful life of five years. Sharp was debating between two sets of equipment—one that could facilitate classes up to 15 people or a smaller set facilitating classes up to 10 people. These equipment costs were $60000 and $45000 respectively and he anticipated that if sales were on the higher end of his estimate larger class sizes would be necessary (see Exhibit 4). Both equipment sets would be depreciated on a straight-line basis over five years after which each would be donated and replaced. To promote the new location Sharp wanted to spend $15000 on a launch event. Sharp considered that cash tied up in working capital accounts would also change. He projected that the added operations would average 35 days of accounts payable and 10 days of accounts receivable. No initial inventory investment was anticipated. Sharp wanted to ensure the decision met a hurdle rate of 20 per cent.THE FACILITY UPGRADEThe second alternative Sharp considered was upgrading and adding to the equipment at the existing location. He envisioned the facility upgrade would have a positive impact on The Academy in several ways. Given the new equipment the upgrade would allow the gym to offer additional classes and the new equipment would also improve the aesthetic appeal of the facility. However a significant capital investment would be required in addition to increased cost of sales and he was uncertain of the return. Sharp knew that some members might want to use only the new equipment.To estimate additional sales arising from the upgrade Sharp considered that a fair estimate would be to use the same average revenue per class. He expected one to four additional classes to be offered per week and that 80 per cent of these sales would be made on credit. Given the additional classes he anticipated cost of sales to remain at the same percentage of sales as in fiscal 2017. The new equipment would require repairs and cleaning and those expenses were also expected to remain at the same percentage of sales as in fiscal 2017. In the event that four classes would be added per week utilities would increase by $500 annually. Administrative duties would increase due to the greater volume of classes and Sharp believed that The Academy’s office expense would increase by $40 per month. If only one class was added this expense would increase by $24 per month. The cost of the upgrade—equipment and installation—was expected to be $28000. The new equipment would be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 10 years. To advertise the new classes being offered Sharp was going to put $2000 toward a media campaign that would run immediately leading up to the launch of the upgraded facility. He estimated the same permanent changes in working capital account estimates as with the new location alternative.Sharp expected most operating costs to remain at the same percentage of sales as in 2017 except for rent depreciation professional fees meals and entertainment and courses and conferences which were expected to remain at the same dollar amount as in 2017. Unless otherwise noted all items on The Academy’s statement of financial position were to remain at the same dollar amount as in 2017. Sharp was curious to see how much cash The Academy would have remaining on hand at the end of 2018.DecisionSharp was anxious to implement a growth strategy soon. He needed to decide whether given the risks involved The Academy should pursue the facility upgrade or add a new location. He was curious to determine how quickly the company could see a return on its investment. However he also wanted to evaluate the business environment risks associated with not moving ahead with the upgrades. After deciding on the best solution for The Academy Sharp wanted to project an income statement and balance sheet for fiscal 2018 in order to assess the overall impact on net income and the business’s cash balance. Before presenting his ideas to the other partners he knew he needed to develop an action plan and contingency plan for any decision he made.

Machacek was the owner and managing director of SÄBU Holzbau GmbH (SÄBU) a construction company in Bavaria Germany with around 40 employees and €7.5 million in yearly turnover. SÄBU specialized in erecting public buildings using an innovative prefabricated module construction technology. Three key employees had just decided to leave the company. One of them had worked at SÄBU for 19 years.Machacek had been feeling lonely in her management position for a while. She had been making all the important decisions on her own because she feared incurring too much risk or spending too much money. The consequence was that she was caught in the operative business to such an extent that development projects in different parts of the company could not be implemented due to the number of issues that remained undecided. Moreover Machacek received a lot of negative feedback from customers because the company was unable to meet the agreed deadlines. As a consequence customers also began to question the invoices that they received and payment morale decreased considerably. Employees were also disgruntled complaining that they did not know what they were allowed to do and not do. One of the former employees succinctly summarized the situation at SÄBU in one word: “chaos—there was a constant loss of information people were getting loud in meetings and customers were sending furious e-mails.” Together with a colleague the former employee had tried to address the chaos in the distribution of tasks and in the internal communication several times but it was all in vain. Finally he did not feel able to cope with the situation anymore and resigned. After the third key employee left SÄBU Machacek knew that she urgently needed to find a way to lead the company out of its crisis situation.ABOUT SÄBU HOLZBAU GMBHIn 1924 Jakob Buchen founded the Buchen Sawmill (Sägewerk Buchen in German abbreviated as SÄBU) in Morsbach in the German state of North Rhine-Westfalia. Over the following decades the company restructured and extended its product portfolio several times. Product offerings included for example wooden storage boxes prefabricated wooden houses garden sheds and construction trailers. To extend market coverage a new plant was opened in Ebenhofen in Southern Germany in the 1960s. Wilhelma Klein the founder’s daughter took over leadership of the new plant which was soon legally and economically separated from the founding firm becoming SÄBU Holzbau GmbH. During the 1990s this company specialized in turnkey projects based on innovative timber construction systems used especially for public sector buildings such as schools childcare facilities and administrative offices. The company also constructed high quality log houses—a business area that was later abandoned.Machacek became managing director of the company in 1998. About the same time Friedrich Nagel joined SÄBU. He soon took over the role of an authorized officer for the company. Colleagues described the second member of SÄBU’s top management team as “a very creative and innovative person” and as “a tinkerer who always tries to find new technical solutions and improvements.” Nagel was one of the main driving forces behind the development of SÄBU’s innovative modular timber construction system. With the new system the company prefabricated walls ceilings and base elements. These elements could then be combined in the plant into complete building modules. This enabled SÄBU to realize larger projects in short construction periods—shorter even than those of competitors that worked with steel modules. SÄBU also made further leaps forward by developing construction systems based on innovative combinations of the building materials timber concrete and steel.INNOVATIVE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGYTimber construction systems hybrid construction and modular designs were the three main pillars of the innovative SÄBU building concept.In timber construction systems parts of the building were industrially prefabricated thus reducing costs and building time. A further advantage of this construction method was the ability to produce parts of the building independent of weather conditions under constant temperatures and under continuous quality control. It was also possible to integrate sanitary heating and electrical installations as well as windows and insulation layers directly in the plant. This enabled SÄBU to erect functional buildings in extremely short construction periods with low levels of emissions and noise exposure.SÄBU was a pioneer in the field of hybrid construction in which the excellent insulating properties and ecological advantages of timber were combined with the advantages of concrete and steel in strength fire protection and acoustic protection. The building shell consisted of timber elements while the ceilings were made out of concrete a building material that could bridge large spans and function as a heat reservoir. SÄBU’s hybrid construction method generated buildings that excelled in energy efficiency and met Germany’s high standards for passive houses (zero-energy buildings).The company’s modular designs used room modules that were made with a primary supporting framework of timber or steel. The modules could be flexibly combined facilitating rapid and cost-efficient construction of individually adapted functional buildings. There were however two major preconditions for the system to work effectively: precise planning and exact coordination of all production and assembly steps. The modular construction system was particularly suitable for extending buildings adding stories and dismantling and relocating buildings.ENVIRONMENTAL AND QUALITY MANAGEMENTAt SÄBU traditional craftsmanship was combined with modern manufacturing processes. The company generally used construction materials that were environmentally friendly and did not have harmful effects on health. For example all timber that was used came from sustainable PEFC-certified forestry sources. Other building materials also needed to meet high environmental standards by means of an environmental product declaration.SÄBU’s management was always striving to systematically ensure that the company’s products and processes conformed with high quality standards. Examples included comprehensive inspection of incoming goods and extensive supervision of the construction by a project manager at the building site. Twice a year the processed materials were checked in unannounced external quality controls that were conducted by an independent officially accredited testing institute. Assembly at the building site was also externally assessed on a voluntary basis. SÄBU had received an external quality assurance certification for industrialized building and pre-fabricated houses.WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERSSÄBU’s primary customers were in the public sector. The competitive tendering procedures were conducted based on legal regulations. Price was usually one of the main deciding criteria. With its innovative hybrid construction technology SÄBU was able to match the prices of much larger competitors at the same or even a higher quality level.The management of SÄBU closely monitored market trends. Tenders in the public sector were analyzed to understand customer requirements and trends. If it was possible to meet the requirements of a tender with the SÄBU hybrid construction system in a cost-efficient way the company would make a calculation and submit an offer.SÄBU offered fixed prices and completion dates. When the company made a submission for a tender it committed to consulting the customer in a clear and honest way. During this phase it was critically important to impress upon the customer that it would be working with a very competent partner if it chose to work with SÄBU. Therefore the company had a highly qualified sales team whose members considered themselves to be a technical complement to the customer’s organizational structures. From the very beginning when an order was received members of the planning team were included in the communication with the customer.SÄBU was almost exclusively working as a general contractor. The customers ordered turnkey buildings and SÄBU was a single source for all construction services. To complete the building in time and in the agreed quality a team of engineers technicians carpenters joiners and commercial employees needed to co-operate in a well-coordinated way. In addition SÄBU needed to closely co-operate with partner firms that were responsible for different construction services such as electrical and sanitary installations. The suppliers and subcontractors were selected not only on the basis of price but also on the basis of their reliability and quality. SÄBU preferred to work in long-term partnerships. “Thus the partners know what we are expecting of them and we know that we can rely on them” Machacek explained.“I CANNOT WORK LIKE THIS ANYMORE”After three key employees left the company SÄBU’s top management team realized that there was an urgent need for change. “I wanted to move forward and Christine Machacek said ‛yes’ but she did not do ‛yes’” said Nagel. “I sold too many products and that is how we overburdened the employees. They simply could not manage it anymore.” Nagel wanted innovation and growth while Machacek preferred to be on the safe side and avoid taking risks. He noted “I always wanted to accelerate and she was constantly on the brake.”The problems at work continued to haunt Machacek at night. One night she had a dream in which Nagel said to her “I have a new company car. Let us go for a drive.” He sped up into the mountains driving around dangerous curves. Machacek was terrified and indeed the car was too fast and eventually left the roadway. The car went down the slope but luckily it got stuck so that both were able to leave the car unharmed. After climbing back up to the road Nagel just said “Mrs. Machacek we have a meeting. We need a new car.”Nagel was astonished when Machacek told him about her dream. As it happened he also had a dream at the same time. In Nagel’s dream he was travelling to a business meeting in Stuttgart on a small motorbike. The motorbike first had a flat tire and then also ran out of fuel so that Nagel was unable to make it to the meeting on time. “My interpretation of this dream” said Nagel “is that the owner–manager was unable to provide me with the necessary resources to perform well in my job.”At that point in time Machacek realized that something needed to be fundamentally changed in the company. “I cannot work like this anymore” she thought. “All the decisions are piling up here with me—all the problems the overload.” Was there a way out? “I will never let consultants into my house” was one of Machacek’s maxims that the SÄBU team had heard over and over again. For the first time Machacek considered whether she should abandon her own precept.","[{""start"":1118,""end"":1136,""text"":""Christine Machacek"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1163,""end"":1172,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1555,""end"":1564,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1989,""end"":1998,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2853,""end"":2862,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3947,""end"":3956,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10063,""end"":10072,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10490,""end"":10499,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10859,""end"":10868,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10276,""end"":10285,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10673,""end"":10682,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11107,""end"":11116,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11180,""end"":11189,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11661,""end"":11670,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12034,""end"":12043,""text"":""Machacek "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11947,""end"":11958,""text"":""Machacek’s "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1270,""end"":1278,""text"":""Germany "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3435,""end"":3443,""text"":""Germany "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1628,""end"":1632,""text"":""She "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1695,""end"":1699,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1783,""end"":1787,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2872,""end"":2876,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12062,""end"":12066,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11779,""end"":11783,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10702,""end"":10706,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10600,""end"":10604,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10300,""end"":10304,""text"":""she "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1591,""end"":1595,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1679,""end"":1683,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12081,""end"":12085,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11204,""end"":11208,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10741,""end"":10745,""text"":""her "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-09-05As a physician Jane Philpott passionately worked to improve life for others. But some health care issues could not be addressed by doctors so she often considered public office. The idea seemed crazy until a 2010 encounter with former Canadian prime minister Paul Martin; he convinced Philpott that idealism had a place in politics if someone was lucky enough to pick the right party obtain a riding nomination win an election and garner influence in a ruling government. Five years later after joining the Liberal party and being elected as the federal member of parliament (MP) for the Markham–Stouffville riding in Ontario Philpott was sworn in as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s minister of health making history as a member of Canada’s first gender-equal cabinet. As one of Trudeau’s most trusted ministers Philpott was able to influence public policy to a degree beyond what she might have imagined when entering politics—which is why when she tendered her resignation in March 2019 she openly acknowledged that it was a difficult decision to quit her latest prestigious post supervising the nation’s fiscal operations as President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government: “[It] grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate.”For almost four years Philpott and her female cabinet colleagues had personified Trudeau’s self-proclaimed feminist values. But on February 12 2019 Jody Wilson-Raybould a fellow cabinet minister resigned as Minister of Veterans Affairs and a member of cabinet after Trudeau used Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence on his team to deflate an explosive allegation published in the media. According to a Globe and Mail report Trudeau’s office had pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC-Lavalin) a Montreal-based engineering and construction firm avoid a criminal trial related to alleged corrupt business dealings in Libya. After she resigned from cabinet Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee that she had been moved from the prestigious position of justice minister to her position as Minister of Veterans Affairs after she fought what she called a “consistent and sustained effort” to influence the SNC-Lavalin file. According to Wilson-Raybould she had been pressed by “many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in [her] role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.” Those pressing Wilson-Raybould were worried they said about how a criminal conviction in the SNC-Lavalin case could impact jobs and the government’s chances of re-election in 2019.Philpott considered it an “enormous privilege” to serve Canadians as a member of cabinet. But like Wilson-Raybould she saw “solemn principles at stake . . . the independence and integrity of our justice system.” And as her resignation letter to Trudeau stated “I must abide by my core values my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.” Submitting her resignation letter had to have been difficult for Philpott. Prudence alone dictated remaining in cabinet and using her influence to effect positive change from within. When campaigning for office Philpott had told voters “For me a seat in the House of Commons is not a target it’s a tool. It’s the tool that you and I will use to make this community better—to make this country better.” As a cabinet minister she could use that tool with surgical precision. Her influence would be significantly less outside cabinet. Did she make the right decision to resign over principles?THE RISE OF INFLUENCEA person of faith and conviction Philpott was born on November 23 1960. The oldest of four sisters with religious parents—Audrey Little an elementary schoolteacher and Wallace Little a Presbyterian minister—she was taught selflessness as a virtue. Her formal education started in her picturesque hometown of Cambridge Ontario where she attended Hillcrest Public School and Galt Collegiate Institute. After graduating high school as a provincial scholar in 1979 Philpott studied medicine at Western University (formerly known as the University of Western Ontario). She then completed a residency in family medicine at the University of Ottawa and a fellowship in tropical medicine in Toronto. In 1986 Philpott married Paul Eric Philpott whose father became a Presbyterian minister after retiring from a career as an accountant. Together Philpott and her husband made a commitment to missionary work by joining an interdenominational evangelical Christian group. In 1989 they travelled to the Republic of the Niger where Philpott practised medicine and developed a training program for village health workers. While the young couple worked in the West African countryside in 1991 Emily Katherine Philpott their two-year-old daughter and her baby sister Bethany Jane contracted serious bacterial infections. The family raced to the nearest hospital two hours away which proved to be too late for Emily. But the death of their daughter did not weaken the couple’s passion for helping others. Following Bethany Jane’s full recovery they continued their missionary work. “Even though it was obviously very difficult for me at the time” Philpott later explained “what came out of that was an understanding that African mothers lose their babies by the thousands every day. And so as hard as it was for me why should an African mother expect that 25 per cent of her children won’t live to the age of five?” After almost a decade working abroad Philpott and her family returned to Canada where she joined the Markham Stouffville Hospital and after completing a master’s degree in health became an associate professor at the University of Toronto. In 2004 Philpott challenged her hospital colleagues to contribute a day’s pay to help fight the AIDS pandemic raising CA$33000. The following year when Philpott temporarily returned to Africa to help during a food crisis the Give a Day initiative to recognize World AIDS Day raised almost $100000 from across eight hospitals. By 2006 after the campaign was expanded to teachers lawyers flight attendants unions and businesses it was raising more than half a million dollars annually. Despite serving the community as a doctor and educator the busy mother now of four could not help wondering if she should try to gain influence over how Canada addressed the big-picture systemic issues that affected health and wellness. In 2010 Philpott met with Paul Martin over coffee then in 2011 when the Conservative government secured a majority government Philpott decided to join the Liberal Party of Canada. In September 2013 she announced her plans to step down as the chief of family medicine at the Markham Stouffville Hospital to enter federal politics. On April 9 2014 she became the Liberal candidate for the Ontario riding of Markham–Stouffville. On October 19 2015 she was elected as a federal member of a new Parliament with a Liberal majority. Shortly after Philpott was sworn in as Canada’s first health minister in 80 years to have a medical background.As a member of cabinet Philpott played a leading role in several of the Liberal Party’s initiatives. Some of the initiatives were direct extensions of Philpott’s role as a physician and Minister of Health: for example legislating a balanced approach to medical assistance in dying and negotiating an accord with new resources for mental health and home care. Other initiatives such as reforming child welfare to reduce the over-apprehension of Indigenous children and improving infrastructure for First Nations to provide clean water on reserves reflected Philpott’s commitments to social health. Philpott was also actively involved in the Liberal Party’s efforts to bring Syrian refugees to Canada.The political party Philpott joined was supposed to be above self-serving power plays. As Vanity Fair noted in 2017 Trudeau was elected because he was widely seen as a champion of good governance and gender equality one capable of “providing hope and delight” in dark times. But the attempt to influence Wilson-Raybould’s decision making as attorney general called into question this commitment. THE SNC-LAVALIN AFFAIRThe SNC-Lavalin affair was widely seen as the straw that broke the back of Trudeau’s much-hyped brand. As Don Martin host of CTV’s daily political program Power Play put it “The unicorn-mounted prince lies bleeding on the rainbow surrounded by dark and stormy clouds.” The crisis was triggered in September 2018 when Kathleen Roussel Canada’s director of public prosecutions informed the Attorney General that SNC-Lavalin would not be invited to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. Instead Roussel would be proceeding to trial charging SNC-Lavalin with the criminal offences of corruption and fraud in relation to business dealings in Libya. At the time SNC-Lavalin was Canada’s largest engineering and construction firm by revenue with over 50000 employees operating in more than 150 countries worldwide. But the company had faced an uncertain future since 2015 when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police the Canadian national police service and an agency of the Ministry of Public Safety Canada filed criminal charges alleging SNC-Lavalin had paid about $50 million in bribes to influence government decisions in Libya between 2001 and 2011. SNC-Lavalin and two of its subsidiaries were also charged with defrauding Libyan organizations of about $130 million. If convicted in a criminal trial the company could lose the ability to bid on federal government business for 10 years potentially costing the company billions in forgone revenue. The loss could weaken SNC-Lavalin’s case for remaining a Canadian company along with its global competitiveness. To mitigate this risk SNC-Lavalin had cleaned house—senior executives had departed and an aggressive campaign to improve ethics and compliance at all levels of the company had been initiated—and it lobbied Ottawa to introduce out-of-court settlements known as deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) into the Canadian legal system. Critics of DPAs insisted they were akin to “get out of jail free cards.” Proponents like former Canadian finance minister John Manley saw DPAs as an alternative means of “punishing the guilty without hurting others who have done nothing wrong.” A remediated settlement would not release the accused company from penalty: if the company qualified for and was granted a DPA the company would have to accept responsibility for the wrong demonstrate that it had taken efforts to ensure the same offences would not be committed again relinquish any benefit gained from the wrong pay a significant financial penalty and if appropriate and possible make reparation to the initial victims of the bribery or fraud.  In SNC-Lavalin’s case the company’s new management team positioned an out-of-court settlement to be in the public interest because it would allow the company to survive and continue to contribute to the Canadian economy while making amends for the misdeeds of former executives without further victimizing innocent employees and other stakeholders including suppliers and pensioners. In its brief to federal officials the company argued “It is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods.” Fair or not according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) almost 80 per cent of corruption cases concluded under its anti-bribery convention worldwide had been settled out of court. DPAs were widely considered “a pragmatic and efficient way to resolve cases that would otherwise require tremendous time and resources to investigate and prosecute before reaching a court.”Following public consultations with many stakeholders (e.g. industry associations current and potential suppliers to the Government of Canada professional organizations civil society organizations non-governmental organizations justice sector stakeholders and provinces and territories) the federal government introduced DPAs to Canada as a small part of the government’s larger 2018 budget legislation. The DPA was to be used at the discretion of prosecutors who would consider a number of factors to determine whether a company was eligible for a DPA such as whether the company impeded or attempted to avoid an investigation or self-disclosed the offence; the nature and gravity of the offence and its impact on the victim (bodily harm or a threat to national security automatically disqualified a company); and how involved senior officers had been and whether the company had taken disciplinary action and attempted remediation.After overhauling its management board and compliance procedures SNC-Lavalin was widely expected to become the first Canadian company to negotiate a settlement under the new legal regime. However Roussel had determined that SNC-Lavalin did not meet the requirements for an out-of-court settlement and instead would remain where it started with the charges in 2015—on the path to a criminal trial. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) was concerned that SNC-Lavalin was being forced to face a trial that could according to the Prime Minister put the jobs of 9000 Canadian employees at risk. They wanted to know why the DPA was not being used and they wanted to be sure that all relevant information had been considered in making that decision. Wilson-Raybould as attorney general was the only person in the Trudeau administration with the authority to question prosecutorial decisions. PMO staff other ministers and their staff and senior public servants started pressing Wilson-Raybould to use expert external council to review the SNC-Lavalin case and determine whether a negotiated settlement would be lawful and in the public interest. Wilson-Raybould declined to do this making it clear that she had decided not to interfere with Roussel’s office and that requests that she do so because elections were approaching amounted to inappropriate political interference. She explained that the legal service of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada was supposed to be above politics and economics. Wilson-Raybould’s position eventually led Michael Wernick Clerk of the Privy Council the most senior civil servant to warn Wilson-Raybould that she was on a collision course with Trudeau: So the [prime minister] wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within [a] legitimate toolbox to try to head [SNC leaving Canada] off. So he is quite determined quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that. According to members of the opposition—who called for Trudeau’s resignation—the government clearly committed a criminal act by trying to obstruct justice. But according to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony she was not asked to abandon the prosecution just to review the matter and determine whether a negotiated settlement could be pursued. These requests in her expert legal opinion were not criminal but were inappropriate due to the political motivations behind them. The generally accepted relationship between an attorney general and other cabinet members was described by Sir Hartley Shawcross in 1951 when the former attorney general of England statedI think the true doctrine is that it is the duty of an Attorney-General in deciding whether or not to authorize the prosecution to acquaint himself with all the relevant facts including for instance the effect which the prosecution successful or unsuccessful as the case may be would have upon public morale and order and with any other considerations affecting public policy.In order so to inform himself he may although I do not think he is obliged to consult with any of his colleagues in the Government; and indeed as Lord Simon once said he would in some cases be a fool if he did not. On the other hand the assistance of his colleagues is confined to informing him of particular considerations which might affect his own decision and does not consist and must not consist in telling him what that decision ought to be. The responsibility for the eventual decision rests with the Attorney-General and he is not to be put and is not put under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.Known as the Shawcross principle this doctrine was used by observers both to support Wilson-Raybould’s position and to attack her for refusing to be open to accepting external advice. Wilson-Raybould did “the standard practice of undertaking further internal work and due diligence in relation to the [prosecutor’s] decision” a practice she had employed for other similar situations. She had also spoken with a former justice minister Kim Campbell who had faced a similar situation during her tenure as attorney general. Nevertheless government officials came to her on several occasions and expressed concern over the economic impact of a criminal trial and a possible conviction. But as far as Wilson-Raybould was concerned the issue was simple: as justice minister and attorney general she had decided to respect the independence of Roussel’s office and concluded that a review of the file was not warranted. Wilson-Raybould alleged that she was removed from her position as justice minister and placed in the portfolio of veterans affairs after resisting political attempts to change her mind—attempts that she felt threatened the independence and integrity of the justice system because they were being made by people within the government seeking “to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.” DECISION TIMEPhilpott was not directly involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair but she was a member of cabinet and therefore considered a member of Trudeau’s team. Still few people would attack Philpott if she had decided to remain in cabinet. After all in the United States at the time the Trump administration was full of honourable individuals who were biting their tongues in public in order to serve the public good as insiders with influence countering their leader’s questionable decisions. Outside Canada the SNC-Lavalin scandal was labelled as almost trivial especially when compared to allegations faced at the time by US president Donald Trump. “There’s no money no sex and nothing illegal happened. This is what passes for a scandal in Canada” pointed out an Associated Press report. Even within Canada many people had a hard time seeing a major scandal because as lawyer Brian Greenspan put it “the prosecutorial function does not operate in a vacuum in isolation and immune from debate discussion and indeed persuasion.”“Maybe I am just jaded” said Scott Reid. That was the disclaimer the former senior advisor to Paul Martin offered after he noted that the SNC-Lavalin affair was just “a political controversy as opposed to a criminal/legal matter.” In Reid’s view the issue was less serious in terms of alleged transgressions than the scandal endured by the previous Conservative government when Senator Mike Duffy was charged with fraud breach of trust and bribery following a scandal over his expense claims. And the SNC-Lavalin affair was “not even close to the sponsorship scandal” that had helped end the Liberal Party’s previous hold on power. But Philpott was not a veteran of old-school politics so her litmus test for wrongdoing did not require a criminal act. And she had not given up her medical career to help Trudeau sell a false promise to be different. “Unfortunately the evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me” Philpott wrote in her resignation letter.The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system. It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. Sadly I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.Philpott was not raised to be a quitter. A profile following her induction into her high school’s roll of distinguished alumni noted that Philpott did not avoid a challenge just because it appeared too big to defeat. When fighting the seeming intractability of Africa’s problems as a missionary Philpott urged others not to give up by quoting a West African proverb: “The river may be wide but it can be crossed.” However remaining on Trudeau’s team would signal to Canadians that she supported the government’s actions. In fact the constitutional convention of cabinet solidarity would have her duty bound to speak in support of the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair even if she disagreed with the government’s statements or thought they were false.When all was said and done Philpott concluded it was “untenable” for her to continue to serve as a cabinet minister after having “lost confidence” in how the government dealt with the SNC-Lavalin affair. But the price of standing on principle would be high. Resigning would not just cost her the very influence over public policy that Paul Martin had convinced her was worth pursuing. While she would remain a member of parliament her declaration would threaten her position in the Liberal government not to mention her chances of being re-elected. Her resignation would also add fuel to a scandal being exploited by the Conservative Party. In other words if Philpott decided to resign on principle the decision could help put in place a new government that didn’t share her Liberal values threatening the future of everyone remaining in the Liberal caucus including more than a dozen other female politicians who had made history along with Philpott and Wilson-Raybould when Trudeau appointed them to Canada’s first gender-equal cabinet.Was Philpott’s decision to resign over principles the right decision?Endnotes","[{""start"":1059,""end"":1072,""text"":""Jane

(TCW) a privately owned third-party logistics (3PL) company based in Haddonfield New Jersey could detect the determination and firmness in the voice of the company’s president and chief operating officer (COO) Jim Tucker: “Mike it is not just about being cheap fast and easy” Tucker said. “We have an obligation to provide the best logistical solution to our customer for each of their shipment requirements.” Mellencamp was working on a bid to provide logistics support to Bell Oil a refinery based in Reading Pennsylvania.  Winning this contract would further TCW’s establishment as a leader in the 3PL industry. As Mellencamp walked out of Tucker’s office he realized that preparing the bid would not be as straightforward as he had thought it would be. The proposal would need to effectively showcase TCW’s value address all practical transport options and remain consistent with the company’s core practice. Above all Mellencamp had only that day Friday June 1 2018 to bring it all together.HISTORY OF Tucker Company WorldwideTCW a third-generation family-held corporation was founded in 1961 by Jacob Tucker. The company provided logistical services to shippers and their customers helping companies efficiently execute freight hand-offs; saving them time; and eliminating the hassles of paperwork billing audits training staffing and optimization. It acted as an intermediary both between shippers and receivers and between shippers and carriers. Through its market knowledge and subject expertise it often helped its clients open new market opportunities receive volume discounts lower overhead costs and achieve timely service.After Jacob’s sudden death his son Bill Tucker took over the business. For the next 32 years Bill immersed himself in the business and industry. His two sons Jeff and Jim worked for their father for over 10 years and later took over the business; they shared a passion for the business and the industry. Jeff served as the chief executive officer overseeing sales and marketing as well as industry participation and leadership. Jim served as the president and COO managing the carrier side credit collections and accounting. Over the years Jeff and Jim had built an outstanding reputation in the 3PL industry. TCW was ISO certified in 2008 and it held ISO 9001:2015 certification as well. In all their business interactions the brothers strove to uphold their core values: customer focus integrity safety quality and advocacy. Services Offered by Tucker Company WorldwideAs a non-asset-based company (i.e. it owned no trucks but worked with fleet operators) TCW provided supply chain solutions to companies in industries such as oil and gas life sciences and health care high-value and high-security goods and food. It also provided services to government entities for example providing relief work during national emergencies such as forest fires hurricanes and terrorist attacks; freight services for the U.S. Mint; and helicopters and boats for the military. TCW utilized an array of transportation modes—including truck rail ocean and air—to arrange logistics all over the world. It offered truckload (TL) intermodal flatbed and specialized equipment for transporting freight. It specialized in freight transportation that required higher service needs—that is where the risk of shipment delays or cargo theft was high where the delay consequences were high and where there was visible corporate behaviour dysfunction. TCW also provided real-time tracking and tracing (through a customer portal) quarterly business reviews (for existing customers) scorecards (based on shipping characteristics) and technology options that included visual performance statistics. Customers appreciated these analyses by TCW and considered them to be value-added services.One thing that had set TCW apart from its competition was its investment in establishing strong communication and visibility channels between its customers and service providers including truck air and ship carriers. This helped TCW create the right logistical solutions for its customers. Results from an internal customer survey showed that TCW was one of the most dependable and reliable partners for most of its clients.The Request For ProposalOn Friday June 1 2018 Bell Oil a large refinery in Reading Pennsylvania sent out a request for proposal (RFP) soliciting bids to transport multiple products from multiple origins to multiple destinations. The refinery solicited local and regional 3PL companies to submit bids for three unique transportation needs. The first requirement was to ship a highly critical 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. The second requirement was to transport a large 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. The third was a small (90-kilogram [200-pound]) but highly valuable $48600 computer server containing sensitive company information which was to be transported across the country from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California.According to the RFP each component could use a combination of transport modes but the best solution should offer the best service in terms of transit time reliability damage rate insurance and of course cost.Jim Tucker saw the call and asked his manager Mellencamp to begin working on the bid right away. However preparing the bid was not easy and TCW had a set of challenges to overcome. TCW’s ChallengeCustomers typically preferred solutions that were fast easy and cheap; they assume that the right vehicle with the desired transit time reliability insurance terms and damage rates would be available. This last-minute attitude increased the overall transportation costs for most customers and became the enemy of corporate savings. They would often not realize how sharply logistics costs rose in the absence of their own advance planning and clear communication and examination of needs. TCW knew that overcoming this attitude would be its first challenge. It could not provide the lowest-cost option to its customer if the customer waited until the very last moment.Jim Tucker wanted to prepare a bid that exceeded expectations for customer service and satisfaction—a solution that provided the lowest-cost option while maintaining the required reliability and service to successfully transport the shipments. He knew that an overly expensive option would jeopardize TCW’s chances of winning the bid.  Tucker and Mellencamp recognized that they were competing with other 3PL companies in the region on this bid. They understood the market and were aware of the different strategies their competition might use—and they were afraid the competition might present a low-ball offer that might be attractive to the customer. At the same time they were confident that the competition could not deliver the experience and service that TCW could offer.Tucker was aware of several past instances where a competitor 3PL had bid on and lost a deal because of a lack of communication and feasibility analysis from the trucking company and driver. Conversely TCW had seen competitor 3PLs win business but then fail to follow through and meet customer expectations leading to aggravated customers. Tucker and Mellencamp discussed their strong communication channel which kept all involved parties in touch at all times as well as their forensic dispatch practice which had been successful over the years. They were confident that a careful examination of the available options and clear communication of the customer’s needs would enable TCW to provide the best logistical solution for the Bell Oil refinery. TCW’s Transport OptionsTo prepare the bid Mellencamp carefully examined all shipping options for serving the refinery’s three specific needs. He prepared three different tables for the three different scenarios and shared these with Tucker. Together they needed to create a bid that not only minimized transport costs but also maximized reliability and customer satisfaction.Shipment Requirement 1: Ship a 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. In this requirement the customer wanted to move a 67-kilogram gasket which was critical to the normal operation of the refinery. If the gasket were needed a delay of one day in receiving it could result in millions of dollars in losses for the refinery. Mellencamp evaluated the different shipping options and prepared a table that compared the different components of each option (see Exhibit 1). Shipment Requirement 2: Ship a 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. In the second requirement the customer wanted to move a 102058-kilogram tank from Texas to Delaware. Mellencamp considered four different transport options to move this oversize load across state boundaries:Option 1 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it on a 19-axle trailer over-the-road (OTR) to its final destination (see Exhibit 2).Option 2 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the rail ramp in Houston then transload and move it on rail to the customer site via a local rail line. Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the final location on a 19-axle trailer. Option 3 involved picking up the vessel from the manufacturer and moving it OTR to the port in Houston then transloading it onto a barge and barging it to the port in New Castle Delaware. Finally it would be transloaded to a 19-axle trailer and moved OTR to its final destination. Option 4 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the port in Houston then transload it onto a barge and barge it directly to the customer’s site. (This option would require site improvement on the customer’s end.) Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the installation site.Mellencamp prepared a table listing all the feasible transport options to carry out this oversize load transportation (see Exhibit 3).Shipment Requirement 3: Ship an estimated 90-kilogram (200-pound) computer server valued at $48600 from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California. The shipper believed the dimensions were roughly 36 × 36 × 40 inches. Under the third and the last requirement the customer required a computer server with very sensitive corporate information to be transported coast to coast. Mellencamp developed a set of feasible solutions to successfully carry out this transportation (see Exhibit 4).THE DECISIONBased on the choices he had developed the challenge for Mellencamp was to come up with a decision for each shipment requirement that would become part of the final bid. He wondered how he should go about making the right logistical decision. What strategy should he use to prepare TCW’s bid?Exhibit 1: Options for Transporting a 67-kilogram Gasket","[{""start"":11679,""end"":11690,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11500,""end"":11511,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10994,""end"":11005,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9858,""end"":9869,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9503,""end"":9514,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1060,""end"":1075,""text"":""Mike Mellencamp"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1749,""end"":1760,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1541,""end"":1552,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2054,""end"":2065,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6421,""end"":6432,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7586,""end"":7597,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8368,""end"":8379,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8810,""end"":8821,""text"":""Mellencamp "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1212,""end"":1222,""text"":""New Jersey"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1790,""end"":1793,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1860,""end"":1863,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11886,""end"":11889,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11792,""end"":11795,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11808,""end"":11811,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11644,""end"":11647,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8910,""end"":8913,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7483,""end"":7486,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-03-29As the manager of Water Operations at the City of London Ontario Tina Soltani was always seeking new opportunities to improve the efficiency of the city’s water distribution. Starting early in 2015 Water Operations in London was consistently experiencing higher operational costs with electricity bills accounting for up to 30 per cent of direct costs. While exploring options to reduce this cost Soltani read the Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater Facilities report that was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 and was delighted to read that the City of Columbus Georgia had managed to achieve 25 per cent energy costs savings by eliminating pump inefficiencies at water pumping stations. Soltani wondered whether she could replicate this success at the City of London. Given that the city’s electricity bill was consistently increasing due to rising electricity costs the possibility of reducing electricity usage was even more appealing. Soltani knew that in the short term there was little possibility for improvements to infrastructure for efficiency gains; however she wondered whether hourly water pumping could be scheduled during off-peak electricity periods when prices were lower. Soltani began to explore hourly electricity prices and wondered whether the pricing schedule could be accurately predicted 24 hours in advance. She knew that creating an accurate prediction model would be critical to optimizing pumping schedules and therefore reducing electricity usage and costs.London’s Water SystemLondon received its water from two main sources: Lake Huron and Lake Erie (see Exhibit 1). These water sources were administered by the Lake Huron Primary Water Supply System and the Elgin Area Primary Water Supply System respectively. There were also two backup emergency wells: the Fanshawe well field and the Hyde Park well field. In 2015 London Water bought 44.3 billion litres of water from the supply systems for a total cost of CA$21.5 million. To move water from the lakes and into its final treated form at individual households London had a complex distribution system of treatment plants reservoirs pumping stations and 1550 kilometres of pipes (see Exhibits 2 and 3).Water Pumping OperationIn determining the optimal pumping schedules London Water needed to address three priorities: meeting demand quantities maintaining water quality and meeting pressure needs. Meeting Demand QuantitiesReservoirs needed to meet both peak water consumption demands and unexpected demands. For example many cities maintained capacity for extraneous demands such as firefighting needs. In 2015 London’s average daily water demand was 120.33 million litres. The largest daily amount pumped in 2015 was 151.45 million litres on July 28 2015.Maintaining Water QualityPumping schedules impacted the age of water in reservoirs and thus affected the water quality.Meeting Pressure NeedsA minimum quantity of water also needed to be maintained in reservoirs to ensure adequate water pressure to deliver water through London’s network of pipes.Meeting the prioritiesTo meet these priorities reservoir levels needed to be maintained between a maximum capacity and a minimum required level. Accordingly over a 24-hour planning period pumping operations were scheduled at low-price hours as long as the key priorities were met. The potential for cost savings by optimizing pump scheduling was thus significant. Soltani believed that London Water was filling the water tanks too early in the day and not benefiting from periods of low energy prices. By efficiently scheduling pumping operations and operating at lower levels throughout the day she estimated that electricity costs could typically be reduced by 10–15 per cent. Energy costs accounted for up to 80 per cent of the processing and distribution costs of drinking water. This wide range existed because the costs included multiple factors in addition to pump scheduling. For example the water pumping cost was much higher in Toronto where the topography forced the distribution system to mostly pump water upstream which required much more energy than in London where 80 per cent of the city was fed by gravity. The efficiency of water infrastructure also had a large impact especially when leaks in the pipes led to water loss. Construction and maintenance costs also varied for different utilities. In regions with colder climates pipes needed to be installed further underground to reduce the likelihood of frozen watermains which made any infrastructure upgrades or repairs very expensive.Despite the benefits of optimizing pumping schedules using predictive and algorithmic methods most pumping schedules were managed manually by water operators. In general however increasing energy costs and water constraints necessitated that all water utilities consider various methods to optimize their efficiency and reduce costs.Electricity MarketsElectricity markets were managed and operated by independent system operators (ISOs). The ISO that operated the Ontario market was the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO). By balancing supply and demand of real-time electricity the IESO determined the hourly Ontario electricity price (HOEP) which was the market price of wholesale electricity in Ontario.The Hourly Ontario Electricity PriceLarge electricity consumers that used more than 250000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity paid the wholesale electricity price or the HOEP. The IESO determined the HOEP by forecasting demand 24 hours in advance and accepting supply offers from generators and electricity importers. Supply price offers were mostly affected by fuel and generation costs such as the cost of natural gas for a generator converting natural gas into electricity and fixed costs such as ongoing operating costs. After supply offers were received a small number of large consumers (local distribution companies or LDCs) bid on the price they were willing to pay for a certain amount of electricity. LDCs determined their bid by forecasting the demand that they expected from their customers which ranged from individual households and private businesses to public utilities such as London Water. Demand was primarily impacted by weather business needs and general usage efficiency. Apart from supply and demand factors inefficiencies in the transmission grid and in the network of high-voltage power lines impacted the transportation and delivery of energy and subsequently the actual clearing prices of electricity.The IESO collected supply offer and demand bids up to two hours in advance of actual energy use. It stacked all supply offers from the lowest-priced offer to the highest purchasing through the stack until energy demands were met. The HOEP was the average of these market clearing prices in any given hour. An additional operating reserve price was set which paid suppliers to have on-call electricity generation capabilities in the case of a demand surge or supply shortage (such as a generation breakdown).Global AdjustmentIn addition to the HOEP electricity consumers were also charged a global adjustment (GA) fee. The GA fee was the discrepancy between the HOEP and any predetermined IESO contract prices with specific conservation generators such as renewable-energy generators. For example the feed-in tariff for on-shore wind electricity generation was $0.128/kWh meaning that IESO guaranteed a price floor of $0.128 for electricity from these generators. When the HOEP went below this price the GA fee was increased to account for the cost of covering the feed-in tariff. The GA was calculated and charged on a monthly basis. To incentivize consumers to reduce electricity demand during peak hours Class A electricity users (defined as having an average hourly peak demand of greater than or equal to 5 megawatts) were charged for their portion of the electricity demand during the five highest annual demand peaks. For example if on an annual basis a consumer accounted for 2 per cent of total electricity demand during peak hours the GA rate would be 2 per cent of the total GA cost. The DataSoltani collected the HOEPs from 2003 to 2015 (see Exhibit 4 and Student Spreadsheet [Ivey product no. 7B19E004]). The data provided the date hour (using the 24-hour clock) and the corresponding hourly prices.Impact and DecisionWith such large potential electricity savings Soltani knew that optimizing the schedules of pumping operations would hold significant merit. Because few other water utilities had adopted such methods London had the opportunity to become an innovation leader and present a best-practice scenario. To make this decision however Soltani first needed to find an accurate way of predicting the electricity prices 24 hours in advance for any given day. Because cost savings were predicated on lower electricity prices determining the best prediction model was critical to addressing any questions about future optimization. After making a large cup of Persian tea Soltani sat down to contemplate how she should proceed.EXHIBIT 1: Sources of Water for the City of LondonSource: Water Treatment and Distribution in London: The Teaching Toolkit slide 3 City of London Canada accessed October 19 2017 www.london.ca/residents/Water/Teacher-Resources/Pages/Water.aspx.

In 2016 the company had been successfully established in eight countries. It was clear that Costco’s next steps would have to build upon this momentum and that the company would have to expand operations. For any retailer selecting new countries and an appropriate entry mode was of utmost importance as different markets presented different challenges and considerations. Before the company could create an expansion plan it was necessary to analyze the entry methods it had used in its prior expansions to understand the factors that had contributed to each success. What would be the best method for entry based on existing barriers in terms of culture and operational constraints?Costco Wholesale CorporationHeadquartered in Issaquah Washington Costco was the largest membership warehouse club in the United States with 481 warehouses in 43 states and Puerto Rico. Costco had more than 80 million members and employed more than 200000 full- and part-time employees around the world. The company sold brand name products at low prices and high volumes and offered ancillary service departments such as gas stations pharmacies food courts optical centres one-hour photo services hearing centres and travel services at its warehouse locations. Costco also offered its own private label brand Kirkland Signature at its warehouses. Some of Costco’s global competitors were Walmart Inc. (Walmart); Walmart’s membership club Sam’s West Inc. (Sam’s Club); Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon); Metro Inc. (Metro); Carrefour Group (Carrefour); the Home Depot Inc. (Home Depot); and Best Buy Co. Inc. (Best Buy).Global Expansion to DateCostco’s 2014 sales totalled US$112.6 billion of which $32.1 billion was from international operations. That year the company’s international operating income saw more growth than Costco’s total operating income (see Exhibit 2). In the five-year period ending in 2014 sales from the company’s international branches showed a significant increase compared to its U.S. branches (see Exhibit 3).Costco’s international expansion began with its entry into Canada in 1985; by October 2015 Costco had established 206 warehouses in eight countries outside the United States as well as online storefronts in Canada the United Kingdom Mexico and China. Several other retailers such as Carrefour Walmart and Tesco PLC (Tesco) boasted a larger global presence than Costco but the success the company had managed to achieve in all eight of the international markets it had entered was noteworthy (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Costco employed a variety of global expansion strategies in each of the eight markets as detailed below.CanadaCostco entered Canada in 1985 opening a company-owned warehouse in Burnaby British Columbia. Costco’s major competitor from the United States Price Club opened its first warehouse in Montreal in 1986 after reaching a joint venture agreement with Steinberg Inc. a grocery chain in the French-speaking province of Quebec in Eastern Canada. Price Club and Costco merged in 1993. By 2015 Costco had expanded its operations to 90 locations across nine provinces in Canada.Costco initiated a dual strategy in Canada that was an extension of the company’s strategy in the United States. Firstly Costco mimicked its U.S. growth strategy by expanding geographically into the largest metropolitan areas on the country’s east and west coasts. Secondly owing to cultural similarities Costco stocked its Canadian warehouses with products that closely resembled the product selection available in its American warehouses. Fascinated by this American-style shopping experience Canadian consumers were increasingly drawn to Costco and the company expanded to 24 Canadian warehouses (including Price Club warehouses). In 1992 Costco and Price Club had 12 warehouses each in Canada.A growth in consumer preference towards lower priced higher quality products brought increased competition. Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws) the country’s largest supermarket retailer opened its first membership warehouse the Real Canadian Wholesale Club in 1991; this was soon followed by Walmart which entered the market in 1994. Canada’s appeal as a key international base increased after the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) in 1987 which eliminated many trade barriers between the two countries. After the agreement came into effect several retail chains including Costco increased their presence in Canada growing competition in the Canadian retail industry. This competition resulted in lower prices to the benefit of Canadian consumers. Given Canadian consumers’ desire to save money Costco’s commitment to low prices was a convincing argument; consumers invested in the company’s memberships and maintained their loyalty year after year. According to Costco’s 2014 annual report the membership renewal rate in Canada was 91 per cent on par with its American rate during the same period.MexicoCostco (Price Club) entered Mexico in 1992 through a joint venture (JV) with one of the largest Mexican supermarket chains Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB de CV (CCM). In 2012 Costco purchased CCM’s stake in the JV and as of October 2015 the company owned and operated 36 stores in 18 Mexican states. Mexico had a history of protectionist trade policies that limited the amount of cross-border trade with U.S. companies. As negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) progressed major retailers in Mexico started approaching U.S. retailers about possible partnerships. NAFTA was signed by Canada Mexico and the United States to remove trade barriers among the three countries. The agreement came into effect in 1994. Attracted by Mexico’s large urbanizing population and a growing middle class large U.S. retailers such as Costco and Walmart capitalized on the opportunity to establish a presence in Mexico. In Mexico Costco was in direct competition with Sam’s Club which had aggressively expanded to 22 locations in the three years following its entry in 1991. Costco’s strategy was to open its warehouses in locations where Sam’s Club had no presence and win memberships through a first-to-market advantage. These shoppers were enticed by Costco’s guaranteed lower prices which led to an increase in the volume of purchases they made during each visit. These consumers associated foreign-made items with positive attributes such as better quality and reliability displaying a strong preference for them over locally made counterparts. This encouraged Costco to adapt its offerings and import non-food items. As the prices of imported goods dropped following NAFTA Costco’s warehouses became a principal source of American-made products.United KingdomCostco entered the United Kingdom in 1993 opening its first store in Essex after reaching a JV agreement with French multinational retailer Carrefour. Price Club also entered the market by forming a JV with a privately-owned retailer Littlewoods Organisation PLC in 2000; Littlewoods’s stake was sold to Costco. In 2003 Costco purchased Carrefour’s stake in the JV and by 2015 Costco operated 27 locations across the United Kingdom. As a wholesaler Costco’s entry into the United Kingdom an industrialized and developed nation with wealthy citizens gave the company significant leverage to operate at a cost base lower than its local rivals. As it had in other countries Costco operated its U.K. stores as strictly no-frills-style warehouses that contained only essentials and avoided facilities such as dressing rooms which wasted floor space. Costco did not invest in a paid advertising strategy; however the local media extensively publicized several aspects of the company such as its lower-than-average markup of 11 per cent building a positive image of the company for consumers. Such publicity also attracted the attention of local retailers who began slashing prices in anticipation of a price war. Conventional supermarket markups ranged from 21 to 40 per cent making the British some of the highest-paying consumers in the Western hemisphere. However the recession of 1991 resulted in a substantial reduction in consumer confidence which in turn made the UK consumers more price conscious. This was the perfect opportunity for Costco to lure UK shoppers by its low price guarantees for bulk purchases.Costco faced strong resistance during its entry into the United Kingdom. The three big local retailers—Tesco J. Sainsbury PLC (Sainsbury’s) and Argyll Group PLC—filed a lawsuit that questioned Costco’s wholesaler status and its qualification for less stringent planning controls which included access to commercial and industrial land at lower cost than the higher priced land allocated for retailers. Costco’s warehouse-style set-up and bulk product supply at discounted prices convinced the High Court to regard Costco as non-retail and to clear Costco to open its first store in the country.South KoreaIn 1994 Costco granted a licence to Shinsegae Department Store (Shinsegae) a major South Korean retailer to open and operate a warehouse club store in Seoul. This became Costco’s first store in Asia. In 1998 Costco purchased the warehouses from Shinsegae and subsequently formed a 94 per cent JV with the same partner. By 2015 the company had expanded to 12 locations in South Korea. Costco introduced local shoppers to the lower price higher quality value model supplying a limited range of products in bigger quantities. South Korea’s relatively large households favoured Costco’s wholesale approach over the prevailing harin (discount) store format. Costco granted an exclusive licence to Shinsegae to run daily warehouse operations and the warehouse adapted products to the tastes and preferences of affluent and well-educated shoppers who valued product quality products with health benefits and customer service. This localization meant that Costco was more successful in this market than most other foreign retailers. In 2014 Fortune reported that Costco’s warehouse in Seoul had recorded the highest sales of any Costco worldwide and had earned the title of “busiest Costco in the world.”Between the early 1960s and the late 1990s South Korea had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Foreign retailers however were largely barred from this growing market—primarily because of government controls over land development zoning regulations and restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI). Liberalization attempts during the 1990s led to the entry into the South Korean market of foreign retailers such as Walmart Carrefour and Tesco but the government’s continued preferential treatment of local retailers proved costly for foreign players. Walmart and Carrefour exited South Korea in 2006. Tesco announced its departure from the market in September 2015.The South Korean government implemented several policies to protect the interests of smaller retailers in the country: these included mandatory store closures on alternating Sundays restrictions on store operating hours and zoning restrictions that affected big box retailers. Although other local retailers such as E-Mart and Lotte Mart had successfully won court injunctions against the Sunday closures Costco suffered adverse media criticism store boycotts and fines when it kept its stores open on Sundays.TaiwanCostco entered Taiwan via a JV with the nation’s largest department store chain President Group opening its first store in Kaohsiung in 1997. By 2015 Costco had expanded to 11 locations in the country.Costco positioned itself as an American retailer with a distinct fondness for local tastes. The company offered products such as Kirkland brand beef steak cut into thinner slices to meet the buying preferences of local shoppers who used beef steak in hot pot a staple Taiwanese dish. Such localization strategies enabled Costco to compete against traditional wet markets. Wet markets sold fish meat fruits and vegetables usually in the early mornings. Costco capitalized on its foreign retailer image and imported about 35 per cent of its products which attracted the country’s younger population. After Taiwan liberalized foreign investment in 1986 and became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 several international retailers entered the Taiwanese retail market. The retail market became highly competitive and this led some foreign retailers to exit; Makro exited the market in 2003. In 2005 Carrefour took over Tesco’s stores in Taiwan after both companies agreed to an asset swap agreement. Even with Costco’s best efforts the company registered losses during its first five years of operation in Taiwan.Costco’s return policy was a major hit with Taiwanese shoppers. Unlike local retailers Costco encouraged its shoppers to return any items that they were not happy with; even a half-eaten watermelon could be returned if it was not sweet. This lenient return policy created free word-of-mouth advertising that helped the company recruit new customers. More importantly the loyalty of existing customers increased as illustrated by a sharp rise in customer retention rates from 45 per cent in 1998 to more than 80 per cent in 2010. JapanCostco established its first warehouse in Japan in 1999; the wholly owned subsidiary was in Hisayama. By 2015 the company had expanded to 24 locations in Japan. Few thought that Costco would be successful in Japan where the average house was only 60 per cent of the size of a house in the United States and rooms averaged a 40 per cent higher occupancy rate. This raised concerns that Japanese houses lacked sufficient storage space for the bulk merchandise Costco planned to supply. Japanese customers tended to favour quality over price. General merchandise stores and supermarkets were easily accessible within short distances so Japanese customers did not expect to travel long distances to a Costco warehouse for frequent purchases. Considering these concerns the Japanese people questioned the suitability of the warehouse club format to Japan.In Japan Costco targeted the wealthy segment of the population people who had access to private transportation and made less frequent shopping trips. Costco enticed these consumers by stocking Japanese staples—several varieties of fish green tea and seaweed—as well as imported goods and brand name merchandise that resonated with brand-loyal quality-conscious consumers. Costco also targeted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that purchased in bulk for resale. Several SMEs preferred Costco’s approach to low pricing over the quantity-based discounts that other Japanese wholesalers offered. By offering excellent customer service and a generous return and refund policy Costco focused on developing trust with these SMEs to ensure their continued loyalty. Such measures ensured that Costco continued to grow in the Japanese market while other international retailers had to exit the country. Carrefour and Tesco announced their exit from the market in 2005 and 2012 respectively.Australia Costco’s first company-owned warehouse store in Australia opened in 2009 in Docklands a suburb of Melbourne. By 2015 the company had expanded its operations to 8 locations in the country.Costco effectively recognized several attributes that were important to Australian consumer groups. It offered multiple payment options including cash electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) and credit cards. In order to keep costs down Costco strictly restricted payment options available to its customers in other countries. As Australian consumers favoured Australian-made products over imports Costco strategically included several local products in its offerings. This openness and flexibility provided Costco with an early advantage in penetrating the duopoly that had previously characterized the Australian food retail market. However for the five-year period ending in 2014 Costco accumulated losses of $44.5 million in Australia. Several factors were involved. Restrictive Australian planning and zoning laws delayed the approval and building of Costco’s first store. Next local regulations prohibited Costco from providing some of its typical services such as insurance and pharmacy. Lastly Costco suffered a major setback with coupon promotions: Australian shoppers did not understand or appreciate coupons and so Costco was forced to roll back most of its major coupon offers.SpainIn May 2014 Costco’s first wholly owned warehouse opened in Spain in the city of Seville. The company opened its second warehouse in the capital city of Madrid in October 2015.Costco’s entry into Spain was well received by the local population thanks to extensive local media coverage of the company’s anticipated product offerings unique business style and employee welfare schemes. Costco also gained the attention of suppliers at both local and national levels who were eager to forge business links with the warehouse giant. While it met its domestic product needs in Spain Costco also planned to use these suppliers to supply products to its other locations worldwide. Costco’s entry into Spain occurred during a period of economic uncertainty. Spain’s economic recovery from the recession of 2008 began in late 2013. However as regional economic problems continued in the European Union Spain’s high unemployment rate posed a substantial threat to Spain’s recovery. In mid-2015 Spain’s unemployment rate was 22.4 per cent compared to the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent. If disposable income remained low the purchasing power of Spanish shoppers would be hindered and they would not approach bulk wholesale purchasing with the same enthusiasm as shoppers in other markets. Furthermore Spain’s old-age dependency ratio was projected to hit 48.7 per cent by 2035. As the country’s fertility rate was also considered low Costco would have to adapt its offerings to grow profitably in this market.Costco’s Global Strategy: Key Success FactorsIncreasing Member Recruitment and RetentionCostco was a pioneer in the membership warehouse club model which required customers to purchase yearly memberships to shop at warehouses. Members benefited from Costco’s lower prices and an increase in customer savings offset the cost of the membership fees. Costco offered two basic membership types: Gold Star memberships for individuals and Business memberships for businesses. For an additional fee each of these memberships could be upgraded to the Executive level which guaranteed shoppers 2 per cent cashback on valid purchases made throughout the year. Although Walmart’s Sam’s Club also offered cashback to its customers it set a yearly cap of $500 per customer. Costco’s no-cap cashback presented a convincing incentive for frequent shoppers to purchase Costco memberships. Moreover Costco allowed its customers to cancel memberships at any time during the year and offered reimbursements of the unused portion of the membership fee. This hassle-free membership model allowed Costco to record a high membership compound annual growth rate of 7.1 per cent in the five years from 2010 to 2015. Complementing the high membership renewal rate in the United States and Canada Costco’s international operations saw a significant 88 per cent increase in its membership renewal rate in 2015. As revenues from membership fees contributed more than 75 per cent of Costco’s gross profit recruiting and retaining members was a key focus.Leveraging the Kirkland Signature BrandKirkland Signature was Costco’s in-house brand introduced to offer premium quality products at prices that were 10–20 per cent lower than those of other national brands. In 2014 Kirkland Signature products contributed 25 per cent of Costco’s sales a significantly higher penetration rate than other warehouse club house brands (18.1 per cent). Without the need to invest in promotional activities Costco was able to strengthen the Kirkland Signature brand by introducing several new products across a broad range of categories every year. As of 2014 Costco typically earned a profit margin of 15 per cent on its in-house brand products compared to 7–10 per cent for other brands. Costco began to use third party e-commerce channels such as Google Express and InstaCart seeking to make Kirkland Signature products available to a larger consumer base. Limiting the Range of Products to Enable Operational ExcellenceCostco’s primary business model was built around the strategy of stocking a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) promoting sales of a limited range of products. A typical Costco warehouse stocked approximately 3700 SKUs less than many other big box retailers. This strategy offered Costco several advantages. First it allowed Costco to assign a greater area of the warehouse to each employee which established higher productivity rates and increased overall profitability. Second it allowed Costco to focus on a smaller number of suppliers which resulted in lower transaction costs. Costco’s transaction cost savings came from lower negotiation costs and reduced policing and enforcement costs. Lastly it meant that Costco had a higher inventory turnover than its competitors. In August 2015 Costco’s inventory turnover ratio was 11.64. Costco was able to sell inventory to its customers before having to pay its suppliers for those products which significantly reduced the level of working capital it needed to maintain. Applying a No-Frills Wholesaling ApproachTypically retailers set aside a sizeable portion of their budgets for marketing store layout and decor. Costco minimized its operating costs through its warehouse store format distribution system and marketing. Costco’s warehouses had a minimalist design with bare cement floors and high sparse ceilings. Floor plans were designed for economy and efficiency ease of product handling and inventory control; and products were displayed on industrial type pallets to facilitate stacking and stocking. To reduce electricity costs Costco installed many skylights sensibly placed throughout the store to utilize natural light. Costco avoided intermediaries in distribution; it purchased its merchandise directly from manufacturers. Goods were typically delivered to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to its warehouses which resulted in significant cost savings. Although the company had direct purchasing relationships with many national brand name merchandisers it did not rely extensively on any one supplier as it followed a supplier diversification strategy.Costco did not employ public relations staff. The company used free word-of-mouth advertising to promote its value proposition. The company’s promotional materials typically took the form of coupons for existing members and direct emails to potential new members and stayed away from traditional marketing methods to keep costs low.Meeting Local Consumers’ Needs and WantsCostco adapted well to each country it entered. The success or failure of its entry ultimately depended on understanding the needs and wants of customers in each given market. In countries such as Taiwan where there was high retail competition Costco partnered with a strong local retailer to gain its first foothold in the market. This allowed Costco to study the unique tastes and preferences of Taiwanese customers and then adapt its product offerings to meet the demands of this local consumer base. Costco succeeded in keeping its customers happy making it easy to retain them year after year. Its “no questions asked” return policy allowed Costco to stand out. Implementing Human Resources Policies that Foster Employee RetentionEmployee retention was widely recognized as a major problem in the global retail industry. Costco’s employee turnover rates however painted a more positive picture. The company’s average turnover was generally low around 17 per cent and this rate dramatically dropped to just 6 per cent for employees who had completed the first year of their tenure at the company. This was a direct result of Costco’s generous human resources policies. In 2006 Costco paid an average hourly wage of $17.00—72 per cent higher than the wages offered by its rival Sam’s Club in the United States. These wages were also supplemented by generous benefits: 82 per cent of Costco’s employees were covered by health insurance and 91 per cent were covered by retirement plans. The company’s contributions towards these benefits were also typically higher than those of its rivals. As a result Costco’s employees were more engaged in the workplace and this contributed to increased employee loyalty job performance and productivity and to better customer service.Key Issues and Strategic OptionsIncreasing the Share of Total Revenue from International Operations Despite international success Costco’s share of revenues from operations outside of its home country continued to be insignificant. In 2014 just 29 per cent of the company’s net sales came from its international operations. A further cause for concern was that Canadian operations contributed 16 per cent of Costco’s total revenue. The United States and Canada therefore continued to be dominant markets for Costco. In comparison Carrefour the French multinational retailer earned 65 per cent of its revenue in 2014 from its international locations which spanned 32 countries through Latin America Asia and Europe. Costco’s dependence on its U.S. and Canadian markets made it vulnerable to regional uncertainty and could significantly affect the company’s revenue growth.Some of Costco’s challenges included increased competition and changing government regulations in international markets. Mature markets such as Japan presented intense competition and a lack of growth opportunities for Costco. In Japan the shifting preferences and lifestyles of consumers led to an increased preference for convenience stores over department stores and supermarkets. As a result Costco also competed with convenience store chains such as 7-Eleven Lawson and Family Mart. Furthermore political and legal changes in international markets had generally been unpredictable. This was exemplified by the South Korean government’s laws protecting small family-owned shops at the expense of international big box retailers; non-compliance posed reputational as well as monetary risks. Finding Entering and Expanding into New Markets with the Intention of Diversifying RiskAccording to the AT Kearney 2015 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) China was ranked as the best country for retail growth in 2014. Despite slower overall growth in 2014 the country’s retail sector continued to show rapid growth at 11.6 per cent. Forecasts put China’s retail sector on track to grow to $8 trillion by 2022 encouraging major multinational retailers to expand into the country. Although Costco successfully entered the Chinese market in late 2014 and had opened an online store its presence in the country was only minor. Furthermore stiff competition from both local and international retailers suggested it would be risky to pursue aggressive expansion in China due to a loss of significant revenue and income-earning potential.Mexico was the only other country on the GRDI list where Costco had established a presence. The Mexican retail sector showed a relatively lacklustre growth rate of 2.4 per cent in 2014. Without organic growth the existing players in the industry sought ways to grow their revenue through diversification. Although Costco had a strong presence in Mexico with 36 stores further expansion could be difficult due to market saturation.The GRDI list included 28 other countries with significant retail sales growth potential but Costco was unfortunately absent from these markets. These countries presented both opportunities and challenges for Costco to explore new markets and identify the most attractive options for its next market entry.Increasing Investments in Multi-channel Retailing to Attract Tech-Savvy Consumers In the last two decades the retail sector had witnessed several major technological innovations one of the most significant of which was multi-channel or omni-channel retailing—providing customers with the convenience of shopping through a variety of channels: physical stores social media and websites. Several big box retailers including Walmart had invested heavily to prepare for multi- or omni-channel retailing. Costco on the other hand had lagged. For example South Korea had the highest smart phone penetration in the world: more than two-thirds of the population owned a device and consumers increasingly used their mobile phones to purchase products online. Although the company had an online presence in five countries (the United States Canada Mexico the United Kingdom and China) its online activities were separate from its warehouse operations.What was Next for Costco?With a global presence established in eight distinct markets how could Costco establish itself as a leading transnational retailer? Costco had managed to build upon successes and grow despite turbulent economic conditions. The company had successfully positioned itself as a market leader broken stereotypes and followed unconventional business strategies. As the global retail industry experienced intensified competition top global retailers faced challenges to operate and expand. Although Costco had climbed the global retailer ranking the company faced challenges and uncertainties.In 2017 Costco had selected specific modes of entry for each of its expansions. Walmart still held the top international retailer position and future countries of interest included France Iceland China and India. Costco could not afford to be viewed as hesitant on the international stage and faced some key questions for the future: How could Costco leverage its experiences and continue its expansion successfully? What would be the best method for entry based on existing barriers and culture and operational constraints in these countries? Based upon Costco’s business model and the potential for a large consumer base should Costco enter densely populated Asian countries such as China and India?Exhibit 1: Top 10 Global Retailers Worldwide 2013Source: Deloitte Global Powers of Retailing 2015: Embracing Innovation 2015 accessed July 11 2018 www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Consumer-Business/gx-cb-global-powers-of-retailing-2016.pdf.Exhibit 2: Costco Operating Income and Warehouse CountSource: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed December 3 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 3: Costco Sales RevenueSource: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed December 3 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 4: Costco’s Market Entry Mode and Current Level of Ownership by CountryNote: JV = joint venture.Source: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed May 2 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 5: Costco Wholesale Corporation 2015 Key Facts Note: Warehouse numbers were as of December 31 2015.Source:","[{""start"":1090,""end"":1128,""text"":""Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1944,""end"":1951,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2064,""end"":2071,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2440,""end"":2447,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":31308,""end"":31315,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30891,""end"":30898,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":31022,""end"":31029,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30686,""end"":30693,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3296,""end"":3303,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3720,""end"":3727,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4214,""end"":4221,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4418,""end"":4425,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4602,""end"":4609,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5587,""end"":5594,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6298,""end"":6305,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7061,""end"":7068,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6966,""end"":6973,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9433,""end"":9440,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9507,""end"":9514,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10120,""end"":10127,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10765,""end"":10772,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10320,""end"":10327,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12707,""end"":12714,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13028,""end"":13035,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13159,""end"":13166,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13923,""end"":13930,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14548,""end"":14555,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15370,""end"":15377,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15592,""end"":15599,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16406,""end"":16413,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17101,""end"":17108,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17420,""end"":17427,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18190,""end"":18197,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27155,""end"":27162,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28703,""end"":28710,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28046,""end"":28053,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28912,""end"":28919,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23286,""end"":23293,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":24460,""end"":24467,""text"":""Costco "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]}]"

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2020-06-01In late 2012 Jack Wang general manager at the joint venture (JV) Shanghai Euclid Printing Machine Co. (Shanghai Euclid) considered the JV a partnership between a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) and an American multinational enterprise. After almost two decades and following multiple rounds of downsizing the JV was coming to a close. It was to be succeeded by a wholly owned SOE called Shanghai Gutenberg Printing Machine Co. (Shanghai Gutenberg) and Wang was anxious about the many questions raised by this situation. The first issue the leadership of Shanghai Euclid had to address was how to maintain the SOE in any form after the JV ended since many SOEs in China had closed in recent years. If the SOE portion of the JV was to continue operations as a standalone business a second issue was how to determine the appropriate scale of operations. How many employees should the post-JV company employ? If the scale was to be reduced what basis should the leadership use for inviting people to remain with the organization? Historically the pressure of management and restructuring had caused considerable employee stress; employees were worried about being laid off and felt anxious about going to work. Wang had to make some hard decisions in order to gain employee buy-in and prevent disruption during this time of transition. In particular he had to take into account the nuances of the Chinese approach to downsizing. Were there any alternatives to downsizing? This situation was the biggest challenge Wang had faced in his 30-year career in the printing machine industry. First Stage: 1958–1993 (Pre-Joint Venture)The JV’s Chinese predecessor was established on August 1 1958 as the People’s Printing Machine Factory. Back then it had over 600 employees. As a local SOE it was formed through the merger of seven factories. At that time China had a planned economy and most private factories were transformed into SOEs through public–private partnerships. In December 1958 the People’s Printing Machine Factory produced the first LB403 high-speed rotary press in China for the Southern Daily News. The press could print over 80000 copies of a four-page newspaper every hour. Over the next 35 years the company introduced more than 20 products and won regional and national scientific awards and accolades. Its market share reached around 75 per cent in China. At this time production tasks were issued by government authorities. The company and its employees faced no pressure or competition in the planned economy and SOEs in this era functioned almost like small societies. Each SOE had its own canteen dormitory fleet of cars clinic kindergarten and employee school. Even the space where employees got married was assigned by the company. Whoever contributed to the company got priority in housing and employees paid a small amount of rent to the company each month.In 1992 there were over 1800 employees at the People’s Printing Machine Factory. That same year Deng Xiaoping the paramount leader of the People’s Republic of China between 1978 and 1989 appeared on the cover of Time magazine. He had taken a 2440-kilometre (km) train ride at age 88 to visit South China and had affirmed the achievements of China’s reform and its push towards a market economy. China was changing and opening to foreign investment and business methods.In order to improve operational efficiency many SOEs had begun to enact enterprise reforms in connection with the three types of foreign-funded enterprises: wholly foreign-owned enterprises Sino–foreign JVs and Sino–foreign co-operations. In April 1992 the People’s Printing Machine Factory began a pilot program for its transformation which saw the liberalization of operations and a move towards a market orientation. Departments unrelated to production and operation—such as kindergartens clinics restaurants and guest houses—were separated and profit maximization was prioritized over social services. As China’s economy continued to reform and open up there was a drive to acquire advanced foreign technology and improve products. The company had manufactured and processed parts and products from Germany and the United States starting in the mid- to late-1980s. With changes in the development of enterprises and the needs of domestic users Chinese companies were becoming more ambitious. The People’s Printing Machine Factory wanted to partner with a company that had a long history of printing machine manufacturing world-leading product technology an appropriate product line and a mature global marketing and service network. It wanted to leverage the manufacturing strength of China and consolidate an expansion in the Asia-Pacific market. Thus it sought out an opportunity for a joint venture marking the beginning of the second stage in the company’s development.Second Stage: 1993–2008: Foundation and growth of the Joint VentureThe People’s Printing Machine Factory and the US firm Euclid Printing Machines jointly established Shanghai Euclid Printing Machine Co. in December 1993. While the American company held 60 per cent of the shares the People’s Industrial Group (the holding company that owned the People’s Printing Machine Factory) acquired 40 per cent of the shares. The JV at that time had registered capital of US$15.5 million. The American firm was among the world’s three largest printing machine manufacturers and had over a century and a half of experience.Like its predecessor the JV operated in the printing machine industry—designing manufacturing selling and maintaining printing machinery and related parts (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The company did not make print products such as newspapers or books themselves. The most common types of printing machines used offset lithography digital flexography and screen techniques. The offset printing technique involved transferring an image from a metal plate to a rubber blanket or rollers before it was printed on media such as paper. This technique did not require contact between the paper and the metal plate. Because it was reliable affordable and good quality offset printing was highly efficient for all scales of production. Large-scale bulk printing publications leveraged two primary types of printing techniques: In the first sheet-fed offset printing sheets of paper were placed in the machine one by one and then cut prior to printing. In the second web offset printing paper rolls were printed on and later trimmed and assembled. Because it was cost efficient web offset printing was often used for large-scale printing that varied frequently such as newspapers. Offset printers were the most common type of machine. The digital printing technique used electronic or digital files as a source; press plates were not required to carry the image nor were set-up sheets needed. Compared to traditional (offset) techniques digital printing offered better quality but it entailed higher per-page costs. Other printing processes included flexography (also called rotary printing) and contemporary letterpress printing which represented one of the main choices for large-scale printing. Over the years the change from traditional to digital printing affected Shanghai Euclid’s operations substantially.As part of an effort to foster efficiency during the foundational stages of the JV more than 600 of an initial 1800 employees at Shanghai Euclid were diverted at the end of 1993—that is they were given new jobs elsewhere or retired with compensation. To facilitate the smooth progress of organizational adjustment the company formed a re-employment engineering office. Especially in the beginning the American and Chinese sides disagreed on several issues the first of which was the correct method of dismissing or diverting employees. The Chinese side insisted on gradual and stable methods to promote the optimization of personnel structure and efficiency whereas the American side was used to taking more drastic action.After the JV was created advanced management concepts were introduced and the company’s organizational framework was set up: there was a chairperson on the Chinese side and a general manager on the US side. Departments for personnel finance sales manufacturing quality development and engineering were established. The number of management layers was flattened which led to faster information flow and more efficient decision making. This flat organizational structure presented challenges however as it was a departure from the operating method that was familiar to the Chinese managers and employees. The Chinese employees had particular difficulty adapting to advanced management methods from abroad. Under the SOE mode of operation they had been accustomed to working and getting paid regardless of the firm’s health or profits with wage levels unaffected by performance or effort and they retained the idea of “eating out of one big pot of rice”—a metaphor for egalitarianism. Moreover foreign companies in China sometimes struggled to understand the kinds of employee benefits paid in China. For example when family planning came under government control as a national policy in the 1980s incentives were enacted as part of the one-child policy. A single-child family might receive ¥5–10 per month from an employer as a reward for compliance. Subsidies such as this child benefit were not always entirely understood or taken into account by foreign firms when operating in the Chinese market.Despite the challenges however Shanghai Euclid prospered. In 2000 the JV’s per capita income was the highest in the national printing industry. Later in 2006 Shanghai Euclid set two records. It obtained 22 tower rotary offset presses from Nanfang Daily which together were worth over ¥70 million. The company also set a record for high contract values in the domestic market as it undertook orders totalling more than ¥400 million. Third Stage: 2008–2012: Decline and Closing of the Joint VentureBy early 2008 however a need for change started to become obvious. On February 18 2008 the company set up a re-employment working group according to government requirements. In 2009 the 28th board of directors contemplated closing the foundry and on November 25 the company decided to restructure the foundry. In 2010 the holding company People’s Industrial Group acquired a 100 per cent equity interest in Euclid International (the US partner of the JV). After the acquisition of Euclid International by the People’s Industrial Group the strategy was to integrate Euclid International’s global resources in places like the United States France the Netherlands and Japan; this would make Shanghai Euclid the largest printing machine production base and Euclid International’s Asia-Pacific centre. However with the outbreak of the global financial crisis the sharp decline in paper media advertising and the impact of Internet multimedia the print volume of paper media had also fallen and the demand for printing machines in the market had plummeted. Printing machinery manufacturers were the first to bear the brunt. Their performance declined and many companies lost money. Printing machine companies with more than 600 employees would often dismiss more than 100 employees at once. Due to the global financial crisis Shanghai Euclid’s profits in 2010 were half of those in 2006. After 2011 the international printing machine market further declined due to the development of the Internet mobile phones and new forms of multimedia. Shanghai Euclid’s sales income nonetheless had grown from ¥87 million before the JV to ¥600 million in late 2011. It was the dominant firm in China in terms of market share with two domestic competitors: one state-owned enterprise and one private enterprise. Competition also came from countries like Germany the United States Italy Japan and South Korea. In October 2012 the People’s Printing Machine Factory acquired 60 per cent of Shanghai Euclid’s equity held by Euclid International. Shanghai Euclid became a 100-per-cent state-owned holding company and was renamed Shanghai Gutenberg thus effectively terminating the JV. The foreign employees then left China. While co-operation in the JV had been more or less successful there was a perception that the American side had given up. As well the People’s Industrial Group no longer regarded printing and packaging as key strategic sectors. The future of the printing machine industry pointed to leaner more technologically advanced firms rather than sprawling industrial operations. Around the same time Shanghai Gutenberg signed a land agreement with the Minhang District Planning Bureau marking the official start of the relocation of the new Shanghai Gutenberg factory. This was in line with requirements regarding the transformation of the urban environment whereby the SOE had to follow government orders and relocate the factory 30 km away. The new plant would be located in the Pujiang Town area of the Caohejing Development Zone in Pudong Minhang District and would have a land area of 9.4 hectares (141 mu). The new factory was 15 km from the city centre 37 km from Pudong Airport and 27 km from Hongqiao Airport. The existing staff lived close to the current factory location and were able to ride or drive there within half an hour. The factory relocation meant that the one-way journey to work would require more than two hours. Staff would have to leave at 6:00 a.m. for work leading to employee complaints and management headaches. At the same time some employees of the younger generation presented challenges because they preferred more exciting work such as jobs in social media and struggled with the discipline required for industrial factory work.At this point 668 employees remained at the JV and considerations around diverting and redistributing them rather than terminating their positions outright were a major challenge. It was to be carried out according to China’s labour laws and standards for negotiating employee terminations with respect to labour relations (see Exhibit 3). The People’s Industrial Group included a human resources unit that attended to many thousands of laid-off workers including many elderly people. These workers often faced illness or disabilities and had no children or support network. Because many had devoted their lives to the enterprise they expected that the enterprise rather than the neighbourhood community would care for them. As such this human resources unit often helped these workers purchase insurance attain medical services procure daily necessities and deal with the aftermath of family deaths. The unit had established 12 regional locations that provided services such as living assistance and medical care for the elderly.The human resources department of the company analyzed the circumstances of each company position. Because the company was planning to relocate in the future and wanted to give some veteran employees the opportunity to choose whether or not to work at the new location it also formulated a special Shanghai Euclid employee termination plan. The management wondered whether the diverted or redistributed staff should be able to choose their new destinations. Regardless it would be necessary to formulate a system for evaluating employees. Shanghai Euclid employees knew about this development so the atmosphere of the whole company was tense. Almost everyone was at risk and worried that they would be laid off. The company had formulated guidelines titled “Operational Measures for Workers’ Labour Relations in the Human Resources Optimization Configuration Plan of Shanghai Euclid Printing Machine Co.” (see Exhibit 4) which ran to 5000 words. The problem faced by the management was that employees had to support the rules at the Workers’ Congress and yet a large number of employees would have to be laid off. Management believed that the reforms might lead to the departure of dozens of employees who were less critical for the company’s operations. As a result nearly 200 people wanted to leave and there were many skilled workers in key positions and this was simply too much for the company to maintain. 2012: THE DECISION POINTJack Wang had been with Shanghai Euclid and before the JV with the People’s Printing Machine Factory for almost 30 years having started as a mechanic in the workshop. Because of his creativity and leadership he had been promoted to assistant general manager deputy general manager and then general manager. He was familiar with every facet of the company and he understood its entire history. Because Shanghai Euclid had performed well in recent years employee incomes had improved and employees greeted Wang enthusiastically whenever they met him. The company’s business had spread throughout North America Europe and East Asia. Wang admired Jack Welch of the General Electric Company in the United States and he imagined that one day he could become China’s Jack Welch. Now Wang was challenged with managing employee downsizing in an acceptable way if that was the approach chosen by the post-JV SOE. He had to get employees on board and choose who would relocate to the new plant. What was the appropriate size of the SOE? On what basis should people be invited to remain with the organization? How could Wang implement these changes without unduly or excessively alarming employees or losing the best talent whom he hoped to retain? Were there any strategies besides or in addition to downsizing that could be deployed? How could employee stress be mitigated? He knew he had to make some tough decisions soon.EXHIBIT 1: Shanghai Euclid—OPERATIONS 2009–2013E (in ¥ thousands)Source: Company information.

EXHIBIT 3: EMPLOYEE DOWNSIZING IN CHINA Versus in THE WESTThe Chinese people were taught from their childhood that they were the masters of their country and that enterprises belonged to the nation. As such having a job was their birth right. Under the planned economy almost no one could be fired in the conventional sense; instead people were sent to new jobs or given paid early retirement. Chinese culture pursued social harmony in contrast to the Western pursuit of law and contracts. Although Chinese employees could terminate their labour contracts relatively easily (by providing 30 days’ written notice or three days’ notice during a probation period) employers generally could not terminate employees’ contracts without strong cause and severance payments.Note: SOE = state-operated enterprises.Source: Created by case authors with data from Dan Harris “Terminating Your China Employee.

The payment base is “three insurances and one gold.”* The three categories are:(1) Employees within five years of the statutory retirement age (including five years)(2) Female employees between 42 years and 45 years; male workers between 52 years and 55 years (3) Workers who are disabled due to work and suffer from occupational diseasesEmployees can negotiate with the enterprise to terminate the labour contract in the following three ways:(1) If you are away from the statutory retirement age by more than five years you may receive economic compensation and one-time incentive fees for self-employment.(2) Workers who are disabled due to work suffer from occupational diseases or have lost their ability to work due to illness may apply for financial compensation rewards one-time subsidies and other subsidies.(3) In the case of employees within five years of the statutory retirement age (including five years) the enterprise shall not terminate the labour contract in principle. If one negotiates with the enterprise to terminate the labour contract one shall submit a written application and the enterprise may consider giving a one-time subsidy.The economic compensation rewards one-time subsidies and other subsidies for the termination of labour contracts are to be negotiated and details include:(1) Quick reward fee:Signing time for completing the labour relationship cancellation procedureWithin 10 working days: RMB10000 + 2 months’ wageWithin 15 working days: RMB7000 + 1.5 months’ wageWithin 20 working days: RMB4000 + 1 month’s wageMore than 20 working days: RMB0(2) Re-employment subsidy: a one-time employment subsidy of RMB6000(3) For employees who have special difficulties after the application is filed by the enterprise the enterprise union will verify the employee’s one-off difficulty subsidy:Subsidy content (RMB5000 each):Children who are still in school (preschool primary school university) Spousal unemploymentWidowed or single parent supporting underage children Employee spouse and minor children who are seriously ill or undergoing treatment Spouse who was an employee of the company and has been diverted from their postDisability Service retired military support Other help (except for other subsidies and circumstances mentioned above) The statutory retirement age of the employees referred to in these measures: men 60 years; women 50 years. In the 15 working days after the completion of the formalities for the cancellation of the contract the enterprise will settle the compensation and incentive fees at one time and remit the employee’s salary card or the bank card provided by the employee.Notes: *Three insurances = pension insurance unemployment insurance and medical insurance; One gold = housing provident fund (used in the purchase of a mortgage) until formal retirement (the individual payment was partly borne by the enterprise); RMB = Chinese yuan.Source: Company records.","[{""start"":2593,""end"":2598,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2291,""end"":2296,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1536,""end"":1541,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1092,""end"":1101,""text"":""Jack Wang"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18363,""end"":18368,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18031,""end"":18036,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18020,""end"":18025,""text"":""Welch"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17885,""end"":17890,""text"":""Wang "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17255,""end"":17264,""text"":""Jack Wang"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1747,""end"":1753,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2928,""end"":2934,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3154,""end"":3160,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3444,""end"":3449,""text"":""China"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4355,""end"":4361,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4258,""end"":4264,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4119,""end"":4125,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5038,""end"":5046,""text"":""China’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5718,""end"":5724,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10052,""end"":10058,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10131,""end"":10136,""text"":""China"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12710,""end"":12716,""text"":""China "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13227,""end"":13232,""text"":""China"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2430,""end"":2433,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4187,""end"":4190,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18627,""end"":18630,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18619,""end"":18622,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18472,""end"":18475,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17966,""end"":17969,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17991,""end"":17994,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18158,""end"":18161,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17614,""end"":17617,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17562,""end"":17565,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17463,""end"":17466,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

This increased scale will drive further efficiencies and benefits to both Tassal’s salmon offering as well as seafood and uniquely position Tassal for its next phase of growth.Mark Ryan chief executive officer (CEO) of Tassal Group LimitedIn August 2018 Tassal Group Limited (Tassal) signed a deal to acquire a shrimp farming business from the Fortune Group’s prawn aquaculture business. This strategic move was to further diversify from its core salmon market to a seafood market. Earlier in July 2015 Tassal announced the acquisition of De Costi Seafoods Company (De Costi) in a deal of combined cash and shares. The acquisition would allow Tassal to address a A$4.3 billion Australian seafood market that was much larger than the previously addressable salmon market of only $700 million while simultaneously improving their economies of scale and scope in production logistics and retailing. Such species diversification was not a new strategy for Tassal: in 2013 the company launched the Salamanca brand for wholesaling imported Norwegian salmon in Australia. Tassal was the largest among the three major producers of premium Tasmanian salmon farmed in inshore pens located in Macquarie Harbour. However the harbour had been under the scrutiny of the Australian authority for mass production and adverse environmental impacts. Given the problems with Macquarie Harbour Tassal’s CEO Mark Ryan had many questions to answer: Should Tassal continue to expand overseas? What were the motives behind the acquisition of De Costi? Did the company have sufficient capabilities and resources to cope with the high demand for Tasmanian salmon particularly in the Asian market? Did the acquisition address Tassal’s vision and its long-term strategy?HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENTTassal was founded in 1986 on the island state of Tasmania Australia as a small salmon farm and hatchery. It was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2003 with headquarters in Hobart Tasmania’s capital. It believed in vertical integration as an effective strategy as early as 2007 when its first salmon shop and restaurant were opened. In 2010 it was Australia’s largest salmon producer sharing 70 per cent of the country’s production. Tassal opened a second hatchery and salmon shop in Kew Melbourne in the same year. In 2011 it launched innovative products such as Tassal Gourmet Salmon Smallgoods and Tassal Salt Reduced Smoked Salmon. In 2013 it launched Salamanca Seafood Company to sell high-quality smoked Norwegian Atlantic salmon to the domestic wholesale market.Growth StrategyTassal had grown through several mergers and acquisitions. It acquired some of the 11 companies that owned leases in Tasmanian waters becoming the industry leader with its high market share and large variety of distribution channels. Tassal provided customers with a large variety of fresh smoked canned and frozen salmon products under various brands including Tassal Superior Gold Tasmanian Smokehouse De Costi Seafood and Salamanca Seafood. As a vertically integrated company Tassal had supply chains scattered throughout the state—freshwater hatcheries saltwater aquaculture sales and marketing and distribution and retail (see Exhibit 1). It also had a sales and marketing office on the mainland in Melbourne Victoria.Tassal focused on increasing the per capita consumption of salmon in the Australian market increasing the margins by improving production processes and strengthening market promotions. Australians were willing to pay slightly more for domestic-quality seafood. Increased fish supply better pricing and efficiency improvements had driven the growth of Tassal’s revenues and profits. Tassal derived 70 per cent and 30 per cent of its revenues from the domestic and export market respectively. The salmon and seafood segments accounted for approximately 84 per cent and 16 per cent of the company’s total sales respectively. Domestic consumption was thus particularly important to maintaining Tassal’s profitability as it could compensate for exchange rate fluctuations in the export market. These factors had contributed to Tassal’s financial performance in 2016. Brand StrategyThe Tassal brand dedicated for the local Tasmanian salmon was Tassal’s cornerstone. Other brands were also introduced for salmons from other areas. For example in 2013 the company created the Salamanca Seafood brand for selling imported Norwegian salmon to Australian wholesalers. It was also a hedge against risks in locally farmed salmons. The acquisition of De Costi in 2015 was also intended for brand and product extension.AccreditationsIn 2012 Tassal joined WWF-Australia (World Wide Fund for Nature) in a three-year partnership project. It was the only salmon producer in Australia that was authorized to use the WWF logo on product packaging. The company had received numerous awards for achieving the highest global standard of responsible seafood production. In 2012 it was the first salmon producer in Australia to achieve the full Best Aquaculture Practices certification at the farm level by the Global Aquaculture Alliance. In 2014 it was the first company to achieve Aquaculture Stewardship Council certification the gold-star rating of sustainable salmon farming.COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT The Australian fisheries and aquaculture industry was a minor producer and exporter producing less than 0.2 per cent of the global market share which was valued at approximately $3.1 billion. Tasmanian salmon was a premium product selling at a better price in the local market. In 2016 Australia’s salmon farming industry was worth more than $700 million. There were a few major domestic players and international competitors.Tasmania’s second-largest salmon farmer behind Tassal was Huon Aquaculture Limited (Huon) founded in 1986 and headquartered in Dover Tasmania. Due to a strong domestic demand and premium prices for Tasmanian salmon Huon mainly focused on the domestic market’s wholesalers supplying salmon to restaurants supermarkets fishmongers and other food businesses.Founded in 1949 Petuna Seafoods Tasmania (Petuna) leased fishing pens in the Macquarie Harbour alongside Huon and Tassal. In 2010 it sold half of its shares to Sealord Group Limited an Australian and New Zealand global seafood enterprise creating opportunities for major facility upgrades and large infrastructure investments including marine farms and hatcheries.Van Diemen Aquaculture Limited and Saltas Limited were relatively small compared to the first three producers of Atlantic salmon—Tassal Huon and Petuna. The former was a sea farmer while the latter mainly operated hatcheries. Both were privately owned and sold products domestically.To meet the strong domestic demand it was necessary to import salmon from overseas. However international competitors were not seen as a threat to the three major domestic players as the imports still allowed them to maintain competitive pricing with a relatively higher quality product.ACQUISITION OF DE COSTI SEAFOODSIn July 2015 Tassal announced the acquisition of De Costi to combine salmon and seafood markets into its operations. This strategic move was intended to ensure the sales growth and returns of its seafood category. The resulting increased scale would strengthen efficiencies and benefits in Tassal’s salmon and seafood categories while preparing the company for future growth. De Costi was a logical target because it was one of the largest players in the Australian seafood industry.In 1974 George Costi and his wife started out with a small fish stall at Paddington Markets in Sydney before founding De Costi in 1981. Its head office procurement and distribution centres were in Lidcombe New South Wales. From a humble beginning De Costi had developed into one of Australia’s largest fresh seafood suppliers. Its facilities were fully automated with large areas to facilitate huge volumes of seafood processing and packaging for further distribution.De Costi distributed its seafood products mostly to the eastern side of Australia and South Australia. Its main customer was Woolworths Group Limited a major Australian company with extensive retail interests throughout Australia and New Zealand. It also supplied to Metcash Limited which was Australia’s leading wholesale distribution and marketing company. In 2015 De Costi’s turnover was approximately $138 million with an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $10 million and net profit before tax of approximately $5.3 million (see Exhibit 2).Motivations The acquisition would allow Tassal to access a larger combined salmon and seafood market in Australia. In 2015 the total seafood industry in Australia was worth $4.3 billion of which salmon and other seafood were worth $0.7 billion and $3.6 billion respectively. The acquisition could bring about synergies within the two entities including product expansion and production efficiency. Tassal could continue to improve existing production facilities while creating new ones including new fish pens without large capital outlays.By joining forces with De Costi Tassal could improve its customer value proposition with a wider and more sustainable product range. Tassal could also improve category management of its new seafood products. The acquisition would improve Tassal’s product technology and innovation thereby increasing its product exposure in Australia’s states and export markets. It would also open new opportunities for Tassal in other food services and help the company build relationships with other retail stores. The acquisition would allow Tassal to focus on its original brand in wholesaling while expanding the retail base through the De Costi brand. The move would also align perfectly with Tassal’s strategy to create and maintain multiple brands and to avoid diluting its original brand. According to Ryan the acquisition had put in place the right foundations for Tassal to pursue the salmon and seafood strategy. The acquisition would help Tassal maintain its overall profitability in the face of uncertainty in local fish farming changes in climatic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations for international markets. During fiscal year (FY) 2016 Tassal was faced with higher costs and less-than-optimal supply due to warm water throughout the summer and autumn months while a high percentage of retail sales volume and pricing were already locked in. These unfavourable issues were reflected in Tassal’s financials for the second half of 2016 where the salmon revenue was comparatively lower than expected.Terms of the Acquisition DealThe payment for the acquisition comprised two components—first an upfront cash payment of $50 million at the completion of the proposed acquisition; second a growth-based earnout payable in new Tassal shares over each of the three financial years from FY 2016 to 2018. The compliance restructuring alignment and integration costs for De Costi amounted to $1.1 million.In particular the upfront payment was based on a multiple of five times the maintainable EBITDA of De Costi’s business in 2015 which was about $10 million. The growth-based earnout depending on meeting the performance targets would also be paid for approximately five times the maintainable EDITDA over the three-year period from FY 2016 to 2018. This contingent earnout was capped at a maximum nominal amount of $30 million and a maximum of 10 million new Tassal shares for that entire period.Under such contingent payment Tassal issued 2.1 million new shares to De Costi (based on its FY 2016 performance) which were 65.6 per cent of the maximum possible earnout for that year (see Exhibit 3). Because of De Costi’s increased post-acquisition operating performance in FY 2017 Tassal issued two million new shares to De Costi which were 60 per cent of the maximum possible earnout for FY 2017.Financial ImpactsTassal had restructured De Costi to ensure that it provided a solid operating platform for Tassal’s sustainable growth initiatives. The restructuring addressed inefficiencies in the seafood supply chain while integrating Tassal’s best practices to increase operational capabilities and further synergies. Despite higher salmon costs and relatively locked-in domestic channel sales Tassal had achieved good performance due to its efficient production and supply chain—particularly in the wholesale market. Such supply chain efficiencies could be partly attributed to De Costi’s strong location advantage which enabled it to service retailers along the east coast of Australia and South Australia. In particular Tassal’s EBITDA in FY 2016 was up by 4 per cent to $97.29 million (see Exhibit 4). This increase was partly due to additional earnings from De Costi and improved operational efficiencies of balancing the product mix. Importantly the cash flow had also increased to $50.2 million which could buffer Tassal from adverse conditions—especially from the local salmon farming—while facilitating its investments for profitability and growth in the long-term. In FY 2016 Tassal also received a five-year tenor of core debt facilities from existing Westpac Banking Corporation and Bankwest which provided the company sufficient leeway to counter agricultural risks and allowed it to consider expansion opportunities.Following the acquisition in FY 2016 however Tassal’s net debt had increased to $69.6 million ($48.9 million of which was used to fund the acquisition). The gearing ratio and funding ratio had also increased (see Exhibit 5). In the first half of 2018 Tassal reported a growth in revenue and operating earnings of 23 per cent and a growth in operating cash flows of 69.2 per cent to $40.6 million. The higher cash flows and the capital raised in the second half of 2017 had significantly reduced the gearing ratio to 13 per cent which provided greater flexibility for long-term investments. These positive figures had substantially strengthened Tassal’s overall financial position. The earnout arrangements could be tricky for De Costi especially when the earnout was tied to the company’s profits or sales. In particular De Costi would become a division of Tassal and have to achieve some mutually agreed upon goals and it could not fully control the necessary resources to achieve them. However the integration had improved the earnings of both entities. In particular Tassal reported an additional expense of $6.7 million to be paid from the company as part of the terms for the earnout payment in FY 2017.Tassal’s operational focus on De Costi’s advantages—innovative product and packaging supply chain efficiencies strong distribution of seafood in Australia’s eastern seaboard and species diversification—was a success as the seafood revenue in the first half of 2018 grew to $42.5 million from $41.1 million and $35.7 million in the same period of 2017 and 2016 respectively. With Tassal’s market dynamics and De Costi’s supply chain efficiencies the combined entity had been successful in species diversification. The acquisition allowed Tassal to effectively put in place a strong set of competencies—particularly in vertical integration from aquaculture to processing and marketing—to diversify into the wider seafood market.Strategic ImpactsThe acquisition of De Costi—one of the market leaders in the seafood industry with strong retail outlets—was a very important strategic move that allowed Tassal to address a much larger Australian seafood market of $4.3 billion from the previously addressable salmon market of only $700 million. This acquisition was a major pivot point in Tassal’s product portfolios and technology to ensure strong sustainable growth. The acquisition had helped in driving Tassal’s seafood sales through a better use of supply chain channels and an optimization of operational costs. Tassal was shifting its focus to a balanced marketing mix by reducing the retail sales and focusing more on the larger volume of the wholesale market. The company was also focused on improving product and packaging and a balanced salmon number and weight. The strategic shift had helped Tassal to improve cash flows and optimize returns.The vision of both companies aligned well in that the De Costi mantra was to source the best-tasting freshest seafood possible while Tassal aimed to create a better tomorrow for the industry. As George Costi the company’s former CEO agreed to continue managing the operations of seafood products for at least three years the post-acquisition integration had proceeded smoothly. This friendly acquisition was successful as De Costi’s seafood segment continued to grow within the Tassal group. The acquisition fulfilled Tassal’s quest for species diversification from salmonids to the entire seafood segment. In 2018 Tassal signed a deal via a De Costi subsidiary to acquire a shrimp farm for over $20 million from the Fortune Group’s prawn aquaculture business aiming to increase its shrimp production sixfold. The acquisition of prawn farms was a further step in its diversification. With the market value of $750 million in 2015 prawns were a major segment in the Australian seafood market that still had a shortfall in supply of approximately $420 million. Due to the strict regulations for obtaining a prawn-farming licence it was easier to simply acquire a company to overcome that entry barrier. This further step would be facilitated by leveraging De Costi’s supply chain advantages and Tassal’s market leadership. Species diversification was a risky move if the parties involved were not familiar with the associated risks in the new segments. Tassal’s prior experience in pioneering vertical integration in the salmon business would be a valuable asset for the company to replicate this expertise in other seafood segments in order to drive category growth (see Exhibit 6).Based on sales channels the Australian seafood industry was divided into retail food service and institutional markets. The acquisition of De Costi had given Tassal easy access to the retail seafood market. Although the seafood segment accounted for less than 20 per cent of Tassal’s total revenue the acquisition of De Costi had allowed Tassal to leverage both companies’ market positioning and supply chain efficiency to further improve market share in both salmon and seafood.TROUBLES IN MACQUARIE HARBOURSalmon farming was introduced in Tasmania in the 1980s after it was found that this island state could successfully farm Atlantic salmon. Tasmanian salmon was considered a fine delicacy and a premium product in Australia. Among 11 companies only the three large salmon farmers—Tassal Huon and Petuna—remained farming salmon in Tasmanian waters. Tasmania was the largest salmon export state in Australia (see Exhibit 7). Macquarie Harbour was the first place where intensive salmon farming started in Australia. It was located on the west coast of Tasmania bordering on a wilderness World Heritage Site. These three companies were still farming salmon in this inlet. The production capacity of salmon pens in the harbour had more than doubled over the last few years up until 2018.However the environmental impact of salmon farming on the area had put the harbour in a state of stress. The Environment Protection Authority which was Tasmania’s principal environmental regulator stated that 21000 tons of fish feed had ended up on the sea floor in 2015 creating huge areas of waste. The specialists stated that the natural landscape of Macquarie Harbour was not suitable for intensive farming due to its narrow inlet known as Hell’s Gates. The inlet was not wide enough to create a big enough tide to help drain the harbour of the feces and fish feed that were ending up on the sea floor. Such deposits were detrimental to the sustainability of the ecology and the farm’s production capacity was forced to step down to 9000 tons in 2018 from 21500 tons in 2017.In 2016 Tassal accounted for about 70 per cent of the state’s farmed salmon—a capital-intensive industry with a three-year harvesting cycle. Tassal owned three leases in Macquarie Harbour. Any troubles in Macquarie pens would be reflected negatively in Tassal’s income statement. The cost of farmed salmon production was increasing year after year. Marine farming however was much more expensive than maintaining the pens in Macquarie Harbour.Ocean warming and a reduction in dissolved oxygen levels were harming the growth and weight gain of the salmons that were being farmed in Tasmanian waters. With warmer waters the farms required more labour for bathing the fish at harbour pens to combat amoebic gill disease. Also protests over the use of synthetic astaxanthin—a chemical in the fish feed used to ensure that farmed salmon had pink flesh similar to wild-caught—had forced major salmon producers in Macquarie Harbour to move to natural astaxanthin which further drove up costs. Then following the massive death of salmon in Tassal’s pens and the ensuing investigations in early 2018 there was public outcry for closing down the pens though the warming ocean water was considered to be the cause. To overcome such public resistance Tassal and Petuna had jointly managed their salmon pens in Macquarie Bay to ensure the sustainability of the seabed and the allied ecosystem. The increased costs had also forced Tassal to withdraw from renewing some fixed-price salmon supply contracts. According to Ryan this move was to balance out the supply-side stress due to the large-scale deaths and increasing production costs of farmed salmon. Tassal’s expansion into the larger seafood industry and plans for vertical integration of prawn farms might also be viewed in the light of these issues to maintain a balanced product mix and mitigate risks of Tasmanian salmon farming. Therefore the acquisition of De Costi had provided Tassal with access to the related seafood markets. Importantly the acquisition and other diversification efforts would help to buffer troubles in the salmon farming industry at least in the short term. Although Australian salmon production was only a small percentage of global salmon production any adverse changes would have repercussions in the domestic seafood market. In 2018 Tassal had resumed exports to take advantage of high global prices. Tassal believed that their bigger fish could be sold at premium prices particularly in Asia as the company planned to open a sales office in China.EXPANSION TO ASIAN MARKETSThe demand for seafood in Asian markets was expected to increase due to stable economic growth a rise in population and the availability of seafood. Seafood was a relatively cheaper alternative to meat for Australian Indian and Chinese customers. The expansion into seafood including the prawns market would help Tassal offset losses owing to increasing costs of salmon production and deaths of salmon in marine pens from climatic changes. Since the acquisition of De Costi Tassal had entered into several joint ventures and planned for further acquisitions and its balance sheet supported such plans. Australian exports of fresh Atlantic salmon to China had risen steeply in January and October 2017 from the same months of 2016 (see Exhibit 8A 8B and 8C). China imported 5137 metric tons of salmon in 2017 which was an increase of 477 per cent. According to Ryan Supply volumes are seasonal and the recent increases have been in part due to strong biomass growth from our farms with fish reaching their optimal harvest weight and seasonality of market demand. We are harvesting some of the largest salmon in the world at present meaning a strong supply of very large fish which the Chinese tend to favour.For Tassal the forecast for an increase in salmon consumption in China and possibly other Asian countries—like Japan and South Korea where Australian salmon was perceived as a premium fish—was a great opportunity for long-term growth. Given environmental challenges in Macquarie Harbour and the growing demand for the salmon and broader seafood markets in Asia Ryan wondered whether Tassal’s acquisition of De Costi made sense.Exhibit 1: TASSAL’S OPERATIONAL BASESSource: Created by the case authors based on Tassal Group Limited “Our Operations” accessed October 26 2018 https://tassalgroup.com.au/our-planet/our-operations/.Exhibit 2: DE COSTI SEAFOOD’S INCOME STATEMENT (IN million A$)Notes: EBITDA = earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization;

She had just wrapped up her 21st year of teaching college courses within Philadelphia prisons through Inside-Out. Now she needed to prepare for the summer Inside-Out’s busiest season for international instructor training. As Pompa reflected on the past year she knew she needed to raise more funds to support the program’s vital work and hire additional staff. University students and incarcerated students alike regularly referred to the course as having been life-changing. Program participants around the country were so passionate about the experience that even after leaving the program they continued meeting regularly in Inside-Out “Think Tanks” to educate their communities and advocate for prison system reform. Faculty from the Inside-Out Instructor Training Program reported that the training had revived their passion for teaching and prisons participating in Inside-Out noted improvements in the behaviour and mental health of the incarcerated students. Despite the success stories Pompa knew it would take more than anecdotal evidence to gain new funders. Prison education funding was competitive and foundations and individual donors increasingly required tangible impact measurements to demonstrate program efficacy. Gathering that data within the strict boundaries of the prison system would be a challenge and might call into question the efforts and effectiveness of the Inside-Out Network members—hundreds of colleges universities sponsors and instructors. Assessing long-term impacts seemed nearly impossible because it was difficult to keep track of participants as they graduated from the college program or completed their prison sentences and returned to the outside world. Plus as Pompa looked ahead to the upcoming summer she knew any measurement efforts would need to be extremely cost-efficient. Without the funding to hire extra staff she and her existing team were already stretched thin. Creating Inside-OutWhen Pompa joined Temple University’s Criminal Justice Department as teaching faculty in 1992 she made prison visits a regular part of her curriculum. “Part of my personal mission is to get as many people to visit inside prisons and jails as possible” Pompa said. “We as a society are only able to continue to incarcerate 2.2 million people because so many of us don’t know what’s going on. Getting people to visit inside prisons is one of the ways that change is going to happen.”Pompa had spent years working in prisons and becoming familiar with the landscape. Still she found herself surprised by the impact of these prison visits. “One day a few years into teaching I remember taking my students to speak to a panel of men who were serving life sentences in prison.” The discussion quickly moved beyond basic criminology questions. “We talked about crime and justice and race and class and politics and economics—and how it was all interwoven. Up to that point I had never had this powerful of a discussion anywhere.” Following the discussion one of the men from the panel suggested that Pompa teach an entire course within a prison for both incarcerated and university students. Pompa couldn’t get the idea out of her head. She began planning and negotiating with prison and university officials and two years later she offered the first full-semester course at a local jail. Each week 15 university students (“outside” students) came to a jail to meet with 15 incarcerated students (“inside” students). She recalled “At first I was really focused on what we could learn together about crime and justice. What I didn’t expect was the other learning that unfolded before my eyes. People were learning about themselves about communication about conflict and about society and their relationship to society in a totally different way.”One inside student agreed: “I started seeing things I could do. In the eight years I’ve been incarcerated I’ve never felt so strong about wanting to make a change.”Designing a Successful CurriculumEach Inside-Out course involved equal numbers of inside and outside students meeting weekly inside a prison or jail. Students sat in a circle with inside and outside students alternating. “What this circle represents is an opportunity to bring people back into the community” said Pompa. She screened all of the students both inside and outside prior to admission to ensure that they could handle the workload and the unique social demands of the course. “I was so trying to be at ease” said one outside student recalling her first day in the course. “But as soon as [the inside students] entered the classroom you didn’t have to try because everyone was so amiable.” Pompa was clear about the goals of the Inside-Out courses: “We were not going in to study the folks on the inside. We were not going in to help them; nobody asked us for help. We were not advocating for them in any way. . . . It was really studying together.” Pompa stayed in the background as much as possible facilitating conversations between the students to help them learn from each other. The students completed coursework around a central theme such as criminology or sociology but discussions naturally diverged into a wide range of issues including race poverty education and students’ experiences inside and outside of the walls. “They come in seeing us as criminals” one inside student said reflecting on an ethics course he took “and we may see them as people in school or the outside world or whatever . . . but the point of ethics is to see past that and to see the actual person. It fits for the class because there’s two different worlds coming into this class trying to learn the same thing.” Correctional facilities kept a close eye on programs such as Inside-Out that operated within their walls. Prison wardens were highly interconnected and bad news travelled quickly. “I’ve seen really wonderful programs get shut down because people bring in contraband or people fall in love or something occurs” Pompa said. “We cannot afford for that to happen. Period.” To protect these boundaries the only personal information exchanged by students was their first names. Students agreed not to contact one another outside of class even after completing the course. “You go into this class knowing that you can never be in contact with the inside students again” one outside student recalled. “And leaving on the last day was saying goodbye forever. Honestly I think that’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” Thanks to these boundaries Inside-Out had not had any major incidents in its 21-year history but Pompa knew it was an ongoing risk. “If anything bad were to happen—an injury or accident—correctional facilities could get rid of the program in a heartbeat.”Global ExpansionWhen Pompa first began teaching Inside-Out classes the program met in a jail in Philadelphia. Because those in jail had relatively short sentences some of the inside students were released midway through the course each semester which disrupted classes and learning. In 2002 Pompa had the opportunity to move her courses to Graterford Prison a maximum-security prison located an hour’s drive outside of Philadelphia. Due to the longer sentences that people served in prison inside students at Graterford could commit to full-semester courses and the classroom discussions became even richer. When Pompa’s first course at Graterford ended none of her students wanted to stop meeting. They decided to continue coming together weekly and became the “Graterford Think Tank” a critical guiding and advising body for the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program. By 2018 the Graterford Think Tank had been meeting weekly for over 16 years.Following Pompa’s initial success two colleagues from Temple University approached her about teaching their subjects through Inside-Out and expanding the program within Philadelphia. Later the Graterford Think Tank suggested expanding the Inside-Out Program nationally. To coordinate the expansion Pompa founded the Inside-Out Center and became its executive director. In 2003 Pompa received a Soros Justice Senior Fellowship to fund the expansion and in July 2004 the Inside-Out Center offered its first training session for faculty from other universities. “We were afraid that nobody would come because it was too weird an idea” Pompa recalled. “We were hoping for maybe 10 to 12 people. We got 20 people in the first training from all over the country.”Instructor training classes consisted of 15–20 faculty who spent 60 hours over seven days discussing course structure completing team projects and meeting with the Think Tank inside of the prison to talk through curricular and diversity issues. “You cannot go in without preparation” said Pompa. “Instructors must know the language prisons use and what questions to ask.”The instructor training sessions cost $2700 and centred on Inside-Out’s unique dialogue-based approach to education which emphasized learning how to communicate deeply across large social differences. In an Inside-Out learning circle “students on both sides have a voice in the world despite their different opinions” said Interim Executive Director David Krueger “and this method of dialogue is important to creating basic values of civic conversation.”The instructor training proved to be very successful not only for preparing faculty to facilitate Inside-Out classes but also to encourage deeper exploration of what it meant to teach. “It was very experientially oriented” said Wade Deisman a professor from Vancouver reflecting on his week-long experience in 2015. “It renewed my sense of teaching mission at a fundamental bedrock level.” By the end of 2018 925 instructors had been trained to offer Inside-Out programming in 45 US states and 12 countries and about half of these instructors had taught Inside-Out classes.Part of the instructor training was focused on starting new Inside-Out courses which meant creating university–prison partnerships. By the end of 2018 more than 150 partnerships had been formed between correctional facilities and educational institutions as diverse as Ohio State University and Stanford. One Inside-Out program in Mexico was made up of students who had worked in drug cartels while another at the University of Sydney focused on incarcerated women. As the programs grew Think Tanks sprang up organically and by 2018 the Inside-Out Center was coordinating communication between more than 30 of them. In all 35000 inside and outside students had completed coursework in many disciplines such as criminal justice law ethics sociology literature and even yoga. The Inside-Out CenterAs Inside-Out courses spread into new communities the Inside-Out Center expanded to serve as the formal hub of the international network. In addition to coordinating faculty training and overseeing the network of Think Tanks the Inside-Out Center handled media coverage maintained the website tried to connect with alumni and promoted the organization’s vision and values (see Exhibit 1). Including Pompa the Inside-Out Center employed two full-time and five part-time staff. The Inside-Out Center did not have a board but relied instead on three committees of Inside-Out instructors and staff to lead key initiatives. The Executive Committee assisted with major decisions especially at critical decision-making points or as new issues arose. The Network Committee offered direction in building out the teacher trainings and provided ongoing support to the faculty network. The Evaluation and Research Committee assisted groups or individuals who were interested in evaluating the program and also oversaw the ethical considerations that could be raised by research and evaluation efforts. The Think Tanks continued to play a pivotal role in the leadership of the Inside-Out Network. Think Tank members helped plan and conduct training sessions; developed independent projects such as re-entry programs for people who were being released; and led community workshops on racial education justice and civic participation. Indeed as civic dialogue became increasingly polarized Think Tanks began to explore ways to promote dialogue across all kinds of social fault lines. Finally Think Tanks provided continuity and coherence. Because so many of its members were serving life sentences the Graterford Think Tank in particular provided an unusually stable source of guidance thought-leadership and cultural continuity for the Inside-Out Network. “The Think Tanks were generated out of a bonded feeling and deep connection” said Tyrone Werts an Inside-Out veteran who had served 37 years behind bars before joining Pompa as the international Think Tank coordinator. Think Tank participants spoke movingly of the importance of the Think Tank’s work and took satisfaction in affecting the outside world by learning with and helping to educate outside students instructors and community members.The Inside-Out Network was highly decentralized and all of the funding for specific courses came from participating institutions. Tuition dollars from the outside students funded the instructors’ salaries while partnering correctional facilities provided inside students with classroom space and correctional officers. The Inside-Out Center itself was funded primarily through foundation grants donations from individuals and earned revenue from the faculty training sessions. Private funding required long hours of work to obtain and was unpredictable. For example in 2015 The Inside-Out Center applied to renew a $300000 grant through the Ford Foundation but was awarded only $100000 in part because the foundation had changed its remit (see Exhibit 2). Higher Education in PrisonsAs of 2016 70 per cent of all US high-school graduates were enrolling in (although not necessarily finishing) colleges and universities and from 2013 through 2018 the higher education industry grew slowly but steadily at 1.8 per cent annually to become a $497.3 billion portion of the $1.5 trillion education industry. Despite that growth university administrators were increasingly concerned with projected declines in the numbers of high-school graduates rapidly increasing internal costs and growing public criticism about the high cost of college tuition. To remain competitive and engage potential new students universities worked to differentiate their offerings. Online education volunteer programs travel abroad experiences and community engagement programs such as Inside-Out were among the strategies universities employed to help their programs stand out. Prison education was a particularly relevant learning opportunity for students in 2018. The Black Lives Matter movement was raising awareness of racial discrimination in the United States including the disparity in incarceration rates based on race: African Americans were five times more likely than Caucasians to be incarcerated and made up 40 per cent of all people incarcerated in the United States despite representing only 13 per cent of the population. The divisive 2016 presidential election had also drawn attention to the lack of political dialogue about these differences across the country and pointed to the need for civil discourse between people holding differing views. Indeed from a smattering of local university programs started in the 1970s (such as Villanova University’s launched in 1972) prison education had grown into an estimated $62 billion industry. While Inside-Out was unique in its approach it competed with several other innovative programs. The Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform and the Petey Greene Program sent trained volunteers to tutor incarcerated individuals with the dual goals of offering prison education and advocating for structural reforms. The Bard Prison Initiative offered college courses and degrees to people incarcerated in six prisons in New York State and boasted a 2 per cent recidivism rate among graduates. In 2015 prison education efforts received a boost when government-backed Pell grants were made available in a limited way to help fund education for people in prison—although by 2018 the new administration had indicated that it was unlikely to renew the grants. In recent years technology-based prison educational solutions had also become available. Code 7370 was a non-profit computer programming class in San Quentin California that sought to reduce recidivism by helping people in prison prepare for jobs in technology and business following their release. Because students had limited access to technology they completed assignments without Internet access by using special desktop computers with double-monitor configurations that allowed them to receive instruction from remote teachers through an administrator’s computer. American Prison Data Systems Innertainment Delivery Systems and Edovo (Education Over Obstacles) made customized tamper-proof tablets equipped with educational materials available to people in prison for about $2 per hour. JPay another competitor provided in-prison video educational and gaming content and an e-messaging service to help people in prison connect to families “to empower those individuals with access to educational tools and assist in their overall rehabilitation process.” JPay offered jails and prisons approximately $0.05 for every message between people in prison and their families a lucrative extra revenue source for participating facilities.Education’s Effect on People in PrisonEducation played a complex role within prisons. Prisons around the country faced numerous issues including overcrowding understaffing high turnover rates among officers and low funding for employee training and operations. Poor conditions had the potential to increase tensions between prison staff and those incarcerated which could contribute to violence. One review of incidents in Maryland prisons documented $860000 of medical care required as a result of 257 assaults not including the costs associated with five deaths (two officers and three incarcerated individuals) lost work time for officers injured and extra legal costs. These realities made attractive any program that could decrease violent incidents in prisons.Prisons also struggled with budget shortfalls. Indeed many prisons had begun to bill prisoners for essentials such as meals toilet paper clothing and dental care a practice commonly referred to as “pay-for-stay.” “Why should the people of Elko County pay for somebody else’s meals in jail?” asked one commissioner in Elko County Nevada where a pay-for-stay program had been implemented. Others saw these programs as part of the punishment. “If they are violating the law” said one sheriff in Iowa “then they should be the ones to pay for it.” Officials in Riverside County California voted to approve a plan to charge people in prison for their stay and reimburse the county for food clothing and health care stating “You do the crime you will serve the time and now you will also pay the dime.” National studies had demonstrated that prison education led to multiple positive outcomes for incarcerated individuals and for society at large. Completing college courses while in prison improved self-esteem and social competence both during incarceration and following release. It also reduced the experience of violence while inside prison (by about 9 per cent according to one study). Further a careful assessment of 58 studies suggested that any exposure to education while in prison (whether at the high-school or college level and whether or not completed) resulted in a three-year recidivism rate of between 30.1 per cent and 38.6 per cent compared with between 43.3 per cent and 51.8 per cent for those receiving no education while in prison. Estimates of the cost to society of crimes committed varied widely from $2100 per incident for theft to $87000 for assault to $8650000 for murder. Other estimates suggested that over a full career men with bachelor’s degrees averaged $660000 more in median lifetime earnings than did high-school graduates and for women it was $450000 more. For both men and women with some college education the differential was $170000. Funding ChallengesDespite the steady growth of the Inside-Out Network and the passion of the students and instructors involved Pompa worried about the Inside-Out Center’s sustainability. As costs rose universities worried about class size and Inside-Out classes typically had no more than 15 paying (outside) students to cover the cost of faculty time—from $10000 to more than $25000 per course. Prison wardens had more education offerings including technology platforms from which to choose. With the politicization of all discussions concerning prisons and race there was an increased need to engage in public relations on behalf of the Inside-Out Center’s dialogue-based approach. Even Inside-Out’s growth had created challenges as the already busy staff computers systems and travel budgets were stretched almost to the breaking point as they struggled to accommodate the increases in instructors to be trained partners to be managed Think Tanks to be coordinated and alumni to be engaged. Worst of all funding was becoming ever more fickle. The partnership with Temple University had provided core support over the years including access to office space and partial funding of Pompa’s salary but the level of support varied with leadership changes and budgetary constraints and centres including Inside-Out were being increasingly pressured to generate additional funds. Grants and donations were becoming harder to obtain and renew putting more pressure on earned income from training programs to cover expenses. Over the years the Inside-Out Center had secured a few large grants but each lasted for only a limited time often because the foundation priorities changed. Complicating matters foundations (and even individual donors) increasingly asked for rigorous often quantitative measures of impact. In a 2017 survey 98 per cent of funders said that impact was among their top three considerations when awarding grants while 88 per cent of respondents said they prioritized program outcomes in their review of non-profit reports. Finally the Inside-Out Center struggled to secure the resources and staff required to track down and engage its alumni base—a task made all the more difficult by the realities that the alumni were young and/or incarcerated and that they identified with local Inside-Out programs rather than with the international Inside-Out Network.Measuring Inside-Out’s ImpactMeasuring the impact on inside students was a delicate proposition. The Inside-Out program prided itself on treating people in prison as people in contrast to the correctional system which literally referred to incarcerated individuals by their inmate numbers. Historically people in prison had been used in studies without their consent which reinforced the need for the Inside-Out Center to be clear about its methods and goals if it did choose to begin collecting data. Federal regulations and university practices seriously restricted the study of “vulnerable populations” including people in prison. The Inside-Out Center also shied away from measuring recidivism citing the intense pressure people faced upon their release. “I’m not under the illusion that this is a silver bullet” Pompa said. “When somebody gets out of prison there are so many variables hitting them. There is no way that a 15-week class is able to stand up against those variables.”Measuring the impact on outside students was similarly challenging as the Inside-Out courses were but one part of the college experience. And measuring the impact of the Inside-Out Network was harder still with its alumni dispersed across a dozen countries and multiple prison systems.Reflecting these realities many staff and Think Tank members argued passionately that the power of Inside-Out was in the transformation of individual participants both inside and outside and so was best captured in stories not numbers. Further some suggested that trying to capture the experience in numbers might detract from Inside-Out’s mission and culture. When reporting program results Inside-Out had long focused on stories. Students completing surveys at the end of each course regularly reported that the course had changed their lives affected their majors and career choices and impacted their perspectives on criminal justice and themselves. Informally several correctional institutions and Think Tanks had reported improved behaviour and increased leadership internally following Inside-Out courses but there were no systematic records. Further while these stories were inspiring they captured only short-term impacts. Several times Pompa and her team had attempted to follow up with instructors to learn what impacts they had noticed related to their classes. “We really wanted to put a finger on the lasting impact” Krueger said “to see what [the experience] means five years from now.” Unfortunately these attempts to collect impact data were limited due to lack of resources and staff time.Finally questions of ownership and impact emerged from the questions about measurement. Who were the numbers for and how could Inside-Out maintain control over access to and the use and interpretation of the measures? Would funders interpret the measures the same way that Inside-Out did? Would prison officials or governments or competitor programs gain access to the measures? In the highly controlled world of prisons a world in which even small events or missteps could be amplified Inside-Out had been extremely careful to preserve its standards and control its story. Would an attempt to quantify impact in any way distort or distract from the Inside-Out experiences and effects that the measurement was meant to convey?Next StepsAs Pompa prepared for 2019 with 10 training sessions scheduled in several countries a number of new Think Tanks emerging and efforts to connect with alumni expanding she knew something needed to change. The past 21 years had proven that Inside-Out worked—that students prisons and communities benefited from Inside-Out’s unique approach to learning. Yet Pompa also knew that the Inside-Out Center desperately needed to secure a steady stream of funding to support the Inside-Out Network in an increasingly competitive prison education and funding context. Both to raise Inside-Out’s profile and to secure additional resources the Inside-Out Center needed to find a cost-effective and culturally appropriate way to measure and communicate its impact to its many stakeholders. The question was—how?Exhibit 1: Inside-out Mission and Vision statementsThe Inside-Out Prison Exchange ProgramSocial Change through Transformative EducationMission StatementEducation in which we are able to encounter each other especially across profound social barriers is transformative and allows problems to be approached in new and different ways.

(AREUFIT) assessed her company’s position in the evolving health services market. Stuart had grown AREUFIT from a sole proprietor start-up to its current position as the Philadelphia region’s award-winning provider of preventive health and biometric screenings corporate health and disease prevention programs and wellness services with annual revenues approaching US$1 million (see Exhibit 1).Stuart had spent the last three years working with an outside consultant in preparation for the next stage in the life cycle of her company. For any founding chief executive officer (CEO) having determined a new future strategic direction represented a personal and professional crossroads. As Stuart recounted “I love what I do and I love going to work. It’s not a burden right now and I don’t want to get to that point so this is the time for exploring options.” When a competitor approached her with an offer to buy AREUFIT Stuart knew she had to make some tough decisions while remaining true to her values and business practices. She wanted to preserve the company and culture she had built protect her key employees and ensure that the brand reputation of AREUFIT would endure.The personable high-energy Stuart understood that uncertainty in the health care industry was a constant factor driven by changing regulatory and economic conditions. However the emerging importance of big data analytics the escalating costs of technology investment the increased threat of competitors eyeing the regional market and a sense of having achieved key personal and professional milestones led Stuart to reflect on AREUFIT’s future and her role in the company. AREUFIT HEALTH SERVICES Inc. COMPANY HISTORYAREUFIT was a privately held corporate wellness services firm that helped employers in the Greater Philadelphia market develop and implement employee wellness programs. It had been providing preventive health screenings wellness services and health education programming since 1992 long before “wellness” became part of employee benefits packages. The company was especially proud of its ability to deliver high-quality customized service packages designed to help clients reach their short- and long-term preventive health and wellness goals. AREUFIT had won and retained contracts with a diverse portfolio of high-profile clients in the Philadelphia market. AREUFIT was a product of the volatile health services industry. Established as a sole proprietorship in 1992 and incorporated in 1996 AREUFIT started by accident. Having pursued a graduate degree in exercise physiology Stuart supported herself by managing an outpatient exercise program for a Philadelphia hospital. Unsure of the potential insurance impact from sweeping health care reforms proposed by Bill Clinton the US president at the time Stuart’s employer reacted with deep budget cuts and the corporate wellness program was abruptly eliminated. However companies had begun to value wellness services as meaningful employee benefits so Stuart began accepting contracts from her former clients. As she recounted “one gig led to another” and offered her a way to finance and complete her doctoral degree.Risk-taking and financial bootstrapping characterized AREUFIT’s start-up. Initial capitalization from friends and family including a $2500 loan from an uncle enabled AREUFIT to make its first significant equipment purchase. While Stuart was taking part at an event a health insurance executive saw how poorly the company’s mobile health van was being managed and offered Stuart a contract to take over the van in 90 days. Stuart accepted and told her small crew “we’re going to fake it until we make it.” As the wellness industry became more mainstream AREUFIT expanded its product line augmented its preventive health screenings with health education components and facilitated connections to technology partners.The 2008 financial crisis forced AREUFIT to get “lean and mean” to survive the decline in clients. Stuart reflected on this time and said “I would never have made these changes if the financial crisis hadn’t forced us to work differently and the fact is we’ve never gone back to the old ways.” Under this lean model AREUFIT employed six full-time lead staff and up to 40 part-time and contract workers brought on to address the seasonal fluctuations of the business (see Exhibit 2).AREUFIT’s LEADERSHIP: CEO Jeannine Stuart Stuart completed her undergraduate degree at Ursinus College and earned a master’s and doctoral degree in exercise physiology from Temple University. Lifelong interest in sports wellness and community engagement was evident in Stuart’s professional and personal life. A former marathon runner and avid supporter of Philadelphia pro football and baseball teams Stuart also formed partnerships with a wide variety of non-profit organizations that promoted health and wellness. She taught kinesiology for many years at West Chester University as an adjunct professor and had been active with community volunteers in Medicine.Stuart built a business that reflected her passions and her personality. She moved AREUFIT’s offices from an office complex in Malvern Chester County to a farmhouse in West Chester Pennsylvania restored to be a comfortable casual family-culture workplace. She built a culture of autonomy and incentives indicative of the role her lead staff and employees played as key company assets. In 2012 and again in 2016 AREUFIT won recognition from the American Psychological Association (APA) as a Pennsylvania Psychologically Healthy Workplace. APA recognized AREUFIT as a national Honoree in 2018. In addition Stuart was awarded the 2007 Small Business Development Center of PA Entrepreneurial Achievement Award. CORPORATE WELLNESS SERVICES INDUSTRY BACKGROUND The corporate wellness services industry was an outgrowth of changes in insurance economic demographic and socio-cultural trends. As a relatively new industry it experienced significant growth from 2013 to 2018 as many businesses purchased wellness programs to try to contain rising health care costs. To cite one factor in response to the obesity epidemic many businesses implemented biometric screening services. According to a 2017 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) 25 per cent of companies surveyed reported that they had increased their wellness program benefits in the previous year with this trend expected to continue through 2023.A wide variety of products and services that fell under the general category of corporate wellness included programs such as smoking cessation bundled measurements such as health risk assessments or education classes on nutrition exercise and stress management.RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE THE NEW NORMALAs the cost of health care continued to rise employers continued to view the preventive potential of corporate wellness programs as a possible solution to reducing company health care costs.According to the Center for Disease Control’s National Health Interview Survey “. . . the prevalence of obesity among US adults aged 20 and over increased from 19.4 per cent in 1997 to 31.4 per cent in January–September 2017.” With the rise in obesity the number of associated health consequences also increased. One way to facilitate health promotion was through employee health management programs (EHMPs) defined as “. . . ongoing organizational activities designed to promote the adoption of personal behaviours conducive to maintaining and/or improving employee health.” Specifically the growth of EMHPs resulted from various factors including increased health care costs enhanced performance among employees increased competition globally and domestically and modified technological processes toward more automation. Since the 1980s EHMPs (also known as workplace wellness programs) offered fitness health promotion and wellness campaigns.  The Society of Human Resource Management had recently conducted its annual survey of employee benefits among US employers. Of the companies surveyed “. . . three-quarters (75 per cent) of employers offer wellness resources and information and/or a general wellness program.” According to the survey only 62 per cent of these employers provided general wellness programs specific to their employees. The efficacy of industry services largely depended on employee participation rates. Particularly related to AREUFIT’s mission only 41 per cent of the surveyed companies offered annual health risk assessments and 30 per cent provided on-site health screening programs. Although this information was not region-specific this data showed that there was a growth opportunity to partner with organizations that provided risk assessments and on-site health screenings along with other preventive and educational programs.Profit was expected to rise as businesses expanded the scope of their corporate wellness programs and offered more services convenience and possibly even access to data of their employees. Advances in technology coupled with personal wearable fitness devices such as the Apple watch and Fitbit were emerging as possible disruptors. One method of counteracting their influence was the creation and implementation by wellness services providers of workplace healthy lifestyle programs that offered comprehensive educational organizational and environmental activities for employees and their families. TECHNOLOGY CHANGING DATA COLLECTION AND ACCESS Technology used to measure an individual’s wellness information independent of situations where they were patients or undergoing prescribed treatments was categorized as person-generated health data (PGHD). A 2017 survey of 2000 employers revealed that among their employees 35.0 per cent currently used wearables and 48.6 per cent were considering purchasing wearable devices for wellness within the next year. The survey also found that 60 per cent of users prioritized the usability of the mobile application as a deciding factor. Major criteria that promoted favourable adoption of wearables included connectivity with wellness vendors long battery life and an employer-facing dashboard with a view of usage and performance. However the survey concluded that PGHD at the time lacked “. . . a clear theoretical basis a set of data models and empirically derived strategies for integrating tools and data into existing clinical applications.” FROM NICHE TO NATIONAL: COMPETITORS SEEK EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIESAn IBISWorld industry report indicated a low to moderate level of market share concentration in the corporate wellness services industry. In 2018 the top four companies were expected to account for less than 25 per cent of industry revenue. Reflecting the diversity of products services and types of providers the industry was highly fragmented.  Commonly many corporate wellness companies targeted market niches such as non-profit or public-sector organizations. Beacon Health Options Inc. for example focused its effort on providing behavioural health and wellness services to active duty members retirees and their families through the United States Department of Defense’s TRICARE program.Among the national market most companies were comprehensive wellness providers who partnered with other organizations. Their services included health risk assessments health fairs health education programs and other wellness programs. Major industry players were national companies such as Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. and Mobile Health Management Services in the private sector. Similar to AREUFIT Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. provided consultative services to companies to develop their own wellness programs for their employees. Mobile Health Management Services Inc. was a nationwide provider of occupational health particularly for initial health employee screenings and drug test administration. Government funded agencies such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. and Pennsylvania’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) offered limited wellness services. Medical organizations such as CVS Pharmacy and Acme Markets Pharmacy were also active in the wellness industry. Various insurers also had a significant impact on the prospects for the wellness industry.AREUFIT’S FORMULA FOR REGIONAL DOMINANCEAREUFIT had a significant presence in Philadelphia and the surrounding five-county region as well as in the adjacent states of New Jersey and Delaware. As the fifth-largest US city Philadelphia offered an attractive expansion target for national companies looking to grow. As a small firm AREUFIT had been able to accommodate employers of all sizes. AREUFIT’s client list included Philadelphia-based organizations from small companies with 25 or fewer employees to large companies with 17000 employees. Another distinctive feature was AREUFIT’S practice of sending cross-trained and professionally certified employees not subcontractors to their client workplaces. Through investing in cross-training AREUFIT created a flexible staff that was able to fill needs in a variety of environments from a mobile vision screening lab to biometric screenings. AREUFIT pioneered mobile health screening vehicles in the Philadelphia marketplace. Since 1996 AREUFIT helped its clients identify vehicles for purchase vetted and oversaw vendors for the retrofitting process managed the maintenance of the vehicles and provided professional staff and management of vehicle operations. AREUFIT provided evidence-based health education tailored to meet specific client needs. The company offered face-to-face biometric reviews and health coaching health education displays and awareness campaigns and workplace seminars developed and delivered by a team of health educators. A sampling of educational services AREUFIT provided demonstrated the company’s wide range of audiences expertise and revenue sources. For example one service was teaching fifth graders about the dangers of smoking funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Chester County Health Department. Another service was providing cancer education to Chester County businesses funded by a Pennsylvania cancer education grant. Yet another service was providing vision care education to registered nurses and children in the Philadelphia school district.To augment its core competencies of preventive health screenings and education and provide the wellness “platform” employers increasingly required AREUFIT formed alliances with national data groups such as StayWell Health Management Active Health Management and WellWorks for You. AREUFIT provided essential data collection on cholesterol body mass index glucose and other areas and worked with its partners to analyze the data and create an information portal. If clients opted for additional tracking AREUFIT monitored their participation in preventive health actions such as mammograms health examinations and vision check-ups. Stuart believed that AREUFIT had a lock on the Philadelphia regional market. The CEO summed up the company’s strengths as follows: Preventive health screenings and education and the full-cycle management of the mobile health screening vehicles. What makes AREUFIT so good at what we do is we’re responsive we’re local. I think this space is very different from other parts of the country. Businesses in Philly really like to do business with other local companies.VOLATILITY IN THE WORLD OF WELLNESSSeveral key external forces that had significant impact on the wellness services industry included changes in insurance coverage uncertainty about regulations advancing technology and a lack of industry definition.Insurance in the Age of the Affordable Care ActIn the 1980s the health insurance industry shaped how corporate wellness programs were defined. More recently consolidation in the insurance industry concentrated the power insurers held. In the regional Philadelphia market three dominant companies—Independence Blue Cross (IBC) UnitedHealth Group and Aetna Inc.—replaced as many as eight previous insurers.  As AREUFIT’s CEO Stuart reflected on her years in the industry: The insurance companies are now out of the wellness business from a client marketing perspective. They claim the Affordable Care Act [ACA] put too much pressure on their profits. In response to perceived threats of the ACA they eliminated the service of helping their clients establish wellness programs. IBC as an example used to provide an account executive to help their subscribing companies identify a wellness services provider. When Independence Blue Cross cut the mobile van services and eliminated the wellness department as a cost-saving measure in 2016 their corporate clients were given a stipend to contract with wellness services providers on their own.This shift in decision-making and cost allocation disrupted the market for wellness providers. Human resources executives had another responsibility added to their already burdened departments. Competing wellness service providers had to strategically focus their services and their key differentiators to win contracts from individual companies. In addition it became more critical to attach a return on investment (ROI) figure to wellness programs. Self-insured companies with 1000 or more employees could often see a correlation between wellness dollars spent pharmacy claims improved employee productivity and lower absenteeism because they knew where their health care dollars were being spent. For small and mid-size employers even when C-suite executives may have felt that a wellness program was the right thing to do without a clear ROI figure it became increasingly difficult to justify the fee-for-services model of contracting with a wellness provider.Regulations and Tax RevisionsVarious government agencies—such as the United States Department of Labor US Department of Health & Human Services and US Department of the Treasury—provided guidance on the development and administration of wellness programs. Companies also had to comply with provisions from the ACA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 particularly those related to non-discrimination and privacy. The Internal Revenue Service issued a “Chief Counsel Memorandum clarifying that case rewards under a wellness program are always taxable as income and cash fringe benefits . . . are never excludable from income.” As Stuart summarized “There are so many regulations that you would have to just dedicate a team to making sure that you are always in the forefront” of regulatory requirements.Technology and DataBeyond the use of wearable technology web-based tracking and data collection were important factors within the wellness industry particularly since corporate partners sought an ROI for offering the programs to employees. Online platforms were difficult and costly to develop. As a result each company maintained proprietary control of the infrastructure. Even health insurance has gone more and more digital enabling subscribers to log on to their account to input an individual wellness survey.Lack of Industry DefinitionAlthough there were various forms of certification and professional training available and some regulation was in place Stuart expressed her frustration that “. . . anyone can call themselves a wellness provider” and provided the example of “. . . an individual who lost 30 pounds and wants to take you on their wellness journey.”  Stuart spent a great deal of time educating prospective clients about the genuine qualifications of her employees. Especially after cost surfaced as a key factor it was time consuming and difficult to convey the value underlying the higher price that a professional organization like AREUFIT charged. Another significant contributor to the difficulty of measuring ROI for employers was the lack of consistency in data collection measurement and analysis.THE DECISIONStuart had to make a decision: grow or exit. Ultimately her decision was shaped by her combined professional and personal tenets:I’m a firm believer in staying true to your core competencies because if you stray from them I believe that you lose your product. I have been working for the past 26 years to position my business. I've met some of my own personal goals and I feel like I kind of want to move on to the next thing though I’m not sure what it is. The climate today is what I based a succession plan on but the market is not now what it once was and I have no idea what it will be five years from now.EXHIBIT 1: FINANCIAL OVERVIEWNote: COGS= Cost of goods sold; All numbers are on a cash basis; *Expenses include: advertising automobile expense professional consulting dues/subscriptions educational expenses insurance (health WC auto GL) payroll expenses employee benefits printing postage subcontract office overhead travel/tolls entertainment wages and utilities.Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: ORGANIZATIONAL CHART FOR AREUFITThe professional AREUFIT staff consists of health educators exercise physiologists registered nurses certified paraoptometric technicians massage therapists health coaches medical technicians interns CPR/First Aid instructors and support staff.Six employees are salaried employees.

He had been in the library consulting Google for information about growth options for his newly developed social enterprise and he wondered how he was going to scale—to continue to make a difference in his community while ensuring the sustainability of the business. It was January 11 2014 and he could not believe that after coming so far he would find himself stuck without a clear way forward.BACKGROUNDNomjana did not belong at the University of Cape Town: he was not a staff member or registered student. His home was Khayelitsha 26 kilometres (km) from where he was standing. Khayelitsha was an informal township settlement on the large sandy plain known as the Cape Flats outside the city of Cape Town. Khayelitsha an isiXhosa word meaning “our new home” was a possibly ironic reference to the township’s establishment following forced removals during apartheid in the 1950s. Khayelitsha was the second-largest township in South Africa.According to the 2011 census Khayelitsha was home to over 390000 people; it occupied a densely populated area next to a main highway that ran east from Cape Town. It was a predominantly residential area mainly occupied by low-income Africans many of whom had come from the Eastern Cape more than 500 km away in search of work and a better life. Over half (54.5 per cent) lived in informal houses or shacks and 41.7 per cent were unemployed. Most of the inhabitants lived in abject poverty and had little access to Cape Town’s wealthy economy.Khayelitsha had been referred to as a “food desert”—an area in which the people faced high levels of food insecurity and low levels of diversity in their dietary options. Quite simply most households in the area struggled every day to get access to enough healthy food and water to live comfortably. It was in this context that Nomjana spent his teenage years always looking for a way to put food on the table in the shack that he shared with his aunt and two younger cousins.EARLY YEARSNomjana was born in Butterworth in Eastern Cape. When he was 13 his father passed away and because his mother was not working the family began to struggle financially. For the first time he was forced to look for ways to survive. His mother had worked for a catering company so she would make meals and Nomjana would sell the food in town. He felt forced to become an entrepreneur. Nomjana remembered “I could see how my mother was suffering and I chose then to make sure that I took the initiative.” Every morning he would go to school and in the afternoon still wearing his uniform he went out to sell his mother’s food.Later Nomjana moved to Cape Town to live with his aunt and focus on his school work—only to be faced with a similar situation because his aunt was also poor and self-employed sewing clothes for others and selling them from her shack. Soon Nomjana was selling the clothes door to door after school. He said “It was a tough situation. I would come back and would have to catch up with my homework and assignments and stuff.” But he began to enjoy it because “it was training for me to do it. I had the passion for selling and dealing with people.”He finished high school and then went to work for Edgars a national retail clothing chain.  He came from a clothing background so he liked fashion. After working at the retail company he thought of starting his own business. Since Nomjana worked in the stockroom he knew the factory that was supplying clothes to the retail store.EARLY ENTREPRENEURIAL EXPERIENCEWhile still working at Edgars Nomjana went to the factory bought some clothes and began selling them door to door after work and during the weekends until he came to a point where he could leave his corporate job and could carry on with his business. However he quickly became aware that his business had a fatal flaw. The neighbourhood he was selling in was a profoundly poor one which meant that successful sales could only take place if he offered his impoverished customers credit rather than selling for cash. But they did not always pay what they had promised. He explained: “Cash: I needed cash to get clothes and then if I get my money in 30 days or 60 days there was no cash flow.” Within a year this first business had failed.Undeterred Nomjana looked for other opportunities in the community and he noticed that people liked to have their pictures taken so he started a photographic business. He took pictures of people drinking in taverns and going to churches. It was 2010 and smartphones had not really penetrated the townships. He recalled how he started the photographic business: I borrowed a small machine an instant photo machine. It was like a Polaroid and in the township it was a new thing. I would take a picture of someone show it to them then ask “Do you like it? Do you know you can get it now?” Then I would give them a price and charge them for the picture. But I was spending everything I earned. So it didn’t take long for this second business to fail as well. At that point Nomjana began to lose heart because he realized he had been doing his own thing for some time and it had not worked. “I just told myself ‘I am not an entrepreneur’” he remembered. He began to think that maybe he should be working for someone else while he tried to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. TURNING TOWARD SOCIAL ENTERPRISEThe failures he experienced allowed him to learn: “I started to understand that I needed to give what I had in order to receive what I did not have. Crazy but that was what changed my life.” He did not have anything in terms of material assets or anything tangible that he could imagine but the idea persisted in his head. “I kept saying to myself ‘Give your time to someone help someone and the business ideas will come.’ That came true.”One day he noticed a garden—a green space in the centre of the ramshackle houses. He discovered that the garden was owned by elderly women in the community and that the garden represented a memory of a rural past for them. The women were too frail to do the hard physical labour of gardening and there was no irrigation. Actually the garden served a much more social than commercial purpose. The women ate most of the produce they grew and although they were willing to sell to people who came to inquire the sales were not generating much income. He thought “Maybe if I join them I can transform the garden from 70 per cent social to 70 per cent commercial by selling the produce door to door.” He approached the women and promised to do the hard labour of planting creating compost and harvesting in exchange for gardening lessons. He observed that “there was wisdom in that garden.” He told the women he could transform the garden within three months and that if he did not manage to transform it they could keep the harvest. The plan worked. He was planting harvesting and selling door to door every day.All of the money that came from door-to-door sales went back in to fund the operation of the garden: to buy seedlings and equipment and to transform the garden into a viable commercial operation. He was living alone in a back yard and paying himself a small stipend of ZAR250.00 (US$17) per month which was enough to rent his shack. With only vegetables to live on Nomjana became a vegetarian. His hard work began to bear fruit as the garden became more commercial and sustainable every month. He also planted fallow spaces adjacent to the original garden expanding the size until eventually he was employing six other young people to work there while he sold the produce. DEVELOPING A PASSIONThe more he learned about gardening the more Nomjana began to see that what counted was finding the vegetable that could deliver maximum nutrition quickly and cheaply. During the learning process something happened: “I fell in love with spinach. For me it was miraculous—without understanding anything in terms of agriculture or nutrition. Every day when I come into the garden spinach was just there.” Nomjana started to research spinach using the computers in the local library and he soon discovered that spinach was a “superfood:”It is loaded with tons of nutrients in a low-calorie package. Dark leafy greens like spinach are important for skin hair and bone health. They also provide protein iron vitamins and minerals. The possible health benefits of consuming spinach include improving blood glucose control in people with diabetes lowering the risk of cancer and improving bone health as well as supplying minerals and vitamins that can support a range of different nutritional needs.From his research Nomjana was convinced that spinach could make a difference in the lives of the people of Khayelitsha. Everywhere he went he told community members about the benefits of spinach and encouraged them to eat it. The community began to call him the Spinach King or at times the Popeye of Khayelitsha. FINDING THE OPPORTUNITYNomjana began to seek out the people who could benefit most from the spinach miracle. Once again the wisdom of the old ladies in the garden provided an answer. They said “Do you know all of us are chronics? That is why we grow the vegetables.” Chronic disease was an epidemic in South Africa. Two out of three women and two out of five men in South Africa were overweight. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as Type 2 diabetes stroke and cardiovascular diseases were the cause of more than half (57.4 per cent) of all deaths in the country according to a study conducted by Statistics South Africa in 2016. NCDs were known to result from poor diets and inadequate exercise. Nomjana did not know that people could get chronic diseases from what they ate. He went to volunteer at the local clinic telling the sister in charge of the clinic that he wanted to promote vegetable consumption among the patients. He worked with the dietitian and one of his duties was to translate the menu—the recommendations and diet plans for the people who were suffering from chronic diseases. Nomjana learned from the patients and from the dietician about nutrition and about the country’s food-based dietary guidelines for healthy living which recommended daily intakes of nutrients and provided guidance about substances such as salts types of fats and sugars. He realized that people in Khayelitsha who were poor and unemployed had little interest in lengthy meal preparation and preferred to eat cheap government-subsidized white bread and convenience food. Nomjana recognized an opportunity to incorporate spinach into products that people were already consuming on a daily basis with the aim of creating a healthier community. “If people are eating bread I will make spinach bread. If they are consuming muffins I will make spinach muffins. If they are consuming rusks I will make spinach rusks” he said. After conceptualizing the idea Nomjana began to look for someone to fund it.He approached banks and went to the government as well as several angel investors but no one showed any enthusiasm for the project. As Nomjana learned “In South Africa you don’t go to a bank when you need money. You go to a bank when you already have money.” The investors he was meeting also said no unconvinced that there would be a demand for so-called spinach bread and unimpressed by his lack of a revenue stream or even a prototype. Nomjana’s experience was not unique in the South African context. While the country had a relatively strong banking system and well-developed financial markets start-ups and micro-businesses continued to be under-served. Some reports indicated that this sector represented the largest funding gap—between funding available for the sector and funding needed by the sector—which was estimated at between ZAR86 billion (US$6 billion) and ZAR346 billion (US$24 billion). Many early stage small micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs) struggled to meet the traditional credit risk assessment requirements making them unattractive to most financial resource holders in the country. This situation was made worse by the low levels of education of many owners of small enterprises in South Africa which made their battle to expand even more challenging. The low levels of financial literacy and weak financial planning and management skills made matters more difficult: many SMMEs did not know who to approach for funding or of how to apply. This generally made the search for funding time consuming and inefficient and it rarely resulted in successful applications. However Nomjana did not give up because by then he had developed a burning desire to start a business which he continued to believe could make a difference to the lives of the people of Khayelitsha. He realized that he was “wasting time because the capital that I was looking for outside was within me. The intellectual capital that I had was sufficient on its own. It formed about 90 per cent of what I needed to start the business.”EARLY EXPERIMENTATION AND GROWING PAINSReturning to the garden he had built he asked for four bunches of spinach. Then he used the ZAR100 (US$7) in his pocket to buy some bread ingredients. He found a recipe by consulting his “old friend” Google and asked his neighbour if he could use her oven. He felt those resources were sufficient to start. In the beginning he used the neighbour’s ovens without paying for the electricity. “I started by baking four loaves. Then I sold them and used the money to bake more: four to eight eight to 16 16 to 24. By the time I was baking 16 every day I started to pay for electricity.” At this point Nomjana was selling each loaf for ZAR10 (US$0.70) making about ZAR1 (US$0.07) profit per loaf and slowly inching his way toward bigger volumes. He admitted that in the beginning his customers did not really like the spinach bread because it contained no salt or sugar—just spinach. Later the products tasted good as well as looked good; but at first they ate them because of the health benefits extolled by Nomjana as he sold them: “I was passionate about educating people about the importance of health the importance of eating healthy the importance of consuming vegetables to eradicate the chance of chronic disease. For each and every loaf I sold there was education at the back of that sale.” Within three months Nomjana was facing the problem of high demand and low capacity. The neighbour’s oven could no longer keep up. “People were wanting what I produced but I couldn’t offer it to them” he said. He went back to the innovation drawing board: “I was just forcing my mind to think creatively and innovatively.” Nomjana popped into a local Spar a national chain of franchised “mom and pop”-style grocery retailers. He asked the manager of the Spar if he could use the spare capacity in the on-site bakery in the Khayelitsha store. The manager asked Nomjana if he had the money to rent the ovens. “I said ‘No! I might pay rent later.’” The manager advised him that he needed a capital infusion into the business so that he could pay rent and make this product and told him he could “come back to us when you are ready. Then we can give you a shelf to sell the bread.” But Nomjana argued: “I want to bake here when you are baking. When you make your brown bread and your white bread I will put my spinach bread in between. That is the deal.” The Spar manager laughed because Nomjana was a very different kind of young man but he could see the benefits to the community so they shook hands on the deal.After a week of using the ovens at Spar Nomjana realized he had underestimated the rate at which the outlet produced bread. Suddenly he had to sell 120 loaves a day—a lot more than the 50 loaves he was expecting. He could barely cope walking up to 25 km a day just selling. He needed help and fast. He wanted to employ five people with five bicycles so that he could distribute the bread more effectively and he needed money for that: he would have to consult either a bank or an investor but his previous experience had left a bad taste in his mouth. “I didn’t want to waste more time. I was a bit arrogant” he said.FINDING A FUNDING CROWDBy googling “easiest funding alternatives” Nomjana found information on crowdfunding—specifically a site called Thundafund South Africa’s leading online crowdfunding marketplace for creatives and innovators. Thundafund’s Nicholas Dilley explained how crowdfunding platforms worked:Crowdfunding is the new bank loan without the pressures of repayments. Crowdfunding is an online method of fundraising that allows people all over the world to put their ideas or pitches onto a digital platform. These pitches are then available for people worldwide to see and to decide whether or not they would like to support the campaign. There are four main types of crowdfunding: Rewards-based donation-based equity-based and debt-based each with its own unique purpose.Nomjana started documenting everything he was doing on a Blackberry smart phone. He took videos and pictures of himself walking along the streets of Khayelitsha to sell and deliver bread and telling people why he needed the five bicycles. The business concept was an innovative idea presented by a young enthusiastic person from an impoverished township near Cape Town.Over one and a half months Nomjana’s videos went viral and he achieved almost 1 million views of his posts on the Thundafund website. His campaign goal had been to raise ZAR10500 (US$732) for the bicycles but by the time the campaign closed he had raised over ZAR20000 (US$1393).Nomjana went looking for unemployed youths to employ. He trained them on how to sell the spinach bread and rode the bicycles with them—he also continued to sell the bread. Although the five workers were earning only commissions he told them “Guys I am teaching you business here and I am actually giving you training on how to be entrepreneurs yourselves.” Nomjana added proudly “All of them have businesses today.”He knew that Spinach King was going to be big because there was great demand for his products and he knew that his products were healthy and that the formula was perfect. His vision was much bigger than the community itself.A DREAM TO GROWBy December 2013 after a year of using the Spar ovens Nomjana had saved ZAR50000 (US$3484) by keeping his costs low and paying neither rent nor salaries. Spar was happy to continue to host the business—especially because the products were being sold in the store. Spar’s regular customers were not part of Nomjana’s original target market and they were prepared to buy Spinach King products at higher prices than those in the townships. Nomjana explained “People don’t have a problem paying more because we tell them they are actually giving an opportunity to poor people to also buy and get nutritious stuff.” Nomjana had begun to understand that he was running a social enterprise and that he had to find a way to be sustainable so that he could continue to assist others. Nomjana added “If the business is 100 per cent social then it is not sustainable. If it is at least 50:50 then it is balancing. That is how we want to be.” He felt ready to take the next step on the journey to sustainability—to develop a replicable model of a bakery that could take healthy eating to impoverished communities everywhere. He knew exactly what he wanted: a containerized express bakery. He had developed a plan for the production floor based on everything he had learned about operations and production while he had been using the ovens at Spar. Nomjana envisioned a bakery that used the same processes as the bakery at Spar but on a smaller scale. He had worked out that his team could make the bread and muffins on one side of the container and sell the merchandise on the other side. He believed that such a bakery was a key component in his plans to grow and scale Spinach King.However Nomjana also knew that ZAR50000 (US$3484) was not enough to build his dream bakery. He needed more money—three times as much in fact. This seemed like an impossible amount for a 23 year old from Khayelitsha to raise. On the other hand the crowdfunding campaign had generated a significant amount of publicity for the Spinach King. “I was in Forbes Africa as an upcoming innovative concept in Africa. I was on CNN and SABC. I don’t know how many times people were writing about the Spinach King.”But Nomjana had no idea how he could leverage this positive publicity. As he gazed at the gorgeous city of Cape Town he wondered what the options might be for scaling his social enterprise and how he could raise the money he needed for his dream bakery. What other options were available for expansion? He wanted to continue to make a difference by improving the health of people in impoverished communities but the question was how? This time Google did not have an answer for him.","[{""start"":1059,""end"":1081,""text"":""Cape Town South Africa"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1082,""end"":1096,""text"":""Lufefe

Eandis operated one of the leading low- and medium-voltage electricity networks in Europe. The company’s financial plan was more complex than it had been in previous years because the company needed to decide whether to roll out smart meters to their Belgian customers—a decision that could be seen as an opportunity for growth. At the same time Van den Bossche was aware of the regulatory risk that came with such large investments in his field. Thus far the company had been operating in a regulated monopoly governed by a cost-plus (cost+) pricing regime. In that regime the company recovered all of its costs from the fees grid users paid to access the electricity distribution network. The charges were expressed in volumetric tariffs of euros per energy unit. The cost+ regime had motivated Eandis to invest in the grid infrastructure; however that regime was about to be replaced by an incentive regulation scheme—a pricing regime that would involve either a price cap an upper limit on the unit prices charged to network users or a revenue cap (an upper limit on the total revenue the DSO could earn). With the anticipated change in revenue structure the company needed a new financial analysis for the company’s planning processes; the new analysis would need to anticipate the potential changes in regulatory structure and how the changes would affect a decision to invest in smart metering. The CEO summarized “With the funding needs ahead for the DSO industry it is important to prove to potential institutional investors and other stakeholders that we have looked at all reasonable scenarios to assess the impact on profitability equity debt turn over . . . you name it.” The Power Grid Industry in EuropeThe power grid industry was rapidly changing and low- to medium-voltage grid operators which were asset-intensive owners of vast infrastructures merited attention. Electricity DSOs played an important role in Europe’s energy system: they linked the transmission system with 260 million connected customers delivering approximately 2700 terawatt hours (TWh) of electrical energy per year. Europe’s DSOs collectively employed approximately 240000 people. Distribution grids had been previously regarded as merely the last mile in the delivery of low- and medium-voltage electricity; however with more technology penetrating the grids the future role of DSOs was increasingly a topic of discussion. Europe’s DSOs approximately 2400 in number were likely to become the central hub and backbone of future intelligent power systems. Several forces were challenging the status quo of electrical distribution. An increasing number of generators creating electricity from renewable resources (renewable generators) were being connected to the networks at the distribution level and the grids were increasingly driven by information technology (IT)—a process known as “becoming smart.” Large centralized power generators such as those involving hydro nuclear energy coal and gas were giving way to a range of dispersed units such as co-generation plants photovoltaic panels (solar panels) and wind turbines. Millions of these small-scale units were already generating electricity all over Europe. Further as smart meter systems were added to the system electricity consumers could use the information and communication technologies to participate in the distribution system. These clients which were unlikely to change in number represented 99 per cent of all final customers. The evolving context was not only changing the business model of power generation but also affecting the grid operations and investments of network companies which included DSOs. Regulation was advancing and it triggered the need for adequate financial planning models to complement existing tools of analysis. In addition to being used in project analysis where for example the net present value of projects or investments was calculated for a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and to assess profitability financial modelling tools were needed to calculate the impact of a project or investment on the rate of tariffs.EANDIS: THE BELGIAN POWER GRID OPERATOREandis was the regional electricity DSO in Flanders the northern Flemish region of Belgium servicing a market that covered 78 per cent of the Flemish municipalities. With a network of 94000 kilometres (km) (61000 km in low voltage and 33000 in medium voltage) Eandis supplied 2.5 million clients engaged 4750 employees and generated €3 billion in operating revenue from a base of €3 billion in total assets.Basic Financial Statement for EandisIn 2014 Eandis serviced a consumption of 30 TWh at a regulated price of €39.17 per megawatt hour (MWh). The company’s return on equity was 7 per cent with equity costs of €140 million for a total equity of €2000 million (€2 billion) (see Exhibit 1). A depreciation cost of €220 million for the regulated asset base (RAB) of €5000 million (€5 billion) indicated that under a simplified linear depreciation model the existing assets were assumed to have an average lifetime of about 23 to 26 years. This was realistic for power grid companies which typically had a mixed composition of heavy infrastructure assets with a lifetime of up to 40 years (e.g. cables and overhead lines) and lighter assets with shorter lifetimes (e.g. IT equipment).Main Assumptions for Cost+ PricingIn the cost+ scenario the regulatory regime was assumed to remain as it was (see Exhibit 2). The annual increase of operating expenses other costs and consumption for the projected years 2015–2024 was assumed under business as usual. In this scenario the change in the RAB was the net effect of the ongoing asset depreciation of €230 million per year corrected for the investments that were planned to replace depreciated assets of €400 million per year. For the new investments a depreciation rate of 2.5 per cent per year was assumed implying an asset lifetime of about 40 years. It was also assumed that positive changes to the financing needs (an increase in the RAB) or negative changes to the financing needs (a decrease in the RAB) were shared between debt (60 per cent) and equity (40 per cent). Moreover equity was equal to the shared capital in 2014 implying the absence of any reserves. As of 2015 the company would have accumulated reserves because a portion of the profit was paid out as dividends while another portion was kept in the company.Financial Planning for Regulatory ChangesIf the regulatory structure changed revenues would vary. The cost+ regime covered all cost positions and the revenues had to provide the profits which equalled the allowed return on equity. This was assumed to be 7 per cent of equity as in 2014. Under this regime the revenues no longer guaranteed a fixed return on equity. Instead the revenues included the costs that the regulator accepted to be recovered from consumers the allowed change in operating expenses and the allowed capital expenditure. The difference between the allowed costs and actual costs determined the net profit and thus the company’s performance. Under the cost+ regime the company had an implicit weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5.5 per cent but in 2014 the regulator had limited the WACC to 5 per cent. The regulator had set the starting value for operating expenses based on the DSO’s expected cost but the allowed operating expense was capped at a 2 per cent increase per year even if the DSO argued that the operating expenses would grow at 2.4 per cent per year and that investing in smart meters would further increase the operating expenses.If the regulatory regime changed to price cap regulation revenues would depend on the price cap set by the regulator and the volume customers consumed (see Exhibit 3). In this scenario the volume risk would be assumed by the company.This possible change to price cap regulation posed the threat that the regulator might not allow grid tariffs to increase more than 2 per cent per year. This threat was taken seriously because the investments had a lifetime of more than a decade while the regulatory period in which the regulated parameters were fixed was typically for four to five years.Investment programEandis was considering a slow but almost complete rollout of smart meters (see Exhibit 4). The costs would be high in the first two years because the company would need to assume costs to prepare the company systems for rollout. Moreover these investments had a depreciation rate of 10 per cent which was set by the regulator based on the expected lifetime of a meter.The ChallengeUsing the financial information and assumptions van den Bossche needed to develop a financial planning model that would help him evaluate the smart meter investment program under the different regulatory regimes and assumptions. Use the accompanying Student Spreadsheet (Ivey product no 7B19N003) to determine whether Eandis should undertake the investment in smart meters under the different regulatory regimes and if so under what conditions the investment might be attractive to Eandis’s equity investors. The financial planning model should include a detailed income statement a cash flow statement and balance sheets for Eandis.Exhibit 1: Company Results 2014 (in € millions except where indicated)Note: € = euros; MWh = megawatt hours.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 2: Business as Usual 2015–2024 (in percentages except where indicated)Note: RAB = regulatory asset base.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: Parameter Settings for Regulatory RegimesNote: WACC = weighted average cost of capital.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 4: Expenditures for the Smart Meter Investment ProgramSource: Created by the case authors.","[{""start"":1085,""end"":1107,""text"":""Walter Van den Bossche"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1627,""end"":1642,""text"":""Van den Bossche"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9904,""end"":9919,""text"":""van den Bossche"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1364,""end"":1370,""text"":""Europe"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2993,""end"":3003,""text"":""EuropeThe "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3208,""end"":3217,""text"":""Europe’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3387,""end"":3396,""text"":""Europe’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3695,""end"":3704,""text"":""Europe’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4478,""end"":4484,""text"":""Europe"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1247,""end"":1251,""text"":""his "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1717,""end"":1721,""text"":""his "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"
"9B21D008Atal Indore City Transport: MANAGING VEHICLE SCHEDULING IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONSaurabh Chandra Sanyam Maheshwari and Amit Kumar Vatsa wrote this exercise solely to provide material for class discussion.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-05-27In March 2020 Sanyam Maheshwari an intern at Atal Indore City Transport Service Limited (AICTSL) met with the technical and operations manager Rahul Shrouti. He wanted Maheshwari to use the management science tools he had learned in his engineering course to determine the bus frequencies and number of buses required to meet passenger demand between various stops. Maheshwari needed to consider reliability cost and safety and how these aspects might be improved. Shrouti suggested that Maheshwari begin by studying the operational planning used by the Indore Bus Rapid Transit System (Indore BRTS).URBAN TRANSIT IN INDIAIndia was one of the fastest growing economies of the world with a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.024 per cent per year. The majority of India’s population lived in rural areas (68.8 per cent) although the share of the urban population was expected to increase substantially rising to 58 per cent of the population (875 million people) by 2050 according to 2011 estimates.With urbanization increasing improving public transport was a priority especially because ownership of private vehicles was also increasing in India leading to city congestion and pollution. In urban areas buses were the most efficient and easiest mode of transport. India was reported to have over 1.75 million registered buses in 2016. Of those the public sector operated 170000 which transported approximately 70 million people per day.In an annual survey of household spending on utility and sustainable products in India both rural and urban buses were reported as the most used form of transport with 62 per cent of urban households and 66 per cent of rural spending on this form of transit. Auto rickshaw was noted as the second most common means of transportation in both urban (47 per cent) and rural households (38 per cent).Public bus transport was not responding quickly to the rising travel demand. India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs provided financial assistance to 11 cities for the construction of 504 kilometres of bus rapid transit (BRT) of which about 245 kilometres were operational and the remaining still under construction.Bus Rapid TransitBRT was the most common mode of public transportation in mid-size cities around the world. The system relied on a segregated infrastructure with dedicated lanes busways and stations efficient fare collection rapid and frequent bus operations and easy boarding and alighting facilities for the passengers. BRT vehicles travelled in exclusive lanes—a corridor “where busses run on a dedicated right-of-way such as a bus lane reserved for busses on an arterial road or a freeway.” The exclusive travel lanes and fewer stations than used in standard networks helped the buses to escape congestion on mixed roads considerably reducing their travel times variability in scheduling and rate of accidents. The bus service blended the efficiency of rail with the versatility of buses making the system fast and safe yet cost effective. BRT was also a flexible system which could be enhanced incrementally.The BRT could be an effective transport service particularly for cities in developing countries with large transit-dependent populations and minimal financial capital. Many urban centres around the world—for example Bogotá Colombia; Guangzhou China; Jakarta Indonesia; and Delhi Pune and Ahmedabad India—had developed BRT networks. The system also helped to address environmental concerns. One-fourth of greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the transport industry. To reduce the associated environmental and health challenges and to decrease energy consumption in travel public transport services needed to be provided as an alternative to private cars providing a service that was safer more accessible convenient and economically attractive. Another advantage to public transit systems was that they allowed economically vulnerable sections of society who could not afford their own vehicles to travel safely and comfortably at affordable rates.To make public transit attractive government agencies needed to plan and manage the infrastructure so the service could cope with increasing demand. However according to studies an ability to accommodate passenger capacity at peak hours was the most significant issue in developing countries. The dilemma could be resolved by increasing fleet size and service frequency at peak hours but the solution required a trade-off between public service and increased expenses for the operator. Sustainability of the service required that both be taken care of. When planning operations for BRT networks many of the options concerned how the public bus service was developed: (1) sufficient capacity to handle expected passenger demand (2) speed of service to minimize travel times and (3) frequency of service to limit waiting time.Meticulous scheduling was needed to maintain the high quality of a BRT service. BRT operations managers usually scheduled the frequency of service for each of the bus routes. To achieve a certain frequency the headway—the time between two consecutive buses leaving the initial station—was calculated at periodic intervals for specified periods of time and operators decided on and maintained this headway on each bus route. The important performance characteristics for a BRT were reliability frequency capacity safety and costs. Reliability was measured as a percentage of bus arrivals within a stipulated delay time and was dependent on traffic conditions on the route. Frequency was the main factor in maintaining reliability and was managed by keeping an appropriate headway. Capacity utilization was the third performance characteristic; optimal capacity utilization could reduce operating costs. The fourth performance characteristic was the total cost of operations which comprised both the investment and operating costs. Operating costs included transportation (the direct costs of operating the buses vehicle maintenance and garages) general and administration costs marketing and advertising taxes and licences and insurance. Last but not least safety was a high priority performance characteristic.Indore BRTS: BACKGROUNDThe Indore BRTS branded as iBUS was started in 2007 under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a city modernization scheme launched by the Government of India. The city of Indore the commercial and educational hub of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was plagued with poor traffic conditions including modest road infrastructure erratic traffic and insufficient public transportation. Increasing commercial and trade-related activities had resulted in a remarkable growth in population and a consequent demand for efficient and reliable public transportation (see Exhibit 1). The BRTS was thus launched to enhance the city’s roads improve traffic conditions encourage the public to use public transportation and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.AICTSL initiated the development of Indore BRTS on a public–private partnership model through the legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle. AICTSL submitted the proposal for approval to India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. In August 2007 the Indore Development Authority issued a construction work order for the selected bidder after funding of ₹984.5 million was approved. A single BRT corridor was constructed on the Agra–Bombay (AB) Road in Indore—a project that experienced several delays. Reasons for the delay included acquiring the land for the corridor’s development completing the parallel underground drinking water trunk line and sewage trunk line and dealing with encroachments and the need to remove illegal constructions on the proposed corridor. After the deadline was extended eight times the corridor was completed in May 2013.Indore BRTS started from Niranjanpur a locality on the northern edge of Indore and ran to Rajiv Gandhi Square in south central Indore. The route ran along the AB Road which connected vital business and residential locations. Hence the route was strategically critical and carried the most city traffic (see Exhibit 2). The corridor was 11.57 kilometres long with 21 bus stops (see Exhibits 3–4). The BRT buses travelled one route in two directions: from Niranjanpur to Rajiv Gandhi and in the opposite direction from Rajiv Gandhi to Niranjanpur (see Exhibit 3). BUS SCHEDULING AT INDORE BRTSMaheshwari met with Shrouti to learn about the operation of Indore BRTS. Maheshwari learned that Indore BRTS had a dedicated team that managed the schedules for buses that ran from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Operations started with dispatching five buses from each end of the route at 6:00 a.m. Initially within the first one to two hours they tried to dispatch enough buses running both directions on the BRT corridor to achieve the desired frequency. At any given time 25–35 buses were in active operation; the remaining buses were used to keep operations running smoothly. Some of the buffer buses were kept at intermediate stops so that if a running bus went out of service on the corridor a buffer bus could replace the out of service bus as soon as possible.The schedulers determined peak and non-peak hours of demand based on data from the previous few days (see Exhibits 5–6). The hourly demand for transit followed a normal distribution with a standard deviation close to 20 per cent of the mean. Ridership on weekdays was greater than it was on weekends.All buses had a global positioning system (GPS) for navigation with radio-frequency identification (RFID). Information from the RFID tags and from live cameras at each bus stop allowed the schedulers to continuously track all buses from the control station. A headway of approximately 3–5 minutes was maintained during peak hours and 7–10 minutes during non-peak hours. Based on the live information the scheduling team could coordinate bus dispatch from their respective depots and guide the drivers in maintaining appropriate headway. The bus drivers were also trained to adjust their speeds to align with the bus ahead to maintain the required headway.Indore BRTS had two groups of bus drivers: one group worked in 12-hour shifts and the other worked 8-hour shift. Drivers on the 12-hour shifts normally began their day at 8:00 a.m. specifically to work peak hours. Drivers who worked 8-hour shifts began at 6:00 a.m. on most days. Drivers worked approximately six days a week getting four days of leave each month.At the end of each day the buses were docked at the Niranjanpur depot where crews washed and sanitized the buses then did a general technical and safety checkup. If an issue arose with a bus while in operation a team of mechanics was available at each end of the BRT corridor to respond to the problem and carry out small repairs. According to the company’s contract with the bus leasing agency each bus could be operated up to 1200 kilometres per week.Maheshwari was satisfied with the information he gathered. He was excited to develop workable solutions for Indore BRTS’s operational problems although the complexity of the problem did worry him. His priority was to develop a solution based on management science using the sample demand data he was given to estimate headway and bus deployment for both directions of the route.EXHIBIT 1: INDORE Bus Rapid Transit System DETAILSNote: mm = millimetres; BHP = brake horsepower; BS = Bharat StageSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: INDORE Bus Rapid Transit System MAPNote: The yellow-coloured stretch of the Bus Rapid Transit corridor indicates slow moving traffic.Source: Open Street Map contributors Open Street Map under Creative Commons licence CC BY-SA 2.0 accessed March 22 2021 https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions? engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=22.6828%2C75. 8574%3B22. 7708%2C75. 9015#map=13/22.7282/75.8848.EXHIBIT 3: Indore Bus Rapid Transit System BUS STOPSNote: km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service Limited; Sq. = SquareSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: Indore Bus Rapid Transit System Bus STOP FeaturesSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: Origin–Destination DEMAND MATRIX For PEAK HOURS (7:30 A.M. to 11:30 A.M.) in number of passengersNote: *distance is measured from the origin (Rajiv Gandhi) to the specified stop; the number of passengers is the total number of passengers travelling between an origin (row) and destination (column) over the measured period; km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service LimitedSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 6: Origin–Destination DEMAND MATRIX For NON-PEAK HOURS (11:30 a.M. to 14:30 p.m.) in number of passengersNote: *distance is measured from the origin (Rajiv Gandhi) to the specified stop; the number of passengers is the total number of passengers travelling between an origin (row) and destination (column) over the measured period; km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service LimitedSource: Company files.","[{""start"":1100,""end"":1117,""text"":""Sanyam Maheshwari"",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1254,""end"":1265,""text"":""Maheshwari "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1574,""end"":1585,""text"":""Maheshwari "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1452,""end"":1463,""text"":""Maheshwari "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12047,""end"":12058,""text"":""Maheshwari "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9588,""end"":9599,""text"":""Maheshwari "",""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1703,""end"":1708,""text"":""INDIA"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1708,""end"":1714,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1860,""end"":1868,""text"":""India’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2238,""end"":2244,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2362,""end"":2368,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2615,""end"":2621,""text"":""India "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3007,""end"":3015,""text"":""India’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8256,""end"":8264,""text"":""India’s "",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7455,""end"":7460,""text"":""India"",""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1301,""end"":1304,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12093,""end"":12096,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12106,""end"":12109,""text"":""He "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12340,""end"":12343,""text"":""he "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12244,""end"":12248,""text"":""His "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1319,""end"":1323,""text"":""his "",""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Musthafa chief executive officer (CEO) of iD Fresh Food (India) Private Limited (iD) was preparing for a virtual meeting with his co-founders. iD was a food company located in Bengaluru India manufacturing ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat food products. The company’s flagship product was its batter for preparing popular Indian breakfast dishesidlis and dosas. The company also manufactured and sold cottage cheese (paneer); curd; parathas and chapatis which were ready-to-heat Indian flatbreads; filter coffee decoction; tender coconut; grated coconut; and batter for making vadas. The company was set up in 2005 by Musthafa and his cousins and had weathered many storms since its inception. Creating a position for itself in the unorganized business of idli-dosa batter had not been easy. iD offered a unique value proposition to its customersthat of freshness which resonated with customers. The company had grown in revenue from a mere ₹0.8 million in 2005 to ₹2.385 billion in fiscal year 2020. The company’s vision was “to grow into a ₹10-billion market leader admired and trusted the world over” in addition to being one of the best and most sought-after companies to work for. Musthafa and his co-founders wished to achieve the ₹10-billion turnover mark by 2023. As Musthafa mulled over issues that had arisen on both the demand and the supply side of the business his thoughts were on how iD could achieve its vision amid a pandemic. The pandemic had brought about production and logistics challenges besides a dip in demand brought about by the fear of the virus itself. How could Musthafa and his team ensure that iD continued to produce amid the disruption of supply chains all over the country? With the logistics sector disrupted due to COVID-19 how could iD ensure that its products maintained the promised value proposition of “freshness”? How could he and his team ensure that wary customers continued to trust iD and not switch to home-made batter or to competitors’ products? iD Fresh FoodThe GenesisiD was started by Musthafa and his four cousins Abdul Nazer Shamsudeen TK Jafar TK and Noushad TA. Hailing from a small village near Wayanad Kerala a state in the south of India the cousins had migrated to Bengaluru another South Indian state where all of the cousins (except Musthafa) engaged in running a small retail grocery store. One of the products sold in the grocery store was locally packaged batter for making idlis and dosas a staple breakfast among South Indians. Idlis and dosas originated in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The batter for idlis and dosas was simple to make. A certain proportion of rice and a kind of black gram called urad was soaked ground and fermented before being used to make idlis and dosas. Indians had been preparing this batter in their homes for centuries using manual stone grinders (and later electronic mixer-grinders). However with more and more women joining the workforce the search was on for convenient alternatives and ready-made batter was one such alternative. Such batter as was sold in grocery stores across India mostly came packed in plastic bags sealed with a rubber band having been prepared by women as part of small home-grown enterprises and supplied locally given the perishable nature of the product. This batter was often perceived as unhygienic with regard to both the quality of water and raw materials that went into it and the manufacturing process itself. Other brands of batter were sold at the grocery stores that came in better packaging and that through the use of preservatives offered slightly longer expiry dates of up to two weeks. These brands were slightly more expensive than the batter in plastic bags. All batter however was priced within a narrow range of ₹20₹30 which included the local grocery store’s margins. Consumers would purchase such batter for regular use based on considerations of price hygiene or total shelf-life.As Nazer complained about the batter sold in their local grocery store Musthafa a computer engineer who had pursued his management degree from a well-known Indian business school noticed that consumers who bought the product often provided negative feedback on it since there was no consistency in the quality of the batter. Musthafa who at the time was employed with Fair Isaac India Software Private Ltd. a data analytics company decided to venture into the business of manufacturing batter with his cousins. The enterprise was initially called Best Food Enterprises. Distinguishing Itself from the CompetitionThe ready-to-cook batter segment belonged to the unorganized market which was localized and extremely fragmented with neighbourhood grocery stores stocking the batter. Even as other brands were engaging in research and development to extend their products’ shelf lives iD decided to adopt and offer to customers the value proposition of freshness with batter that was made with fresh raw materials of a specific quality. The iD founders who themselves had little knowledge of this business arrived at the right mix of rice and urad by speaking to various customers who were experienced at preparing such batter. This was a 5:1 proportion of rice and the gram respectively together with a .03 per cent portion of fenugreek seeds which was to be blended to make a distinctive batter. In keeping with its unique selling proposition of being 100 per cent natural iD’s batter did not contain any chemical preservatives or additives to make the batter soft and fluffy and instead relied on the traditional fermentation process. Further the batter contained low-sodium salt and used water purified by the reverse osmosis method. With no added preservatives the batter had a use-by-date of seven days from the date of manufacture. Similarly the paneer launched later by iD was made using the traditional method of adding lime to milk instead of the commercial method of adding citric acid.While its recipes were simple iD innovated around packaging and distribution. In 2014 iD introduced idli-dosa batter packaging in the form of a sealed pouchwhich when opened took the shape of a small tub with a boat-shaped bottomthat Musthafa termed the “transformer pouch.” While the cost of the packaging was slightly higher it gave customers the convenience of storing the batter in the pack itself which could be reused instead of having to transfer the contents into a bowl after cutting the packet open. Another packaging innovation was for the vada batter which was made available in a pouch with an attached spout through which customers could squeeze a perfectly shaped vada with a hole in the centre out of the package and into a frying pan. iD was thus able to bring science into the art of making vadas which otherwise likely would have remained restricted to those who would have received this knowledge and skill passed down through the family.Early YearsIn 2005 with an investment of ₹50000 the cousins rented a shop in Bengaluru’s Tippasandra locality; they bought a grinder a mixer a sealing machine and a second-hand scooter and started their batter business. The idea was to offer hygienic well-packed preservative-free batter to Indian households by supplying it to retail outlets personally from their 50-square-foot kitchen. The target was to sell 100 packets per day at over 20 stores in the city. Reminiscing about the initial days Musthafa recalledWe would buy the grains clean them soak grind [and] package [them] and then load the packets in the evening. I would personally load these packets on my scooty [a two-wheeler] and go [from] store to store in Bengaluru. However the initial months were those of struggle and sales did not pick up for a good nine months. The packets that were not sold and had not yet expired were supplied to business-to-business (B2B) stores at a reduced price in the initial months which helped iD stay afloat until retail sales picked up. It took the cousins nine months to achieve the target of selling 100 packets daily. The fact that many of the grocery stores in Bengaluru were run by people from Kerala known as Malayalis also helped the business by allowing the cousins to forge immediate social connections.The founders knew nothing of breakfast food let alone food technology. They spoke to older women who were responsible for the family cooking in order to get the batter right. They focused on sourcing the right quality ingredients from the same farms and mills in order to maintain consistency in quality. However such focus on quality did not prepare them for the unexpected challenges that arose. In April 2006 the cousins found themselves in an ugly situation—one that could possibly damage iD’s credibility—when the batter packets supplied to a grocery store that did not possess adequate refrigeration facilities became over-fermented and resulted in the packets bursting. This was an important lesson for the team and accordingly they began to focus only on larger stores that had refrigeration and that did not turn off the electricity at night. The team learned that of the 65000 retail stores in Bengaluru 12000 had refrigeration. These became the target segment for iD and Musthafa and his co-founders decided that they would need to get their product into as many of these stores as possible.By 2007 the company was selling 3500 kilograms (kg) of batter per day. Musthafa decided to quit his job and officially join iD full-time as CEO in 2008. He also sold his land in Wayanad and used the money to set up a 2500-square-foot factory in Hoskote Bengaluru. As the company scaled up its operations it was clear that the existing machinery would not be sufficient. The small grinders the founders had procured from vendors in Coimbatore could grind only 1.5 kg per hour. Nazer thus designed a unique machine (which the cousins had manufactured by their vendors) that helped them scale up. As the company grew to ₹5 million turnover by 2008 Musthafa decided to explore new markets. In 20092010 the company decided to set up operations in Chennaithe so-called “Mecca” of idlis. Of the foray into the Chennai market Musthafa said:We decided to plough all our profits into setting up a plant in Chennai and launched the product in 2010. Only after we launched it did we realize what a tough market it was. For one we couldn’t compete with the local players on price. They were buying rice subsidized by the state government at ₹1 per kg to make the batter. So they were able to supply batter at ₹20 per kg and iD batter at ₹45 per kg was way too expensive. Secondly since the subsidized rice was not really suitable for the batter they would add loads of [baking] soda to it and that would make their idlis softer than ours. Therefore for the Chennai customer not only was our batter much more expensive the quality didn’t meet their expectations. But we didn’t want to compromise on our product quality.Meanwhile business in Bengaluru had begun to slip because the core team was focused on setting things right in Chennai. The cash flow was impacted as a result since iD was losing money in the new market. The founders had put their entire profit into setting up the infrastructure in Chennai. For nearly six months they were not able to pay salaries on time. Although a few of the employees left most stayed. The business was proving to be a costly journey. Finally the only option for preventing further losses was to shut down the Chennai operations sell the assets and use the money to pay salaries. iD decided to exit the Chennai market in early 2012. The foray into Chennai had cost iD’s founders about ₹3.5 milliona huge loss for an entrepreneurial venture in its early phase.The Chennai debacle had taught the founders that even more than a food business iD was a logistics business. Poor quality refrigeration and air-conditioning facilities had also been responsible for the failure in the Chennai market. The founders also learned that it was important to find a target group that valued the company’s positioning.iD decided to look at other geographical locations and grow business elsewhere (see Exhibit 1). The company also decided to pay attention to logistics and technology. iD set up operations in Mumbai and Hyderabad in 2012 and in 2013 respectively and ventured onto foreign shores when it commenced operations in Dubai. The founders also decided that it was time to diversify their product offerings. Nazer who understood people’s palates and their tastes and preferences better than his co-founders created additional products such as flatbreadsparottas and chapatis. In late 2012 they again tapped the Chennai market with their other products especially parottas selling only these in Chennai for more than a year. When the team was convinced that they had created a brand and retail presence in Chennai they relaunched their batter there.In 2014 the company was renamed as iD Fresh Food (India) Private Limited. While Musthafa had the word “identity” in mind for the acronym his cousins were thinking of iD as standing for idli-dosa. A logo and the packaging were designed. As the company expanded its operations it searched for better machines—ones that could help it scale up and become profitable. In 2014 Musthafa visited Germany with the intent to purchase better machinery. While he could not find a machine that could make the batter for the Indian breakfast items by grinding rice and pulses he did find a machine that the Germans used to make mustard paste. With the help of the German machine manufacturer Musthafa adapted this machine into a heavy-duty grinder that worked as an idli-dosa batter making machine. It cost the iD owners around ₹10 million but it also helped them to increase their capacity dramatically. With its capacity of 5000 kg batter per houralmost 100 times the capacity of traditional machinesthe machine helped iD to scale up and leverage costs as well as maintain hygienic practices. The company was able to service its stores across 45 locations including eight in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through its five plantstwo in Bengaluru and one each in Hyderabad Bhiwandi (Mumbai) and Ajman (UAE). Challenges and Early LessonsThe company faced several challenges in its journey. In the initial days even as the founders struggled with finances the company received an order from a reputed five-star hotel chain to supply it with thousands of packets of “diamond cuts” a popular Indian snack. Musthafa approached the hotel’s chef to understand how the diamond cuts would be used. When he was told that the hotel chain intended to use the product as a bar snack to accompany the liquor served in the bar he rejected the offer since it contradicted the cousins’ value system. The initial days of the company was also when the company’s vision was crystallizednot to just make money by any means but to assist cooking in kitchens across India. The goal was to complement households in taking care of the family by providing them with fresh food and not compete with the cook.   The company also did not want to be acting as third-party manufacturers for restaurants and hotels. Musthafa and his co-founders  realized that products such as rose cookies and diamond cuts were not in line with their value proposition. The company believed it should stick to its core strengthmaking products with a short shelf life.However as testified by a veteran of the Indian food industry the fresh-food business was risky because of the products’ short shelf life as well as the problem of logistics. With a three-to-seven-day shelf life for its products iD could not have used the traditional fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution model with its time lag of two to three weeks for products to reach the retail stores post-production. Musthafa and his co-founders made two fundamental decisions. One was to create a zero-inventory business model and the other was to create their own distribution model called the DSD (direct store delivery) which used a DCS (driver cum salesperson). Every day the DCS would load the truck with an approximate quantity of idli and dosa batter visit each store take the order supply the quantity then and there create the invoice and collect the payment. Unsold goods were exchanged daily. With this model the company had 600 salespeople visiting close to 30000 outlets every day. The model had its challenges; for instance it was extremely important to get the volume right as Musthafa explained:It was a magical balance. To give you an example imagine a store which can consume only 50 packs a day. If I supply 60 packs I lose 10 packs as wastage. If I supply 40 then it is an opportunity loss for me and the store. So I had to get the magic number of 50 right. When we started iD we focused on availability and supplied more. This resulted in huge wastage as high as 2425 per cent. We had to get the ideal mean between ensuring availability and minimizing unsold inventory.The founders then made their third fundamental decision. They started investing in technology. Musthafa’s information technology (IT) experience helped them to develop an application (app) to capture data on a real-time basis reducing their wastage by 1.6 per cent. In 2012 using a Nokia phone they started capturing store- item- and day-wise sales and wastage data. They then used data from the previous eight years to predict demand and plan their daily production accordingly to supply the magic number to the right store on the right day. Musthafa explained the use of technology as follows: Our day starts early when we ensure that batter is made seal-packed and loaded into chiller vans by 5:00 a.m. We supply this batter to stores across Bengaluru and other cities we operate in by 2:00 p.m. [at the] latest. We have geo-tagged every store and optimized the routes so that our representative reaches [them] in the shortest time. And to ensure that the salesman actually visits the store we invented geo-fencing. This means he has to reach the store to do a transaction. iD managed to create a large data bank through this process and reduce wastage. Previously 90 of the 100 packets it sent out to the market would come back unsold. When iD started sending out 4000 kg of batter 500 kg would come back. The company could not have grown a profitable business with such wastage. The mobile app helped iD track store-wise and item-wise sales and wastage data on a daily basis. The data helped the company to predict the right demand for a store on any given day. Musthafa proudly said Today with our intelligence-using technology my warehouse manager hands over the precise stock along with a pre-printed invoice to the DCS. This invoice is not based on a pre-order and is accurate 99 per cent of the time. Today in a matured city and [with] a matured product we run at less than 2 per cent wastage. Techies call it analytics we call it common sense. iD runs on IT. We have transformed into a logistics company besides being a fresh food company.As an entrepreneurial venture the company had faced challenges with raising capital in the initial years. Islamic religious principles forbade iD from taking loans. For the first 10 years then the company relied on re-ploughing its profits for financing its expansion plans. In 2014 iD raised ₹350 million from Helion Ventures Partners a venture capital fund to “modernize its [iD’s] factories expand its fleet and for marketing and R&D [research and development]” in addition to receiving mentoring support.The company also undertook aggressive distribution. As was attested by the chairman and managing director of an advisory firm “Wherever there are stores selling bread milk and butter you can find iD Fresh Food. They are not restricted to just the supermarkets. This has put them in pole position.”iD Tastes SuccessThe company grew its product portfolio to include curd and paneer in 2016 as well as other products such as ragi idli and dosa batter introduced in 2017 and its innovative vada batter and filter coffee decoction packs in September 2018 (see Exhibit 2). Simultaneously iD explored newer channels of delivery through partnerships with grocery delivery portals such as BigBasket Grofers DMart and others. Musthafa realized that while such portals were great for customers to order what they needed on demand online sales were still a small fraction of iD’s overall sales. The company which had relied on right product packaging right store placement and word of mouth in its initial days started in 2015 to communicate its success through mainstream media campaigns including print out-of-home and radio advertising. In 2017 iD raised US$25 million from Wipro Limited chairman Azim Premji’s family office PremjiInvest which led to PremjiInvest acquiring a 25 per cent stake in the company at iD’s valuation of US$100 million.In 2019 iD decided to launch an economical variant of the idli-dosa batter Daileez in the relatively price-sensitive smaller towns and rural areas. The primary objective of this flanker sub-brand was to create demand for quality products in markets that were traditionally considered as not being brand-conscious without damaging the existing flagship product. Daileez was launched at a price point of ₹49 for 1.2 kg as opposed to the regular variant priced at ₹70. In 2019 iD also launched its filter coffee decoction across 600 stores in the United States after receiving clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Between September 2018 and March 2019 the company earned ₹60 million through the sale of its coffee decoction pouches in India the UAE and the United States. The company aimed to achieve sales across 5000 US stores in six months and reach monthly revenues of about ₹10 million even as the Indian sales of coffee alone were expected to reach ₹3 billion by mid-2020. In February 2020 iD launched its tender coconut and fresh-grated coconut products. The grated coconut was put back in the coconut shell and sealed while the exterior of the tender coconut was shaved off to bring down its weight to only 600 grams. The company ended fiscal 2020 with a revenue of ₹2.5 billion of which 50 per cent came from the batter; 35 per cent from parottas which had a three-day shelf life; 10 per cent from cottage cheese; and 5 per cent from filter coffee decoction.Going OrganicIn March 2019 with its eye on sustainability iD announced its intent to transition into a completely organic brand. An industry chamber report published in 2018 had estimated the size of the organic products market to reach ₹871 million by 2021 up from ₹533 million in 2016 growing at a rate of 17 per cent. Such an increase was expected to be buoyed by trends such as “an expanding urban population base rising health concerns growing consumer spending on food products and deterioration of food quality.” iD wished to make organic foods mainstream starting with the Bengaluru market.An “organic” label came with challenges. A company could label its products as organic provided no chemicals had been used on the land for the previous three years. Organic farming itself posed further challenges: on the supply side a change in mindset was required for farmers to adopt the required bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers. This was made more complicated by the low yield associated with organic farming as well as a lack of certifying agencies in India. On the marketing side higher perceived prices of organic products leading to lower expected profits prevented the adoption of organic farming. iD partnered with three vendors who were working with over 1000 farmers and offered these farmers a 2530 per cent premium for the organic crops they grew. The company had been working on the requisite technology and supply chains to transform itself into an organic company for the past two years. The ingredients for iD’s products as well as its processesfrom suppliers to storage facilities and manufacturing unitshad all been made compliant with organic certification norms. It also obtained certifications from the Agricultural and Processed Foods Export Development Authority the National Programme for Organic Production the United States Department of Agriculture and Jaivik Bharat under the supervision of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.The organic food business itself posed three challenges: affordability availability and trust. Most organic foods were priced at a high premium of 8090 per cent compared to regular products. The availability of organic foods also posed a challenge as Musthafa explained: “Of the 65000 outlets selling food products in the Bengaluru market [fewer] than 1000 stores would have organic products available. Unless these products are made available the demand for organic won’t grow.” The final challenge was to ensure consumers trusted the claims of organic food and that the company met the need for adequate certification agencies that could provide credible certifications of organic.iD commenced its phase-wise transition of iD products into the organic mode by making its flagship batter Malabar parotta and wheat parotta available in the Bengaluru market. These products were available across 25000 stores with iD planning to increase this number by 10000 based on product demand. iD also planned to convert its other offerings into organic over the next year thereby converting 50 per cent of its consumers’ daily food intake into organic since it believed idlis chapatti and coffee constituted 2030 per cent of consumers’ daily consumption. The company also planned to offer the organic range at 25 per cent less than the price of the processed organic range available in the market at the time. Musthafa stated in an interview that iD would charge ₹80 for an organic parotta (the regular variant cost was ₹70) while there would be no change in the prices of the chapattis.India and the COVID-19 PandemicOn December 31 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) received an alert from China regarding several cases of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan a city in China with a population of 11 million with several of those infected reported as working at the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The market was closed on January 1 2020. On January 11 2020 China reported the first death due to the coronavirus a 61-year old man who had purchased goods from the seafood market.India’s first COVID-19 patient was reported on January 30 2020 who coincidentally was from the same state Kerala as the iD founders. The patient was a 20-year old medical student who had returned from the Wuhan district in China. Meanwhile on February 11 2020 the WHO announced that the disease caused by the new coronavirus would be called COVID-19. The new coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2. Exactly a month later on March 11 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 12 2020 India reported its first fatality due to COVID-19 when a 76-year-old man from Kalburgi Karnataka died.On March 22 2020 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a 14-hour voluntary lockdown—the “Janata curfew” (the people’s curfew). This was followed by a nation-wide lockdown imposed until April 14 2020 with only essential services kept outside the purview of the lockdown. By April 14 2020 more than 10000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in India and the lockdown was further extended to May 3 2020. The lockdown was further extended by two weeks on May 3 2020 and further extended again later until May 31 2020.At a press conference in May 2020 India’s central bank the Reserve Bank of India stated that the gross domestic product growth in fiscal year 20202021 was expected to remain in the negative territory with economic activityand as a result growthhaving slumped due to the lockdown. Most of the slump in economic activity on the demand side was on account of the drop in private consumption while on the supply side there had been contraction in the service sector even as agricultural growth offered a glimmer of hope.The COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to cause severe business disruption on a large scale impacting multiple stakeholders systemically with a long duration and intense velocity as it could spread like a market contagion and have long and severe cascading impacts. It could also lead to shortages in the availability of workers and infrastructure as companies would be impacted simultaneouslyin addition to being affected by changes in the behaviour of customers suppliers competitors and so on.The Ready-to-Cook Food Category amid COVID-19As the pandemic spread in India and as working from home became the norm consumers started seeking convenient food options even as there was a decline in eating out. A study by an Indian consulting company found there was a 60 per cent increase in consumer spending on home cooking during the pandemic. The ready-to-cook market in India which was at ₹21 billion in 2019 was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18 per cent to reach ₹48 billion by 2024 while the organized ready-to-eat category which was at ₹80 billion in 2019 was expected to double in the next five years.  iD’s competitors included companies such as MTR Foods and Maiyas in addition to a host of local players who had introduced a variety of breakfast mixes including idli and dosa as part of their offerings. Some of these companies such as MTR Foods had differentiated themselves by offering a range of breakfast mixes with the value proposition of being “easy-to-cook” and “instant” since they required only hot water to be added and would be ready in three minutes. The pandemic and the resultant opportunities led to the entry of new companies into the ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook categories including Jubilant Foodworks Veeba Foods Adani Wilmar Licious and Cure.fit. Amul one of the well-known Indian brands in the dairy industry entered the ready-to-cook segment with frozen products such as parottas patties and potato wedges even while it expanded its ready-to-eat portfolio. These frozen foods had been expanded across 6070 per cent of the company’s retail network. Companies like Adani Wilmar had entered the ready-to-cook category with competitive ready-to-cook products such as khichdi (porridge). Licious had entered both segments with its meat-based products and sought to tap modern trade storesbesides its own app and e-commerce platforms such as Dunzo Swiggy and Amazon Freshfor retailing its ready-to-eat products.Even traditionally the biggest challenge for the ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat categories was to maintain taste since these categories encompassed processed foods and depended heavily on the use of preservatives. One analyst explained the challenge as follows: “These companies have to match the individual taste preferences of consumers which vary throughout the country and at the same time keep economics in mind and do it profitably.” Another analyst had referred to the risk associated with the frozen foods category where temperature control was a challenge. Scaling up in the category was also difficult since doing so would require a lot of capital being a “fairly complicated category.” Managing Supply Chains iD had drawn on rural youth from across India to work in its manufacturing plants.

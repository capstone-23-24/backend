Little information was available in Western literature about the Hermit Warrior concept. Rooted in the annals of ancient martial arts pedagogy the notion aptly described Chye’s personal motivations and professional mission. An equally appropriate literary analogy—and one more familiar to Western readers—for Chye and Yunquan’s business was the Robin Hood principle which matched the concept outlined by Yunquan. “We make money from people who can afford [it] and we subsidize people who cannot afford to pay” Yunquan explained. For Chye being the titular Hermit Warrior culminated in founding Kapap Academy Pte. Ltd. (Kapap Academy) in 2007. For over a decade Kapap Academy had been hailed as “the top realistic self-defense academy in Singapore” with a clientele of “over 140 companies and 90 schools.”On a damp Tuesday afternoon April 17 2018 Chye and Yunquan were nestled in Kapap Academy’s Robinson Square studio in the heart of Singapore’s central business district. They were deep in discussion contemplating their next moves. For over a decade Kapap Academy had trained thousands of people from all walks of life with its brand of self-defence known as Modern Street Combatives. And yet Chye and Yunquan were only just beginning to achieve their mission on a global scale. Not resting on their laurels Chye and Yunquan were determined to ensure that Kapap Academy’s social mission would proliferate internationally. This posed a number of challenges the most difficult being how to enter new markets. The partners debated the benefits of adopting either a licensing model or a franchise arrangement. Both options had their advantages and drawbacks. Adopting a licensing model would allow Kapap Academy to keep costs low and to reach customers without high set-up or marketing costs. However licensing was a piecemeal approach where expansion would be slow and quality control issues could potentially arise. On the other hand franchising meant that Kapap Academy as the franchisor would have more control over the overseas operations in order to better ensure training quality. However it would also be a much more costly endeavour. The economic support required by franchisees and the investment involved in managing operations were both substantial. As the afternoon passed this dilemma continued to worry the two founders as they wondered what their next step should be.THE HERMIT WARRIOR: MASTER TEO YEW CHYEAs the self-professed Hermit Warrior Chye made it his life’s mission to equip everyday people with the necessary skills to sense keep at bay and protect themselves from danger if ever called upon to do so. Chye’s mission mirrored that of Kapap Academy: to empower ordinary citizens to learn realistic self-defence skills. “Ordinary people” Chye explained “included [those] without martial arts skills or [without] the strength and size advantage.” Chye pointed out that this vulnerability “transcended communities [and therefore] also included the disadvantaged community.” Chye grew up with an abusive father and this had had a strong impact on him as Chye explained: “I grew up surrounded by domestic violence. I grew up constantly living in fear wondering when the next time violence would come. As a result of all this negativity no less from my own father I was very withdrawn. The violence formed the foundation of my deep-seated insecurity.”However it was not until many years later after a terrible tragedy that Chye founded Kapap Academy. “The main stimulus behind [Kapap Academy] was my brother’s death” Chye recalled. His brother had died in December 2007 following a seven-year coma. In 2000 Chye’s brother who had been badly beaten by five men and suffered a fractured skull remained in a coma until he died. “It was then that I decided to do something about people getting victimized” Chye said in a local paper interview. In Chye’s mind everyone deserved to be equipped with skills that would be “sufficient to make it out alive of such grave situations” whether or not they could afford the training for it.Having been a practitioner of martial arts for four decades Chye at age 59 had a muscular physique that was very advanced for his age. Chye’s study of martial arts included an expansive list of different disciplines ranging from Asian practices such as tae kwon do wing chun and ju-jitsu to Western combat styles such as Savate. Chye was a certified instructor for various techniques including Kapap the combat technique of his company’s name. Kapap was the original hand-to-hand combat used by the Israeli Special Forces. However Chye noted that the self-defence techniques taught by Kapap Academy also incorporated elements of Chinese martial arts American and British wrestling and others and were suitable for the everyday person on the street. Aside from being an accomplished martial artist Chye had also had a career in investment promotion at the Economic Development Board of Singapore and at private holding companies such as Wuthelam Holdings Pte. Ltd. He was a qualified psychologist who understood that a large part of self-defence involved environmental awareness taking preventive measures to “avoid and get out of danger” and “try not to get into trouble [in the first place].” Apart from his personal tragedy Chye’s background as a psychologist had also spurred him to establish Kapap Academy as he explained: “[Over] the last 20 to 30 years I’ve been providing free counselling for ladies who’ve been sexually assaulted and raped. It always troubled me because they describe how they got attacked [and] as a martial artist I could imagine them getting out if only they knew what to do.” THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET?Although the social impact of violence was clear a pressing issue that could not be ignored was whether it presented a viable business opportunity for Kapap Academy to pursue. What was the serviceable market for martial arts classes?The growth of the Singapore-based ONE Championship represented a strong case for a burgeoning martial arts market. ONE Championship was a mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion that boasted more than one billion viewers across 75 countries in 2015 just five years after its launch. In July 2017 it raised a total of US$100 million and was scheduled to stage a record 24 live events across Asia in 2018. However in December 2017 the Straits Times reported the difficulty of hosting large sporting events in Singapore given its small market highlighting the limited growth potential for the local sports industry. It further stated that ONE Championship’s growth would come from other parts of Asia rather than from the local population. The logical argument could then be made that given the country’s small domestic population and fan base there would similarly be a limited number of persons interested in any given sport. ONE Championship did not fairly represent the same market segment as the martial arts training market that Kapap Academy ostensibly served though it was related. A better comparative analysis would have been the performance of Singapore’s leading martial arts gyms. MMA gyms had seen a rise in popularity in Singapore since the early 2010s; Impact MMA and Evolve MMA were two market leaders. In an interview with the American news channel CNBC Impact MMA’s owner and founder Koh Kok Kwang said “MMA has really come on the scene here [since 2010].” Since opening its doors in 2010 Impact MMA had seen its membership steadily increase and stabilize at 400 to 500 active members at any given time. With an annual membership fee anywhere between S$1260 and S$2600 its estimated annual revenue amounted to almost S$1000000. Viewed with respect to the overall popularity of martial arts (using ONE Championship as an example) the growth potential in this industry was somewhat limited.THE CONFLUENCE OF MARTIAL ARTS AND REAL ESTATEWhen Kapap Academy opened in 2007 Chye was surprised to find that most of his students were female. His assumption was that “fighting” classes would appeal more to males. However it was clear by the initial response that the segment Kapap Academy served was differentiated from the gyms that provided services and products related to fitness aesthetics or sports. Kapap Academy was in the business of self-defence. It appeared that Yunquan’s opinion about rape being “the worst thing that could happen to a girl” resonated with others. Chye explained Kapap Academy’s value proposition to consumers as follows:There is a clear distinction between martial arts as a sport and martial arts used for self-defence. Modern Street Combatives is a very simplified way of engagement it’s not stylized so it’s very functional. Apart from combining various disciplines [to constitute Modern Street Combatives] we removed elements which were ineffective when the person was under duress. Pertinently it also teaches people to be good in the art of hurting people to get away from danger. What we teach is so different from the sport of martial arts [where] it’s over once the referee says it is. Sportsmen aren’t here to hurt people. It’s a different degree of intensity more basal animalistic and ferocious—it’s about survival. Your life depends on it.Therefore while the sporting and martial arts industry in Singapore did not appear to be a large serviceable market Kapap Academy was in fact operating in a different market segment altogether. It was operating in the niche personal safety industry. It appealed to consumers’ personal safety concerns. Despite its lean setup and considerably lower marketing presence compared to Impact MMA or Evolve MMA Kapap Academy generated a steady revenue of about S$300000 annually from its classes. This was a generous amount of revenue considering that the company maintained affordable rates even for persons who fell outside the scope of its target beneficiaries. For each hour-long session Kapap Academy charged an average of S$250 for corporate classes S$20 for adults and S$15 for students. Each of Kapap Academy’s courses lasted no more than 10 sessions with no expiry date for usage. This was in contrast to MMA gyms which relied heavily on repeat long-term customers paying a monthly subscription.  Kapap Academy’s outreach was mainly focused on institutions and corporations but that segment consisted of only about 30 per cent of its training revenue. Most revenue—about 70 per cent—came from direct consumers. One of Kapap Academy’s structured courses Personal Protection Level 1 (see Exhibit 1 Part A) could be subsidized by SkillsFuture credits. Other courses could be customized for people with specific needs (see Exhibit 1 Part B). These two features helped explain why most revenue was generated from individual customers. Chye noted that many students had registered for classes because they had moved to or were visiting countries with higher safety risks. However the revenue was generated by only 85 per cent of all users of Kapap Academy’s training services. Yunquan estimated that 15 per cent of the people Kapap Academy trained each year were its target beneficiaries. For several months each year instructors would provide free weekly training sessions at various shelters for women who were victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse. Kapap Academy also provided free (or at a heavily discounted fee of S$5 per hour) ongoing training for seniors and occasionally partnered with other social enterprises to help disadvantaged individuals. These indicators of strong consumer demand suggested that the personal safety training segment had a relatively more organic and larger growth potential than MMA gyms. Kapap Academy’s training schools were performing well but it was still difficult to determine if the business was able to sustain its mission. “We operate in a very low value industry and where overheads are high” Chye stated which was why he had always looked for other streams of income to remain independent and sustain growth.Chye invested in various properties to sustain his mission and add diversification to the business. Kapap Academy’s training revenue accounted for only half of the company’s total income. Yunquan estimated that another S$200000 in annual revenue was passive income generated from real estate investments. These assets were owned either by Gracie Asia Pte. Ltd. (with Chye and Yunquan as shareholders) or by Chye and his daughter (see Exhibit 2). Kapap Academy owned interests in both Singaporean (90 per cent of its portfolio) and Australian (10 per cent of its portfolio) properties.Chye and Yunquan expected this passive income to double within the next five years. Although the plan was optimistic they felt that it was attainable with a disciplined approach to growing these investments. The asset value of the real estate portfolio amounted to almost S$30 million. Half of the passive income generated each year was channelled back into reinvesting and acquiring new properties; the other half was reinvested in Kapap Academy to support its growing training division. Chye also invested S$150000 of his own savings each year to support Kapap Academy. By growing the portfolio and generating more passive income Chye was facilitating Kapap Academy’s mission. “We believe having strong passive income will allow us to keep our training fees affordable to as many as possible” explained Yunquan.THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IN SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA AT A GLANCEChye’s years of experience as an investment officer had clearly influenced his strategy to diversify his revenue streams and add passive income as a source of support for Kapap Academy’s mission. Unlike the MMA industry in Singapore the property market was generally on the rise given the island state’s land scarcity and high population density. According to a Business Times article Singapore’s property market was the most promising market among the Association of Southern Asian Nations or ASEAN member states which included the Philippines Thailand and Indonesia among the 10 member countries. The Morgan Stanley research report projected a bullish 8-per-cent rise for 2018 and again in 2019. It further expected new home sales growth to accelerate from 40 per cent in 2017 to nearly 50 per cent in 2018 citing reasons such as buyer demand outweighing a tight supply of unsold inventory. A substantial factor for increasing buyer demand could be attributed to the buoyant collective sale market Singapore had experienced in late 2017 and early 2018. Albeit less optimistic a Bloomberg survey similarly projected a sizeable increase in residential property prices by about 5.5 per cent in 2018. Historically Singapore’s residential property prices were always rising steeply. The country’s property price index (PPI) which measured price changes in residential housing was consistently above 100 per cent (except after the global financial crisis of 2007–2008) with an average of approximately 130 per cent each year for the previous decade (see Exhibit 3).Another rising property market was Australia. Investors and developers such as Far East Organization a leading Singaporean property developer were eager to enter the Australian market with expectations of increases in the coming years. In 2017 alone residential property prices increased in almost all major cities in Australia (see Exhibit 4) although real estate analysts had mixed expectations for 2018 and beyond. THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY AND GLOBAL MARKETSBeing a social enterprise had its perks. Government-supported agencies such as the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE) provided forms financing. Some local banking corporations such as the DBS Bank offered a Social Enterprise Package with favourable banking terms for a “business with a social purpose that has—or is striving towards—a commercially sustainable business model and delivers social impact to the chosen social cause.”Although Chye recognized the value of these benefits he was not keen on taking advantage of all of them as he claimed:A lot of people start something but the sustainability is not there so many of the organizations depend on government funding or charity from people and we do not believe in that. . . . I’m sceptical of charity because it’s based on goodwill . . . we create our own money . . . the idea is that in the future we don’t have to ask for money from the government.He went on to explain his motivations:We [at Kapap Academy] don’t want to become dependentonce the funds run out we might get into trouble. What we’re trying to do is create a vehicle to sustain it beyond my life. I never talk in terms of 10 years but in terms of 20–30 years when I’ll probably be dead; but before I die I need to know that the pieces are in place and even without me [the mission] will continue.Theoretically all social enterprises had to be financially stable. To achieve sustainability an enterprise’s costs were expected to fall as the number of its beneficiaries increased. This would be a key challenge for Kapap Academy as it pursued plans for international expansion. “When we first started we probably didn’t think beyond Singapore but now we’re thinking of communities beyond our borders like China and India” Chye admitted. Therefore Chye and Yunquan had to devise a strategy to go global while balancing cost speed and quality. As they deliberated on the various expansion pathways available they focused specifically on two options: the licensing model and the franchise model. Licensing Model OptionThe first option was for Kapap Academy to grant licences to teach self-defence under the Modern Street Combatives brand which Kapap Academy had registered as a trademark and use its structured syllabus and methodology in the training. The syllabus consisted of instructional videos and mandated workbooks created by Chye and Yunquan in Kapap Academy’s Singapore headquarters. Licensees could range from other martial arts schools to personal instructors. To be a licensed trainer either individually or under the auspices of a martial arts school the individual would have to undergo a week-long intensive training period to become a certified Modern Street Combatives trainer. Would-be instructors also had to negotiate a royalty fee to use Kapap Academy’s intellectual property. Kapap Academy planned to sell each licence for S$5000 to S$10000 with a nominal monthly contribution of under S$500 (which was part of the royalty fee that licensees were required to pay Kapap Academy) to continue using the license. Yunquan noted however that although they would have preferred to standardize the duration of licensing contracts across all licensees localized practices demanded that there should be variances.Kapap Academy considered adopting the “hub and spoke” concept for selling licences to would-be Modern Street Combatives instructors as Chye explained:The idea is to have a hub in every city with one or two “country managers” as partners and master licensees who would support sub-licensee instructors. The sub-licensees would be the spokes who would then in turn teach their local community Modern Street Combatives. Our licensees both master and sub-level are more akin to social activists and evangelists who are spreading [Kapap Academy’s] social mission.These master licensees would oversee the sub-licensees in governance and operational matters such as upholding quality of training ensuring compliance with the laws of the country they operated in and effecting timely collection of monthly licensing fees. Master licensees would be given defined geographical boundaries to operate in as Yunquan explained: “For example the master licensee for large countries like China would be defined by the city level. Within the city they may have say 20 to 40 spoke-level sub-licensees under their supervision and governance. For smaller countries the master licensee may be at a country level instead.”Structurally Kapap Academy would sign a contract with its hub-level master licensee partners and any disputes would be resolved under the Singapore judicial forum. The engagement with sub-licensees however would be directly with the hub-level master licensee where the agreement would be governed and settled under local laws. As a matter of consistency Chye had prepared a standard template for the basic terms but he was also aware of the need for flexibility to accommodate local practices. “The important thing here is that the substantive terms regarding the use of our intellectual property are consistent across all master licensees and sub-licensees” he said. As a go-to-market strategy Chye further advised on-boarding licensees to adopt the same tactics he used when he first acquired customersattracting corporations to control costs as he explained: When you just start out it’s not always necessary to have a large studio or any studio at all for that matter. Aim for the corporates. Offer to go to them and they will definitely be more likely to engage your services. More often than not they also have better [amenities] than what you as an instructor will be able to provide.However a key challenge with adopting the licensing model was lack of control over the quality of the Modern Street Combatives training being provided by licensees. Modern Street Combatives instructors could operate virtually autonomously after being certified and having paid the royalty. Although Kapap Academy as the licensor would retain control over the use of its intellectual property it could have no control over the licensee’s business. The issue of control was exacerbated by Kapap Academy’s lean set-up of only five core members which it continued to abide by (in principle) even as it expanded overseas. With only one or two managers overseeing each country supervising the quality of instruction would be an operational challenge. Therefore licensing was an affordable option for trainers to provide Modern Street Combatives to their local communities but it lacked quality control for Kapap Academy. Additionally Chye and Yunquan had hoped that licensees would be able to sub-licence the intellectual property through the “train the trainer” program if instructors were able to certify more licensees. The program would create a positive network effect and increase reach although potential quality issues were unavoidable. However Chye noted that one way to ensure that the Modern Street Combatives training was being taught correctly was to ask students to rate their instructors and training sessions. Franchise Arrangement OptionSetting up franchises would mean that Kapap Academy retained a considerable degree of control and could effectively have independent branches of the company overseas. Unlike the licensing model where independent instructors or other martial arts schools would teach Modern Street Combatives using the company’s supplementary videos and workbooks relatively autonomously a franchisee would have to operate the business with specific directions. It would also have to comply with the stipulated guidelines of the level and type of marketing the franchisee should carry out in its own local area. Chye and Yunquan would set up global Kapap Academy franchises as opposed to licensing the Modern Street Combatives methodology. However this would require the franchisee to have a physical studio (in most cases) which was a significant investment unless a studio was already available. Apart from the economic burden on the franchisee the franchising model also seemed to be a more cost-intensive market expansion option for Kapap Academy compared to the licensing model. The franchisee would presumably negotiate for more economic support in return for its own considerable investment. Although the franchisee was legally independent it was economically dependent on the integrated business system of the franchisor. However a key motivation of becoming a franchisee was to take advantages of the larger corporation’s brand and access to resources capabilities and market positioning. Unlike the licensing model where Kapap Academy would only need to certify the would-be instructor during the intensive one-week training period franchising would involve ongoing assistance by the franchisor. Setting up franchising arrangements also required both the franchisor and the franchisee to comply with jurisdictional requirements (where applicable) which represented an additional cost for all parties involved.However if the franchisor was able to support its network of franchises it could reap great benefits. For Kapap Academy setting up global franchises would offer the benefit of having a more permanent and reliable physical presence in new markets. This would intrinsically create greater brand awareness. Working with corporations and institutions could save Kapap Academy the expense of renting studios because these clients generally had their own facilities that allowed on-site training. However it would better serve Kapap Academy’s social mission if the franchisees could welcome customers to their own studios for training. Without a dedicated studio Kapap Academy would have to rely on partner martial arts gyms with licensed instructors to teach Modern Street Combatives to a non-corporate clientele. The Modern Street Combative program would thus be just be one of many self-defence techniques offered by the partner gyms which would lack active promotion of Kapap Academy’s brand equity. Overall however franchising would be a quicker way to penetrate and establish a presence in a new market. THE NEXT GENERATION AND BEYOND“I’ve spoken to my daughter about this and she knows that when I die the plan is for all the property investments held in my name be given to Kapap Academy’s cause” Chye stated. “She understands and is already carving her own path at 21” he added “but I’m glad that she too feels a strong compassion to help those in need.” Chye’s daughter Nicole was also actively involved in Kapap Academy’s mission as she worked on enhancing the product offering by introducing new technical elements to the fold. “It’s still [in its] early days but we are adding some features leveraging technology to our Modern Street Combatives training program to help keep people safe” Yunquan said. Chye would only consider his mission a success if he was able to “to reach out to at least two generations.” While he would not see it happen in his lifetime he had certainly laid the foundation for success. As the day wound down Chye and Yunquan’s conversation came to a close. The skies had cleared and the sun was setting. Yunquan packed up as she prepared to head out for an evening training session. She was in a hurry because the rush-hour crowd would soon flood the local subway train stations. “So we’ll pick up again tomorrow okay?” Chye asked as Yunquan was leaving. “Yes of course. See you in the morning” Yunquan responded before closing the door behind her. And suddenly the room was still. Chye stood squarely in front of the door taking a moment to organize his thoughts from the day’s discussion as the sound of Yunquan’s footsteps tapered off down the corridor. “It’s in good hands” he thought to himself.EXHIBIT 1: Modern Street Combatives MaterialsPart A: Level 1 and 2 WorkbooksPart B: Containment of Aggressive Situations Course for Front-line StaffSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-03-31It was a cold day in December of 2016. Sitting in the lounge of Toronto’s Pearson International Airport Youbin Leng the chairperson chief executive officer and president of Feihe International Inc. (Feihe) was reading a joint statement from the governments of Canada and the People’s Republic of China which communicated an open attitude toward direct investment. Leng was excited about the Canadian government’s desire to attract foreign investment. He and the executive team of Feihe were considering entering the Canadian market very soon. Leng was confident that internationalization would make Feihe one of the most widely known infant formula brands; however as he considered the cultural and institutional differences between China and Canada and the uncertainty involved in the Canadian–Chinese business relationship he wondered what would be the best way to enter the Canadian market. Should Feihe use a greenfield investment an acquisition or a joint venture? Feihe InternationalIn Chinese feihe meant “a flying crane” a symbol of auspice loyalty and longevity. Feihe was founded in 1962 in Qiqihar a city in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China which was famous for its habitat for red-crowned cranes. This company started as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) that manufactured milk powder. In the 1990s Youbin Leng joined the company and found that the company was growing slowly under the planned economy. In August 1996 it was incorporated as Feihe Dairy during a period of China’s nationwide SOE asset restructuring. Leng acquired a majority of equity in the company in 1998 and transformed Feihe into a privately owned company in 2001.Fifteen years later Feihe was headquartered in Beijing China. It became the largest domestic Chinese infant formula company and the third-largest dairy company operating in China (including both domestic and foreign brands). In 2016 Feihe had 16.9 per cent of retail sales in the domestic infant formula market and 7.7 per cent of retail sales in the overall infant formula market (including both domestic and foreign brands). The company earned revenue of ¥3724.4 million with a profit of ¥406.2 million (see Exhibit 1). It mainly manufactured infant formula but also produced adult milk powders liquid milk and soybean powders. It provided milk powder formulated from fresh milk for infants and children under six years old. In addition to producing cow milk infant formula Feihe was exploring the market for goat milk infant formula. Feihe’s principal products were high-end and regular infant formulas. Its high-end products included the award-winning Astrobaby premium infant formula. In 2017 Astrobaby won for the third consecutive year the International High Quality Trophy from Monde Selection in Belgium which served as an endorsement of Feihe’s product safety and premium quality. More importantly Feihe’s high-end products were very profitable. For 2014 2015 and 2016 Feihe’s overall gross profit margin was 47.8 per cent 55.3 per cent and 54.6 per cent respectively; and the gross profit margin for the high-end products was 60.2 per cent 68.5 per cent and 68.9 per cent respectively.The success of Feihe in China depended on its clear positioning in the market. Feihe had hired Junzhi Consulting to clarify its strategies as “producing the milk powder that is more suitable for Chinese babies.” More specifically it aimed to be “standing at the top of the industry to avoid the price war winning the consumers’ faith with the rise of brand strength and building competitiveness by focusing on resource acquisitions and corporate strengths development.”Aligned with the strategic positioning Feihe successfully managed its supply chain. The infant formula industry had a long value chain and the price and quality of the raw materials were two primary factors that affected the operation of dairy enterprises. Feihe’s supply chain gave it control over the entire production process including choosing the raw materials implementing its unique processing technology enforcing its strict inspection system and accessing diversified suppliers.As for the choosing of raw materials Feihe differentiated itself from most domestic brands by using fresh milk as the main ingredient in all its infant formula products. Depending on individual brands’ strategies both milk powder and fresh milk could be used as raw materials for producing infant formulas; however many Chinese customers believed that using fresh milk maintained the most nutrients in infant formula. Complementary to the use of fresh milk Feihe exclusively used the wet blending–spray drying process to manufacture its infant formula products. Compared with a dry blending process the resulting products were more water-soluble the nutrients were more uniformly distributed throughout each batch and the powder particle size and colour were more consistent. In 2016 Feihe’s fresh milk procurement costs amounted to ¥569.9 million 33.7 per cent of the sales revenue. To ensure freshness and timely delivery Feihe had spent 10 years building a vertical supply chain that included the cultivation of cattle feed large-scale dairy farming production and processing logistics warehousing channel control and after-sales service. The major farms in Feihe’s supply chain were along the 47th parallel north which the dairy industry regarded as the “world gold milk source” because of its climate conditions and natural environment.Feihe ensured the quality of its raw materials through an overall quality control system comprising 25 comprehensive procedures and more than 300 checkpoints from the inspection of feed in the whole production process to the delivery of finished products. The company designed highly automated production lines and procured advanced equipment and machinery to decrease risks of both contamination and human error while increasing production.The company’s main suppliers were dairy farms close to Feihe’s production facilities which was aligned with the Chinese government policies to support the local smaller-scale milk suppliers. Its exclusive suppliers included internationally accredited farms in Gannan and Kedong which housed approximately 45900 Australian Holstein cows. The largest supplier was YST Dairy Farm Ltd. (YST) in Heilongjiang Province. In 2016 fresh milk purchased from YST accounted for 80.1 per cent of the company’s total procurement cost at a cost of ¥456.4 million. Although Feihe had 25 other raw material suppliers its business and operations were highly dependent on fresh milk from YST. Besides fresh milk Feihe also procured a variety of other ingredients for its infant formula production such as whey protein powder and non-fat milk powder which were generally procured from domestic trading companies and international suppliers including powder manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand. Feihe also had its own milk collection stations production facilities and an extensive distribution network throughout China. Thus the majority of Feihe’s production facilities were within a 30-minute drive of the milk suppliers which enabled the company to process milk quickly to ensure freshness and better quality.Feihe’s diversification of suppliers ensured the stability of raw materials sourcing. However due to increasing costs of land water and labour resources the overall costs of feed and fodder were rising in China. Thus upstream processors such as Feihe suffered from the high costs and price volatility of raw materials.The Chinese Dairy SectorIn 2008 a milk scandal had seriously damaged the Chinese infant formula sector. During this food safety incident dairy products including infant formula and other food products from China were adulterated with melamine which killed six infants and sickened 300000 others. Although Feihe was not one of the brands involved this scandal damaged the whole domestic dairy industry by eroding consumers’ trust in Chinese domestic dairy brands.After 2008 the Chinese dairy sector had stepped into a reforming stage when more and more domestic and foreign brands were emerging. The domestic dairy companies continuously optimized their management systems improved food quality and participated in global competition. Although the safety issues of domestic dairy products were eliminated consumers’ safety concerns and trust were still the biggest challenges to the recovery of the industry. Due to the loss of consumers’ trust in domestic dairy products China became a net importer of dairy products and the trade deficit in this sector increased each year. China’s percentage of imported dairy products increased from 5.2 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2010 and 27.0 per cent in 2014. In 2016 China’s main dairy imports were milk powder products mostly from New Zealand but also from Australia the United States France Germany and Canada (see Exhibit 2). From 2008 to 2017 China’s imports of dairy products and infant formula had increased 3.62 times and 3.80 times respectively. The Chinese dairy sector failed to quickly recover from the scandal not only because of safety concerns but also for three other reasons. First the production costs of domestic milk powder were higher than the production costs for imported milk powder due to China’s limitations in terms of agricultural land clean water and cattle resources. At the same time the price of the dutiable imported dairy products was significantly lower than the price of domestic dairy products. Second Chinese consumers’ purchasing habits were being shaped by an e-commerce boom in China resulting in more online sales and cross-border purchases which enabled foreign infant formula to pour into the domestic market. Finally to satisfy consumers and obtain high profits some manufacturers chose to register their brands overseas but produce domestically or to label their products “imported with original packaging” or “100% foreign milk source” which contributed to a disorderly and competitive marketing environment.However domestic producers also had opportunities. First with the relaxing of the one-child policy the demand for infant formula was increasing. According to AskCI Consulting Co. Ltd. the retail sales value of the infant formula market increased from ¥63.7 billion in 2012 to ¥84.4 billion in 2016 and its sales volume increased from 375000 tonnes in 2012 to 465800 tonnes in 2016. Observers estimated that the market growth would continue as a result of the government supports for the dairy sector increasing industry concentration and the implementation of the universal two-child policy.Second the demand for goat milk infant formula was increasing in China. One reason was that some Chinese infants suffered from lactose intolerance or other cow protein allergies so that the parents preferred to source goat milk powder for their babies. These parents were willing to pay a premium price for goat milk infant formula. Many domestic infant formula milk producers including Feihe were trying to develop their goat milk production lines after 2013 and some industry experts estimated that goat milk infant formula would be the next high-end star product in the Chinese infant formula industry.Third in 2016 China announced a new regulation that required all infant formula manufacturers to register the ingredients in their brands before selling in China. The regulation aimed to increase the market concentration of the infant formula market and would likely drive some small brands out of the market while the major domestic dairy companies would benefit from this new policy. Fourth supported by the Chinese government the dairy sector had entered into a period of rapid revolution after 2008 with massive mergers and acquisitions and internationalization. The leading domestic dairy enterprises began to invest in farms and plants and to collaborate with strategic partners overseas. Through this internationalizing approach domestic firms introduced high-quality foreign milk products into China to meet domestic consumer demand and improve their brands’ reputations and competitiveness. Internationalization strategies became an important part of the Chinese dairy sector’s market expansion.The Internationalization of Chinese Infant Formula CompaniesIn 2016 China had a total of 103 infant formula companies which produced approximately 725700 tonnes of powdered infant formula. Major domestic infant formula brands grew to 45.5 per cent of the Chinese infant formula market in 2016 from 41 per cent in 2012 and were estimated to reach 48 per cent by 2021. The industry was dominated by 10 big players that together held a concentration ratio of almost 80 per cent. Among them eight companies—Yili Inc.; Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd.; Bright Dairy & Food Co. Ltd.; Want China Holding Limited; Shijiazhuang Junlebao Dairy Co. Ltd.; Nestlé China; Feihe Dairy; and Beijing Sanyuan Foods Co. Ltd.—accounted for 51 per cent of the infant formula market’s total production and 54 per cent of its sales (see Exhibit 3).All of these major Chinese dairy companies had started to expand overseas. Yili Industrial Group Co. Ltd. (Yili) from Inner Mongolia which was one of the forerunners among the Chinese dairy enterprises began internationalization in 2007 and accelerated the process after 2013 by seeking high-quality low-cost destinations. Within two years Yili had successfully established a global supply chain covering Europe Asia America and Oceania. Yili’s production plant in Waimate New Zealand was the company’s flagship international innovation project. The plant was the world’s largest integrated dairy facility to date; it included research and development (R&D) production deep processing packaging and manufacturing facilities and represented an investment of US$600 million—a new record for economic co-operation between China and New Zealand. China’s Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd. (Mengniu) another leading dairy enterprise in China moved relatively slow. In June 2013 it acquired Yashili International Holdings Ltd. for HK$12.4 billion obtaining two infant formula brands Yashili and Scient. Yashili a wholly owned subsidiary expanded overseas as part of Mengniu’s internationalization strategy. Construction of Yashili’s New Zealand plant—a NZ$220 million investment—began in July 2012. The plant was expected to have an annual output of approximately 47174 tonnes of infant formula. In April 2017 Mengniu signed an agreement with several large farms in New Zealand to supply its Deluxe milk line; it aimed to develop a joint strategy that would include its supply chain and dairy processing. Mengniu also entered into strategic co-operative arrangements with several leading international dairy enterprises including Arla Foods based in Denmark and Danone based in France.The Biostime International Holdings Ltd. (Biostime) another major infant formula producer in China had a long history of collaborating with French strategic partners in seeking milk resources. In 2013 Biostime and Isigny Sainte-Mère a leading French dairy brand signed an agreement to expand their infant formula production capacity. On June 12 2015 the company’s French infant formula plant became operational through a €65 million investment; Biostime’s investment accounted for €20 million. The 40000-square-metre plant was designed to process approximately 45359 tonnes of infant formula by 2018. Another Chinese leading infant formula producer Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co. Ltd. (Beingmate) invested ¥170 million to set up a subsidiary in Ireland in 2013 for R&D production and sales of infant formula and related products. In 2015 Fonterra Brands (Australia) Pty. Ltd. the dairy giant from New Zealand acquired Beingmate which enabled Beingmate to acquire 51 per cent equity in Darnum another processor under that group’s umbrella. The company thus formed an unincorporated joint venture with Fonterra and established an infant formula production plant in Victoria Australia.Acquisition was a widely used strategy in the Chinese dairy sector. Bright a leading brand in southeast China with a 100-year history divided its international acquisition and strategic alliance strategy into three steps. First it acquired 51 per cent of the New Zealand New Wright Dairy in August 2010 for NZ$82 million. Second it started a strategic co-operation with the Australian Pactum Dairy Group in April 2014. Third it acquired full control of Tnuva the largest integrated food enterprise in Israel in June 2015. Another high-end brand Ausnutria Dairy Corporation Ltd. (Ausnutria) used a similar strategy by acquiring 51 per cent equity in the Dutch company Hyproca Dairy Group (Hyproca) with equity exchange and cash in 2011. This acquisition provided stable milk resources and production plants in Europe and thus developed Ausnutria’s experience in farm management resource control R&D technology and quality system design which improved the company’s operation. In July 2013 Ausnutria acquired 100 per cent equity in Hyproca and aimed to develop its production capacity further in the high-end market.But internationalization could be risky. For example in 2012 another infant formula producer Synutra International Inc. (Synutra) signed an agreement with Sodiaal International SA the largest French dairy company and invested €90 million to build a new modern infant formula plant with an annual capacity of approximately 90718 tonnes. However in 2016 it was reported that Synutra was unable to pay its bills because of its undesirable sale of French products in China. Canada’s Dairy IndustryCanada’s dairy sector was an important and growing part in the Canadian economy (see Exhibit 4). According to the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) the dairy industry was Canada’s third-largest agricultural sector (behind grains oilseeds and red meats) and contributed significantly to the Canadian economy. It employed approximately 221000 people in 2015 contributed about CA$19.9 billion each year to Canada’s gross domestic product and remitted CA$3.8 billion each year in federal provincial and regional taxes. In 2016 it generated CA$6.17 billion in net receipts and employed approximately 22900 workers in dairy processing alone. Canada had developed a system to ensure the quality of dairy products and its strict quality standards resulted in the great reputation of Canadian dairy products. A wide range of institutions including the federal government departments regulatory bodies and advocacy groups supported the implementation of these standards. For example the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of dairy products both exported from and imported to Canada through the establishment of dairy product standards and grades dairy plant inspections packaging and labelling requirements regulations animal health programs and product safety monitoring. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada worked with farmers and producers to enact dairy policy conduct research assist market and rural development and help with the livestock improvement. The Dairy Farmers of Canada also developed the Canadian Quality Milk Program which provided guidance for dairy producers to improve food safety management in dairy farms.Although the Canadian dairy industry occupied an important position in Canada its output was relatively low compared with that of other major countries. In 2016 Canada’s milk production was approximately 8 million tonnes which was significantly lower than production in New Zealand (approximately 21 million tonnes) the European Union (approximately 221 million tonnes) or the United States (approximately 96 million tonnes). Because of its relatively small population Canada was able to meet its domestic requirements with its milk and dairy production but the country was not very active in the international dairy trade (see Exhibit 5). From 2007 to 2016 Canada’s exports and imports of dairy products both increased but imports were consistently higher than exports leading to a deficit each year. In 2016 the country imported 233560 tonnes of dairy products valued at CA$969.4 million representing an 8 per cent growth rate; it exported 98758 tonnes valued at CA$235.3 million representing an 11 per cent growth rate. The Supply Management SystemOne important reason for Canada’s smaller scale of dairy production and deficit was the unique Canadian Supply Management System monitored by Dairy Farmers of Canada. This system aimed to stabilize producers’ revenues and consumer prices and to avoid costly product surpluses through “three pillars” namely setting production quotas managing minimum prices and controlling imports. Every year the Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee looked at yearly demand to determine the production and supply quotas of milk for each province and to set a minimum price for milk. This system led to three notable outcomes: it kept foreign products out through its high tariffs beyond the quota; Canadian producers and consumers avoided unpredictable price fluctuations; and the sustainability of this sector was ensured so that producers did not need a government subsidy as producers did in other countries. However this system was also criticized for trade protectionism. Since the dairy industry was not covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) it became a target of the NAFTA renegotiation between the United States and Canada. The Canadian government also attempted to expand similar protections to other milk ingredients by implementing a new price class Class 7 to lower the price paid by domestic producers which angered not only the US producers but also producers from Australia the European Union Mexico and New Zealand who were driven out from the Canadian dairy market by this policy. As an opinion piece from the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy noted such protection had “resulted in low Foreign Direct Investment to the Canadian dairy sector. Of the [US]$21 billion invested globally into the dairy sector Canada attracted a minuscule amount—less than one per cent.” Dairy Industry in OntarioThe majority (approximately 82 per cent) of Canada’s dairy farms were in Ontario and Quebec approximately 12 per cent were in Western Canada and just over 5 per cent were in the Atlantic provinces. Ontario’s share of the total Canadian milk market was approximately 32.0 per cent with 2.77 million litres of milk produced in 2016. Ontario had 3705 dairy farms and 72 dairy processing plants that supplied and processed not only raw milk but also all the other milk products. Ontario was also a major goat milk production base with 52 per cent of Canada’s goats and 36 per cent of Canada’s goat farms. According to Ontario Farmer magazine “There were 240 goat milk producers licensed by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs in 2015. The Ministry licenced 22 new producers in 2014 and 35 in 2015. There were already 24 new producers ‘pending’ in 2016 ‘in all ranges of farm size.’”Feihe’s INTERNAtionaLIZATIONThe Chinese customers’ awareness of product quality and safety had been increasing since the milk scandal in 2008 that had involved Sanlu the producer responsible for the tainted infant formula. Many Chinese customers were willing to buy foreign products to ensure food safety for their babies. As a result the Chinese market was currently dominated by international brands but domestic brands including Feihe were attempting to catch up by increasing their investments in raw material sourcing and technology.Feihe aimed to compete with international brands on both quality and price. It seized a chance to grow in the domestic market after the falling of Sanlu in 2008. In 2016 it beat foreign brands in 10 provinces of China. Also the company noticed that since 2012 the high-end infant formula segment in China had increased from a sales value of ¥19.9 billion (31.2 per cent of the overall market) and was expected to reach ¥66.4 billion by 2021. Although Feihe had begun its internationalization strategy as early as 2005 when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange it did not have any foreign manufacturing plants. Further it delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2013 to free more capital for domestic mergers. However Feihe needed more suppliers of low-cost high-quality raw materials to satisfy the growing demands in China. To support its internationalization strategy the company positioned its brand as “more suitable for Chinese babies” and spent ¥13.8 million in R&D in collaboration with international research institutions including the Feihe Nutrition Laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre at Harvard Medical School in 2016. Feihe then filed its initial public offering application with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May 2017 which indicated that the company was trying to obtain more capital and secure its leading market position in China. However since this company had not yet been listed it still lacked sufficient capital for a large investment. In November 2015 Feihe announced a plan to invest US$100 million in building an intelligent plant with an annual output of approximately 45359 tonnes of milk powder in California. However it soon found that due to the local laws and policy restrictions in the United States it might not be the perfect match for Feihe.Kingston’s AmbitionThe year 2016 was a milestone in the history of China–Canada relations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the G20 leaders’ summit in Hangzhou China; and only a couple of weeks later Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Canada for four days—the first Chinese Premier to do so in 13 years. The two leaders issued a joint statement to encourage more co-operation between their countries.It was exactly at this time—“a time to nurture cooperation” between these two countries—that Feihe targeted the Canadian market. Canada’s three largest dairy processors—Saputo Inc. Agropur Cooperative and Parmalat Canada—processed approximately 80 per cent of Canada’s raw milk and did not have a clear strategy on infant formula or tapping international markets. To attract more capital and diversity the CDC started to search for an infant formula processor in Europe or Asia. Kingston a city on the eastern end of Lake Ontario was chosen as a potential location. In June 2016 Feihe invited a small delegation from the Kingston Economic Development Corporation (KEDCO) to China to help celebrate its anniversary and this trip provided an opportunity for the city to forge a new relationship with this potential investor.Kingston was recognized by the London (UK) Financial Times 2017–2018 publication on “American Cities of the Future;” was the winner of “Small Cities in North America for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy;” and was rated sixth in the category of “Small City for Human Capital and Lifestyle.” While economic growth in 2016 was more robust outside the Kingston metropolitan area Kingston had a population of 167965 and a well-educated labour force of approximately 91000. It had access to an effective transportation system composed of highways railways and air transportation integrated with US networks which enabled passengers and cargo to conveniently arrive at major North American cities. Kingston also had four well-organized business parks with complete facilities infrastructure and was close to major highways and downtown.Another advantage of Kingston was that it had the support of KEDCO. Established in 1998 KEDCO was a not-for-profit agency providing sales and marketing for the City of Kingston. It facilitated investment and job creation. In its 2015–2020 strategic plan KEDCO aimed to reposition the city as an agri-business centre by focusing on food processing technology and sustainable agriculture. To achieve this goal KEDCO assisted enterprises in applying for funding and determining which programs and services would best meet their needs. The funding programs were supported by both provincial and federal governments and included two five-year federal programs to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture agri-food and agriculturally based product sectors in domestic and international markets which were in operation until 2019 with total funding of CA$391.3 million; a CA$5 million funding program offered by the Ontario provincial government for food and beverage processing; a development fund for economic development in eastern Ontario; and an innovation fund to help the agriculture sector adapt to the global and domestic market environment. Next StepsMost of Feihe’s competitors had invested in New Zealand and Australia; Canada was not a traditionally popular investment destination for the Chinese dairy giants. In addition Canada had not had an infant formula processor in the country in the past 20 years. Kingston was fuelled by the investment and ready for its ambitious plan. Any major dairy country would envy a large inward foreign direct investment in the competitive global market. At the same time Feihe was already on track for internationalization and was highly interested in investing in Canada. The question was: How could Leng formulate a best entry strategic plan for Feihe?Exhibit 1: Feihe Financial Data For the year ended December 31 (in ¥ thousands)Note: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1.00 = ¥6.94 on December 30 2016Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: 2016 China’s Milk Powder Imports by Country of OriginSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China The Chinese Dairy Yearbook 2017 [in Chinese] (Beijing China: China Agriculture Press 2017) 436–437.Exhibit 3: Top 15 Dairy Companies in ChinaNote: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1.00 = ¥6.94 on December 30 2016.Source: Kungang Song “The Dairy Industry Review in 2016 and Focus in 2017” [in Chinese] China Dairy Industry Newsletter September 2017 accessed October 4 2017 www.cdia.org.cn/down.php?name=uploads/pdf/1510292756.pdf.Exhibit 4: Canada Milk Production 2007–2016Source: “Milk Volumes and Components” Canadian Dairy Information Centre Government of Canada February 23 2018 accessed Oct 10 2018 www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/index_e.php?s1=dff-fcil&s2=msp-lpl&s3=hmp-phl&page=histprod.Exhibit 5: 2016 Canadian Exports of Dairy Products by Region Source: “D033Y Canadian Imports / Exports of Dairy Products (Year)” Canadian Dairy Information Centre Government of Canada accessed October 10 2018 aimis-simia-cdic-ccil.agr.gc.ca/rp/index-eng.cfm?action=rR&pdctc=&r=166.endnotes,2.0,"[{""start"":1135,""end"":1146,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1395,""end"":1399,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1574,""end"":1578,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2357,""end"":2361,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2567,""end"":2571,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30222,""end"":30226,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1482,""end"":1484,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1699,""end"":1701,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1856,""end"":1858,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1327,""end"":1332,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2741,""end"":2746,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]}]"

(Sandu Pharmaceuticals) was a publicly listed company operating in the pharmaceuticals and health care sectors. Incorporated in 1985 the company traced its history back over more than a century. The third generation was at the helm of the firm in September 2016. Sandu Pharmaceuticals manufactured Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurveda was a traditional Indian system of medicine native to the Indian subcontinent and a popular form of alternative medicine. The demand for Ayurvedic medicinal products had seen an upswing not only in India but across many countries in Africa Europe and North and South America. Shashank Sandu the company’s director was in a “happy space” in his business. One day while chatting with his friends about opportunities for setting up manufacturing bases in countries outside India the conversation turned to the subject of grooming the next generation to run the business. This got Shashank thinking about how previous successive generations in the family had handled the challenge of absorbing family members into the business and in particular about whether he was doing enough to prepare the next generation to take over a business that was bound to grow more rapidly in the future given the growing concern worldwide about the cost of allopathic health care and demand for less invasive and more holistic treatments.The Business of AyurvedaIn 1899 Shashank’s grandfather and his four brothers all of whom were practitioners of Ayurveda (Ayurvedacharyas) decided to set up a business to formulate and sell Ayurvedic medicines. Their entrepreneurial venture was a direct response to the nationalistic Swadeshi movement and specifically to the call by one of the first leaders of the Indian independence movement Balgangadhar Tilak to  revive domestic products and production processes. Ayurveda was one of the world’s oldest holistic healing systems. Therapies were typically based on complex herbal compounds minerals and metal substances. This system of medicine had had a continual presence in the Indian subcontinent for more than 3000 years. However by the late 19th century Ayurveda and other traditional systems of healing were under threat not only from the British regime that ruled India and was skeptical about these systems but also from modern (allopathic) medicine even though allopathic formulations were far more expensive. Historically practitioners of Ayurveda made their own formulations. Sandu Brothers Private Limited (Sandu Brothers) was one of the early attempts to create an industrial-scale manufacturing and distribution operation focused on Ayurvedic medicines. As demand grew the company moved its factory to larger premises soon after its founding. The success of Sandu Brothers’ products was driven by a commitment to quality and a firm adherence to the basic tenets of Ayurveda.Since its inception in 1899 the business had expanded greatly; it had a pan-India presence and significant exports to 22 countries. The company had close to 950 employees out of which 30 were in management. About 100 employees were in manufacturing 400 were in marketing and sales 40 were in quality control and research 50 were in warehousing and logistics and the rest were categorized as workers. Though it stayed true to tradition in its use of ingredients the business incorporated modern pharmaceutical practices in formulation manufacturing testing and quality control. By 1998–99 the company had manufacturing units in New Mumbai and Goa as well as a full-fledged research unit. The company was not only growing its export market but also actively considering setting up units including wellness spas and centres outside India (see Exhibit 1 for the organization structure at the senior level.)During the past century allopathy had been at the top of the hierarchy of preference for medical systems in India. Since the nation’s independence in 1947 the Indian government had endeavoured to provide affordable health care using this “modern” system. However many Indians saw Ayurveda as an effective choice for managing certain chronic diseases and recognized its potential to promote overall well-being wellness and health with minimal side effects. Some popular formulations were believed to improve immunity aid in indigestion relieve musculoskeletal conditions like joint pain and promote healthy hair growth. However due to a lack of active government support and involvement this and other indigenous systems of medicines had languished for decades. It was only in 1995 that the government set up a department devoted to Indian systems of medicine under the Central Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A separate ministry dedicated to research development and education in various branches of non-allopathic systems was set up in 2014. In many countries around the world practices derived from Ayurveda were seen as being part of the family of complementary or alternative medicine and more recently were being integrated into general wellness applications and in some cases medical treatment.The Family in Family BusinessThe Sandu family belonged to the close-knit Karade Brahmin community which had been socially and politically influential in the Konkan and Goa region of Western India under various ruling dynasties before the area was colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Karade Brahmins typically served as village record keepers and accountants financiers tax farmers merchants in intra-Asian trade priests and diplomats. As a result of the Portuguese invasions the community had scattered to nearby regions where its members took up administrative vocations under the ruling dynasties and established themselves as landowners and traders. The community continued to be close-knit and it emphasized learning through both traditional and modern systems of knowledge. This focus inspired the five Sandu brothers to venture out of the traditional occupation of landownership and join the growing tribe of indigenous entrepreneurs who were trying to break the stranglehold of the British in the health care sector and many other sectors of the Indian economy.A majority of the founders’ sons had decided to join the family business. In most cases the sons either were not given a choice in the matter or did not even consider pursuing another career. For example Shashank’s father was admitted to the first batch of a top-notch management institution but the family urged him to forgo that opportunity and join the family business instead (he did however take a part-time management course at the same institution). Based on their aptitude the second generation members were put in charge of various aspects of the business. Some of them were trained in particular trades to make the job–person fit more appropriate. For example Shashank’s father had a business degree one of his two uncles was an Ayurvedic doctor and another was a printing technologist. Some of his cousins however had chosen to work in areas of the business that caught their fancy. Some had only a sinecure management position (e.g. in charge of transportation). The daughters of the family got married and moved away and were not expected to make any ownership claims. Daughters-in-law were not expected to join the operations but to preserve family peace and harmony instead.The joint family structure had been the norm in India for centuries and continued to be quite prevalent even in modern times particularly among business families. The Sandu family though close-knit had maintained separate establishments for the past few decades; Shashank’s grandmother had had the foresight to encourage the separation of the household to minimize conflicts. However the entire family spread across many households jointly participated in a number of prescribed religious rituals and festivals every year. The family aimed to abide by traditional Indian middle-class values:Health is wealth.A paisa saved is a rupee gained.Avoid all types of wastage—food electricity raw materials.Be frugal and live simply—take a bus if possible not the car.Good education and learning is a must and will last throughout your life.Respect elders even though you may think they are wrong.Growing up in a family imbued with a strong set of values still did not eradicate the problem of some family members blurring the lines between their entitlement as owners and their responsibilities as managers. The second generation had 15 male cousins (see Exhibit 2). Among them one family member decided to buy a luxury vehicle with money drawn from the business. Another decided to fuel his gambling habit from the business cash box. Some had unrealistic aspirations that they expected the business to support. One wanted to produce a movie which he expected the business to back rationalizing that the company’s product placement in the movie would help in marketing. Some members decided to start their own businesses using family resources without thinking through the consequences. For example one member started a car repair showroom within the factory premises without requesting the necessary permissions. Everyone wanted a personal car and a driver—paid for by the business. In some sense many family members viewed the business as an entity that existed to bankroll their whims and fancies.The Business in Family BusinessThe second generation continued to view the employees of the company as an extension of the family. Most of the workers were from the same region as the family. Many were second generation employees themselves. The approach to managing employees was distinctly paternalistic. The family’s belief in paternalism was severely shaken when there was strike in the factory in the late 1980s which led to the factory’s closure for nine months. The industrial unrest was fomented by external leaders who specialized in galvanizing employees to raise questions against real or perceived injustices. One of Shashank’s uncles was stabbed (he survived) there was sloganeering against the family owner/managers their effigies were burned and an atmosphere of terror and fear reigned. For the family it was a psychologically devastating time.Shashank who had just finished high school at that time was drafted into interacting with lawyers and courts as he was not targeted by the striking employees. The industrial dispute was eventually resolved through the use of various legal strategies but it had led to the closure of one unit and the shifting of the manufacturing base to regions with a more positive industrial climate. More importantly more nuanced thinking about the management–employee relationship emerged as a consequence of these events. From a strong emotional bond based on paternalism the relationship shifted to one in which commercial ties and economic value constituted important strands. The company ensured that the new plants did not have unions.Shashank recollected that from a young age it had been drilled into him and all of his siblings that in business a personal promise or verbal commitment was golden. Before the company went public in 1993 capital formation was primarily financed through personal loans. These loans were typically between two parties where one’s word of honour was paramount. However meeting the commitment to pay back the principal with hefty interest rates on the due date at periodic intervals was also a big challenge. Shashank said “I have seen my father and uncle crushed with stress about sticking to their commitment [to pay back on time].” The third generation insisted on changing the pattern of capital accumulation by accessing more formal channels. They had to fight their predecessors’ inherent fear of both loss of control and of disclosure requirements. There was a great deal of opposition from various family members to a public listing. Some said “How much do you want for your business expansion?—here let me write a cheque.” Ultimately there was only a mandatory dilution of 25 per cent of the shares to the public. The father and uncles took a pledge from the third generation telling them “You are only going to the public to generate money. Don’t ever ‘play the market’ because if you start playing the market your focus will shift from manufacturing.” See Exhibit 3 for the business value system that guided the family. By 2015 the family business consisted of the publicly listed pharmaceutical company as well as privately held companies and trusts that controlled various types of assets and discharged different types of responsibilities. As the business grew the family felt the need to introduce modern practices of manufacturing quality control and process orientation. In time the company’s manufacturing plants adopted aseptic techniques to improve quality with the entire process of converting raw material to products untouched by human hands. Rules for Joining THE Family BusinessThe family had never done any formal succession planning. But as Shashank and his siblings and cousins were growing up Shashank’s father and uncles who were involved in managing the business put in place some broad rules for working for the family business based on what they had learned from past experience. The next generation was told that joining the business should not be considered an entitlement. They were expected to earn appropriate educational degrees and work in an outside firm in a responsible position before they would be considered for a suitable role in the company. Shashank recalled:We were told categorically and repeatedly that we should get trained in roles that the business requires. The prime requirements in any business are marketing manufacturing and finance/legal. We were expected to gauge our aptitude before deciding on the role in which we wanted to specialize. For example during my summer holidays in high school I worked as an assistant clerk with one of our chartered accountants. I didn’t like it as a vocation but understood what an accountant does. Similarly my brother worked under a well-respected chartered company secretary. My cousin went to work in a pharmaceutical company as a research scientist and today handles the manufacturing and R&D [research and development].Shashank subsequently completed a master’s degree in business management from a reputed institute and worked for about three years in marketing at two well-known companies in the private sector. Recalling his stint at a fast-moving consumer goods multinational company he said:I was selling the product in Dharavi the largest slum in Asia. It taught me to respect the customer. The demand for the company’s products was naturally limited in such a poverty-stricken area. I had to think out of the box to get the shopkeeper to place an order for even a very small amount of products. Rejections were part of life there. I really learned the art of sales there. In my second stint I learned how to manage workers to ensure that production always kept pace with client demand.After about three years Shashank was invited to apply for a position in the family business. He was interviewed by an external expert and his salary was negotiated based on his last drawn salary.While discussing how the third generation was prepared for operational responsibilities Shashank said:We come with three types of baggage: (a) our personality (b) our character and (c) the perceived value placed by all those who surround us. The last type starts even with the nickname given to you. I and my siblings had domestic help who also did some light office work during the day. So their perceptions of us and what gets communicated among employees is also part of the baggage. Family members had their own set ideas of what we should do when we grew up. I think education and outside work experience helps a person overcome this baggage to a large extent.Talking about the norms of the business that were informally communicated to all (see Exhibit 4) Shashank recollected some conflicts within the family:Everyone wanted to join the business as their birthright. Everyone wanted the same salary. But can a business take this load? By the time the third generation was joining the business the distinction between ownership and management was becoming clear. Family members who didn’t fit the requirements were either eased out or were retiring anyway.There were family members who were not interested in contributing to the business. They were happy with the dividends they earned. Over the years such members were bought out (see Exhibit 5 for the changing pattern of family owners and managers). Shashank explained “Business is like a capitalist system. You need to constantly feed it with various types of expertise to be supplied by the family. There were some who didn’t want to be bothered. But those who were contributing to the requirements of the business started increasing their holdings.”SUCCESSION IN THE TRUE SENSEWhen a next generation member joined the business they had to learn the business and make their presence felt. Shashank recollected that in his initial days as a management trainee he spent two months in each department. While in the logistics department he realized that the carrying and forwarding agent was getting richly remunerated because of a flawed commission formula. He had this changed. Similarly he brought down the cost of bottling by negotiating a better deal with the bottle suppliers. He was able to do these things because people were willing to listen to him due to his position as a family member as well as his external job experience. Shashank recollected:People in the company are very smart. They figured out that I could make good decisions but they also separately got these decisions ratified by the big bosses (my father and uncles) as they didn’t know where the power centre was and they themselves had a different equation with the older power centres. At some point in time from both sides a line has to be drawn when the older generation says clearly “Don’t involve me” and the employees understand that the power centre has shifted.Recalling how he had had to fight his way in Shashank described an incident where a very senior professional in the company misrepresented facts to his uncle after ferreting out information from him through a junior colleague. Shashank had actually initially fed partial information to the concerned professional who then encouraged the older generation to essentially negate the proposal before it was even formally presented. In the formal meeting Shashank supplied the full information and had his proposal accepted. This was how he ensured that this particular person stopped pitting family members against each other. Shashank joined as management trainee in 1992 was promoted as manager (planning and development) in 1993 and became general manager (marketing) in 1994 and director in 1996.  With two brothers and two cousins (one actually belonged to the fourth generation but was referred to as a cousin) handling various roles in the business conflicts did occur from time to time. Typically conflicts between any two family members were openly discussed with the other two acting as arbitrators. Conflict was considered a healthy way to understand different perspectives of the business. Shashank explained that this way of resolving conflicts reflected the way things were handled in his family saying “Business is an extension of how the family is.”Role for family members who retireDBoth Shashank’s father and uncles retired upon reaching the age of 60 an occasion that was marked by an appropriate farewell function. After retirement each took some time off for religious tourism. After a few months they started coming back to the office and spending a few hours in the afternoon in offices assigned to them. None of them was part of the organizational structure. However their presence was welcomed as the operational managers used them as a sounding board. Many older employees dropped by to chat with them even about personal issues. The elders also looked after the religious traditions of the family planning family events such as get-togethers and weddings as well as various community events not connected with the business.current CHALLENGES OF the BUSINESS By the second decade of the 21st century 65 per cent of India’s population was less than 35 years of age. The challenge before the company was to present its products in such a way that it appealed to the young generation. The global phenomenon of aspiring to a healthy lifestyle was catching up in India as well. Shashank felt that opportunities to explore and expand in the Indian market were significant. To cater to modern sensibilities and lifestyle requirements the company had come out with individual pack sizes of its products which allowed daily doses to be carried easily in a purse or lunch box. The company was also thinking about creating certificate courses to allow practitioners to recommend correct therapies and appropriate doses.The Next GenerationThe fourth generation of the family comprised of the children of the four cousins involved in managing the business fell into various age groups ranging from toddler to college student. Shashank said:With the new generation it is a different story. They know the rules of joining but they may not even be interested in our business. Ayurveda is not exciting enough for a generation with many more avenues of success in the digital age. This generation doesn’t see joining the family business as a sacred duty or at the very least a responsibility. We have a family friend and advisor who interacts a lot with the children to understand their mindset and interests. We have to find ways and means to get the youngsters interested in what we do. For example we asked my college-going niece to host the program when the prime minister of Mauritius was visiting our factory in Goa to inaugurate a herbarium facility. We encouraged her and her college friends to come to Goa and go on a field trip to our state-of-the-art plant there which is a bonus as Goa is also a lovely vacation spot. When groups like this see how well managed the plant is our children start looking at their own property in a different light!It was clear that Shashank had been mulling over the future of the family business and in particular the role of the next generation as leaders (see Exhibit 6). While much of the preparatory work for the next generation was rather informal such as plant visits it seemed inevitable that Shashank’s attention would turn toward a more formal and planned approach for a smooth and seamless succession from the third to fourth generations. He wondered how other family businesses faced this inevitable event in their history and whether something could be tailored to fit the context of Sandu Pharmaceuticals.EXHIBIT 1: ORGANIzATIONal CHART (AT the BOARD Level AND ONE LEVEL Down)Note: HR = human resources; R&D = research and development; QC = quality control.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 2: GENOGRAMSource: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 3: BUSINESS VALUE SYSTEM PROFESSED BY THE FAMILYThe institution comes first then the family and then the individual (member).In the company’s progress lies your progress.Your surname does not assure you of anything.We are here to propagate the science of Ayurveda.Promise what you can deliver.Profit is not and should not be the only criteria for success.By manufacturing effective but affordable medicines we are serving society.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 4: FAMILY CODE OF CONDUCTInduction of family member occurs only if the business requires it not by right.Family members must be professionally qualified.Family members must have worked outside the business for at least two years.Compensation will be decided by an outside panel.Business needs are different from family requirements and one should not be confused with the the other.Management is separate from ownership.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 5: CHANGING OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ACROSS GENERATIONS IN the family’s PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSESNote: The management position held by the lone member of the fourth generation in the table is considered to be part of the third generation by the family and hence is indicated as such; *only the adult children of Shashank his brother and his cousins had shares allotted at the time of writing the case.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 6: Income statement across two financial yearsNote: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; ₹1 = US$0.0149 on September 1 2016; MAT = minimum alternate tax.Source: Company files.,3.0,"[{""start"":1554,""end"":1568,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1855,""end"":1863,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2325,""end"":2333,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7278,""end"":7286,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7744,""end"":7752,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8526,""end"":8534,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10884,""end"":10892,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11115,""end"":11123,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11843,""end"":11851,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12348,""end"":12356,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13907,""end"":13915,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13961,""end"":13969,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14429,""end"":14437,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15160,""end"":15168,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15957,""end"":15965,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16216,""end"":16224,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16890,""end"":16898,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18523,""end"":18531,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17978,""end"":17986,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19076,""end"":19084,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19258,""end"":19266,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19481,""end"":19489,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19654,""end"":19662,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20432,""end"":20440,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21526,""end"":21534,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22166,""end"":22174,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23209,""end"":23217,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1336,""end"":1341,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1476,""end"":1481,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1748,""end"":1753,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2658,""end"":2663,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2976,""end"":2981,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3167,""end"":3172,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3167,""end"":3172,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3860,""end"":3865,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4613,""end"":4618,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4845,""end"":4850,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8311,""end"":8316,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]}]"

They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!This sounded like a threat which it was presumably intended to be. However only weeks before the picture had looked rosier for Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and its chief executive officer (CEO) Ian Read. In the fiscal year 2017 Pfizer had successfully maintained its position as the leading global pharmaceutical corporation in terms of its revenue from pharmaceutical products of US$52.8 billion (see Exhibit 1). Nevertheless in the last few years Pfizer had had many setbacks other than those generated by the president’s threat. For example a comprehensively planned merger with Allergan Plc (Allergan) had to be stopped and competitors were closing in on Pfizer’s leading position (see Exhibit 2). In addition drug patents were about to expire and the company’s entrance into new emerging markets was creating many problems. However the entire pharmaceutical industry not just Pfizer was being challenged by various issues. While corporations were recording decreasing global average returns on investment (10.1 per cent in 2010 and 3.2 per cent in 2018) they were also experiencing increased research and development (R&D) costs ($1.2 billion in 2010 and $2.0 billion in 2017). Furthermore companies from other industries—such as the electronic device producer Philips—were entering the market and some emerging-market companies were becoming unexpectedly strong. Given these challenges Read needed answers to some key questions: Do these changes mark a turning point for the whole industry? Does Pfizer need to act and if so how? The pharmaceutical INDUSTRYThe pharmaceutical industry was complex with some important trends. Globally in 2018 pharmaceuticals represented more than 16 per cent of health expenditures. In 2017 global sales were recorded at $1.2 trillion (see Exhibits 3 and 4) and the demand for pharmaceuticals was rising. Historically the United States has been the country with the highest spending on pharmaceuticals with an average per-person spend of $1162 in 2017. Viewed with respect to global pharmaceutical sales in 2018 the United States was the biggest market with a share of 48 per cent. Europe (including Russia and Turkey) accounted for 22 per cent; Japan accounted for 8 per cent; Latin America accounted for 5 per cent; and the regions of Africa Asia (excluding Japan) and Australia accounted for 17 per cent (see Exhibit 5). Health-care spending was known to be increasing for a variety of reasons and this increase suggested that demand for pharmaceuticals was likely also to be rising.First an ageing population led to increased demand (see Exhibit 6). Second the supply of biologics had increased substantially amounting to 25 per cent of the total pharmaceutical market in 2017 (see Exhibit 7). Biologics were highly effective drugs for certain classes of disease such as cancers rheumatism infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis diabetes and neurological disorders. They represented a very expensive form of treatment usually lasting around a year and with costs averaging $25000 per patient. Biologic drugs were produced using animal cells or microorganisms and the molecule sizes were many times those of conventionally synthesized drugs. A study by the consultancy company McKinsey concluded that the development and production costs for biologics as well as the complexity of a biologic drug equated with those of building a business jet. Due to their efficacy biologics were in high demand. Third globally increasing awareness of the importance of early health checks the use of prophylactic drugs (e.g. vaccinations) and better information availability had all further increased demand.Finally favourable growth rates in pharmaceutical product purchases had been predicted several years ago for developing markets (see Exhibit 8). However the road to success in developing countries had in fact been bumpy for Western pharmaceutical companies. Local producers (mainly generics producers) often retained a higher market share and more power in these developing markets than Western pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore relatively weak patent law slowing economic growth intense local competition and government efforts to reduce health-care costs (or at least to prevent their growth) had reduced company expectations of rapid success. CompetitionIn general the pharmaceuticals market could be divided into two main categories: prescription drugs which could only be prescribed by doctors; and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs which could be purchased without prescription because they were considered comparatively safe in terms of self-diagnosis and self-medication. The latter included products such as painkillers nasal sprays food supplements and vitamins. Under some jurisdictions these could also be sold in supermarkets and drugstores. In the United States OTCs made up 16 per cent of the total market in 2013 similar to the percentage in other major markets (see Exhibit 9).Within the prescription drug market a further distinction was usually made between “innovative” drugs (also called “branded” drugs) and “generics.” Innovative drugs underwent extensive R&D processes and clinical trials using humans and animals. In the United States once they were approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) innovative drugs were patent protected giving the developer firm the exclusive right to market the product for several years (20 years in the United States). In rare cases extensions were requested; for instance if a molecule had been substantially modified. Patents protected the particular chemical structure only. Other innovative pharmaceutical companies that had developed a different drug treating the same disease could thus apply for a distinct patent and this resulted in “between-patent competition.” As soon as a firm lost patent protection for a drug (i.e. for the active ingredient) other firms could market a product based on the same active ingredient as long as FDA approval and bioequivalence standards were met. Such drugs were called generics and they resulted in “within-patent competition.” Generics were marketed under different names from those of the original branded products. Generic copies of biologics were called biosimilars; due to the specifics of biologic manufacture it was not possible to copy them precisely (as could be done relatively easily in the case of conventional or synthetic drugs). Copying biologics could only result in similar but not identical drugs.The roles of doctors and patientsBecause self-medication with prescription drugs was illegal patients needed to go to doctors or hospitals to obtain them. In most health-care systems doctors were relatively free to decide on treatment and medication. They normally had the choice between different substances and would suggest a particular drug depending on availability. To save on costs many countries encouraged the prescription of generics. In 2017 these made up only 10 per cent of total prescription sales (in $) but generics had been outgrowing branded drugs for many years (see Exhibit 10). In general doctors tended to choose products that they feel provided the best treatment for a given patient. The market power of expensive innovative drugs was sustained by the fact that in most countries there were no regulations concerning cost cutting or a preference for generics. Moreover depending on country and disease patients were frequently not required to pay for drugs because the state or private insurance schemes covered this expense. As doctors had a large influence on which brand was purchased pharmaceutical firms’ marketing activities tended to be targeted at doctors. Moreover depending on the law the extent to which direct customer marketing of prescription drugs was permitted varied. Sales representatives had always been the main communication channel between pharmaceutical firms and doctors and firms invested in sales to such a considerable extent that doctors from time to time complained about over-marketing. Many firms however were not prepared to reduce the size of their sales forces unless the competition did the same: they were trapped in a “marketing-and-sales arms race.” As a result pharmaceutical firms had in recent years spent significantly more on prescription sales activities (including expenditure on sales marketing and administrative costs) than on R&D. For instance in 2017 Pfizer spent $7.6 billion on R&D but an enormous $45.4 billion on prescription sales (see Exhibit 11).In 2010 the US Congress demanded greater transparency in marketing activities in order to reduce the number of corruption allegations. In response to the demands of Congress Pfizer cut down on payments to US health-care professionals—by 11 per cent in 2012—and reduced spending on company-sponsored dinners by more than half. Since 2014 firms in the United States had been required to enter payments to doctors into a public database. In addition to these tighter regulations doctors had become less welcoming towards sales representatives; they said they did not feel well informed by them and so the doctors instead tended to favour online information. A recent study revealed that 65 per cent of physicians were interested in getting clinical information online. Doctors also generally lacked the time to meet with sales representatives because they were under pressure to see increasing numbers of patients.In Europe such marketing activities were also limited by governments. For example in Switzerland each pharmaceutical company could only target a given doctor once a year. In Slovakia the government introduced a law that stated that doctors were required to pay a 19 per cent tax on both financial and in-kind benefits (e.g. meals events hotels) received from pharmaceutical companies.Yet the need for marketing activities became more important in particular as the trend of self-medication was increasing. This was also related to the growing amount of information available online—a source frequently used by patients in addition to or even in preference to their doctors’ advice. This was a delicate issue for pharmaceutical firms because in Europe direct marketing could not be targeted at patients. Pharmaceutical companies could circumvent such regulations by using new digital tools such as patient and physician portals and by promoting social-media posts. Extensive information about specific drugs was offered online and pharmaceutical companies also provided information during discussions on various online health platforms. Nevertheless when compared to some other industries by 2018 pharmaceutical companies had not yet taken full advantage of social and other online media. The development of drugs and the patenting processIn 2018 most pharmaceutical companies were highly vertically integrated compared to other industries and so were carrying out R&D drug production and marketing and sales activities themselves. In terms of its R&D the innovative sector of the pharmaceutical industry was like the oil industry a “self-liquidating” industry: both had to continually develop new products and both experienced long product lead times. In 2015 the pharmaceutical industry dedicated 15 per cent of its net sales to R&D (see Exhibit 12). In the United States alone more than $48 billion was spent in 2015 on pharmaceutical R&D (see Exhibit 13) a long and resource-intensive process involving several phases. In 2016 the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) estimated that it took on average 12 years for a product to reach the market (see Exhibit 15).In general the process started with the identification of a target (e.g. a protein) in the human body upon which the drug would be required to act and the development of an initial formulation (preparation). These preparations were then repeatedly tested and modified (up to 10000 times) in order to achieve the desired effect and minimize side effects. If preliminary results were promising a patent was registered in order to obviate potential competition. These new chemical entities (NCEs) were subject to pre-clinical testing often on animals. The objective was to investigate the drug’s effectiveness and any possible side effects. This process of laboratory testing would take about three and a half years. The pre-clinical test results would subsequently be evaluated by the relevant health authority and if appropriate permission would be given for further (clinical) tests. In the United States the regulatory agency was the FDA comparable to the European Drug Agency (EDA). On average only five out of every 10000 NCEs would make it to the clinical testing stage from which point on they would be designated “investigational new drugs.” In 2016 the average cost of finding and developing a new drug amounted to approximately $1.9 billion. If Phases I to III of clinical testing (duration about 6 years) showed positive results in terms of effectiveness and side effects a new drug would be approved for marketing; this last stage could take up to two and a half further years. However reaching this stage did not necessarily mean that the drug would stay on the market in its current form. It continued to be subject to further tests the results of which might require the drug to be modified or in some cases taken off the market completely. The new-product success rate was one or two per 10000. The lengthy launch period for new drugs was the subject of an ongoing debate and in 2017 the US president announced the government’s intention to speed up the FDA approval process.In the past patent law had made it possible for many pharmaceutical firms to earn high revenues from just a few popular products. The development of these so-called “blockbuster” drugs (drugs with more than $1 billion in yearly revenues) had long been considered essential for the success of global pharmaceutical firms (see Exhibits 16 and 17). Firms would naturally try to make maximum use of patent protection and new globally standardized products tended to be patented and brought to market simultaneously worldwide. In exceptional situations governments would use a patent without the consent of the patent holder in order to produce a drug and make it available to patients (a process known as “compulsory licensing”).An innovative branded drug in a new therapeutic area was known as a “breakthrough” or “first-in-class” drug. New drugs in existing therapeutic areas were known as “follow-ons” or “me-too” drugs. Pfizer’s Viagra for example was a breakthrough drug when it was launched in 1998 and the company profited substantially from it until 2003 when Bayer introduced a similar product Levitra (an example of between-patent competition).When patent protection ended other firms were free to start selling generic copies of the same chemical. Usually patent expiry led to a dramatic drop in revenue referred to as the “patent cliff.” Within-patent competition was initiated when generics producers started selling the generic copy at much lower prices. Patent expiry could have devastating effects. Between 2003 and 2011 Pfizer’s blockbuster Lipitor yielded annual revenues of $10–12 billion but when Pfizer lost Lipitor’s patent protection in 2010 sales dropped to $4 billion in 2012 and reached a low of $1.7 billion in 2016. In 2017 alone Pfizer lost patents for several key products including Lyrica and Viagra. Global-pharmaceuticals forecasts anticipated that in 2023 across all companies $67 billion of sales would be at risk due to patent expiries. In 2017 the figure was $32 billion. The biggest generics producer was Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva) and other big players were Mylan NV (Mylan) Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Sun) and Sandoz International GmbH (Sandoz). Often generics manufacturers tried to make use of any scientific progress that had taken place since the development of the original patented drug. Consequently generics could sometimes be substantially superior to the originally branded products in terms of effectiveness and side effects. In contrast to branded products generics were profitable despite lower price levels because their manufacture sidestepped a large proportion of the expensive development and test phases. Due to their lower prices many governments had taken steps to improve the market position of generics resulting in a rising proportion of generics in the global drugs market. Recent patent disputes in emerging markets such as Brazil and India were considered a threat to the traditional patent system. In 2018 India was the biggest global generics market in terms of the export of and demand for generics. Although India adopted new patent law after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 the way in which the new ruling was interpreted made it unfavourable to innovative (international) pharmaceutical companies. In 2012 for example the Indian national court upheld the position of the Indian government and refused requests from Novartis International AG (Novartis) and Bayer AG (Bayer) for patent exclusivity for two drugs stating that these could not be classified as “new inventions” under Indian patent law. Under compulsory licensing Indian generics producers were then allowed to produce generics for these products by paying a license fee of about 6–8 per cent of the annual revenue to the innovator firm. In 2013 the Indian Patent Office granted the generics drugs producer Cipla the right to produce Pfizer’s patent-expiring cancer drug Sutent. These cases were decisive to the future of Indian patent law and pharmaceutical firms feared spillover effects into other markets. Because many important patents had expired sales of Indian generics surged. But problems such as poor hygiene and defective processes in many Indian plants hampered the country’s generics exports.The supply chainFrom manufacturing through to use by the patient drugs in development went through a number of steps.ProductionThe production base for most drugs consisted of fine chemicals. For branded products fine chemicals accounted for 10–15 per cent of the final price; for generics it accounted for up to 30 per cent. On average half of all pharmaceutical products globally were manufactured by the pharmaceutical firms themselves; the other half were produced by firms in the fine-chemicals industry. The chemicals consisted of standardized or customized molecules plus active agents that were processed into the final drug in tablet or fluid form. Fine chemicals were essentially raw materials or mass-produced products generally made to a high standard by a variety of firms. As such there were many potential suppliers. No single chemical firm had achieved a dominant market position. The pharmaceuticals industry was by far the largest buyer of fine chemicals and frequently a substantial percentage of a chemical company’s revenue depended on just a few pharmaceutical customers. Drugs manufacturers for their part had to be able to guarantee high product quality. A given drug required every factory to have precisely defined processes and permissions that were checked regularly. If a given health authority judged that there were variations in quality safety or effectiveness product authorization was immediately withdrawn.Distribution and PricingWholesalers and pharmacies ensured that products reached patients. However there were considerable differences between the United States’ and European markets. In most European markets the health authorities set maximum mark-ups for pharmacies and wholesalers whereas in the United States there was more flexibility. On average the drug manufacturer received around 66 per cent of the sale price the wholesaler around 5 per cent the pharmacy about 20 per cent and the state around 9 per cent (in value-added tax and other taxes). The wholesalers would buy directly from the drug manufacturers and distribute the products to hospitals and pharmacies. To carry out this function the wholesalers needed a license and had to conform to certain criteria—such as keeping a safety stock so that they would be able to deliver within a short time frame. Wholesalers who organized the logistics of delivering drugs to pharmacies hospitals and health centres delivered the majority of drugs. Europe was dominated by a multichannel system in which multiple wholesalers would sell a given product. Large pharmacy chains specialized pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies were also able to some extent to buy drugs directly from the manufacturer. The growing importance of chains and mail-order houses in Europe however was leading to an increasing trend towards bypassing the distributor. Wholesalers had been experiencing increased price pressure resulting in tighter competition. In Europe in 2014 the average wholesale margin was around 5–10 per cent but this varied greatly between countries (e.g. in Sweden it was 3 per cent and in the Netherlands it was 23 per cent). This pressure was to some extent due to rising packaging delivery and transportation costs. Increased competition had also resulted from the tendency for drug manufacturers to establish just-in-time production systems which had caused the industry both in the United States and Europe to undergo substantial consolidation over the last few decades. Pricing was more critical for generics manufacturers than for innovative pharmaceutical companies. The competitive generics environment played a major role in pricing. An example was the effect exerted by wholesalers and parallel imports: the wholesaler could promote the distribution of higher volumes of drugs. Some wholesalers added service activities such as market data gathering processing and packaging to their core business; some even integrated vertically both downstream and upstream and had taken over production and pharmacy functions. This strategy however was disliked by national health authorities and was therefore highly restricted in some countries. The preclusion of parallel imports also had an impact on prices and revenue. The fragmentation of the European Union (EU) pharmaceutical market (and with this its pricing levels) led to parallel trading where firms could buy drugs in a country with lower price levels and resell them in countries with higher price levels. Parallel trading was estimated to amount to $4.5 billion in 2016. The sale of parallel imports in the pharmacy market amounted to 1.6 per cent in Belgium 25.5 percent in Denmark 8.5 per cent in Germany and 1.9 per cent in Poland. The role of the pharmacy varied from country to country. Prescription drugs were generally available only through pharmacies but the degree of influence of the pharmacist on the choice of drug or brand depended on the particular legal environment. Generally only doctors could decide on the drug prescribed but in many countries the pharmacist was allowed to replace a branded product with an unbranded one containing the same active ingredients. Regional DifferencesIn 2013 state-supported compulsory health insurance existed in the majority of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. On average 58 per cent of medication expenses in OECD countries were financed publicly (e.g. in Germany 77 per cent; in the United States 48 per cent). Patients and/or private health insurance (see Exhibit 18) funded the other 42 per cent. Health systems in Europe and the United States were different. In the United States the great majority of the population was privately insured as there was no or little public health insurance. Moreover until 2017 the US government had rarely commented on drug price regulation. In 2018 however the US president announced when meeting with US-based CEOs of pharmaceutical giants “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.”Traditionally the US market had always been the most important market for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide yielding high prices and margins. In Europe state health systems were the principal purchasers of drugs but this was becoming less of a positive for the pharmaceutical industry than it used to be. Due to increasing public health-care spending and tight national budgets European governments had in recent years become active in the areas of price regulation and negotiation. For the pharmaceutical industry these measures had taken on vast proportions. Tom McKillop the CEO of AstraZeneca Plc (Astra Zeneca) from 1999 to 2006 spoke of an “extortion-like” situation. Felix Raeber at the time head of European media relations for Novartis described the situation as one where the pharmaceutical companies were “without control” over pricing. One regulation method involved the state and manufacturer agreeing to set fixed prices. This meant lengthy price and reimbursement negotiations which could delay product launch significantly. The German government in 2005 for example became involved in price regulation and demanded sweeping price reductions. For example Lipitor patients would in future receive reimbursement up to a certain amount only. The government also asserted however that if the price of Lipitor were to be reduced by a further 38 per cent patients would receive full reimbursement. Pfizer implemented the price reduction which had a drastic effect on its profits. It did mean though that the product could be kept on the market.  Governments in Europe set prices by what was known as “referencing.” Products with similar therapeutic effects were grouped together and a lower all-in price separately determined for each group. The reimbursement system was then aligned such that the patients paid for the drugs if the price was higher than the reference price. Another measure taken by governments was known as an “all-in price markdown” that limited a product’s profit margins—one such was the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme system developed in the United Kingdom.In 2012 an average price range of 30 per cent over or under the EU average price existed. Each country set different prices; hence price control within the EU resulted in parallel imports and lost profits for pharmaceuticals corporations. Governments via their respective health-care reimbursement systems influenced not only prices but also product demand. Usually patients would get drugs expenses paid for only if the drug was classified as reimbursable by their national health-care system. Many countries established so-called “positive lists” where all products on the list were normally reimbursed and/or “negative lists” where all products on the list would not be reimbursed. When a prescription drug was not reimbursed the demand for this drug was thereby automatically limited—as patients would shy away from drugs they had to finance out of their own pockets.Exhibit 1: Revenues of the Pharmaceutial SEgment of the top 10 Pharmaceutical Companies 2007 2012 and 2017 [in US$ millions]Notes: *Including generic drugs.

Samsui Central Kitchen (SCK) Samsui’s flagship corporate social responsibility (CSR) project provided 1.8 million meals annually to various long-term care facilities for the elderly and was especially crucial because the existing SCK facility was reaching maximum capacity and stakeholder buy-in would be needed to expand it. Ang strongly believed in Samsui’s ambition to embed CSR in its core company strategy. Having achieved his initial objectives for the central kitchen he set his sights on expansion to impact more beneficiaries in the company’s home base of Singapore. He wondered how to quantify the impact of SCK’s CSR initiatives in a clear and simple message in order to communicate the impact to various stakeholders and justify the further expansion of SCK. Samsui’s BACKGROUNDIn 2013 Samsui was set up by Soup Restaurant Group Limited (Soup Restaurant) to spearhead Soup Kitchen’s CSR efforts as part of its “drive to do good.” Soup Restaurant had started in 1991 as a restaurant operating out of a single shop-house in Singapore’s Chinatown with only six employees and six dining tables. The restaurant sold various herbal soups and home-cooked Chinese dishes at an affordable price-point to mass-market consumers. Soup Restaurant had since expanded to 17 restaurants across Singapore and Malaysia with a franchise in Indonesia. The company had been listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange since 2007 and operated an entire portfolio of brands and verticals in the food and beverage (F&B) sector. The products ranged from prepared condiments and sauces to frozen supermarket food (see Exhibit 1).A major reason for Soup Restaurant’s decision to set up Samsui was to enable better tracking of key process indicators and the resources needed for these activities with the goal of doing sustainable good. In 2016 Soup Restaurant received the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Award for Small and Medium Enterprises. The following year the company was recognized as a Champion of Good by the NVPC.Ang and the rest of Samsui’s management team decided that the company’s philanthropic efforts should not be restricted to one-off projects and events preferring sustainable and long-term initiatives. Given Samsui’s extensive experience in the F&B industry as well as the experience of its parent company Samsui decided to leverage its knowledge of the food value chain to help charitable organizations. Traditionally charitable organizations could not leverage economies of scale to negotiate lower prices for ingredients and they often lacked distribution networks for logistics. But Samsui had strong bargaining power in its relationships with suppliers due to the collective clout of Soup Restaurant when purchasing ingredients. Samsui also had distribution networks in place that it could leverage for the transportation and logistics of ingredients and cooked meals. This competency-based approach ensured that Samsui focused on its core expertise of food manufacturing which culminated in launching the “Makan Project” in 2013. Makan was a program that delivered better quality food to 20000 underprivileged recipients in homes and care centres. The initial 30000 meals were prepared in the existing central kitchen of Samsui’s parent company during downtime periods when excess production capacity could be utilized. As the program’s popularity increased Samsui explored ways of expanding this CSR initiative by increasing the number of meals provided to beneficiaries. Consequently Samsui decided that setting up a new central kitchen was necessary with the existing kitchens already running at full capacity. Samsui’s decision to pursue strategic CSR was exemplary. Industry experts had criticized the philanthropic CSR approach on the basis that CSR should encompass more than just philanthropy volunteerism and eco-friendliness. This view was echoed by research from McKinsey & Company which argued that companies typically took a too inward-looking perspective of CSR efforts and viewed CSR as a distinct program in a company’s operations. In contrast Samsui relied on its core competencies instead of reinventing the wheel to bring about social benefits in an innovative way that allowed it to create a sustainable initiative in the form of SCK. It could thus be argued that Samsui’s approach was ahead of its time in respect to its Singaporean peers.However there was a clear need for a framework in the decision-making process for CSR. When Samsui was just starting out new CSR projects could be quickly ideated materialized and tested to determine whether they met the expected objectives and were sustainable. However the absence of a formal and rigorous framework that considered the implications and viability of an initiative conflicted with Samsui’s ambition of embedding CSR into its core company strategy. Given that Samsui had limited resources as a relatively small enterprise it was prudent to avoid initiatives that were merely well-meaning but not profitable. Otherwise Samsui would risk creating an assortment of uncoordinated and unfocused CSR activities that would become unsustainable. Therefore it was imperative for Samsui to create effective key performance indicators to benchmark its performance and the achievements of the company. This was especially important because Samsui was engaged in CSR projects that were no longer small in terms of time operational scope and capital commitments despite Samsui’s limited resources. The most recent addition of a flagship SCK had cost the company $1 million in capital. Ang shared Samsui’s preference for working with like-minded program partners such as Standard Chartered Bank. In addition to collaborating with Samsui to build SCK Standard Chartered Bank had its own program—the Silver Lining—aimed at improving quality of life for the elderly. The program launched in 2012 involved the bank’s employees engaging with seniors through various community initiatives. BETTER FOOD NEEDED AT Long-Term Care FacilitiESThrough market research Ang found that the food served in Singapore’s long-term care facilities for the elderly had been the subject of criticism by industry experts. The two main criticisms were the lack of nutrition and the lack of variety. Many care facilities ran their own kitchens with mixed results. The issue of lack of nutrition had been well-documented with the most common nutritional problems for residents in long-term care facilities being weight loss and associated protein-energy malnutrition. The prevalence of these two factors among the elderly in these facilities in Singapore ranged between 23 and 85 per cent. The lack of variety in the food served in these facilities had been attributed to outdated kitchen equipment and time constraints resulting in limited menus with the same cooking methods and ingredients used repeatedly. In a 2016 study it was found that a quarter of long-term care facility residents did not enjoy the food provided while a third complained that they were unable to find their favourite food among the offerings.Both the lack of quality and lack of nutrition were issues that necessitated intervention. These factors could lead to adverse effects on the health and quality of life of long-term care facility residents. Malnutrition had been found to compromise their quality of life leading to chronic disability functional decline increased health care costs and possibly even death. A lack of food choice could result in inadequate food intake leading to weight loss and a suboptimal body mass index suggestive of malnutrition. As such it was imperative to find a major company prepared to tackle the root of the problem by providing nutritious food to improve quality of life for the residents. Globally autonomy of choice had been reported as one of the main reasons for improved food intake in long-term care facilities which could also indirectly tackle the malnutrition issue. The level of satisfaction with food service had increased up to 30 per cent after long-term care facility residents were offered the power to choose from a menu. Therefore providing a range of food choices was considered the key to providing adequate nutrition in the form of a balance of carbohydrates proteins and vegetables. Ang felt that given Samsui’s unique position in the F&B industry it was well placed to tackle the issue by providing a variety of food to improve the quality of life for the elderly.MARKET SIZeBased on the NVPC training program Ang realized that the first step was to estimate the number of meals for long-term care facilities. The first of two key figures to be used in estimating the number of meals was Samsui’s targeted market share of 30 per cent in Singapore by 2031. Based on Ang’s calculations Samsui’s current market share was closer to 17 per cent. This estimate was based on a linear projection over time and the first-mover advantage SCK’s project had in serving the relatively closed market of the long-term care facility meals industry. The second key figure was the total number of beds in institutional care centres which was projected by the Singapore Ministry of Health to be 17000 by 2020. The figure represented growth of 85 per cent from 2010. Ang assumed that the number of beds would increase in a linear trend during the forecasted period as opposed to the exponential growth seen from 2010 to 2020.Ang also projected that the supply of beds in long-term care facilities would increase to meet demand which was driven in part by the lack of quality home care options. Approximately 2 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and over stayed in long-term care facilities compared to an average of 6–8 per cent in Northern Europe and Australia. SAMSUI CENTRAL KITCHEN’s PROJECT Samsui’s flagship CSR project was the SCK project. It was intended to provide employment skills training to individuals in need. The SCK project was launched in October 2017 by Samsui and the Standard Chartered Bank of Singapore with the support of Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) a government organization that provided the matching service between the trainees and Samsui. The project had been touted as the first social service system in Singapore. It was a collaboration between the public sector private sector and social enterprises leveraging their respective strengths and resources to deliver sustainable long-term impact on the community. The current facility was staffed by 30 trainees and produced 1.8 million meals annually. The trainees would prepare meals to be served to beneficiaries at various non-profit organizations. Samsui’s menus were approved by dieticians and nutritionists before being rolled out. Through this project Samsui aimed to provide a greater variety of nutritious food options to increase the overall satisfaction of care health and quality of life for residents.  One immediate impact of the launch was SCK’s increased capacity with an almost 500 per cent increase from the 365000 meals previously delivered by Samsui. The impact on food quality was also palpable according to the recipients of the meals. James Tan chief executive of Touch Community Services (one of the beneficiaries of the kitchen) said that the food was delicious and that it helped to get good quality food at good prices. Trainees who worked in the kitchen were also offered jobs with Samsui upon completion of their training. Even if these trainees chose not to work with Samsui they would have picked up some useful skills for employment opportunities elsewhere. Ang also noted another less apparent impact of the SCK project: by outsourcing food operations the long-term care facilities could free up workers and related resources for other activities. This enabled the facilities to focus on their core strength of providing quality care.SAMSUI’S PLAN FOR EXPANSIONIn 2018 the capacity of SCK was 1.8 million meals per year. This could meet the needs of approximately 2465 long-term care facility residents annually which was a fraction of the 17000-capacity requirement set by the Singapore Ministry of Health for 2020. Ang saw an opportunity for Samsui to make use of its comparative advantage to meet the needs of even more long-term care facilities and residents. Samsui would be able to negotiate better prices for food ingredients and make use of its inherent knowledge in food production to provide a greater social good.A key challenge faced by long-term care facilities was providing nutritious and varied meals at a cost-effective price point. Options included setting up a kitchen within the long-term care facility and engaging third-party food caterers. Ang noted that setting up a kitchen was expensive. Using third-party food caterers was also not ideal because caterers had little experience and ability to address the dietary requirements of the residents often resulting in bland and unvaried meal plans. In contrast SCK aimed to provide sufficiently nutritious and varied meals without being prohibitively expensive.Ang felt that with Samsui’s team of professional chefs and the ability to purchase bulk ingredients from wholesalers SCK could provide an extensive balanced menu to long-term care facilities with high-quality ingredients and at a lower cost than other available catering options. The meals offered included local favourites tweaked to match the dietary requirements of the residents. For example Samsui chefs developed a low cholesterol version of laksa by using anchovies and fresh milk.SAMSUI’S NEED FOR a DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKGiven that the existing SCK facility was reaching its maximum capacity Ang knew that investment from the parent company “Soup Restaurant Group” would be needed for expansion. The first SCK was built at a cost of $1 million. Because Soup Restaurant was a publicly listed for-profit organization it had to be accountable to stakeholders and shareholders. Ang needed to ensure that the group’s commitment to doing good was sustainable. Samsui had joined NVPC’s Company of Good program in 2016 as a founding member. This program aimed to empower businesses in Singapore to contribute in strategic sustainable and impactful ways. NVPC advocated the “Four I’s” framework—investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 2). Ang reflected on how Samsui’s focus on doing good had been incorporated throughout the company’s business processes. During the recruitment process for new employees personal qualities such as integrity and willingness to do good for the community were highly sought. Samsui selected its employees for CSR initiatives based on the employees’ strengths and interests. The employees were also rotated among the various CSR activities to increase their exposure to varied experiences. Ang was thus able to build a culture of strong employee participation and volunteerism. Lee Chee Hua a chef participating in a CSR program to cook meals for the beneficiaries shared his thoughts: “When I participated in the programme I realized that ageing is a path that most people have to go through. Seeing the joy on the faces of the people we serve brings much satisfaction to me.”The learning experience from partnering with NVPC also prompted Ang to consider whether Samsui should use the Four I’s framework to benchmark its performance and achievements. Ang felt that the impact of the model could be further enhanced. Knowing that Samsui as a small-to-medium enterprise had limited resources it was important to avoid initiatives that were well-meaning but not profitable. Therefore Ang needed to conduct a more in-depth analysis. He needed to find options for evaluating the SCK project’s impact in a more formal and rigorous manner. Measuring impact quantitatively was important to ensure buy-in from key stakeholders including Samsui’s employees management and shareholders.SOCIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENTBy reviewing existing literature on the topic Ang identified two key tools that could be used effectively to evaluate the SCK project: the balanced scorecard and social return on investment (SROI). The balanced scorecard could clearly highlight the program’s objectives and the steps Samsui needed to take to meet those goals. However the balanced scorecard could only provide a subjective form of measurement. It was unable to quantify figures such as social outcomes and impacts. In contrast the SROI was an adaptation of the return on investment formula used by traditional investors to assess a company’s success. The SROI framework could measure and report a broad concept of value that extended beyond financial terms and enabled an organization and its stakeholders to see a more complete picture of the benefits from their investment of time money and other resources. Mathematically the basic formula could be expressed as follows: SROI = Present Value of Benefits ÷ Present Value of Total Investment. Ang knew that he needed some concrete numbers to gain stakeholder support for the expansion of SCK to reach more beneficiaries. The SROI formula could help provide those figures. However to estimate the SCK project’s impact using the SROI framework Ang needed to first complete four key steps.Step 1: Theory of ChangeThe first step was to identify the underlying theory of change (ToC) which was an overview of the relationship between interventions and expected effects or outcomes. That overview would map the chains of causes and effects. The ToC would highlight the transition from the current state to the final state via the intervention method (see Exhibit 3). At the current state food offerings at long-term care facilities lacked nutritional value and variety which led to a lower quality of life (QoL) for the residents. The World Health Organization defined QoL as “the individuals’ perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns.” There were several domains operating under the QoL umbrella. In respect to the SCK project the focus was on the domains of physical health and psychological health. The intervention method was providing meals with greater nutritional value and greater variety. Greater nutritional value would tackle the physical health domain whereas greater variety of food would increase food choices and address the psychological health domain. Step 2: Impact MappingImpact mapping was achieved using a logic model. The model examined various resources (i.e. inputs) used to conduct activities. The activities were measured in outputs which consisted of direct quantitative and qualitative summary measures obtained from the activities. Ultimately the outputs led to outcomes or social externalities that occurred within one to three years. The outputs also led to long-term benefits for stakeholders which were attained within 7 to 10 years. The impact map was fundamental to an SROI analysis. Using the developed ToC as the underlying concept the impact map ascertained the social impact of an intervention. Ang developed the impact mapping for the SCK project based on his own reading (see Exhibit 4).Step 3: Data CollectionThe data collection process comprised three progressive steps: (1) selecting indicators (2) identifying financial proxies (valuation and monetization) and (3) collecting data. In selecting indicators the developed ToC relied on secondary research to build the case for the need for intervention. To measure whether the outcomes set out had been achieved indicators could be selected to ascertain whether a change had occurred. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators could be used to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. The indicators chosen should be S.M.A.R.T.—specific measurable attainable relevant and time-bound.Indicators had to be chosen to measure the changes brought about by Samsui’s intervention. Many found the process of translating outcomes from social welfare interventions into measurable results challenging. Consequently both quantitative and qualitative indicators were used in tandem to illustrate several aspects of Samsui’s SCK intervention. This served to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. A quantitative indicator of saving for example would be the resource saved by outsourcing meals to Samsui. The quantitative indicator of these opportunity costs which were incurred by preparing meals in-house was used together with surveys of long-term care facility operators and service staff. One key consideration for Samsui was whether the indicators could be reasonably measured. Having chosen suitable indicators monetary values were attached to the outcomes to estimate the social value to different stakeholders. To do so financial proxies had to be chosen. Financial proxies helped to reach the desired indicator and estimate the social value of non-traded goods to different stakeholders. The financial proxies chosen had to be close to the desired indicators. For example a monetary value was calculated for a long-term care facility freeing up resources by outsourcing to Samsui on a per meal basis. This calculation was based on the difference between the existing industry average food price versus Samsui’s food price (see Exhibit 5). Data for each of the indicators chosen had to be collected based on research and existing sources (i.e. internal stakeholders and external sources). This step was done using reasonable efforts to evaluate the change that resulted. Two key variables were identified that could significantly alter the calculation of SROI: (1) the number of meals sold to long-term care facilities and (2) the difference in Samsui’s food price versus industry average. Other model assumptions were also used for the SROI analysis (see Exhibit 6). The calculation also involved estimating the SCK project’s deadweight; that is how much of the outcome could be achieved without intervention? No deadweight was assumed for the outcome of “residents having a greater variety of nutritious meals.” This change was unlikely to happen without Samsui because no other meal provider was offering a similar standard of nutrition or variety in 2018.Step 4: SROI Modelling In the final step the social benefits were summed up and discounted. The value of outcomes were discounted to the same period as when the investment costs were incurred. Subsequently the ratio of the summed benefits to the present value of the investment was calculated. Because SROI was a ratio it was meaningless on its own. It had to be compared against a benchmark such as competing companies within a given industry or Samsui’s own past performance. Alternatively both comparisons could be done. To compare the SROI against other Samsui performance would require another study. MOVING FORWARDBefore Ang could explain to the board members his plan to scale up the SCK project to double the current capacity he needed more evidence to demonstrate the current project’s achieved impact. He approached SG Enable an agency in Singapore dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities for a possible partnership pertaining to the possible location for the second SCK project and additional workforce that was inclusive of persons with disabilities. Ang was eager to continue doing good.

Though Elon’s comments are unpredictable we will continue to monitor Tesla’s operations to ensure no chaos there and will work in step with the company.Kazuhiro Tsuga president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Panasonic CorporationIn October 2018 Tesla Inc. (Tesla) an American automotive and energy company received an approval from the Shanghai government to acquire a plot of land to build a new electric-vehicle (EV) factory. The factory was planned to produce the first cars within three years with an initial annual capacity of 250000 vehicles. Discussions leading to the deal began in July 2018 in response to the rise of the Chinese EV market and the additional tariffs imposed on imported vehicles by the Chinese government during the 2018 trade war with the United States. In 2013 Tesla partnered with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) the consumer electronics company and world leader in battery technology to build “Gigafactory 1” in Nevada United States to manufacture batteries—the most critical component in electric vehicles—and this partnership resulted in significant mutual benefits. Panasonic hoped to launch full-fledged battery production in China in partnership with Tesla but first wanted Tesla to give priority to building additional capacity at Gigafactory 1. Because there was no obligation for either company to not collaborate with other companies Tesla and Panasonic could each be worried that the other would collaborate with a third company which would threaten their respective markets and large investments in Gigafactory 1. In fact Tesla announced that it was considering partnership with several battery cell suppliers for its first overseas factory in China and Panasonic was also considering collaboration with other battery suppliers and automakers to strengthen its competitive position in the country.Management at Tesla had many decisions to make and questions to answer for the near future: What should be Tesla’s growth strategy in China the world’s largest automotive market? Could Tesla establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in China on its own? Should Tesla continue its partnership with Panasonic in China or should it look for other Chinese or non-Chinese suppliers or partners? Could Tesla still be successful globally if it were not successful in China?TESLA AND ITS DEVELOPMENTHistoryTesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning with the vision to produce fully electric sports cars designed to offer performance aesthetics and sex appeal. Within a short history of 15 years the company had mastered many challenges and experienced soaring growth. Although the impressive growth had not resulted in significant profits by 2018 Tesla had managed to become one of the most valuable car companies in the world with a market capitalization of about US$59 billion and approximately 46000 employees. Elon Musk joined the company in 2004 as chairman and took a decisive role in the design and development of the Tesla Roadster a battery-powered sports car that was introduced to the public in July 2006. After many production delays and financial troubles the board of directors dismissed the two founders and Musk took over as CEO in October 2008. At that time Tesla was producing less than 200 Roadsters filling a niche in an industry that produced several million vehicles per year. Tesla was facing serious liquidity problems with cash reserves reaching a critical level during the financial crisis of 2008 but the company eventually managed to secure financing to keep its business going. Beginning of the TurnaroundIn 2010 several events turned out to be in favour of Tesla’s growth. First Daimler AG (Daimler) a German multinational automotive company bought a 10-per-cent stake in Tesla for $50 million while also providing the company with engineering supports and parts for the its planned new Model S. Meanwhile Tesla continued to provide battery packs and battery integration and management services for Daimler’s smart electric cars. Second the U.S. federal government granted Tesla a loan of $465 million to produce and market its Model S. Third Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) due to the financial crisis sold its production facilities—with a capacity of 500000 vehicles a year—to Tesla which then shifted its production sites from Lotus in England to Fremont in California. Fourth Tesla announced its initial public offering (IPO) while establishing an agreement with Toyota to jointly develop EVs. Toyota also purchased $50 million worth of Tesla stocks at the IPO even though Tesla had increasingly accumulated losses of $154.3 million compared to $55.7 million in 2009. Tesla’s success continued in 2012 with the delivery of the Model S; Tesla reported the first quarterly profit in 2013 of $11.2 million. Tesla then unveiled a prototype of the Model X a sport-utility vehicle (SUV) built on the platform of the Model S. The company also announced the Model 3—an affordable car to serve the mass market. It also planned to introduce superchargers which would allow a car to replenish 50 per cent of its batteries in 30 minutes along with the accompanying charging network to reduce the owner’s “range anxiety.” Tesla also ventured into the stationary energy field by introducing solar panels and home batteries (e.g. the “Powerwall”). In 2017 the company introduced the Tesla Semi an all-electric battery-powered truck. Batteries were the most critical component in all battery-powered vehicles. Since 2013 Tesla partnered with Panasonic the consumer electronics company and a world leader in battery technology to build Tesla’s Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and then Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York. In 2018 the company planned to enter the world’s largest automotive market in China with a local production site. After building Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo there was a chance that Tesla might partner with Panasonic again to build Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai. However Tesla was also considering other local and overseas potential partners.OVERVIEW OF the ELECTRIC-VEHICLE MARKET Significant Rise of the Global EV MarketThe EV market had grown globally at a compound annual growth rate of 32.57 per cent and was on track to grow from an estimated 1.50 million units in 2018 to an expected 10.79 million units in 2025. This trend was in response to a massive decline of urban air quality volatile global oil and fuel prices and the public’s attempts to de-carbonize transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries in Asia Pacific especially China were the largest markets for EVs. The alarming levels of pollution in these countries had prompted their governments to provide incentives to promote the sales of EVs. Globally governmental subsidies grants and tax rebates contributed to the EV market’s growth as did improved charging infrastructures increased EV battery range and reduced battery costs. In 2017 the total number of EVs in circulation worldwide exceeded 3 million an increase of 50 per cent from 2016 with the United States Europe and China consuming approximately 0.76 0.82 and 1.23 million vehicles respectively. The number of new vehicles sold around the world—both battery-powered and plug-in hybrid types—was over 1 million. China had the largest number of sales at 579000 vehicles while the second largest market—American customers—bought 198350 vehicles (see Exhibit 1). The market share of EVs in the highly competitive Chinese market was around 2.2 per cent compared to 1.2 per cent of the U.S. market. Norway had the most impressive market share of 39 per cent with sales of 62260 vehicles. The sales figures in emerging economies like India and Brazil where road and electrical infrastructure still needed further improvement were only 2000 and 360 vehicles respectively.Importance of Lithium-Ion Batteries for the EV IndustryBatteries accounted for over one-third of the total vehicle price. Sourcing the right suppliers was therefore crucial for vehicle manufacturers and the market for lithium-ion batteries was expected to grow strongly to $50 billion in 2020. In 2018 the major lithium-ion battery makers were Panasonic Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) BYD Auto Co. Ltd. (BYD) LG Chem Ltd. (LG Chem) and Samsung Group (Samsung). These makers held over 60 per cent of the global market share (see Exhibit 5). Primarily located in Asia these manufacturers created an oligopolistic industry structure with a relatively high bargaining power toward vehicle manufacturers. To reduce its dependency on battery makers in 2014 Tesla in partnership with Panasonic began the construction in Nevada of Gigafactory 1—the world’s largest production plant for lithium-ion batteries. This factory expected to be completed in 2020 would eventually cost Tesla around $5 billion. Tesla estimated that this plant would reduce the battery price by roughly 30 per cent by using economies of scale and having the production plant on its doorstep. Through the $2.6-billion acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (SolarCity) in 2016 the companies built Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo to produce photovoltaic components. TESLA’S BUSINESS MODEL The Sustainable Solutions for the World’s Transport and Energy Tesla’s business model was different from that of traditional car manufacturers (see Exhibit 2). The company did not set goals of producing high-end EVs for the affluent to make money and move up in the business rankings. Instead its value proposition was to offer sustainable solutions for the world’s transport and energy needs. The initial target customers were in the premium segment and the company planned to make its cars more affordable in the future. In 2014 Tesla’s typical customers lived in California and earned more than $100000 a year. However its Model S and Model 3 introduced respectively in 2012 and 2017 were designed to be affordable cars for the mass market. To keep this value proposition Tesla had established strategic partnerships in various sectors. Growth through Strategic Partnerships In 2010 Tesla acquired Daimler as a shareholder and strategic partner with whom it exchanged knowledge in research and development (R&D) production processes supply-chain management and battery technologies. Tesla also partnered with Toyota on the development and production of Toyota’s EVs and Toyota aimed to learn from Tesla’s decision-making and management style. Tesla established partnerships with mobile communications operators such as AT&T Inc. for installing wireless connections in its cars to enable machine-to-machine communications for safety diagnostics as well as for remote monitoring and repair. Tesla collaborated with Nvidia Corporation early during the development of its Model S in 2012—all Tesla’s vehicles including the Model S Model X and Model 3 were equipped with Nvidia’s supercomputer which could provide full self-driving capability.In the energy sector Tesla established strong partnerships with Panasonic and SolarCity. Panasonic became Tesla’s shareholder in 2010 when it invested $30 million in the company. Tesla partnered with SolarCity an active enterprise in the solar energy field to exploit its battery know-how to develop a complete off-the-grid kit for storing solar power. This backward integration would enable Tesla to become more than just a car manufacturer. The close collaboration with SolarCity and the eventual acquisition of the company in 2016 allowed Tesla to diversify into solar energy services. In 2015 Tesla announced the release of the Powerwall—an energy storage unit targeting niche households that already had a solar panel—to store surplus energy that could be used when a home’s solar panel was not producing enough energy. Financial services and sales or leasing of the Powerwalls were also added to Tesla’s revenue model. Key Resources Activities and Revenue SourcesSome of Tesla’s strategic resources were its patents which included expertise in software and battery technology. The charging infrastructure for its vehicles plus their energy management and storage were also counted among Tesla’s strategic assets. Located in Palo Alto California a part of the Silicon Valley Tesla could attract highly qualified employees which were its key human resource. Musk was also regarded as a key resource. By using Twitter for marketing activities Musk had made Tesla’s overall business highly dependent on him. The biggest change in Tesla’s key resources was the transfer of all of its patents to become open-source platforms in 2014. Tesla believed that technology leadership was not defined by patents; rather that they were small protection against a determined competitor. Tesla applied the open-source philosophy to its patents arguing that it would strengthen rather than diminish its competitive position. It might be argued that Tesla intended its patents to become industry standards for networks of charging infrastructures—to be used by its customers and competitors. The wide adoption of such standards could help Tesla sell more of its cars and other innovative products and could become the foundation that would support its future business models.Tesla’s three key activities and main revenue sources were R&D sales and service activities of its cars and energy storage products and its charging infrastructure. GROWTH STRATEGY IN CHINAAttempts to Enter the World’s Largest EV MarketTesla began to enter the Chinese market in 2014 and 2015 but failed to gain traction. In 2016 however its sales in China exceeded $1 billion—three times more than 2015 sales. In 2017 the company failed to maintain this growth rate but still doubled its sales to surpass $2 billion. China was the largest automotive market in the world and the fastest growing EV market as of 2016 (see Exhibit 3). The market potential was attributed to the rise of a middle class—people who were willing and able to spend on innovative and sustainable cars. Importantly the Chinese government offered a substantial subsidy for electric cars that was worth up to $15000 per vehicle in 2016 (see Exhibit 4). To fully penetrate the Chinese market Tesla decided to establish a manufacturing plant in Shanghai to sell cars directly without having to ship them from the United States. Tesla could significantly leverage China’s lower labour costs and proximity to rare minerals—especially lithium—that were required to build the batteries. While markets for EV batteries were predominantly located in Europe the United States and Japan an increasing shift toward China was predicted for the near future. These location advantages would lower Tesla’s production costs allowing the company to sell its cars at a more competitive price in the Chinese market. The China location would also lower the risks and expenses of shipping components by air especially flammable and heavy batteries from the United States.A more recent aspect which influenced Tesla to make the relocation decision was the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. The Chinese market contributed 17 per cent to Tesla’s revenue in 2017. In response to the trade war which had raised the tariff on imported American cars Tesla had to raise the prices of its cars in the Chinese market by an average of $20000 to maintain its profit margin. An additional tariff of 25 per cent on imported American products imposed by the Chinese government could be bypassed if Tesla produced the cars in China.Construction of the Shanghai Gigafactory 3In July 2018 Tesla announced a deal with Chinese authorities to build the battery manufacturing plant—Gigafactory 3—in Shanghai to accelerate production and to avoid increasingly expensive import tariffs. The government approved the acquisition of an 864885-square metre plot in Shanghai’s Lingang area where several auto manufacturers with foreign ties had facilities. In March 2019 the Chinese authority also approved that part of the production line would begin operation by the end of the year. Tesla was advancing its plan to produce around 500000 vehicles per year for Chinese customers by 2022–23 which would double the size of global electric car manufacturing. In March 2019 Musk confirmed that Tesla would also produce battery cells in the Chinese factory which had not been included in his initial plans for China thereby returning to the goal of producing everything at the same place in a “one-stop shop.” Tesla manufactured its lithium-ion batteries in Nevada and its vehicles in Fremont California. According to Musk “Things are moving fast. This will actually be once complete the equivalent of our Fremont factory plus our Nevada battery Gigafactory combined. It’s integrating the two which kind of make sense.” The new factory was expected to cost around $5 billion. Meanwhile Tesla secured as much as $521 million in loans from Chinese banks bringing the carmaker a step closer to producing the Model 3 sedans at its first overseas plant. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH PANASONICSynergistic BenefitsPanasonic was engaged in the development of electronics technologies and solutions for the consumer electronics housing automotive enterprise solutions and device industries. The automotive batteries were made in a three-pillar global production system in Japan the United States and China. In 2010 the company began mass production of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid EV automobiles. It had developed strong partnerships with Tesla and Toyota and focused sales in the high-growth Chinese market. In March 2018 the company commenced mass production of automotive lithium-ion batteries at its first plant in Dalian China. In 2018 with about 274000 employees Panasonic achieved revenues of $75 billion in which Japan China Asia Europe and the Americas contributed 47 12 14 10 and 17 per cent respectively.In 2014 Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a $5 billion lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant known as the Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. This factory would produce cells modules and packs for Tesla’s vehicles and for the stationary storage market to reduce cell costs and to produce more lithium-ion batteries annually. This partnership continued in building the next Gigafactory 2 in New York to manufacture solar cells following the $2.6-billion acquisition of SolarCity in 2016. Both Gigafactories were Tesla’s backward integration to secure the critical supply of batteries and alternative energies.Tesla could also benefit from its supply contract with Panasonic which reduced uncertainties in the supply of batteries. The partnership also provided the opportunity to drive down the unit price of batteries by 30 per cent by 2020. Panasonic would not have committed to such high investments if it did not expect sales and profitability to be driven by battery sales through scale economies. As expected Panasonic’s operating profits had significantly increased by 11.7 per cent to $3.87 billion in fiscal year 2018. Other potential synergies included additional visibility and market reach for Panasonic in the United States and for Tesla in Asia through their strong brands in their respective markets. Panasonic hoped to launch full-fledged production in China together with Tesla; however that agreement was not yet confirmed. The continued collaboration would make sense because Tesla and Panasonic worked together before and their technologies were already customized to be compatible. This prior experience would reduce the lead time and costs of the cars when production was finally ramped up in China. Panasonic also had a strong interest in having a production facility in China to leverage the country’s lower labour cost and weaker currency. Japanese companies were in fact struggling with their sales figures due to the strong performance of the yen. Uncertainty of Partnership in ChinaIn November 2018 Musk announced that Tesla was considering several battery cell suppliers for the factory in China. In January 2019 Tesla signed a preliminary agreement with state-owned Lishen Battery just days after Tesla began building a factory in Shanghai with an aggressive production goal. It was unclear however what the firms had agreed to. In March 2019 Tesla was reportedly discussing a partnering potential with CATL for its battery supply. The partnership between Tesla and Panasonic seemed to be diverging in the Chinese Gigafactory 3 project. In December 2018 Panasonic joined with LG Chem to add more production capacity for EV batteries in China. This collaboration was in response to the Chinese government loosening of its restrictions to attract foreign investments and to promote new-energy vehicles as the country’s environmental problems worsened. In January 2019 in order to compete more effectively on cost and scale with rising Chinese players Panasonic planned to establish a joint venture to produce batteries with Toyota in 2020 and also planned to move some plants in Japan and China to this new facility. However the U.S. plant with which Panasonic had partnered with Tesla would not be involved in the Toyota deal. The new venture aimed to supply batteries to Mazda Motor Corporation—Toyota’s partner on electric car technology—Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. and Subaru Corporation. The venture would also encourage Honda Motor Company Ltd. which used Panasonic batteries in its hybrid vehicles to adopt the new cells.OTHER POTENTIAL PARTNERSIt would be convenient for Tesla to continue collaborating with Panasonic to build Gigafactory 3. However another player among the top four makers—Panasonic CATL BYD and LG Chem—might provide more partnering advantages in some other aspects (see Exhibit 5). The Chinese CATL and BYD and the South Korean LG Chem companies were the top battery suppliers with sales revenues totalling $4.4 billion $17.7 billion and $25.6 billion respectively in 2018 and the number of employees amounting to 14000 220000 and 18000 respectively. CATL and BYD had respectively 98 per cent and 87 per cent of total sales in their home Chinese market while LG Chem had 32 33 and 20 per cent respectively in its home South Korean market China and other Asian markets.Chemistry of the BatteriesTesla claimed the highest energy density and low cobalt for its lithium-ion batteries which were co-produced with Panasonic. BYD and CATL could offer a lithium-iron phosphate battery that did not contain cobalt. Lithium-iron phosphate batteries had lower energy density but were safer especially in terms of flammability while offering a cycle life similar to those batteries with cobalt. Cobalt was a very rare earth primarily found in the unstable Democratic Republic of Congo which in turn created supply uncertainties. Lithium-iron phosphate batteries could therefore be a viable option for Tesla especially to prevent new scandals about spontaneously burning cars. CATL and LG Chem were also working to lower cobalt content in their batteries (see Exhibit 5).Lithium as the main component of batteries was a critical cost driver. Although lithium was mostly used in lithium-ion batteries it was also widely used in the production of glass grease air treatments polymers pharmacy drugs metals and other products. The price of lithium had continued to rise over the years which increased production costs of batteries (see Exhibits 6 and 7) and access to a local reserve of lithium was therefore very valuable. BYD seemed to be a potential partner for Tesla in China because of its location advantage—available access to 80 per cent of the local lithium reserves in China’s Xining city.Regulations and Incentives from the Chinese GovernmentTo stimulate the transfer of new more advanced technologies from abroad the Chinese government required that for foreign companies entering the automotive industry partner with a local company the foreign equity be capped at 50 per cent. Although either CATL or BYD could be a good candidate Tesla could be subject to the risks of losing its strategic intellectual-based assets to these local companies due to the joint venturing and partial control. Given the continuing desire of the Chinese government to stimulate the use of renewable energy through various regulations and incentives and given Tesla’s strong technological capability in the field Tesla would need to negotiate with the government to establish a wholly-owned production facility in the country.Since 2012 the Chinese government had invested over $10 billion into the EV battery industry which resulted in a significant rise in the number of EV manufacturers. This support would end in 2020 however as the government sought to encourage companies to become more competitive. BYD and CATL would have to be careful about the prospect of competing without subsidies with foreign rivals like Panasonic and LG Chem. In response to the soaring demand for new-energy vehicles to gain a larger market share and to expand its production capacity BYD planned to spin off its automotive battery division by 2022. Meanwhile CATL joined forces with many powerful domestic and global automakers that were aiming to reduce the pressure of supplying batteries and expedite the production of new-energy vehicles. LOOKING FORWARDTesla had managed to expand its business successfully through various strategic partnerships with Daimler Toyota Nvidia and Panasonic as those companies brought in essential technologies and financing. Panasonic had helped Tesla reduce the bargaining power of its battery suppliers thereby mitigating the inherent risk of supply bottlenecks and excessive production costs. Through this partnership the unit costs for lithium-ion batteries were expected to be reduced at the Gigafactory 1 in Nevada thereby giving Tesla the opportunity to significantly increase profit margins. Meanwhile Panasonic could capitalize on the massive contract volume with Tesla thereby increasing its operating profits in the battery cell business. Although this partnership had been very fruitful for both Tesla and Panasonic Tesla was considering whether to go it alone or to partner with other companies for its expansion in China. The company could also consider continuing its partnership with Panasonic and one or more other companies. Two potential partners seemed to be the Chinese CATL and BYD which held the second- and third-largest share in the global lithium battery market (see Exhibit 5). Tesla needed to answer several important questions before making a final decision.What was the overall competitive situation of Tesla and its partnership with Panasonic? How should Tesla and Panasonic strategically manage their partnership to optimize the mutual benefits? How should Tesla overcome challenges in investing in China the world’s largest automotive market? Which battery suppliers other than Panasonic could be potential partners for Tesla in its direct investments in China? Tesla as a young start-up company strove to maintain its leadership as one of the top-selling manufacturers in the established automotive industry as the large incumbents were beginning to make significant investments in the manufacture of EVs and other related sustainable businesses. Overall could Tesla still be successful globally if it were not successful in China?

Ltd. (Nissan) and Mitsubishi Motors (Mitsubishi) was arrested and detained by Tokyo district public prosecutors—this time on the grounds of breach of trust. Instead of greeting 2019 in one of his luxurious homes in Beirut Brazil or France Ghosn found himself in a five-square-metre detention cell in Tokyo Japan. It was a fate that 64-year-old Ghosn had not expected. In 2017 the three companies had produced 10 million cars making the alliance one of the largest automakers in the world. Ghosn was responsible for the turnaround of Nissan in the late 1990s and he was also featured in comic books due to his popularity. He had been preparing an implementation plan that would cement in 2019 the alliance among the three automotive firms into a holding company structure that would make him the overall chair.The 2019 arrest and subsequent indictment of Ghosn a Brazilian-born French citizen with Lebanese blood triggered a great uneasiness among all of the companies’ shareholders and was reflected in erratic trading. It threatened a formula that would have allowed each of the three companies to gain ground in the automotive industry even though Mitsubishi was a late entrant to the alliance and implementation plans were still afoot. The indictment raised many questions about corporate governance reforms in Japan that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had been instituting since 2010. It challenged the relationships not only between Japan and France which had a vested interest in Renault but also between the nations in which Ghosn had grown up: Brazil and Lebanon. Ghosn was not only the celebrated gaijin or foreigner who defied Japan’s long-term employment and keiretsu (informal company group) system but he was also an international figure who rubbed elbows with government leaders especially where automotive companies were located.Relationships were uncertain. What could Nissan do in its corporate governance structure to restore investor trust and prevent the recurrence of another Ghosn scandal? What would happen to the alliance between Nissan Renault and Mitsubishi?The Birth of the Alliance and the Role of Carlos GhosnCentury-old Nissan was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles by 2018. However the stellar performance of the company would not have been possible had it not been able to overcome the financial hurdles of the 1990s. Nissan sought out partners that included Daimler Chrysler and Renault but it was the latter that Nissan partnered with. In 1999 Renault purchased a 36.8 per cent stake in the company. Renault then assigned Ghosn to help revive the firm. Yoshikazu Hanawa the president of Nissan at that time agreed on the condition that Ghosn would come in as a Nissan and not as a Renault executive. Ghosn recalled At the time Nissan was in a desperate situation. The company’s share of the Japanese market had been steadily falling for 26 years. Financially it had been in the red for seven of the eight years through 1999. Interest-bearing debt was more than 2 trillion yen (US$17 billion at current rates). Because of this the release of new models had slowed almost to a stop.Despite the predictions of doomsayers profit margins improved within three years and obligations to creditors were halved under the leadership of Ghosn. From chief operations officer (COO) Ghosn assumed the presidency in 2000 and the chief executive officer (CEO) position in 2001. The year after Renault’s stake at Nissan increased to 44.4 per cent while the latter gained a non-voting 15 per cent equity share of Renault. At this point Renault-Nissan BV was formed to manage this alliance. In 2010 the stake of Renault in Nissan was lowered by 1 per cent.  The cross holding between Nissan and Renault allowed the two auto-manufacturing firms to operate separately with different sets of boards yet gain from manufacturing and distribution synergies. Further the two firms shared in common their research into building electric hybrid and self-autonomous vehicles. That strong alliance brought forth even more conquests for the two companies both together and alone. There was a venture with Germany-based Daimler AG makers of the Mercedes Benz Dongfeng Motor Group in China and Russian automaker AvtoVAZ. A proposed tie-up with General Motors in 2006 did not materialize.Meanwhile in 2015 the French government enacted the Florange Act which effectively granted equity owners of two years or more double voting rights. The Renault board succeeded in limiting the rights of the French government which owned 15 per cent of the company. Under a Restated Alliance Master Agreement Nissan would be allowed to increase its holdings in Renault if the French government interfered in Nissan’s business decisions. The move served to protect the interests of Renault and Nissan and had the effect of further strengthening trust between the two companies.  In 2016 Nissan purchased a 34 per cent interest in financially troubled and scandal-riddled Mitsubishi and Nissan-Mitsubishi BV was formed the year after. Almost immediately Mitsubishi improved financially turning losses into profits benefitting from the management expertise of Nissan-assigned executives and shared operations under the leadership of Ghosn who was named chair of the Mitsubishi board in that year. The tripartite alliance produced and sold 10 million cars annually (see Exhibit 1 for the state of the relationship as of January 2019).Carlos Ghosn the Celebrated Hero at Nissan Ghosn’s entry into the automotive industry was fortuitous. Encouraged by his sister Ghosn joined French tire maker Michelin soon after graduating from the École Polytechnique. He started from the factory floor rose to become a plant manager and then was assigned by the co-owner of the family business to manage the company’s Brazilian plant. His successful turnaround of operations led to his assignment as CEO of the North American division. Again Ghosn was able to revive the business by acquiring Uniroyal Goodrich in the 1990s.In 1996 Ghosn was recruited by Renault. Realizing he would never assume the top position at Michelin—it being a family business—he moved to financially troubled Renault in 1996. He was appointed executive vice-president and in that capacity began to restructure the operations of the French carmaker which had been suffering from the merger with Volvo. In the process of restructuring Renault Ghosn gained the moniker of “Le Cost Killer” for his strategy of cutting costs. When Renault purchased a substantial stake in Nissan in 1999 Ghosn was assigned to revitalize the firm.The rehabilitation of Nissan came in phases. The first phase was dubbed Nissan’s Revival Plan. At this time the 43-year-old Ghosn was bold and determined. “I asked for trust and backed it up by saying that if we did not return to profit after a year I would resign as would my executive committee” he had declared in front of Nissan employees. He formed cross-functional teams to identify solutions and then introduced changes that were considered un-Japanese. Instead of favouring seniority and lifelong employment the new president of Nissan closed unprofitable plants and terminated the employment of 21000 personnel. He then shifted to a merit-based system that disregarded age gender and nationality and brought in foreign managers—initially about 30 executives from Renault most of whom he handpicked. Ghosn also challenged the keiretsu and awarded contracts based on terms favourable to the company.Nissan began to see some changes in profitability in the immediate years that followed and Ghosn did not have to resign as he had promised to do if things did not work out. In 2001 Ghosn was named Nissan’s CEO. He then entered the second phase of the rehabilitation referred to as the Nissan 180 plan. The Nissan 180 goals were to increase sales by one million units increase operating margins by at least 8 per cent and reduce interest-bearing debt to zero by 2015. The company achieved its one million sales goal (see Exhibit 2).In 2005 Ghosn was appointed president and CEO of Renault making him the first CEO to lead two Fortune 500 companies. As Renault CEO he also became the default head of Renault-Nissan BV. The appointment required him to shuttle back and forth between France and Japan and resulted in him wearing different hats; however Ghosn believed that it allowed him to strengthen the ties between the two firms. Meanwhile at Nissan the company proceeded to enter its medium-term plan called Nissan Value-Up. The two-year plan aimed at sustaining performance by further enhancing the company’s product line. This was followed by GT 2012 a five-year plan that focused on long-term performance through growth and trust. However the plans were suspended due to the economic turmoil brought about by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.In response Ghosn who had become president CEO and chairperson of Nissan declared the company in crisis and moved to a recovery plan. Belt-tightening moves were undertaken to conserve cash including a reduction in managers’ salaries and the suspension of dividends (see Exhibit 3). However one investment that Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered vehicles. As a result LEAF the first mass produced electric car was launched in 2010. By then he was president CEO and chairperson of Renault as well.The recovery of Nissan was interrupted by the March 2011 earthquake which affected Nissan’s facilities among others. Immediately after this event Ghosn launched Nissan Power 88 the goal of which was to reach a sustained 8 per cent operating margin and attain an 8 per cent share in the global market. Nissan missed the mark on both targets with only a 6.1 per cent global market share and a 6.9 per cent operating margin. It was reasoned that Nissan had been affected by unfavourable foreign exchange rates. This period saw mass replacements of key executives including Toshiyuki Shiga who was terminated as COO in 2013 when he was unable to shore up the sales of LEAF. Shiga who had joined the company in 1976 was subsequently appointed to the board and served as vice-chair to Ghosn.Despite missing these Power 88 goals Nissan forged ahead and announced its M.O.V.E. 2022 midterm plan. The 2022 goal was to increase global revenues to ¥16.5 trillion generate cumulative free cash flow of ¥2.5 trillion and revive its original goal of 8 per cent sustained operating margin. The company intended to sell one million electric vehicles annually and to continue to introduce new technologies and products through its Nissan Intelligent Mobility strategy (see Exhibit 4).The Allegations and Charges Against Ghosn“If you have not been a villain at a certain point in time you will never be a hero. And the day you are a hero you may become a villain the next day.” Ghosn made this ominous comment when he discussed the Japanese comic book about him.Ghosn’s success at Nissan made him a global celebrity. In 2003 Fortune magazine named him one of the most power people in business. He moved in political and social circles hobnobbed with influential individuals in various governments was interviewed and studied in business schools as an exemplar of good leadership. At the height of his fame he averaged l1 speeches a month spoke on global issues in symposiums such as the World Economic Forum and even carried the Olympic torch during the last leg during the opening of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. A citizen of three countries—Lebanon Brazil and France—Ghosn was a jetsetter. He kept residences in each of these countries and others. There appeared to be no end to what this man who had attained a semi-godlike image could do.From the rise came the fall. As Ghosn prepared to strengthen the current alliance of Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi a report submitted by a whistle-blower—the result of months of covert internal investigation—gave rise to a number of problems. What began as a case of misrepresentation became elevated to a breach of trust. To progress prosecutors needed to prove that “Ghosn violated his official duties that he committed the transgression to enrich himself or a third party and that the conduct financially harmed the company.” A lawyer opined that prosecutors aimed to prove that Ghosn had treated Nissan as his own.The initial allegations stemmed from the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act that Japan’s Financial Services Agency had enacted in 2010 which compelled publicly listed firms to declare the compensation of executives who received at least ¥100 million. In the period April 2010 to March 2015 reports filed with the agency showed that Ghosn had received total compensation of roughly ¥5 billion. When Ghosn then Nissan chairperson was first arrested in November 19 2018 it was alleged that he had underreported his annual income—already high by Japanese standards—by half. If convicted Ghosn could have been sentenced up to 10 years in prison fined ¥10 million or both.Ghosn was said to have been particular about his compensation. He had wanted to receive his compensation in US dollars but Japanese law prohibited disbursement in foreign currency. Further an executive compensation advisor stated that Ghosn did not believe he was adequately paid based on international standards. A global consultancy Willis Towers Watson reported that Japanese executives earned only a tenth of those in the United States or 20–30 per cent of levels in some European countries. The detained ex-chair claimed he had been offered CEO positions by four companies and knew his true market value. Despite the claimed underpayment Ghosn was one of Japan’s top 10 highest-paid executives not just for one year but also for seven consecutive years.  The matter of compensation was a sensitive issue not only at Nissan but also at France-based Renault. It was reported that in 2017 alone Ghosn received ¥735 million from Nissan ¥227 million from Mitsubishi and ¥128 million from Renault. The year before his contract with Renault was at risk due to compensation negotiations. With the backing of the French government he had received a renewed contract up to 2022 after he agreed to cut his remuneration by 30 per cent. His goal was to cement the alliance but to do so he claimed he needed to chair all three companies.In a potential case of embezzlement under criminal law or breach of contract under corporate law Japan’s prosecutors also alleged that Ghosn used company resources to fund family vacations and to finance the purchase renovation and maintenance of homes in Beirut and Rio de Janeiro which he personally used. After a concern raised by company auditors Ghosn considered re-purchasing the homes with personal funds but nothing materialized. Regardless prosecutors claimed that Ghosn as a resident of Japan should have reported the use of corporate property as part of his compensation.Moving from the whistle blower’s report into their own investigation prosecutors asserted that Ghosn transferred to Nissan personal losses he had incurred during the 2008 financial crisis. It appeared that Ghosn’s asset management company had insufficient collateral to cover the ¥1.85 billion paper loss when the yen appreciated during the crisis. It was then that Ghosn transferred the potential liability to Nissan. However due to some resistance and following notification by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission the contracts were returned to the asset management company. Finally it was alleged that the company had paid out consulting fees supposedly for the management of charitable activities amounting to tens of millions of yen to Ghosn’s elder sister. Records did not appear to show the sister’s contribution to Nissan. This same sister was also said to be living in Nissan’s Brazilian property. In this regard Nissan intended to file a case in Brazil against Ghosn and his sister for a supposedly fraudulent contract.Ghosn’s DefenseOn that fateful day in November 2018 Ghosn was escorted by Japanese authorities from his private plane which had just landed in Haneda Airport to a Tokyo detention cell. It was eight weeks before Ghosn was allowed to publicly defend himself. Confined in a sparsely furnished cell he was allowed to speak only to his attorney and embassy officials. Even before his public appearance Ghosn had already asserted that the allegations against him were false.  On January 8 2019 Ghosn was given the opportunity to speak publicly before being brought back to his detention cell to await trial. The procedure required him to address only the court without speaking to his lawyer or family. Due to the language barrier the entire procedure took two hours—four times longer than usual. Nonetheless Ghosn remained composed and addressed the various allegations.First he explained that there was no malice in the transfer of his contracts from his asset management corporation to Nissan. He indicated that this had been a temporary solution while he sought to find collateral needed to buffer the devaluation of the yen against the dollar. Further he claimed Nissan did not incur financial losses since the contract was returned to the asset management corporation. The foreign exchange contracts arose from his compensation in yen even though most of his expenses were in dollars.Ghosn averred that all his compensation from Nissan was disclosed and that any item not disclosed referred to hopeful and not agreed upon future payments. He had entrusted Greg Kelly with the legal management of his compensation and though Ghosn maintained he was abreast of his market rate as a CEO (since he received offers from four major companies) his lawyer Motonari Otsuru former head of special investigations at the Tokyo Prosecutors’ Office stated that the amount of compensation was undetermined. This was because it referred to retirement benefits and Ghosn had sought the counsel of internal and external lawyers regarding his remuneration.  Throughout his speech Ghosn reiterated his love for Nissan and Japan and enumerated all his positive contributions to both. He shared how Nissan’s performance had improved considerably under his leadership and how Nissan’s success also benefited Japan.Hiroto Saikawa Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NissanWhen the alliance purchased a 34 per cent share in Mitsubishi with Ghosn as chairperson Ghosn relinquished the Nissan CEO position to Hiroto Saikawa a Japanese executive who had risen from within the ranks. He was seen as a “loyal right-hand man to Ghosn” credited with negotiating a revised agreement with Nissan following the Florange Act. Saikawa served as co-CEO until he officially assumed the position in April 2017.However Ghosn was said to have been displeased with continued poor performance of the firm. In addition during the leadership of Saikawa Nissan had to recall 12 million vehicles due to improper inspection. It was believed that Ghosn distanced himself from the problem; instead of returning from a family vacation when informed of the scandal he opted to stay in Western Japan with his family. Saikawa was left to take full responsibility.  Saikawa on the other hand was careful not to criticize Ghosn but did express surprise that the lapse in protocol was not discovered sooner despite transparent operations instituted by Ghosn. Saikawa then agreed to return part of his salary as did other senior executives as atonement for the inspection scandal. This scandal haunted Nissan as another round of recalls also for improper inspection hit the company in December 2018.In November 2018 it was Saikawa’s turn to distance himself from Ghosn when the latter was arrested initially on the grounds of misrepresentation. In an official statement by Nissan Saikawa relayed that he had immediately called for an internal investigation of Ghosn’s misconduct and on this basis called for the ouster of the chairperson and his trusted associate Kelly from the Nissan board. “Beyond being sorry I feel great disappointment frustration despair indignation and resentment” Saikawa was quoted as saying. Informed of the covert investigation on Ghosn about a month before the arrest Saikawa claimed that Nissan’s United States operations were a negative legacy of Ghosn due to declining profitability. In January 2019 Nissan announced the retrenchment of 700 workers in that United States following the removal of 1000 workers in Mexico.Saikawa also made constant reference to the “dark side” of the Ghosn era and was unsure whether Ghosn was “a charismatic figure or a tyrant.” He emphasized that the recovery of Nissan was attributable to many hardworking individuals rather than just one.  Notwithstanding these comments Saikawa recommended that investigation should continue to include all other geographic areas of Nissan’s operations. He further contended that the three-way alliance undervalued Nissan shares but the companies needed to collaborate to weather the Ghosn scandal. Nonetheless he was adamantly opposed to permanently cementing the relationship between the three automakers and was vocal about reducing the control of Renault over Nissan. Ghosn who was subsequently allowed to talk to the press after his prolonged detainment believed the precise timing of his ouster had to do with his plans to further strengthen and cement the current alliance. However Saikawa had earlier told media in a news conference that followed Ghosn’s arrest “Do not take this as a coup d’état.” As the current CEO of Nissan Saikawa seemed the most natural replacement for Ghosn as chairperson of the company. His failure to act as an independent leader did not work in his favour however and his signature did appear in documents with prosecutors on retirement compensation and non-compete agreements. However to the surprise of many Saikawa indicated in January 2019 that he would step down as CEO after instituting corporate governance reforms. The two-year term of all board directors ended in June 2019.Replacing GhosnOf the three companies involved in the alliance Mitsubishi was the first to make an announcement about Ghosn’s replacement. Days after Ghosn was arrested the board of Mitsubishi unanimously removed Ghosn as chairperson and appointed its current CEO Osamu Masuko as acting chairperson. Renault was more circumspect preferring not to fire Ghosn pending results of an investigation. Chief Operating Officer (COO) Thierry Bollore who was being groomed to take over the CEO post in 2022 was appointed acting head on November 21 2018 and was confirmed as CEO only on January 24 2019 a day after Ghosn resigned from his post. Appointed on the same day as chair of the board was Jean-Dominique Senard the largest shareholder of Renault who was the first non-family CEO of Michelin.Nissan’s board was in fact the first to fire Ghosn as chairperson but the board had been unable to appoint his replacement during the November 22 2018 board meeting. On December 17 2018 the board again met but failed to name a successor. It would appear that the committee of three outside directors formed during the November board meeting was unable to arrive at an acceptable replacement. They also could not agree to recommend Saikawa as provisional chairperson.Replacing Ghosn on the Nissan board appeared critical. Before the ouster of Ghosn and Kelly Nissan’s nine-member board had been composed of four foreigners and five Japanese citizens (see Exhibit 5). It was a good balance considering the 43.4 per cent ownership of Renault in Nissan. Consequently the preferred replacements of Renault were individuals from the French side. On the other hand Nissan preferred a Japanese chairperson coming from among of its current directors. The candidates identified were Saikawa Executive Vice-President Hideyuki Sakamoto and Director Toshiyuki Shiga.Under the restated agreement between Renault and Nissan the former was given the right to select Nissan’s top executives and therefore the replacement for Ghosn. Since the business decision would affect Nissan the French government which owned 15 per cent of Renault was precluded from casting its vote. Should the French government interfere Nissan had a unilateral right under Japanese law to increase its holdings in Renault to 25 per cent and cancel Renault’s voting rights altogether. This would render Renault’s investment unprotected. After the December board meeting Renault twice asked Nissan to hold a special shareholders’ meeting. The request was granted only after Renault announced permanent replacements for Ghosn as CEO and chairperson—both of whom committed to restoring “trust” within the alliance. Had Nissan not responded within eight weeks Renault had the right under Japanese law to petition the courts to force a meeting. The special shareholders’ meeting to decide on the replacement for Ghosn or abolish the board chair post was scheduled for April 2019.The Future of the Nissan–Renault–Mitsubishi AllianceThe almost 20-year-old alliance between Renault and Nissan was regarded as a great symbol of French and Japanese cooperation. Ghosn was expected to make an announcement in March 2019 regarding a more permanent alliance and this would have been a grand celebration. At less than 8 per cent of the market the current business relationship between the three companies was already considered a leader in the automotive industry. Therefore it would be difficult for both parties if each were to compete separately since they would each be competing from weaker positions. For instance the combined budget of about ¥800 billion for research and development would be greatly affected considering Japanese rival Toyota worked with a ¥ trillion budget.Both countries needed to ensure that the right replacement for Ghosn was selected to maintain the stability of the current relationship that had already included Mitsubishi. However any action had to be taken immediately as competitors wanted to get a lead in newer technology vehicles which would upset Nissan’s long-term strategies captured in M.O.V.E. 2022. Google was already leading the field of autonomous driving.Without Ghosn considered the orchestrator of the current alliance at the helm distrust appeared to prevail. The French government had continually pressed Nissan to share information about the investigation but the latter seemed hesitant even if there was a commitment to do so in line with the alliance’s charter of transparency trust and mutual respect. Nissan had been giving summaries but Renault was interested in a full report. Renault like Nissan and Mitsubishi had also been conducting its own investigations on compensation. Nissan and Mitsubishi aimed to recover compensation paid to Ghosn that was unauthorized by Nissan-Mitsubishi BV.On January 25 2019 Renault’s chair had his first official conversation with Saikawa and together they agreed to rebuild a climate of trust and cooperation.

A novel coronavirus had sparked a global pandemic of COVID-19 and widespread lockdown of non-essential economic activities to avoid contagion. However for Harman Singh and his team at Yuno Learning Global Private Limited (Yuno Learning) not much had changed with regard to their work.Yuno Learning one of India’s leading live online training platforms for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) operated in a fully remote working mode. It held teaching sessions and preparatory tests online solicited customers online through various digital marketing channels and held work meetings over conference calls. Hence Yuno Learning did not have to close business during the lockdown. Further while the global health crisis was threatening to derail the economy in many countries and negatively affect employment online education was expected to see an upsurge as a result of a renewed focus on upskilling in a downward market.Website visits had indeed increased for Yuno Learning since the lockdown started in India; however course sales had stagnated. But this was not a new challenge; Singh had already been facing that challenge before the crisis hit the world. Yuno Learning among its peers already had an impressive website visit rate thanks to a broad-based marketing strategy the firm had adopted early to build brand awareness. The firm had also made efforts to attract leads from various affiliate sources. However as was the case with every other website only a percentage of the visits and leads converted to sales. Singh needed to solve that problem. How could he ensure that the maximum number of those who reached Yuno Learning through organic or paid marketing subscribed to the IELTS test preparation courses?ABOUT THE INDUSTRY: ONLINE EDUCATIONValued at US$101.1 billion in 2019 the education sector in India was one of the largest and fastest growing in the world. The sector was buoyed by India’s large population of youth projected to be the world’s largest population of youth in 2020. At the same time the government made education a fundamental right in 2010 creating a massive market for public and private providers of education for youth. India was also home to one of the largest labour forces globally which created a thriving market for professional training and certification. In 2018 the government of India allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the education sector expanding the market to encourage international players to enter India’s education space.Online education consisted of web-based distance learning through live or pre-recorded resources. It became popular in India as a result of the country’s affordable Internet rates (one of the most affordable globally) increased security in digital payments and widespread use of smartphones. The government of India actively encouraged digital adoption and digital education particularly in the rural areas through various policies such as Digital India e-Vidya Vahini Vision Digital India and SWAYAM. The result was that e-learning in India was projected to grow from $247 million in 2016 to $1.96 billion by 2021—making it the second-largest e-learning market in the world catering to 9.5 million users and growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44 per cent. In 2019 there were 3500 educational start-ups in India catering to primary and secondary education through online tuitions and supplementary training professional skilling and certifications and training for competitive examinations (see Exhibit 1).With a CAGR projected at 50.84 per cent the online test preparation segment was the fastest-growing segment in India’s educational industry projected to reach $90.75 billion by 2024. The segment included private and foreign players notably BYJU’s Pearson Education and Kaplan Inc. These businesses provided training for the Indian civil service and provided other screening examinations for government and public-sector jobs common admission tests for business schools medical and engineering entrance examinations and international screening examinations such as Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) the Graduate Management Admission Test and IELTS. Approximately 30 million Indians attended competitive examinations with more than 50 per cent appearing for the civil service and other government entrance examinations.IELTS TRAINING: THE GATEWAY TO INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONHome to the world’s largest youth population India featured prominently in international education. Driven by the competition at home many meritorious students sought to complete their education abroad. In 2019 India was among the world’s largest sources of outbound students second only to China. The top three destinations were the United States Canada and Australia followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.IELTS was conducted by IDP Education Limited an international education service and the British Council an international organization for cultural relations and education. The test of English language proficiency was compulsory for those who sought to migrate to English-speaking nations for education or work. IELTS scores were accepted in most countries that had English as the first language such as the United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand and the United States contributing to the popularity of the test among aspiring migrants to these countries. IELTS training alone was estimated to be a $150 million industry in India in 2019.The IELTS industry was highly fragmented with roughly 5 per cent of the industry falling into the organized sector. There were three types of providers: (1) local and regional coaching centres that delivered in-class training to students (2) online training institutes and (3) distance education institutes that provided educational materials for self-study. Some of these institutes such as the British Council Jamboree Education Private Limited Fateh Education Consulting Private Limited Triumphant Institute of Management Education Private Limited and Edwise International had a presence across India and even had branches outside the country. Others were well known at a regional level such as Megamind Consultants Private Limited and Manya Education Private Limited in north India and Camford Academy and IELTS Academy in the south. Start-ups also featured prominently in this sector with some of the popular companies being Magoosh and TheScoreBooster.com.Typical customers for IELTS coaching were students or professionals who were price-sensitive and wanted value for money. Customers generally subscribed to a preparatory course two months before they planned to appear for the examination. The in-class model of education usually attracted young students whereas working professionals preferred the more flexible options of online classes or self-paced study. Students also opted for the free media such as tutorials on YouTube free courses on Udemy and Coursera and free IELTS materials available on educational websites.The IELTS training industry also attracted students from other countries such as Bangladesh Malaysia Vietnam Sri Lanka Iran Turkey and Brazil.SINGH AND THE INCEPTION OF YUNO LEARNINGEducational innovations and entrepreneurship had always fascinated Singh. While undertaking his master of science in computer science at North Carolina State University in 2000–2002 Singh was the president of the university’s entrepreneurs’ network. It was also during this time that Singh developed an interest in the field of online education.In 2002 soon after he graduated Singh launched his first venture Sikhya Solutions which provided e-learning solutions to educational institutions such as Duke University North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina System. In 2006 Singh launched AuthorSTREAM.com (AuthorSTREAM) a free platform for sharing PowerPoint presentations which became the second largest platform of its kind. In 2007 AuthorSTREAM became a part of Singh’s next venture WizIQ a cloud-based platform for hosting online courses. In 2015 WizIQ was ranked among the world’s top five learning management systems with over 70000 courses catering to more than 4.5 million customers. By 2017 WizIQ had partnered with Microsoft Corporation to provide online teaching technology and services to the government of India for the SWAYAM initiative.In an interview with UpGrad in 2017 Singh saidThe most fundamental question one has to answer is why do they even want to be an entrepreneur. There are different reasons for different people. It could be the opportunity staring [you] in your face and you just don’t want to let it go. Jeff Bezos started like that. The other is that you really want to make a dent in the universe as Steve Jobs puts it and you get on an activist kind of mission to do that. Another is you just want to be your own boss and you want to start your own business. . . . For me it was definitely the more activist kind where can I really make a huge dent in the universe. And there I narrowed down to education because education has that possibility. . . . I was always interested in the education industry. I love teaching. I was a tutor in my career; I was a teacher at several stages. . . . I think I’m a good teacher. . . . And I was in a unique position as a technologist. [At] the same time I saw an opportunity. So . . . several things got together and [there was a] kind of a voice inside [that] said “This is my space.”As WizIQ was scaling new heights in online education Singh’s attention moved to a new opportunity. While on a trip to his hometown Chandigarh he noticed a surge in IELTS training advertisements indicating a booming market with possibilities for business innovation. Singh noticed that while IELTS training institutes were plentiful the presence of online training was relatively low. This absence of online training was a challenge for the aspirants many of whom were working professionals and could not make time for the regular classroom. Students from small towns were also compromised because city-based training centres were inaccessible to them. What was available online almost entirely depended on recorded video lectures limiting the scope for real-time problem-solving and interaction with the faculty members.Singh felt that there was a chance to make a difference by offering IELTS aspirants in India live online English language training which at that time was provided by only one other company in India IELTS Ninja. In November 2018 Singh launched Yuno Learning—a dedicated platform for delivering live online training for IELTS examination.YUNO LEARNING: STRUCTURE CULTURE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMERSSingh’s previous experiences in the software services business had taught him that often firms failed because of a lack of coordination between the marketing sales and product teams. Thus Singh kept the structure at Yuno Learning relatively flat facilitating interdepartmental coordination and flexible decision-making. He eliminated the slow email mode of communication and moved all discussions and coordination activities to Slack a popular online business communication tool. For daily internal meetings he implemented the use of Zoom meetings and Skype and had everyone in the business trained on using these tools.The core teams consisted of the instructors responsible for the design and delivery of the classes student evaluation personalized mentoring and demo sessions; the marketing team responsible for increasing traffic and leads (potential customers website visitors or others who shared their contact details for product enquiry); and the sales team responsible for converting leads and prospects into sales. The firm also used the services of a technical support team responsible for designing and maintaining platforms and providing information technology support to employees and students. That team and a finance team were outsourced operations (see Exhibit 2).Product Offering at Yuno Learning: Live Online ClassesYuno Learning used Zoom’s meetings and webinar platform for delivering live online classes and it used Google’s suite of products for other operational necessities. Students could select between a four-week focused course on writing and speaking skills or a six-week comprehensive course (see Exhibit 3). For a meaningful learning experience students needed to be equipped with stable high-speed Internet and functional English speaking and writing skills. The student base at Yuno Learning was almost entirely made up of individuals from India. Still there had been students from the United Kingdom and Dubai as well.Yuno Learning offered certain key value propositions to its customers. These included separate live training for each of the IELTS components—writing speaking reading and listening—which helped the student grow proficient in each area; recorded classes for revisiting the lectures at the student’s convenience; and more than 100 free practice tests. To ensure a comfortable live classroom experience and individualized attention to every student each group was limited to 10 students. In addition there were one-on-one live mentoring sessions for feedback on progress and speaking practice. All instructors had at least 10 years of experience in training for competitive examinations such as IELTS GRE and TOEFL.The live classes ran in four batches: morning afternoon evening and night all on weekdays. An instructor typically taught two batches in a day. Most students preferred to join the 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. classes. In the one-on-one live mentoring sessions students practised their speaking skills and received feedback from the trainers. Singh himself conducted many of these mentoring sessions.Apart from individualized mentoring Yuno Learning fostered peer learning. Students in a batch were connected to one another through WhatsApp groups where students could share queries and have their doubts clarified. Efforts were made to keep classes fun updated and personalized curated to the needs of the audience. Singh described Yuno Learning’s approach:The first thing you need to have in mind when trying to capture your modern learners’ attention is this: Don’t make them wait. This means you have to make your point right away; otherwise they will get distracted and you’ll lose them. . . . Grab their attention by explaining exactly how the e-learning course will improve their individual performance and how it will benefit their personal or professional lives. In addition make it brief; modern learners don’t have time to lose so tell them what they need and want to know and nothing more. This goes for the rest of e-learning course too; use bite-sized chunks of e-learning content to get your message across include only the most relevant data and consider using infographics which are very popular among modern learners as they make information very easy to grasp.Once a course was completed for a batch the instructor for that batch had a week off. During this week the instructor conducted demonstration (demo) sessions on the website for new prospects clarifying the design and content of the program and teaching a sample topic. Prospective students were likely to subscribe for a course if they liked the instructor who provided the demo and they typically preferred to take the course with that same instructor. At the end of each week all of the prospects who had newly subscribed to the course were assigned to one or more batches to be taught by the same instructor for the next four to six weeks.In addition to their regular pay the instructors received incentives based on the number of prospects who subscribed to the course after attending the instructor’s demo. This system encouraged the instructors to continuously improve their teaching and it provided the instructors with immediate feedback on the efficacy of their demos.Classes at Yuno Learning were highly rated for their interactive nature flexibility and individualized attention to students (see Exhibit 4).Marketing Channels at Yuno LearningThe marketing and sales teams were involved in attracting prospects and facilitating their journey on the platform to a subscription (see Exhibit 5). Paid marketing mainly consisted of Google Ads (contributing to about 46 per cent of the subscriptions) affiliate marketing with aggregator platforms such as Sulekha (26 per cent) and Facebook advertisements. Yuno Learning’s Facebook page had 8600 “likes” and its Facebook Group on IELTS preparation had over 2000 members.Content writers from Yuno Learning regularly responded to IELTS-related queries on the question-and-answer platform Quora. Content from the live classes was also posted on YouTube and Facebook. The paid and organic social media marketing efforts yielded another 17 per cent of the subscriptions. Organic search—Google page ranking referral traffic and direct searches—contributed to 8 per cent of the subscriptions. Organic marketing efforts also included the frequent blogs posted on the Yuno Learning website on various topics related to IELTS.Although Yuno Learning experimented with multiple marketing channels Singh decided that in keeping with prevailing industry practices the marketing team would reduce the focus on those channels where the conversion ratio (i.e. the number of subscriptions in proportion to the generated leads) would be less than 5 per cent.Multiple Funnels: The Customer Journey at Yuno LearningOnce a visitor reached Yuno Learning’s website the most direct path for them was to read the product descriptions and subscribe to one of the two paid courses. However the relative newness of the concept of live online classes in the IELTS space made it unlikely that visitors would readily subscribe without a demo or trial session. Hence Yuno Learning made provisions for trial sessions demos and other free content that was made available on the website with a free user account (see Exhibit 6).To attend a demo the visitor needed to create a free user account and then register for the session. On registration the visitor (now called a prospect) immediately received a welcome email from Yuno Learning detailing the offerings. The prospect also received a counselling call from a member of the sales team who gathered the prospect’s requirements and provided them with instructions for joining the demo session. The sales team also discussed with the prospect their preference for generic or academic IELTS problem areas for the curriculum and convenient schedules for joining live classes. The sales team observed the demos. At the end of the session the instructor briefed the sales team about the prospects who seemed promising. The sales team followed up with the promising prospects reassessing their requirements and matching them to the offering that best suited their needs. Those who subscribed for the paid courses were assigned to the next new batch.Yuno Learning also offered unlimited access to free practice tests to those who subscribed with a free user account. Because the IELTS syllabus seldom changed the battery of practice tests was created with a one-time effort from instructors—an investment with multiple returns. Free practice tests were a popular search online and this strategy was adopted in the hope of bringing search traffic to the website. Users of free practice tests were also contacted with a remarketing pitch for Yuno Learning’s paid courses.Before the demo sessions became the practice Yuno Learning had experimented with other forms of customer engagement. The paid courses were preceded by a free class format; prospects who established a free account with Yuno Learning were offered unlimited free live classes with no hidden costs. However the content of these free classes was limited to only a few topics from the syllabus. Those who enrolled in the free classes were connected to an automated system using emails text messages and WhatsApp. The system sent regular communication with reminders about classes and their times. During the class instructors were responsible for convincing the students of the value of the paid course. Prospects keen on purchase were approached by the sales team to close the deal while prospects who still seemed undecided became a part of the remarketing efforts through WhatsApp text messages Google Ads and emails. While this marketing strategy resulted in subscriptions Singh wanted to evaluate a few more strategies before finalizing the best funnel mix. Thus in mid-2019 the free classes were replaced by a free trial format.The free trials arose from Yuno Learning’s temporary experiment with open classes. Rather than assign students to classes in batches each open class was a stand-alone in terms of content and difficulty level making it possible for students to join a course at any point in time. The prospect of peer-to-peer learning was low in these classes because the students and their capacities were different in each class but the open class concept offered flexibility to learners who wanted to start immediately or had to miss a few classes midway. Yuno Learning offered a limited experience of these open classes as free trials allowing interested prospects to join two ongoing live open classes for free. For their access to continue beyond the trial period prospects had to pay for the full course. The open classes were however not successful because of scheduling issues and the instructors’ challenge in teaching an audience that changed daily. Participants also reported low engagement in the sessions due to the lack of peer-to-peer learning. Therefore open classes were discontinued after a short while in favour of the batch system.In mid-2019 the marketing team noticed that keywords related to IELTS mock tests were getting good traffic in Google Search. This meant that prospects were sometimes looking for not classes but practice for IELTS exams. Sensing vibrant traffic here Singh structured a new mock test-only course. This course consisted of four comprehensive mock tests for IELTS evaluated by Yuno Learning’s instructors and a live four-hour discussion with an instructor to clarify doubts and discuss scope for improvement. When prospects registered for the mock test course they were taken to a regular demo class to get a feel for the live discussion with an instructor.The initiative looked promising initially but as more and more prospects were consulted it became evident that the mock test market was flooded with free or low-cost mock tests. Also students cared little about the quality of the mock tests and looked for heavily discounted prices. Yuno Learning could match these prices only if it dropped the quality of its evaluation and decreased the number of evaluated attempts. The consultation would also have to be reduced from four hours to one hour at best. Singh was not willing to compromise on quality so the mock test-only course was taken down in early 2020. The team decided to hold the product until the market seemed ready for it. Free practice tests however were kept available on the website to draw organic traffic.Apart from those who engaged actively on the platform a significant flow of visitors came to the Yuno Learning platform but did not subscribe to any of the paid or free offerings (visit and drop). Other visitors would establish a free account on the website but never return for further engagement (register and drop). Then there were prospects with free accounts who expressed interest in a demo but did not attend it (interest and drop). There were also those who dropped out after attending the demo choosing not to subscribe (attend and drop). Some prospects attempted the free practice tests but did not subscribe to the paid offerings (practice and drop). Finally there were also cases although infrequent where customers subscribed to paid classes but did not attend them (subscribe and drop). Yuno Learning continued to engage these prospects and visitors through remarketing employing various channels such as emails WhatsApp paid remarketing advertisements and text messages (see Exhibit 7).By 2020 the live online IELTS coaching industry had seen many new entrants. Other players in this domain offered differentiated features such as a one-on-one classroom model at Mindmine Global and Simpli English and unlimited live classes and one-month trial access at E2Language (see Exhibit 8).THE DILEMMA: THE MOST EFFICIENT CHANNEL AND FUNNELThe core team met over video conference in April 2020. The pandemic seemed to weigh on everyone’s mind as the IELTS examination was postponed or cancelled in over 70 countries. When the conversation returned to work Singh notedThe COVID crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. Foreign travel seems out of the question for another quarter of a year at least. What is worse there will be a psychological impact of this crisis on people planning to move abroad for work or education. The virus has shown that countries worldwide developing or developed are equally vulnerable to such a pandemic; this might worry people about venturing away from home in a foreign land. At the same time economic turbulence might turn people to plan for alternatives. Lockdown gives them more free time than usual to invest in education. It is time we pace up our activities plug the holes in our strategies and ensure that we do not stray from the target due to the turbulence.Sunil from the sales team suggested “To pace up the straightforward way is to bring more people to the demo sessions. Leads have been up since we tied up with the affiliate firms. Sales have flattened as I can see but that could be due to the COVID crisis. I feel the affiliate model is working well for us.”Komal Sunil’s teammate agreed adding “However we need more hands if we must take care of all the leads we are receiving. I wish there was a way to know if a lead is actually planning a purchase or just browsing around but I guess we are helpless there.”Neil from the marketing team put his view forward:We have seen the organic direct and advertisement traffic convert better than the traffic from the other channels till now. Last year most of the students forwarded by the affiliate were interested only in local classroom coaching. This year amid COVID-19 I have a hunch that the leads from the new affiliates will be more open to online coaching. But we are yet to see this in results.Vinita the most experienced instructor offered her perspective:Every now and then in the demo classes I am finding many students have an erratic Internet connection. Even after all the preparation and effort the Internet connection is creating a poor experience for the students. Another problem is that some students are not able to keep up with the curriculum because their English is too weak. Around 10 per cent of our students take a refund and leave either because of technical issues or because they cannot keep up with the curriculum.“The first problem may have to do with customers who depend on low bandwidth mobile Internet” Neil observed. “Initially I believed that the low bandwidth was related to the location of the prospect. However the CRM [customer relationship management] reports show that such problems may surface even in metropolitan areas.”The team spent an hour brainstorming various solutions. They noted that the affiliate model was generating about 26 per cent of the total leads so more money could be invested there. The sales team needed more people to keep up with the additional traffic. On average each sales personnel made 20–22 calls a day each call lasting over 15 minutes to resolve queries and counsel the prospect about future directions. This led to backlogs. The chances of converting a lead who was approached after three days went down by 70 per cent.The sales team suggested that when a prospect dropped out after a demo a provision should be available to give the prospect a few ongoing paid sessions free of cost. This would help to convince the prospects of the value of the classes. The instructors observed that this practice would however affect the batch dynamics with new people requiring extra attention mainly because they needed to be convinced of the value of a subscription. Instructors recommended continuing with the practice of sharing occasional live sessions on Facebook and directing prospects there for an experience.The marketing team believed that while Google Ads was still a significant marketing channel for the business it was necessary to invest in other channels so that the overreliance on Google Ads could be mitigated. Although the organic channel looked promising it was a long-term wager for the business and would take another one to two years to generate a decent volume of prospects.As Singh went through the recommendations he noticed one trend. As usually happened in start-ups the early months of the operations were spent experimenting. The core team tried multiple channels to engage customers based on popular industry practices and patterns noticed in customer behaviour. Many of these solutions were intuitively appealing but a few of them were difficult to continue unless more resources were invested in them. While the innovator in Singh wanted to experiment his founder’s acumen told him that since resources were limited (Yuno Learning was presently operating on seed funding) it was essential that the money went to strengthening the route that earned the maximum dividend. He wondered if it was time to take stock and get rid of all channels with a conversion ratio of less than 5 per cent.As everyone fell quiet Singh concludedIt seems that we have tried a number of ways to bring people to our website and I would not be surprised if each has led to some form or other of customer engagement. In the early months our focus was on building word-of-mouth and awareness for our brand so we went all out when it came to engaging with customers. However every prospect we bring in imposes a responsibility on us to engage the prospect in the best possible way and to generate a positive customer experience. We must identify the workflow that smooths our operations and best engages the prospects. From now on we want to invest only in quality traffic and focus on those leads that have a high likelihood of conversion. While approaching the problem with a broad brush has its own merits it is time we discover who are worth our time and money.As he pondered the data the choice that prevailed in Singh’s mind was that of quality over quantity. How could he ensure that the people who reached Yuno Learning were valuable prospects who subscribed to the course?EXHIBIT 1: SEGMENTS IN THE ONLINE EDUCATION MARKET IN INDIANote: CAGR = compound annual growth rate; US$1 = ₹75.72 as of April 30 2020.Source: Netscribes (India) Pvt.

However recognizing that Johnsen could push her appeal further and slow the progress on starting the project the committee decided to offer Johnsen a senior director position at the advertised level of EX-02 but still as a temporary secondment.Johnsen saw the committee’s decision as a victory. She was confident she could demonstrate her value over the year and that the director general Landon Kokomo would make her position indeterminate without question. There was also the possibility that she could use the temporary position to parachute into a permanent position at an even higher grade.In September 2019 Johnsen submitted the papers finalizing her leave of absence from her current permanent position. She hesitated for a few moments before signing the last of the documents—she was voluntarily giving up security in a job she found familiar and enjoyed. But she reminded herself her performance appraisals had always been good and although she was giving up a secure position the leave guaranteed her an equivalent-level job with the federal service upon her return in case the new position did not suit her career goals. Besides she was confident that she would surpass expectations as she had always done before.She had successfully navigated the temporary contract process when she first started working for Public Services. If necessary she could do so again.Success for JohnsenTransition into the new position went smoothly for Johnsen. With her raise Johnsen was able to afford a new condominium in a boutique development in downtown Ottawa Canada’s capital city. Her hours were long but she found the work on the science and technology project even more fulfilling than she had expected. She enjoyed the challenge of establishing new processes such as building team structure hiring staff and launching new projects. She also enjoyed being in the milieu of science and technology. The challenges went beyond how to ventilate a building or improve the efficiency of heating and air conditioning. Instead she was having to consider how to use store and dispose of chemicals. Ventilation systems needed to accommodate storage of everything from viruses to chemicals to waste. The job’s one-year term was long enough for Johnsen to establish the specifications for “greening” one of the research laboratories at the National Research Council. It was an older laboratory with an historical footprint. Her specifications if followed would preserve the historical footprint meet the required standards for environmental impact and still complete the project within budget—almost unheard of in the federal civil service.The team Johnsen had put together included some talented people. One team member Kristof Warden was an architectural technician who specialized in adaptive reuse of older buildings. Several other people had also been actively recruiting him but Johnsen convinced him to join her team where he would have scope to grow. His ability to translate Johnsen’s ideas into plans were largely responsible for the success of the project with the National Research Council.Johnsen’s performance review for the duration of the one-year position was coming up within weeks. She had not found another permanent position during this term but she was confident that her current position would be made indeterminate. She had met all required goals for the year and success with the changes in this particular laboratory would provide the science and technology project with a green laboratory that boasted a preserved historical footprint.Concern for KokomoKokomo had also been preparing for Johnsen’s evaluation. He had assigned her a project with enough challenges to engage her but with minimal risk that she would step outside her scope of authority. Kokomo ensured that the project was located in Ottawa where he could supervise Johnsen’s progress closely. There were days when he regretted that choice; he felt stretched meeting his own goals let alone constantly monitoring Johnsen’s work. This was not how he imagined spending the last few months before retirement.Initial feedback from people involved in Johnsen’s project had been good. She had built a solid team and her casual candid approach was serving her well with negotiations. Kokomo was concerned however when Warden accepted Johnsen’s offer over those of other team leaders. Warden was an asset to the department and Kokomo wanted to be sure that he remained with the project for the long term. However it did not take long before Warden came to Kokomo with concerns. Johnsen was taking credit for Warden’s work claimed Warden. Even more upsetting she was holding him back from his full potential. She would often assign Warden menial tasks and suggest how he could do the things he specialized at differently. Kokomo had heard rumours that Warden was looking for work on a different project. Kokomo was becoming accustomed to the high turnover rate associated with Johnsen’s working style which did not seem to be improving. However losing a team member as valuable as Warden would be an unpleasant experience. Employees at the National Research Council laboratory had also complained to Kokomo about Johnsen’s behaviour. Apparently she was continuing in her tendency to be proprietary about buildings she was working on and had begun to treat the laboratory employees as though they were her employees working in her laboratory. The laboratory supervisor threatened to pull his building out of the project if Johnsen were not replaced. Retrofitting plans were in place and would come in under budget if realized as proposed but none of it would succeed without the co-operation of the laboratory supervisors.The final challenge seemed to be Johnsen’s pursuit of perfection. She acted as though she knew she was being closely observed and treated her secondment to the EX-02 position as a test she intended to pass. Johnsen would allow nothing to go wrong under her watch. She was unable to accept failure or anything less than perfection as the end product. However her team members often felt demoralized. They argued that their work was innovative and required advancing with less-than-perfect proposals in some cases. This was the only way to learn about what worked and what did not work. But Johnsen was unsupportive of their efforts and ideas unless the promise of the project was the outcome Johnsen expected. She pushed the team hard often leaving staff members feeling crushed by her criticism and warnings of failure.The ReviewOn a warm September 2020 morning Johnsen dressed carefully for her virtual performance review. The COVID-19 pandemic that had been raging across the country and the world since earlier that year had made the working environment particularly challenging. However Johnsen had mastered virtual meetings telephone calls and distanced on-site reviews. She was feeling confident about the next step in her career. Johnsen’s confidence evaporated however when she logged into the virtual meeting room and noticed that a human resources director had logged into the meeting with Kokomo. She was also concerned that Kokomo seemed to be avoiding Johnsen’s gaze although it could have been only the camera angle.After everyone was settled Kokomo looked up at Johnsen and announced “Mattie I’m going to be brief and direct and then we can discuss your options. We are not renewing your secondment. With restructuring through the pandemic your previous position no longer exists but we will support you in finding work at your previous level of pay in another department.”,9.0,"[{""start"":1489,""end"":1496,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1154,""end"":1161,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1147,""end"":1161,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1385,""end"":1392,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2688,""end"":2695,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2712,""end"":2719,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3479,""end"":3486,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3883,""end"":3890,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4119,""end"":4126,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4336,""end"":4343,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4849,""end"":4856,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5238,""end"":5245,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5552,""end"":5559,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5371,""end"":5378,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6193,""end"":6200,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5795,""end"":5802,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6429,""end"":6436,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6738,""end"":6745,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6970,""end"":6977,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7144,""end"":7151,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7526,""end"":7533,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7628,""end"":7635,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7799,""end"":7806,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8028,""end"":8035,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8174,""end"":8181,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8402,""end"":8409,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8514,""end"":8521,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8537,""end"":8543,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1540,""end"":1543,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1558,""end"":1561,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1740,""end"":1743,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1956,""end"":1959,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2077,""end"":2080,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2408,""end"":2411,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2385,""end"":2388,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2195,""end"":2198,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2113,""end"":2116,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2029,""end"":2032,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1924,""end"":1927,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1898,""end"":1901,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2310,""end"":2313,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2359,""end"":2362,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2469,""end"":2472,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2442,""end"":2445,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2596,""end"":2599,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2702,""end"":2705,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2536,""end"":2539,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2825,""end"":2828,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2849,""end"":2852,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2950,""end"":2953,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2932,""end"":2935,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3079,""end"":3082,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3265,""end"":3268,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3658,""end"":3661,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4149,""end"":4152,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4887,""end"":4890,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4965,""end"":4968,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5404,""end"":5407,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5875,""end"":5878,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5474,""end"":5477,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5925,""end"":5928,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6461,""end"":6464,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6530,""end"":6533,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6483,""end"":6486,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7003,""end"":7006,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7023,""end"":7026,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7201,""end"":7204,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7032,""end"":7035,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7646,""end"":7649,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8113,""end"":8116,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8219,""end"":8222,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8345,""end"":8348,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2802,""end"":2808,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]}]"

For Yu Wang the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Tantan however the day was anything but ordinary. Wang had much to be excited about. Since its introduction last September his nearly one-year-old mobile dating application (app) had attracted more than two million active users and was considered the Chinese equivalent to Tinder a dating app that had gained widespread use in North America. Tantan (literally translated from Mandarin as “scouting around”) had experienced unprecedented growth and had already achieved the milestone of being the second-most popular mobile dating app in China. Wang now had his sights firmly set on wresting first-place bragging rights from the market leader by the end of the following year. The app had gained such widespread popularity that a reality TV show entitled Meeting Your Match was under active consideration for the dating service featuring Mike Sui a famous Chinese actor who had volunteered to play the main role in the show.Yet for all its success (and perhaps because of it) Tantan faced ever-increasing competition from a growing number of competitors—smaller agile players with creative ideas and large acquisition-oriented multinational companies alike—all of whom were expected to make major inroads in the popular mobile dating market in China. The influx of competitive apps not only caused much concern to Wang and the Tantan senior management team it also raised several unnerving questions:Given the innate conservative nature of Chinese society how should Tantan continue to grow its customer base to retain and enhance its presence as a viable mobile dating solution?How could Tantan retain its prime position among the young adults seeking romance in China when its very success resulted in a significant drop or worse yet a cessation in usage?Perhaps most important how could Tantan make itself less vulnerable to the very disruption it had unleashed on the Chinese dating market?MEETING YOUR MATCH IN CHINAMarriage was deeply rooted in Chinese culture and was considered a rigid societal obligation. Traditionally marriage was considered critical for propagating the family lineage. Almost 70 per cent of the Chinese people who married did so between the ages of 25 and 29. The minimum legal marriageable age in China was 20 years for males and 22 for females. Consistent with worldwide trends those in rural areas tended to marry at an earlier age than their urban counterparts. Contemporary Chinese society demonstrated a remarkable schism with respect to gender issues and with the status of women in particular. On the one hand Chinese women were expected to be married by the time they approached their mid- to late 20s thanks to widely held antediluvian mores that they were “most tender like a steak” at that time. Past that point the pool of prospects rapidly shrunk and it became increasingly difficult to find a partner. In fact 90 per cent of women in China were married before reaching the age of 30. An unmarried female in her late 20s was branded as “leftover” and “undesirable” regarded incomplete and considered one of the biggest signs of disrespect to her family. Women who were still single at age 30 were accorded “spinster status.”On the other hand the gender imbalance in China served as a crucial demographic equalizer (see Exhibit 1). Attributed primarily to China’s multi-decade-long one-child policy and the traditional Chinese preference for sons there were 118 males for every 100 females in 2010. The result was a growing number of Chinese men having trouble finding brides. Of all unmarried Chinese people aged 35–39 years old 88 per cent were male whereas 99 per cent of all females aged 30–34 year old were married. By 2020 it was estimated that 30 million men of marrying age would be unable to find a wife allowing women to be more selective in their choice of a marriage or dating partner. Young Chinese adults typically met their significant other through mutual connections that included friends family close and distant relatives co-workers and previous classmates. It was also not uncommon for parents to post a brief description and sometimes even a picture of their son or daughter to publicly accessible bulletin boards and to meet other like-minded parents in public parks with the objective of arranging the nuptials of their adult children. Such “marriage markets” were very popular in China (see Exhibit 2). Evolving societal norms resulted in a greater preference for later marriage typically after reaching the age of 25. Although traditionally divorces had been considered taboo in China by 2014 the annual divorce rate had increased by 3.9 per cent to more than 3.63 million. Many people attributed this accelerated divorce rate to the well-entrenched and increasing adoption of social media across China. It was felt that venues such as Tantan Momo (another location-based dating app) and WeChat (China’s most popular social networking site) made it easier to reach out to people and to indulge in extramarital relationships. Chinese culture remained conservative and therefore it frowned upon casual relationships. This attitude was exemplified by the Ministry of Culture’s clampdown on Momo for allegedly encouraging prostitution. Although sex education in China was officially implemented in 2008 the curriculum was minimal with very little focus on reproductive health and even less on contraception. At least 13 million medical terminations of pregnancy were undertaken annually and 10 million “morning after” pills were sold each year. The impact of mass media on shaping the views around sex could not be understated. Television shows such as Girls and Masters of Sex had shifted previously conservative attitudes catering instead to an urban progressive stance. As the middle class in China continued to grow people in the younger generation were less reliant on their parents and had more buying power. In 1989 only an estimated 15 per cent of young Chinese adults had engaged in sex before marriage. However in 2016 that percentage was estimated to have grown to well above 70 per cent attributed to China’s burgeoning number of dating apps and its cultural transformation in the intervening years. China’s youth were now more likely than not to have engaged in both sex before marriage and casual sexual encounters (“one-night stands”) as premarital and extramarital sex became less taboo. As well a heightened awareness and overall acceptance of homosexuality and LGBT (lesbian gay bisexual and transgender) rights in major cities coupled with the rise of more gay-specific apps such as Grindr Blued and Aloha also resulted in the LGBT community’s greater participation in the online dating scene.The targeted market for online dating apps comprised young Chinese adults between the ages of 20 and 27. During this age range the vast majority of break-ups occurred as college graduates moved to different geographic regions to take up employment frequently leaving behind their established social circles. People born in 1995 entered an economy twice the size of the economy a decade earlier. With an estimated 905 million mobile Internet users and 532 million smartphones and a projected compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent estimated to prevail until 2020 the Chinese mobile app market was booming (see Exhibit 3). Online dating in China really achieved critical mass in 2010 and had continued to grow year-over-year since then. In 2016 online dating was expected to generate approximately ¥3.15 billion in annual revenues (nearly US$500 million; see Exhibit 4) having grown by nearly 20 per cent year-over-year (see Exhibit 5). An increased familiarity with technology and its promise had fostered greater demand and higher expectations from mobile applications. With an emphasis on “now rather than later” millennials—people born in the 1980s and 1990s—had developed into a generation of tech-savvy light-hearted individuals who identified more easily with pop culture and displayed increasing affinity with localization and its advantages.TANTAN’S LOVE LINEYu Wang the CEO and founder of Tantan was born in Beijing and at the age of seven moved with his family to Stockholm Sweden where he later studied computer science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). An avid gamer he excelled at the computer game QuakeWorld which he played nearly 12 hours a day to become one of the top 10 players in the world. Perhaps not surprisingly his academic performance suffered and he nearly failed his first year at KTH. Realizing his mistake Wang shifted his focus to his studies and graduated with dual degrees in computer science and industrial economics. Upon graduation he moved back to Beijing to start his first job at Ericsson as an engineer working on an open source telephony solution. The successful completion of this project saw Wang transitioning into mobile solutions at his supervisor’s own start-up where he developed a roaming solution that permitted users to keep their telephone number and pay lower local rates. For his efforts Wang was offered a 20 per cent stake in the company and the position of chief technology officer. However he longed to work with younger like-minded colleagues and in 2007 he left the company to start his own venture with his friend Pan Ying also known as Sophia whom he later married. The two entrepreneurs started a company called P1 which was an invitation-only fashion community platform. Local fashion photographers would with permission take pictures of people who displayed exceptional style and invite them to join P1 where members could access their own pictures as well as those of other trendsetters. Wang and Sophia ran the company for nearly nine years but found that its exclusive community presented a significant challenge to achieving adequate scale. In 2012 Wang added a function to the P1 community called Street Crush. This function permitted users to visit any profile and to track incoming visitors to their own profile. If two users visited each other’s profile they could start a conversation about their similar interests. An improved version of Street Crush featured the option of anonymity whereby visits could be hidden unless both users clicked Secret Crush on each other’s profile. The Secret Crush function was later removed to avoid distracting users from P1’s core purpose—to create a community based on a common interest. However the Secret Crush function eventually served as the precursor to Tantan. Tantan was established in September 2015 as an extension of P1’s Secret Crush. Tantan targeted both heterosexual and gay relationship seekers in mainland China. Available in both Mandarin and English versions the app could be accessed by anyone with a smartphone operating on an Android or IOS platform. The development of Tantan was heavily influenced by Wang’s previous work and his related life experience—in particular the extension of P1’s Secret Crush website function and prior to meeting Sophia Wang’s loneliness (which might have been alleviated by an app such as Tantan). While working at Ericsson surrounded by millions of people in the bustling metropolis of Beijing Wang had felt that given the conservative Chinese culture there was no culturally acceptable way for an “outsider” like him to reach out to a potential partner. He knew it was an opportune time to develop a dating app for mobile users because of the dearth of venues in China where young singles could meet and socialize with other like-minded individuals. Location-based dating apps such as Tinder were flourishing in the West but had not yet made an impact in China. Wang felt that the existing Chinese online alternatives were either too marriage-oriented or too sex-oriented. Females in particular were hesitant to use the sex-oriented solutions that were coupled with a format where anyone could message anyone else. Apps such as Momo (Tantan’s direct competitor) were heavily subject to spam and resulted in low response rates for males seeking increasingly elusive females. To bridge the gap and solve these issues Wang developed the Tantan dating app. Tantan had a tightly knit development team consisting mostly of Swedish and Chinese employees. On February 3 2015 Tantan raised $5 million in series A financing led by Bertelsmann Asia Investments. Bertelsmann had been an early investor in the digital media provider Audible which was later acquired by Amazon. An additional $32 million in series C financing—this time led by DST Global Vision Plus Capital and LB Investment—was obtained in May 2016. Tantan remained a private company.THE TANTAN APPThe Tantan app was a replica of the North American mobile dating app Tinder. It was very easy to download (see Exhibit 6) had nearly identical features to Tinder and offered the same user experience. Tantan allowed its users who needed to be at least 17 years of age to make friends and meet potential partners by swiping left for “no” or right for “yes” on a selected set of photographs on the user’s profile and then enabling a two-way chat for every mutual match. The app was available in both Mandarin and English and with users’ permission could leverage a user’s social network profile information and location to find people nearby. A special feature included filtering out people the user already knew (based on their contact list and mutual contacts) so that users met only new people.Tantan was not immune to mainland China’s Internet censorship which typically flagged politically charged terms such as “64” and “Bo Xilai” and considered sexual content to also be controversial. Certain sexually charged phrases such as “hook-up buddy” or “get a room” were flagged in chat rooms and received a pop-up warning message in the app’s selected language. Any offensive language would be flagged and the user was asked to think twice before sending it—one of Tantan’s differentiating factors. The app prioritized user experience especially for female users. The number one issue that concerned female users was the prospect of receiving unwelcome sexual overtures from men. Tantan aimed to develop into more of a social platform where people looked for friends and someone to chat with.Tantan remained free to users relying on advertising for its revenue. With nearly two million active users generating around 100 million daily swipes Tantan planned to charge a nominal fee of ¥5 per month for services once it reached 10 million users. The app enjoyed an active user rate of 80 per cent and a weekly retention rate between 55 and 60 per cent. Tantan’s promotional activity was primarily based on word of mouth fostered by trust through personal connections with first-hand user experience attesting to the app’s quality. Contrary to the popular promotional tactics of the time Tantan used very little social media promotion because of China’s ban on the major social network websites (e.g. Facebook Instagram YouTube and Twitter).TANTAN’S RIVALSTantan had many competitors in the online dating landscape (see Exhibit 7). Momo was Tantan’s biggest mobile dating competitor. Launched in July 2011 and led by Tang Yang Momo was a free location-based app with instant messaging available for all smartphone platforms and tablets. Momo was perceived as a flirty “hook-up” app comparable to Tantan. Both apps encouraged strangers with similar interests to connect and expand their social circles with other nearby strangers. Some features on Momo included the ability to find nearby users join groups engage in message boards and participate in nearby events. Moreover users had the ability to go beyond instant messaging and play both single and multi-player games. Contrary to Tantan’s simple profiles Momo’s users were encouraged to make Facebook-like profiles by providing more details about themselves in order for the app to identify more accurate matches with nearby strangers.Momo gained major traction in the Chinese market as a leader in the mobile dating landscape; the user growth rate was exponential. Momo reached half a million users in December 2011—only one month after the release of the app. Three months later the number of Momo users reached two million. One year later it had reached 10 million users and then surpassed the two milestones of 15 million users in October 2012 and 100 million users in February 2014. By June 2014 Momo claimed a total user base of 148 million with 52.4 million monthly active users (MAU).Given its unprecedented growth rate and popularity Momo had no problem attracting investors. The app filed for an initial public offering in the United States on November 7 2014 and raised $2.5 million in series A financing through Buttonwood Capital and Matrix Hong Kong. Momo completed its series B financing in October 2012 and series C financing a year later by which time it had raised nearly $40 million. In May 2014 Momo raised $211.8 million in series D financing. Momo earned revenue from three major areas: premium membership subscriptions mobile games and marketing. A premium membership costs approximately $2 per month or $17 per year. Benefits of the premium membership included VIP (very important person) logos advanced search options discounts in the emoticon store higher limits on the maximum number of users in a group and the ability for users to track recent visitors on their profiles. Additionally Momo integrated mobile games into its platform to monetize its large user base. Third parties developed games and the revenues were shared between Momo and its developer partners. Momo also launched Dao Dian Tong a marketing tool that enabled local businesses to build their own pages and allowed users to find them. Over time Momo anticipated connecting users to e-commerce companies as an additional source of revenue including the e-commerce giant Alibaba.After dominating the mobile dating landscape the Momo app diversified by adding check-ins for venues and local interest groups. Momo’s executive team worked diligently to shift the public perception of the app toward a social network and away from its tainted perception as a “hook-up” app. It promoted itself as a social network for millennials and its promotions contained little to no suggestion of dating (see Exhibit 8). These efforts appeared to be successful. In early 2015 Momo could boast 78.1 million MAUs 13 per cent higher than only a few months earlier and 83 per cent higher year over year. Momo reported net revenues of $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2015 383 per cent higher year over year. Perhaps most important the app earned a net income of $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with a loss of nearly $3 million at the end of 2014.TINDER IN CHINAIn addition to tracking homegrown Chinese competitors Wang also kept a wary eye on Tinder the U.S.-based app that was credited with being the pioneer of location-based mobile dating apps. Since its inception by founder and CEO Sean Rad in September 2012 Tinder spanned 15 countries and had achieved an impressive user base of 50 million active users including several celebrities. Tinder’s top foreign markets included Brazil and the United Kingdom both of which had millions of users and a daily growth rate of 2 per cent (approximately 20000 new users per day). Tinder had also been widely adopted in places as far as Dubai Turkey Egypt Morocco and South Africa and was estimated to be in use by nearly 4 per cent of the Norwegian population. The app’s promoters claimed that users found matches four million times a day and generated 350 million daily swipes equivalent to 4000 matches around the world every second. Rad claimed that Tinder app users made 10 million matches and 750 million swipes every day. On average users of the app checked their accounts 11 times per day and spent 90 minutes engaging with the app. Tinder was owned by the Match Group a division of Barry Diller’s IAC which owned other dating sites such as OkCupid and Match.com. In November 2015 Match Group was part of an initial public offering that raised about $400 million for an approximate valuation of $3 billion. Tinder played a pivotal role in Match Group’s appeal. In its prospectus notes filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the group reported Rad’s app as having “risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the dating category” and that it particularly appealed to young users. According to one estimate Tinder’s valuation as a freestanding operation could have been higher than $1 billion.Rad and Tinder were no strangers to controversy. Rad had been named as defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit and had even been fired from his own company only to be reinstated as CEO in August 2015. Tinder was striving hard to distance itself from the image of being a “glorified frat house” devoted solely to the promotion of casual sex. By some estimates this effort had been successful. A survey conducted in the closing months of 2015 reportedly found that 80 per cent of Tinder app users were seeking more than just a “one-night stand.” Rad had grand plans for Tinder. He was not limiting the app to user-data-informed advertising and subscription services or only applications for that matter. Rad explained his plans:We have the potential to grab a massive audience as big as Instagram’s or Snapchat’s but the value we’re giving is so much greater than any of these social apps. . . . The matches made on Tinder can change lives. The Snapchat photo from two hours ago—who gives a [expletive]? In March 2015 Tinder introduced Tinder Plus a paid service that allowed unlimited matches as opposed to the free version that limited the number of right swipes in a 12-hour period. Although many users were unhappy with the limited number of “likes” a free user could indicate and the company policy of charging different prices for different age groups (a Tinder Plus subscription was $19.99 per month for users over age 28 $9.99 per month for those 28 and under) at least some interested observers reported that Tinder’s swipe right limit was working.Rad had expressed keen interest in China and had even announced his intention to enter the Chinese market in 2013: “China is the market that I think about a lot. There are a lot of sensitivities around entering that market but we’ve definitely done a fair amount of due diligence and we do have plans to enter the Chinese market.” Despite his professed interest however Rad had to contend with at least one major stumbling block to his aspirations. Both Facebook and Instagram the venues Tinder relied on to authenticate individual user identity were banned in China thus necessitating a major change in Tinder’s user acquisition strategy there. As well most dating apps in China had been specifically tailored to the local market a feature missing from Tinder. Many large American companies had overlooked the differences in the Chinese market to their own peril. Most recently Uber had acknowledged its failure due to competition from Didi Chuxing a homegrown ride-sharing company. There had been claims that under the leadership of Xi Jinping the Chinese government’s preference for domestic service companies would exert even greater pressure on foreign competitors.TANTAN VersuS TINDERSimilar to Tinder Tantan relied on companion applications for users to further connect with each other. The company circumvented China’s ban on Facebook and Instagram by using the ubiquitous WeChat app and requiring users to provide their phone numbers to verify membership. Celebrity and public figure verification conducted so as to avoid impersonators was available on Tinder but not on Tantan. Additionally Tinder had far wider global reach relative to Tantan which allowed the app to provide its premium service Tinder Plus. The premium service effectively leveraged its vast worldwide user base to increase the chances of finding a soulmate beyond the confines of a single country or region.Tinder also implemented a new 500-swipe limit over a two-hour period for basic users in an effort to avoid spammers and web robots. The app also implemented a “super like” function restricting basic users to only two “super likes” within a 12-hour period. Lastly Tinder Plus included two new features that were unavailable in its free basic version: rewind and passport. Rewind allowed the user to return to the previous left-swiped profile in the event of a change of mind; passport gave users the ability to browse and chat with other users around the world and go beyond the default 100-mile (160-kilometre) radius. However Tinder remained an insignificant presence in China restricted by its reliance on the China-banned sites. And yet that issue had not dissuaded the firm from pursuing a premium-pricing approach there. In Beijing Tinder planned to charge its users $14.99 for the first month and $6.67 per month thereafter or $10 for a six-month subscription.TANTAN’S OTHER CHALLENGES The popularity of a dating app rested on its ability to claim a large number of users which also increased the probability of fake accounts and impersonators. Tantan was subject to this potential threat and reacted to this issue by announcing the impending introduction of video verification. New users would be required to use their phones to make available a brief video snippet of themselves uttering a few words (e.g. “hello Tantan”). Tantan personnel would then compare the snippet with the user’s profile for verification. Once verified by Tantan the user had full access to the app. Tantan hoped this practice would reduce the incidence of fake accounts.The problem of fake accounts and impersonations however paled in comparison with an even greater concern. In late November 2015 Larry Salibra (CEO of Pay4Bugs) discovered and publicly reported a significant security flaw in the Tantan app. In a damning repudiation of Tantan’s assurances with respect to its users’ privacy Salibra claimed that any marginally competent hacker could access usernames passwords phone numbers and even conversations occurring within the confines of the app. All information—user interests hobbies preferences regarding partner age and even sexual orientation—was being transmitted in clear text across the Internet devoid of any encryption whatsoever. To add to this concern individual users could easily be tracked using coordinates and basic geometry on Google maps. Luckily there had been no indication to date of a privacy breach. Tantan responded swiftly to this issue by making available an updated version of the app with improved encryption and a team dedicated to resolve all issues 24 hours a day seven days a week.CONCLUSIONAmid the promise of Tantan’s ever-increasing popularity Wang still had many important decisions to make as the first anniversary of his brainchild approached. Would Tantan live up to its hype? Or was it yet another brief success without a future?EXHIBIT 1: CHINA’S DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONPopulation growth rate:0.45 per cent (2015 estimate)Population growth compared to the rest of the world: 162Urbanization:Urban population: 55.6 per cent of total population (2015)Rate of urbanization: 3.05 per cent annual rate of change (2010–2015 estimate)Sex ratio:At birth: 1.15 males per 1 female0–14 years: 1.17 males per 1 female15–24 years: 1.13 males per 1 femaleTotal population: 1.06 males per 1 female (2015 estimate)Source: “The World Factbook: Population Growth Rate” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?; “The World Factbook: Rank Order” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2002rank.html#ch; “The World Factbook: Urbanization” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?; “The World Factbook: Sex Ratio” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?EXHIBIT 2: MARRIAGE MARKET IN CHINASource: Photo used with permission; Cherry Flava “On the Marriage Market in China” May 12 2016 accessed April 15 2016 www.cherryflava.com/futures/on-the-rack-in-china/.EXHIBIT 3: GROWTH RATE OF SMARTPHONE USE IN CHINA (2014–2020)Note: Methodology: Estimates are based on the analysis of survey and traffic data from research firms and regulatory agencies historical trends and country-specific demographic and socioeconomic factors.

(AkzoNobel) was at the company’s Delhi headquarters going through reports on Dulux TileShield (TileShield) a brand on which she had been working for the last two months. Launched by AkzoNobel in 2006 TileShield quickly became synonymous with roof tile protection so much so that most competing brands in the category had adopted similar-sounding names. AkzoNobel’s competitors such as Asian Paints Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac Paints had all developed similar technologies which stepped up competition in the new category of exterior paints. As competition grew it became increasingly difficult for TileShield’s sales force to ensure that it continued to be the preferred brand among customers. Even though the brand was facing profitability pressures the regional sales office in Kerala was putting pressure on the brand team to reduce prices. The time for urgent action had arrived.Dhawan knew she had to address the immediate pricing demands of the brand. She had to decide whether this was the right time for a major change in the brand offering even though the effects of such a change would not be felt before the next sales season about six months away. The alternative option was to wait and make only minor changes based on the identified issues and see how the market responded in the coming months. This wait-time delay however might take away TileShield’s early-mover advantage something the company had been cashing in on for a long time. Dhawan and her team were also debating whether or not there was a need to take any steps at all. Perhaps what TileShield was experiencing was simply the norm in the life cycle of a product that operated in a fiercely competitive market.THE Indian Paint IndustryUntil the 1960s the Indian paint industry was dominated by the unorganized sector. As late as 2009 the unorganized sector catered to about 35 per cent of the total demand. Most of the organized players in the paint industry operated at the national level while their unorganized counterparts operated primarily at the regional level.The industry was broadly divided into two segments—decorative paints and industrial paints. In the organized sector decorative paints accounted for about 70 per cent of the market share and industrial paints accounted for the rest (see Exhibit 1). The decorative paints segment had a clear advantage over the industrial paints segment in terms of both market share and growth potential. Many types of decorative paints had been developed over a period of time and were classified under a unique system (see Exhibit 2). Between 2001 and 2010 the industry had grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 15 per cent attracting many national and international players. By financial year 2011 the size of the industry was estimated at approximately US$4.2 billion. There were four major participants in the market: Asian Paints Kansai Nerolac Paints Berger Paints and AkzoNobel Global (see Exhibit 3). A variety of products were available in the exterior paints segment as well. By and large organized participants sought to offer a wide range of products and variants (see Exhibit 4).Buyers and Influencers in THE MarketThe do-it-yourself culture was nearly absent in the Indian paints industry so channel members and other influencers played a key role in this market (see Exhibit 5). Since painting usually involved technical steps such as dilution (i.e. percentage of solvent added to the paint before application) opacity (i.e. non-visibility of the undercoats) and coverage (i.e. area covered by one litre of paint under the recommended dilution and number of coats) consumers in India rarely undertook the work themselves. Instead they outsourced painting jobs to contractors or to architects who generally made the paint-brand decision. Although this trend was changing somewhat with homeowners becoming gradually more involved in paint purchase decisions their input was restricted to choices of paint colour and shade. By building brands through mass advertising paint companies tried to reduce the influence of contractors and architects (customers) and increase the influence of homeowners (consumers) in decision-making; however they were still a long way from achieving their goal. AkzoNobelIn 1911 Brunner Mond & Co. began operations in Calcutta (now Kolkata) the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal to sell alkalis and dyes. It was one of the four companies that would eventually combine with three others in 1926 to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) (India). What followed was a period of sustained expansion diversification and growth. ICI began manufacturing activities in India in 1939 with the establishment of Alkali and Chemical Corporation of India Ltd. in Rishra West Bengal. In 1984 the ICI group companies in India were merged into what was one of corporate India’s largest mergers of that time. Nalco Chemicals India Ltd. was formed in 1987 with Nalco Chemical Company (United States) and AkzoNobel each holding 40 per cent of the equity. The first phase of AkzoNobel restructuring was completed in 1993 with the divestment of the seed fibre and fertilizer businesses. In 1995 the agrochemicals business was transferred to a joint venture with Zeneca Limited United Kingdom.In 2008 AkzoNobel N.V. became the sole owner of ICI. This shift in ownership became possible through an arrangement under Section 425 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 when ICI became a subsidiary of AkzoNobel N.V. To leverage the global strength of the AkzoNobel brand in 2010 ICI India Limited was renamed AkzoNobel India Limited.Roof Tile PaintsRoof tiles were a common feature of buildings in parts of India that experienced high rainfall such as the state of Kerala where these tiles were part of the traditional architecture. In Kerala AkzoNobel broadly divided housing into four types (a classification that was also used for consumer segmentation): middle-class houses bungalows villas and high-rise buildings.The state of Kerala had a high average annual rainfall and its two monsoon seasons—Edavappathy or the southwest monsoon (June to August) and Thulavarsham or the northeast monsoon (October to December)—tested the roofs of houses. Roof tiles were designed to bear the vertical impact of heavy rain and except for high-rise buildings were used in most homes in Kerala. The use of paint on the surface of roof tiles was intended to mitigate the effects of rain on the tiles. Historically regular exterior paints fulfilled this function; however research and development in the paint industry and growing customer awareness about the efficacy of painting roof tiles led to the birth of a new product category—roof tile paints. These new paints were made with a strong latex film that allowed them to bear the impact of rain much more effectively and for a longer period compared to the existing exterior paints. AkzoNobel India Ltd. (then ICI Paints) launched its pioneering product in this category in 2004 under the brand name Dulux TileShield (see Exhibit 6).By 2010 the category had acquired an identity of its own and consumers were able to distinguish between roof tile paints and other exterior paints. This level of improved consumer awareness was an outcome of promotional efforts by companies that provided point-of-sale material and by key influencers such as painters and contractors who purchased and used these paints. This growth in consumer awareness was accompanied by greater competition as other participants entered the market. By 2011 the category was expected to grow at a CAGR of 30 per cent for the next five years. Despite this growth spurt beyond the distribution of print material (e.g. product guides and paint-shade booklets) at the point of purchase no participant in the roof tile paint category spent additional money on media and promotional activities.Despite the growth of the category especially in the key state of Kerala TileShield sales did not grow in financial year 2011/12. According to the sales team the brand’s high price and increased market competition were responsible for its plummeting sales. Some time earlier on the recommendation of the sales team in 2010–2011 the company had adjusted the price of TileShield by offering a discount on the prevailing dealer’s price; however this adjustment had no visible effect on sales. Decreasing the price further would have resulted in reduced margins for dealers who were already complaining of the negative effect of past price cuts. Dhawan knew that further reducing TileShield’s price was not an option particularly given AkzoNobel’s bid to develop a premium brand image by keeping its prices 7 to 10 per cent above those of Asian Paints the overall leader in the decorative paints category.Apart from price Dhawan and her team had identified other potential problems related to past issues with TileShield such as increasing competition and rising consumer expectations among others.ProductAbout two years earlier one of TileShield’s product lots had been found defective. Consumers complained that the paint peeled off and faded quickly. The company recalled the entire lot after receiving multiple complaints but the negative effects of that product failure persisted. There had also been complaints by contractors regarding coverage issues but subsequent product testing showed that these charges were baseless. In 2012 TileShield contributed nearly 3 per cent to overall sales in AkzoNobel’s exterior paints division.PricingLike other industry participants AkzoNobel offered dealers a 5 to 8 per cent margin on the recommended prices which were market-driven and were called “market operating prices” (MOPs). The company followed a similar margin structure for TileShield. Only Asian Paints offered a lower margin of 3 to 4 per cent. As a brand in the premium paint category TileShield promised dealers higher margins. AkzoNobel’s policy of keeping its prices higher than those of Asian Paints allowed it to give dealers higher margins. The main paint base used in TileShield was sold to dealers at a price of US$83.60 per 18 litres as per the dealers’ price list (DPL) while the DPL of Asian Paints’ equivalent product TileGuard was US$72.40 per 18 litres. Despite this price difference dealers complained about the lower margins they were getting per 20-litre can (of which 18 litres consisted of base paint and the rest a mixture of tints required to get a desired shade). The volume was not necessarily always 20 litres but 20-litre cans were the market standard. Exhibits 7 8 and 9 show the pricing structure of the different participants for the two major shades “Terracotta Red” and “Sunrise” which accounted for 70 per cent of the volume of shades. After their discussions with the dealers the field team reported that despite higher base prices and percentage margins dealers were getting lower absolute margins on some of the TileShield shades they were selling. This point was yet to be verified.CompetitionTile paints belonged to a super-premium category of paints; therefore middle-class households did not accept them easily preferring instead to use regular exterior wall paints on their roof tiles. Even for companies with a presence in the tile paints category the focus area was bungalows. By 2011 the company faced strong competition from national players such as Asian Paints Kansai Nerolac Paints and Berger Paints. As the category gained greater acceptance and consumer awareness improved regional competitors began to enter the market. The attractiveness of the market also lured some international participants like Sherwin-Williams and Nippon Paint who were keen to make a foray into the Indian market. Some Southeast Asian companies also entered the fray. Southeast Asia had been the preferred employment location for residents of Kerala which made product acceptance relatively easy for these companies because of their existing connection to the country of origin. By 2012 there were about nine companies competing in the roof tile paints category in India (see Exhibit 9).AkzoNobel had seen its sales stagnate in recent years but having led the category with more than 30 per cent market share in the past the company expected sales to grow as the roof tile paint category grew. Market Research and Consumer BehavioUrThe company hired a market research agency to evaluate consumer perception and behaviour with a view towards gaining a better understanding of consumer needs and influences. The research targeted consumers contractors and dealers primarily in the city of Cochin in Kerala. It focused on people whose homes had been painted in the last six months and who had used either Dulux roof tile paints or selected competitor brands. The market research showed that increased competition had diluted the degree of product differentiation among the various brand offerings. Product attributes in the paints industry could be broadly divided into performance (durability coverage and ease of application) and aesthetics (the beauty or visual effect of the paint on the tile surface in terms of colour finish and similar factors). Typically consumers of paints placed value on the aesthetic aspects of the product while painters and contractors concentrated on performance attributes. However an initial exploratory study on consumer behaviour conducted as part of the overall market research reported that in the tile paint category consumers were more interested in the performance of the paint than in aesthetics. They saw roof tiles as the primary feature of the house which needed good protection (see Exhibit 11). Since the life of the paint emerged as the most crucial parameter for consumers most of the paint manufacturers in this category focused on paint quality.The study indicated a high preference for natural shades with Terracotta Red and Sunrise dominating among more than 2000 shades and constituting nearly 70 per cent of the demand. The study also identified some shades of blue and green that were gaining popularity. However natural shades emerged as the clear winners in both Indian and world markets. To understand consumer requirements the study tested three product concepts. Of these the first focused on performance the second on aesthetics and the third on aspects of both. The third concept was primarily used to reinforce an understanding of consumer expectations with respect to the first two concepts.The results of this part of the study revealed that consumers were well aware of the importance of the roof tiles’ function and therefore regarded performance as the primary requirement from roof tile paint. Further consumers were found to identify closely with use of the local terms for the various conditions of the monsoon seasons a factor that raised the question of how to use the local language on the product packaging as a way to attract buyers. Although the study results confirmed the importance of performance characteristics they also made differentiation more difficult. Repositioning the product in the minds of consumers emerged as the only option. Some of the positioning points identified in the study included longer life anti-fungal properties the stability of the colours (anti-fading) and anti-leak/waterproofing properties. Some of these attributes would necessitate product improvements by the company’s research and development (R & D) team.New Shade RangeAround the same time in 2012 AkzoNobel’s R & D team came out with a new range of metallic paint shades a product range that had already been accepted in some parts of the world. The historical attachment of Kerala temples and households to sheen supported the introduction of this new shade range. In 2011 one regional player Indigo Paints began to offer metallic shades in the roof tile category but despite using mass media to promote the product it had been unsuccessful. On the other hand metallic shades continued to be a popular choice for interior walls. For AkzoNobel the new shade range offered an opportunity to break free of similar offerings in the market but it was important to first gauge the acceptance of the product and the influence on decision-making.The study indicated that consumers regarded metallic shades as superior to matte-finish paints but tended to limit their use when it came to exterior paint jobs. For instance for aesthetic effect metallic paint would be applied on the borders of the roof for aesthetic effect. An alternative usage prevalent in Kerala temples was the application of metallic shades to pillars in houses. This use of paint was a market-abusive practice and posed another challenge to the company: Should it attempt to prevent this practice or should it support it to improve sales? The company was aware that encouraging the practice could lend support to the argument that tile and other exterior paints could be used interchangeably.Dilemmas and Decisions Dhawan and her team had to tackle the problem on two fronts: one involved gaining some clarity on product differentiation and positioning and the second involved getting the right combination of product promotion and other market parameters especially price. The team also had to make a decision on the introduction of the metallic shade range. Should they launch it separately as a new product range or as a new shade range in the existing product line? Alternatively should they opt against launching it at all?TileShield was still the market leader and due to the continued high growth in the roof tile paint category it still had reasonable growth potential. However the company could not ignore the pressure from the rapidly increasing competition. Further dipping sales and revenues posed a definite concern and the fact that dealers were demanding higher margins to push sales added an additional pressure. After considering multiple options in deciding the future of TileShield Dhawan and her team shortlisted three options. Continue with the Existing Value PropositionThe first option was to continue with the existing value proposition and focus on improving the paint’s quality and performance and if required adjust the price to make sure that both dealers and consumers were satisfied.In the team’s view one of the major advantages of this option was that it could be implemented quickly. The peak season for tile paint sales would end in less than a month and the other alternatives would take at least three to four months to implement. AkzoNobel believed that the main differentiators for TileShield in its current form were its quality and performance (see Exhibits 11 and 12). The management team felt that by making some adjustments to the product formulation the R & D team could help bring down prices to the extent that everyone in the value chain would benefit.The only concern with this alternative was that many international players had already entered the market and most of them claimed to have a better quality product than TileShield (see Exhibit 13). In such an environment it was unclear whether TileShield’s current positioning on quality was sustainable or not especially given that the brand had already lost about 5 per cent of its market share in the last two to three years; the current market share for TileSheild stood at 30 per cent.Relaunch TileShieldThe market research study had already established that performance more than aesthetics mattered to the consumer. Thus another option for the marketing team was to strengthen TileShield’s position in the market by redefining its consumer value proposition. This option could help the company in two ways. First it could help redefine the price which would reduce the pressure on the R & D department by removing the need for a reformulation effort. Second it could help TileShield achieve the desired differentiation in a highly competitive market.However the identification of a new value proposition was a challenge that would possibly require the company to redefine other product elements such as packaging and collaterals. The question was whether such a huge undertaking was called for since TileShield was still the market leader (see Exhibit 14). The other disadvantage of this alternative was that it would not benefit AkzoNobel in the current season; the company would have to wait until the following year to register the impact of the relaunch.Use the Brand Equity of WeatherShieldWeatherShield was the front-runner in the exterior paints division at AkzoNobel. It was a highly regarded exterior brand not only in India but also internationally. The company had given special attention to WeatherShield and had promoted it aggressively in recent years. It was the only brand in the exterior paints division at AkzoNobel that was promoted through television commercials in India and the company’s research had shown that this approach had helped WeatherShield gain high brand equity. The brand name WeatherShield was associated with many products at that time; however the advertising focus was primarily on Dulux WeatherShield and Dulux WeatherShield Max both of which were exterior wall paints.Could the company capitalize on WeatherShield’s brand equity to reduce some of the risks associated with the relaunch of TileShield? As Dhawan saw it there were two alternatives in associating with WeatherShield: one was to completely replace the brand name TileShield with WeatherShield Tile (one of the names that was under consideration) by the start of the next major sales season; the second was to retain both brand names namely TileShield and WeatherShield Tile and split the tile paint into two variants with TileShield focusing on its current positioning. This strategy was in line with the option to continue with the current value proposition. Launching WeatherShield Tile with the new positioning before the start of the next season would require the company to undertake some consumer research in the coming months. In either case the marketing team was not considering spending any additional promotional money on different media largely because of the absence of promotion within the category and also because the company was in the process of mapping out its media activities for the umbrella brand WeatherShield.Although the latter of the two alternatives seemed to address the existing problems there were some embedded issues. Keeping both brand names could lead to confusion among consumers. It could also lead to more supply chain problems as a result of doubling the number of stock-keeping units. Forecasting accuracy and the availability of stock-keeping units were already prevalent problems and the related issues were likely to double if there were two brand names to deal with. If the marketers chose to replace the brand name TileShield with WeatherShield the company would not be able to implement the change in the next three to four months. In either case there was the risk of a negative impact on the WeatherShield brand name.The Way ForwardDhawan had to weigh all the options in light of future considerations and the current market scenario. There were many unanswered questions: Was there a problem in the pricing structure? If so why had it not been identified by now? What changes if any needed to be made in the price points? What was more feasible— upward movement or downward movement in the price point? If the company did not increase TileShield’s market operating price what could it do to make sure that its profitability as well as that of its dealers was not affected? Could the different consumer segments be targeted in different ways? Could different value propositions be used for different segments? What should they do about the metallic shade range? Should it be launched or not? Should the positioning be changed? If so what would be the most suitable positioning point? Was further consumer research called for? Even if she was able to answer all these questions Dhawan faced a much bigger strategic decision: How should AkzoNobel’s marketing team execute the relaunch? Given the above questions if it were possible to make the necessary changes was a relaunch even required? The decision was an important one. If successful it would help one of the company’s more profitable brands retain its leadership and market share. If not the failure could affect the company’s profitability. Additionally Dulux’s other brands could also take a hit.EXHIBIT 1: INDIAN PAINT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS (2011)Notes: **Premium range is a major driver of growth of the decorative paints and roof tile paint category;Source: Company records.

Chinese employees were mostly administrative and service staff recruited locally while non-Chinese employees were mostly expatriates from around the world including Europe North America Latin America Africa Australia and Asia. In their day-to-day work Chinese and non-Chinese staff interacted frequently in a flat and functional organizational structure (i.e. with limited power relations between co-workers).On March 7 2012 one day before International Women’s Day all 244 female staff members of Birkenshire received an email from the human resources (HR) department announcing a gift of pink towels in celebration of the day. Within one hour of this announcement a discussion commenced as an email thread among female staff and continued into the afternoon of March 8. The question facing the management of Birkenshire was whether they should respond and if so how and when.The PINK TOWELSThe email message from HR read as follows: Dear AllTomorrow is International Women’s Day (IWD). The first IWD was observed on March 8 1911. In China March 8 was officially marked as Women’s Day by the government in December 1949. Each year on this day there are hundreds of thousands of activities around the world for the celebrations. Interestingly in China this year to celebrate the upcoming International Women’s Day women in bridal dresses and high-heels took part in a running contest in the Colorful World Park of Changsha capital of the Hunan Province. As with our celebration of IWD this year HR has prepared a towel gift set for each female staff member: We are putting the gifts in your pigeon holes this afternoon (by 4:00 p.m.). For those who do not have a pigeon hole please go to the post room to collect your gift when you are free.The subsequent discussion included female staff with a few male staff in management positions copied. The first response read like this:I don’t want this to be mistaken as ingratitude but I do start to wonder what kind of image of women is reproduced here? We have in the past been treated to pink-glitter picture frames and visits to kitchenware factories and now the company is showing how much it is caring about our physical appearance by offering us pink towels! As a woman who has gained a Ph.D. and a decent job in a corporate environment that is still very much dominated by white men I’m very aware of the struggle many women have had to go through to reach such a position. Up to this day it still happens regularly that people I newly meet will turn to my husband and ask him what his work is in China. When he answers that it is me who is working here they kindly ask if I am a language teacher! Certainly no woman can be an executive!Because of this obvious continued subtle and open discrimination of women I feel that these kinds of presents are absolutely not the appropriate way of celebrating Women’s Day. The company should set a good example in recognizing the professional achievements of the women working here instead of joining the general patriarchal chorus that sees women at work as a temporary maybe even regrettable incidence and thinks that women should rather care about their looks (towels) home (kitchenware) and children whose picture would look extremely nice in pink-glitter picture frames. There are certainly books DVDs and other kinds of gifts which express respect for women’s intellectual and professional qualities rather than reducing them to pink towels!  Staff ASome of the following comments expressed sympathy with the above statement.Well said. I totally agree. The money could be far better spent on contributing to causes to help other women in China. Staff BI support the sentiments expressed. Another idea might be to offer a fund for young women to pursue higher education. Staff CSoon the discussion expanded its focus and began to take on other issues.I’ve lived and worked in three different countries—the United States the United Kingdom and China—and have to say this: it is nice to be receiving a gift in the workplace to commemorate such a day as it is not something I expected. It is special to be in China so I take it as part of the wonderful Chinese protocols. However as you pointed out the symbolism of the items selected is deeply rooted and as one of the few women holding a high position in the company it is appropriate that you point it out. Perhaps next year more individuals can be consulted about what might constitute an appropriate gift to mark this occasion before someone goes shopping with the company’s money? The idea of a contribution to a cause for women in China sounds like a great idea and something most of us could agree on. Staff DThe following comment took a personal perspective and further expanded the focus:Thanks to [Staff D] for reminding us all of the fact that we are in China which as you correctly point out has its own protocols—the symbolism of which is very deeply rooted. On that point maybe the following may shed more light. My mother who was born and brought up in China before emigrating returned to the land of her birth just once (in 1973 and by boat) when she brought amongst other things bales of towels for the very reason that towels have long been popular presents for men and women in China. As for the colour it should be remembered that whilst the choice of pink has certain connotations in countries such as Germany and Britain it has no such connotation in China as far as I am aware.As for Britain I worked there for 20 years in two organizations where my employers never once offered any material token of their appreciation for all my hard work. The tokens of appreciation offered by Birkenshire are therefore much appreciated by me as I accept them in the spirit in which I feel they are meant. Staff EThe two following commentators also expressed their appreciation for the gift:Yes [Staff E] I agree with you and thank you for your comments. Actually most of us Chinese staff appreciate the gift from the company. We don’t think too much about it. This case might be a good example of what “cultural conflict” is . . . . Staff FThank you for such an interesting email [Staff E]. You are right about the colour issue in China. Do look around and you will see how pink has a different connotation here. I could not agree with you more in appreciating the gesture from Birkenshire. I am happy to belong to a work environment that expresses recognition for my work through such small details. Thank you to the people who thought about us the women at Birkenshire and thank you for the little token. Staff GAt this point the first commentator Staff A provided further input to the ongoing discussion:I’m sorry that this issue is now interpreted as a cultural conflict. This is absolutely not the case. I do not object at all that a present is given nor do I want to contest that pink/red might have another meaning or that towels are not seen as offensive. What I am objecting to however is that women are given household goods as gifts by their employer. If towels are a common gift in China then I can assume that men too receive pink (lucky) towels as gifts from the company? No of course not. I would imagine though that key rings agendas purses business card holders and similar items of daily use can be given as gifts too; right? Why then household goods to working women? This is a gender issue and not a cultural one. It is about appreciating women’s work and not about Chinese versus Western culture.The conversation continued to split from there with more comments and perspectives being contributed:Different women have different views towards gifts. I just got the pink towels and they are lovely. I really love them. Staff HI am a working woman and hope to become an executive in the future. I don’t think someone or my employer buying me a pink towel or a business card holder could change the fact that I am a professional woman. I’d interpret the type of gift being selected here simply because compared to business card holders towels could be useful to everyone. I have to say having lived and worked in the United Kingdom for more than 10 years the last one and half years at Birkenshire have been very different but certainly memorable to me as I feel I have been recognized and considered after all the hard work. I very much appreciate all gifts being offered by Birkenshire not just the money being spent but the idea the time and people who organize all of these. To some extent I won’t mind any gift being offered. Staff IAlthough “cultural conflict” makes the issue sound more fun I have to agree with Staff A that this is a gender issue instead of a cultural one. As a Chinese person I am not bothered at all by the pink towels or red but as a woman I do find it ironic to have this “Women’s Day.” Does it mean all the rest of the year are men’s days? I would rather there were solid regulations considering working women’s welfare for instance longer maternity leave or better/more chance for professional development etc. That said I will still pick up my pink towels. Just hoping next year or in the near future we can see a difference and not just pink towels.  Staff JIt’s a real shame that in an organization where thinking is exactly what we are meant to do Staff A’s astute points about gender get distorted into ingratitude to the hospitality that China offers and worse escalates into the ever-convenient discourse of a Western attack on China. She is spot on. Staff KThe first commentator Staff A continued to offer more input:The Day of Women’s Rights and International Peace actually celebrates: www.un.org/ ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womday97.htm; www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html. Women’s Day is to remind us that women’s rights had to be fought for and that this is still the case today. It’s not Mother’s Day.The email discussion continued on until the afternoon of March 8 before eventually quieting down. During the course of discussion the management of Birkenshire had not responded but a few (male) staff in top management positions including the head of HR and the chief executive officer were copied on the emails and therefore were aware of the discussion while it developed.,12.0,

Mishra had called a meeting with his plant managers to review the progress on their production targets. As the plant director he had received a request from the head office at Bangalore fifteen days earlier asking him to produce 27000 units of a popular inverter brand for the month of June. The original target of 5000 units set two months previously had unexpectedly been raised to 7000 just a month ago and since the Rudrapur operation was already struggling just to deal with that change in its original production target this latest order represented a massive challenge both for the plant and for its director. SCHNEIDER ELECTRICFounded in 1836 Schneider Electric (Schneider) was a French multinational corporation that specialized in producing components for energy management and electricity distribution. It operated in over 100 countries around the world and employed approximately 160000 people. In 2015 the company made a profit of €3.6 billion on revenues of €26.6 billion.Schneider Electric had been operating in India since 1963 and had established a 100 per cent owned subsidiary in 1995. The company’s growth in India had been inorganic in nature with several well-known acquisitions including Conzerv (2010) Zicom (2010) Digilink (2011) and Luminous (2011).SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC PLANT—RUDRAPURA New Plant The city of Rudrapur was located in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. The State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) had been formed in 2002 with a mandate of promoting industries by developing industrial infrastructure in the state. SIIDCUL set up a large integrated industrial estate in Rudrapur that attracted companies such as Tata Motors Ashok Leyland HCL Technologies Limited and Schneider among many others. This flood of new business led to significant infrastructure growth in the area along with an influx of migrants from across India who were looking for jobs in these industries. Schneider set up its Rudrapur plant in 2009. Availability of land infrastructure facilities a cheap labour force and attractive tax incentives represented the major reasons for Schneider’s selection of Rudrapur as the site for its new plant. To quickly set up the operation old machines from the Bangalore plant were relocated to Rudrapur. Quality testing of products continued to take place at the Bangalore plant during the initial setup period and eventually in 2010 this process was moved to the Rudrapur plant.Schneider divided its business operations in India into three clusters each of which was led by a vice-president who oversaw operations at eight to 10 factories. Each cluster had three to four directors of operations who were responsible for plant-level profitability. Initially all senior plant managers reported to their counterparts at the main plant in Bangalore Karnataka in southern India but this decentralized form of supervision led to a lack of unity of command in the individual plants a situation that adversely affected operations. In 2010 the plant director at Rudrapur was given complete command of that plant and all senior managers reported to him (see Exhibit 1). The plant director reported to the vice-president at corporate office. Early Workplace Culture at Rudrapur A significant number of Schneider operators had been relocated from Bangalore to Rudrapur in order to run the new plant and train local hires. These workers faced a variety of issues in their new city such as language barriers and difficulty adapting to the extreme weather conditions of Rudrapur. As a result they jumped at any opportunity to return to Bangalore. This ongoing shifting of jobs soon created a transactional mindset among the relocated employees and their performance lacked a sense of ownership and responsibility. The Rudrapur plant employed over 450 workers 20 per cent of whom were permanent staff; the remaining 80 per cent consisted of temporary local hires. Because the local workers were not offered any formal training they found it difficult to match the productivity of the operators who had come from the main plant. This lack of preparation and some human resources (HR) issues resulted in low morale among the workers who felt unmotivated to improve their productivity. During the first few years of operation at the Rudrapur plant the corporate culture suffered from the workers’ limited sense of connection to the products and to the plant a low degree of involvement by senior management with the workers and the workers’ dislike of the senior managers’ authoritarian leadership style.Production IssuesWorkers at the Rudrapur plant were untrained in the latest methods of lean production and the five basic phases of the “5S” workplace methodology (derived from five Japanese words for “sort” “set in order” “shine” “standardize” and “sustain”) were missing. Thus the overall operation lacked this main component of a lean manufacturing system. Newer managers noted that tools were not stored in the proper drawers and areas the production line was haphazard and the production floor and surrounding area were not cleaned to management’s expectations.Rudrapur was located a significant distance from other manufacturing hubs so it faced the additional problem of long lead times for delivery of materials. This situation combined with unmet high production targets and low labour productivity led to a pileup of inventory at the plant in terms of raw material and work in progress. Since the plant output had a seasonal demand inventory targets fluctuated a factor that further exacerbated the inventory pileup.Due to these and other planning-related issues idle production lines were a familiar sight at Rudrapur. The plant often fell below its production targets and faced a constant struggle to keep the lines rolling. Worker productivity was low and there were quality issues with the products. The defect rate was high with customers returning a large proportion of products back to the company. Schneider’s head office believed that the problems at the Rudrapur plant were caused by external factors over which the management had no control. For that reason no corrective actions were initiated by the head office or by plant management.Acquisition of LuminousIn 2011 Schneider Electric India acquired a major stake (74 per cent) in Luminous Power Technologies India (Luminous) a well-known manufacturer of power back-up solutions for retail customers in India. Luminous was launched in 1988 by Rakesh Malhotra and had sales of approximately 11 billion Indian rupees (€170 million) in the year ending March 2011. The company was well known for its power inverters and uninterrupted power supply devices. This product segment had been growing at a compound annual growth rate of over 20 per cent in the last five years and was expected to grow at the same rate for the next decade. India experienced severe power outages during the summer season (April to August) and demand for Luminous products was highly seasonal in nature. Over the course its existence Luminous had been able to establish a reputable brand name in the power-supply segment. As a leader in a fast-growing market Luminous was a good strategic fit for Schneider Electric India. This acquisition helped Schneider triple its sales locally and made it the seventh largest operation in the Schneider group globally.Prior to the 2011 acquisition Luminous had appointed Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador in 2010. This brand-building strategy sought to project an image of excellent product quality by associating it with a cricketing legend like Tendulkar.Luminous planned to introduce a new product in 2014 the production of which was assigned to the Rudrapur plant. Starting in late 2013 the plant began to receive ever-increasing targets of manufacturing components for that particular model but in line with its past record the plant kept falling short of meeting those targets and its product quality fell far below expectations as well. Defective returns were high which did not bode well for the Luminous brand which had Sachin Tendulkar as its ambassador.Mishra Joins the Rudrapur TeamSamir Mishra held a master of science degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university and had worked with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (India) Mahindra Reva (India) Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Limited (India) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (United States) prior to joining Schneider as its director of engineering in 2012. In March 2014 Schneider Electric India appointed Mishra as the plant director of its Rudrapur plant. Mishra was given the overarching mandate of turning the plant around—specifically to successfully deliver on the new Luminous product line. Up to the time of this appointment Mishra’s experience consisted of managing small teams of engineers; he had no prior experience with managing workers at a plant level. Even so Mishra nurtured a passion for active people management and he welcomed the opportunity to move from a technical role into one of leadership. PLANT TURNAROUND A Plan for Change at RudrapurAfter taking over leadership at Rudrapur in March 2014 Mishra took stock of its operations. Upon a review of the reports on product returns he noticed that the plant rejection rate was around 96000 parts per million. An industry average plant rejection rate of 25000 parts per million was considered acceptable; the rate at the Rudrapur plant was almost four times that. Mishra was surprised at this poor state of affairs. Upon accepting the offer to manage Bangalore he had been assured that while the plant faced a major issue concerning productivity quality was not an issue. Mishra quickly realized that the head office was not being kept up to date on the quality issues so he arranged a personal meeting with the plant’s quality manager Anil Rao to get to the root of the problem.  Rao was adamant that the plant’s quality issues could not be resolved as quickly as Mishra was expecting. He also complained to the top management that Mishra was interfering in his functional domain. After some discussion with his superiors Mishra decided to dismiss the quality manager asking him to leave immediately. Within a week Mishra had appointed a new head of quality. From his two decades of experience in working with various organizations across different geographies and cultures Mishra had derived a three-pronged philosophy for running a successful business. He believed that customer satisfaction drove volume lean manufacturing minimized waste and motivated the workers and informed workers were more engaged and hence highly productive. To drive customer satisfaction Mishra believed the product should have high quality and high reliability. Moreover these traits should not come at an added expense; the product should be priced competitively. Mishra’s time in the United States had exposed him to the principles of lean manufacturing so he understood that minimizing waste and improving productivity provided effective ways to reduce costs. Finally he felt confident that employees who had a sense of ownership towards their product and company would be motivated to make sound decisions to improve quality and reduce waste. Mishra knew that if he could successfully implement his three-pronged philosophy he could improve the state of affairs at the Rudrapur plant. Dealing with Resistance Deciding to tackle the HR issues first Mishra planned to launch a number of HR and learning interventions to empower engage and energize the workers and improve productivity at Rudrapur. Most of his interventions were based on the belief that workers perform better when they possess a sense of ownership. Before he could implement his plans however Mishra’s changes met with some stiff resistance from the most unlikely of corners.Anit Singh who had served as the HR manager at the Rudrapur plant since its inception did not appreciate his new director meddling in HR issues. To his credit Singh had a proven track record of keeping the plant free from any industrial relations issues. Furthermore the plant remained non-unionized while all the other plants under SIIDCUL’s control were plagued with union issues. Singh was concerned that the plant’s temporary employees who constituted 80 per cent of Rudrapur’s workforce might raise demands to be promoted to permanent status if they began to feel empowered by Mishra’s planned HR interventions. In light of these concerns during discussions between the two men Singh presented Mishra with some strong arguments against such changes. Singh informed Mishra that the former plant head used to keep workers at arm’s length and had a highly directive approach to leadership; he was in the habit controlling the workers through Singh.Mishra shared “The HR manager and his style of functioning before I took over were highly controlling and directive. No dissent was [allowed from the workers]. I had to deal with Singh’s mindset which was more challenging than dealing with workers.” To deal with Singh’s concerns Mishra invited Singh to his cabin for a discussion over a cup of tea. Before Mishra could initiate the conversation Singh told him “You are playing with fire. Temporary workers may create industrial relations issues.” Mishra acknowledged Singh’s concerns but went on to request that Singh proceed with the suggested HR interventions. Further Mishra assured Singh that the HR department would be given the credit for all potential benefits derived from such interventions and if any of the interventions failed Mishra was ready to take the blame. Mishra listed the probable benefits which included lowering the plant’s attrition rate enabling workers to develop a sense of ownership and fostering a new feeling of security among temporary workers all of which would improve the engagement level of the workers. Eventually Singh understood that there would be no personal risk in the interventions and he agreed to follow through with Mishra’s plan. Human Resource InitiativesThe Collar SystemWith Singh on board Mishra started off by rigorously emphasizing a collar system. Trainees in the workforce wore a red-coloured collar on their shirts which was upgraded to orange and then green when they became experts in their sections and passed the requisite tests. This graduated process was designed to facilitate other HR interventions that involved peer learning and on-the-job training. Public functions were organized to congratulate workers as they graduated from one stage to the next. Once workers arrived at the green-collar level they became members of a high-powered group that could directly approach senior management with suggestions for ways to make the plant run more smoothly. Senior managers were asked to forward these suggestions to the director within 24 hours along with a brief analysis and plan of action to ensure quick decision-making and implementation. By quickly implementing many of the workers’ suggestions Mishra established himself as a leader who believed in empowering others. The implementations had the added effect of instilling a sense of ownership among the green-collar workers who numbered about 60.Training ProgramsAnother intervention that Mishra initiated—one that he liked to call the “Duality of Training”—was essentially peer learning. The green collars were specifically given the task of training the red collars which fostered close interaction between the trainees and the skilled workers. Plant engineers used to sit in on these training sessions to evaluate the trainers. The engineers’ input honed the skills of the green-collar workers and made them expert at their tasks.  Mishra also asked the line leaders to swap positions with operators on the line for a few shifts each week calling the process “Face the Management.” This intervention was initially opposed by the line leaders who felt that performing the tasks of an operator was a demotion. Mishra also heard concerns that temporarily allowing operators to run the line might create issues among the operators and line leaders. By outlining the expected learnings from the job-swap process Mishra was able to defuse the tension around the process and things went smoothly forward. Operators were expected to understand and appreciate the challenges faced by line managers and thanks to the job swap and managing the production line for a day the operators realized that the job of line leader was not as easy as they had previously believed. Similarly line leaders were exposed to the pain points of the operators and to the issues these workers faced in performing to their peak capability. Over a period of several such rotations this intervention fostered a sense of mutual respect between the operators and line leaders in place of the previous animosity. The process also facilitated empathy and meaningful communication in the workplace which had been missing up to that point.Communication EffortsMishra implemented a policy of having an open house each month where the plant’s workforce and the management team would discuss plant issues. At these meetings Mishra shared Schneider Electric’s vision for the plant with the workforce and regularly highlighted how the workers’ career goals were in sync with the vision of the plant. The goal was to instil a sense of belonging and cohesion across the workforce and bind the disparate groups with a shared vision.For his part Mishra started a daily routine of walking throughout the entire plant and assembly lines mingling with the workers. He was open to discussing any issues the operators faced on the line and he tried to come up with on-the-spot solutions. This daily communication removed the power distance perceived by many of the workers who finally began to see the management and workforce as a single team with a shared vision striving to improve the future of the plant.THE CHALLENGEProduction Targets at SchneiderThe Schneider India marketing function was an independent vertical that reported to the senior vice-president of marketing based out of the Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong. Schneider India’s marketing management team received a quarterly target based on the average yearly revenue target that had been fixed for its business operations. This number was reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis taking into consideration the actual production target as well. Based on this quarterly number set for Schneider India’s marketing team each cluster was assigned a revenue target. Further down the line the respective marketing managers who were each responsible for one or more plants set the product forecast based on the clients’ needs. The production target-setting process was dynamic and was linked to the revenue target set for the entire Indian operation. The production target of the plant was reviewed regularly and the targets for various months were updated in advance after a review process (see Exhibit 3).An Unexpected Jump in DemandSoon after Mishra joined the team at Rudrapur in March 2014 the Bangalore head office set a June 2014 production target of 5000 units of finished goods for the new Luminous product (see Exhibit 2). Two months later in May 2014 this target was revised to 27000 units. The sudden spike in demand was due to the Luminous team’s aggressive marketing efforts for the new product and it was essential not just to fulfil the demand but to fulfil it with quality products. Mishra and his management team were shocked by this sudden change in expectations. Several people felt that the plant could not supply the increased demand and they asked Mishra to negotiate lower targets with head office. Off the record senior management at the head office suggested the same approach advising Mishra to formally ask head office to lower the plant’s production targets. One senior executive from the head office privately advised him against accepting the order at all since failure to fully meet Luminous’s request could cost Mishra his hard-earned professional reputation. MEETING THE CHALLENGEConvincing Head OfficeMishra did not want to let the Luminous order slip away from the plant and he was keen to take up the challenge in spite of being advised against doing so. He spoke to his management team and presented them with a roadmap for how he planned to execute the order. Mishra’s plan included the introduction of a learning culture through a people-process intervention and the launch of a lean production concept that included a re-engineering of the production process. The members of the top management team were convinced by Mishra’s enthusiasm for meeting the challenge and they handed Mishra free rein to implement his ideas at the plant. They did however advise Mishra to act with caution. They realized his strategy would have to be put into place immediately before the plant’s issues hurt the market for the new product. Convincing the Team at RudrapurDespite considerable advice to the contrary Mishra decided to push ahead. He saw an opportunity in this challenge. Having tasted initial success with the HR interventions he felt this production challenge represented a growth opportunity for the plant. Mishra called his plant management team together for a meeting where he announced his intention of accepting the target and he discussed his plan to meet it. Immediately the heads of two departments—procurement and production—raised their protests. The procurement manager Vikas Choudhary was among the strongest opponents of Mishra’s plan to forge ahead with the increased order. Choudhary argued that accepting the increase in demand at the plant’s current production level would impose a severe inventory shortage on the plant and purchasing large amounts of raw materials in such a short span of time would be very expensive. The suppliers would demand a significant premium and freight costs would also increase significantly to ensure the faster transport of goods. Added to all of these logistics issues was the possibility that Rudrapur’s routine suppliers would not have the spare capacity to be able to match the plant’s short-term demand.Rakesh Razdan the production manager pointed out that the production line in its current configuration did not have the capacity to produce even half the output expected from the plant. Mishra accepted these concerns as genuine and appreciated the thoughtfulness of his managers during the meeting. He gave the responsibility of finding solutions back to the managers themselves promising them his full support in their efforts to meet this challenge and pointing out the benefits of being able to successfully re-engineer the current processes to meet such a demand spike.Creating Production Efficiencies The plant management team quickly realized that improvements in worker productivity alone could not match the required demand; it was time to implement lean and agile production techniques. Razdan was given the task of studying each process in the assembly line and identifying those that were creating bottlenecks. Upon finding a bottleneck he was given the authority to redesign the process and workflows to effectively “debottleneck” the line. Razdan also undertook an action study by observing the workers as they performed their tasks on the line. This activity allowed him to identify the processes that needed to be re-engineered to improve worker productivity. Razdan found many simple changes that could be quickly implemented. Minor changes (for example moving a raw-material feeding tray from a position below the line to a platform alongside it) improved worker productivity and line capacity significantly. The line operators were responsible for correctly aligning and installing electrical components inside the inverter bodies. The plant’s own research and development team shared the operators’ feedback (for example regarding the placement of various components inside the inverter) with the research and development team at Luminous and  these two teams jointly improved the product layout to make it easier and quicker to assemble. The testing bench for the inverters was also shifted to the Rudrapur plant from the Luminous offices thus enabling quicker identification and correction of assembly issues.Choudhary was asked to expand Rudrapur’s current group of raw-material suppliers. Finding it difficult to bring new suppliers on board in a short period of time he decided to ask Luminous to share its own list of suppliers. The Luminous management team initially balked at this request but soon complied when they realized that their latest product launch would collapse if they did not assist the Rudrapur plant. Two of the new suppliers were located in Pune and Vadodara in western India so Choudhary decided to visit them personally to persuade them to help the Rudrapur plant with its high inventory requirements in the short term. To save time Choudhary hesitantly asked Mishra for permission to travel by airplane instead of the usual train. Mishra approved this request on the spot and commended Choudhary for his commitment to the endeavour. Seeing Mishra follow through on his promise of support was a morale booster for the entire management team. THE PATH FORWARDMishra and his team had made a lot of progress in improving the overall function of the Rudrapur plant but there was still a long way to go and a huge production hurdle had yet to be crossed. It remained to be seen whether Mishra would be successful at turning the plant around and fulfilling the challenging order. Were his interventions likely to succeed? Could Mishra have adopted a different approach to meet the challenges? exhibit 1: organization structure of the rudrapur plantSource: Created by the authors EXHIBIT 2: PRODUCTION TARGETS FOR luminous’s NEW PRODUCT LINE IN 2014 Source: Created by the authorsEXHIBIT 3: RUDRAPUR PLANT PRODUCTION PER MONTH IN 2014Source: Created by the authors,13.0,"[{""start"":985,""end"":997,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1168,""end"":1174,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1294,""end"":1296,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1382,""end"":1385,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2297,""end"":2302,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2561,""end"":2566,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":9316,""end"":9322,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9352,""end"":9358,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9791,""end"":9797,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9739,""end"":9745,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9966,""end"":9972,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10109,""end"":10115,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10667,""end"":10673,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11168,""end"":11174,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10875,""end"":10881,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11236,""end"":11242,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11326,""end"":11332,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11419,""end"":11425,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11578,""end"":11584,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11871,""end"":11877,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12049,""end"":12055,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12431,""end"":12437,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12636,""end"":12642,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12947,""end"":12953,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13611,""end"":13617,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13799,""end"":13805,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13979,""end"":13985,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14259,""end"":14265,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14477,""end"":14483,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14601,""end"":14607,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14769,""end"":14775,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14805,""end"":14811,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15192,""end"":15198,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15270,""end"":15276,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16193,""end"":16199,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16439,""end"":16445,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17161,""end"":17167,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16885,""end"":16891,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18174,""end"":18180,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18335,""end"":18341,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18651,""end"":18657,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20220,""end"":20226,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20674,""end"":20680,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20685,""end"":20688,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20845,""end"":20851,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20986,""end"":20992,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21219,""end"":21225,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21310,""end"":21316,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21573,""end"":21579,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21466,""end"":21468,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":21478,""end"":21481,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":21540,""end"":21542,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":21832,""end"":21838,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21972,""end"":21978,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":21894,""end"":21900,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22209,""end"":22215,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22239,""end"":22241,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22336,""end"":22338,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22418,""end"":22424,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22432,""end"":22435,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22487,""end"":22489,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22500,""end"":22503,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22542,""end"":22544,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":22744,""end"":22750,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23553,""end"":23559,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26173,""end"":26179,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26245,""end"":26251,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26354,""end"":26360,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26379,""end"":26382,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":26314,""end"":26317,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":26694,""end"":26700,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26835,""end"":26841,""labels"":[""PERSON""]}]"

His prior experience as vice-president of product engineering in another leading global company matched IR’s desired candidate profile. The position was established to lead IR’s ETCs in India to a new path making them more efficient and effective. IR India established its ETCs in 2004 to support the product development activities of different IR businesses in India and abroad. Soon after he joined Madhavan found that the ETCs were not able to perform as designed. Projects were missing their delivery targets and there were major differences in the understanding of the requirements among the strategic business unit (SBU) teams which led to continuous changes in deliverables and resulted in customer dissatisfaction. Key employees of the ETCs were unhappy and some high performing team members left the organization. In general the ETCs were designed to cater to the needs of the various SBUs. However without effective support from these centres the company’s SBUs could outsource work to private companies threatening the existence of the ETCs as internal service providers. In early 2012 only a few months after joining the ETCs Madhavan was assessing the situation and determining whether he had the right organizational configuration to grow and sustain the ETCs in IR India. History of Ingersoll Rand: The parent companyIR was a US$13 billion diversified industrial company that had been operating in numerous countries since 1871 and traded under the stock exchange symbol NYSE:IR. The first invention that led to the establishment of the company originally called the Ingersoll Rock Drill Company was a steam powered rock drill (see Exhibit 1) invented by Simon Ingersoll (1818–1894). The drill was instrumental in excavation mining tunnelling and highway construction. The company further specialized in heavy tools developing other useful products such as the hammer drill jackhammer drill downhole drill stopper drill paving breaker air-operated hoists clay diggers riveting hammers chipping hammers and grinders. In 1902 the company developed the first portable compressor and began a compressor line of business to go along with its tool business. However the company was known largely for its rock-drill products and enjoyed a narrowly focused industrial company image until the year 2000. In that year Herbert Henkel the company’s chief executive officer at the time attempted to change that image by changing its logo. However his efforts met with limited success. In 2005 the company engaged in further re-branding exercises. It identified a strategy to more broadly change its image—“to inspire progress by unleashing the potential in people and technologies.” IR hoped to do this by diversifying from a maker of “construction/heavy machinery” to a company that would be active in the “diversified industrial” sector. Since 2000 IR also made a number of acquisitions particularly in the non-construction and non-heavy-machinery sectors (see Exhibit 1). The company decided to focus on integrated home solutions by investing in security technologies and manufacturing door locks. It made its largest investment in 2008 when it acquired Trane Inc. a global leader in indoor climate-control systems and solutions valued at $10.1 billion. In 2011 IR operated in various different business units including the following:Climate Solutions: Climate-control products delivered energy-efficient refrigeration and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment as well as refrigeration for transport stationary refrigeration and manager-controlled temperature environments. This segment included leading brands such as Hussmann Thermo King and Trane.Residential Solutions: A broad segment of residential products and services which were only available in North and South America provided safety comfort and efficiency to homeowners. This range of products and services included mechanical and electronic locks energy-efficient HVAC systems indoor air-quality products advanced controls portable security systems and remote home management products. This segment included such brands as American Standard Schlage and Trane.Industrial Technologies: The industrial technologies segment included products and services that enhanced energy efficiency productivity and operations. The range of products and services included compressed air systems tools pumps fluid-handling systems golf and utility vehicles and micro turbines. This segment included such brands as Club Car and Ingersoll Rand.Security Technologies: The security technologies segment included products related to electronic and biometric access control systems and software; locks and locksets; door closers; exit devices; steel doors and frames; portable security devices; and time attendance and personnel scheduling systems. The focus of the scheduling systems was on various different markets including commercial construction health care retail maritime transport education and government procurement. The brands included CISA LCN Schlage and Von Duprin.Ingersoll Rand in India IR started its India operation in Kolkata in 1921 making it the oldest Indo-U.S. joint venture company in India. In 1958 it opened a branch in Ahmedabad and established the first Indian manufacturing facility in Naroda Ahmedabad in 1965 where small garage-type reciprocating air compressors were produced. In 1978 IR established its second manufacturing plant in Bangalore for production of construction mining and water-well-drilling equipment. The company produced compressors in the United States and only customized them slightly in India in the initial phase. In 1983 the Naroda plant started assembling screw compressors and in 1989 packaging the centrifugal compressors under the brand name Centac. The centrifugal compressor was a breakthrough technology because it had a higher flow capacity it was more reliable and it required less maintenance compared to the reciprocating compressors commonly sold at that time. The plant also started manufacturing gas compressors in 1994 and received ISO 9000 certification in 2000. In addition the company acquired a majority stake in Wadco Tools which was based in Sahibabad India. The company launched an indigenously built hydraulic drifter drill in 2001. The plant at Naroda expanded to other areas of production as the company decided to shift the production of its polyethylene terephthalate packaging facility from the United States to Ahmedabad. The manufacturing of the rotary compressor facility was also shifted from Bangalore to Naroda. The Indian economy showed resilience in 2008–09 during the global economic crisis. In 2008 IR experienced weaker demand globally for its products and services and an internal analysis predicted that the outlook would be similar in 2009 as the markets saw a decline in North America and Western Europe which accounted for a majority of its sales. The revenues from the newly acquired Trane were also on a decline except in the Asian markets. Therefore it was important for the company to direct its focus to the growing markets in Asia including India (see Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3). In addition the lower cost of production in India meant that it was lucrative for the company to increase its focus on India. The years 2008 and 2009 saw an increased transfer of manufacturing from the United States and Europe to Indian facilities. The company had already transferred production of blowers to Naroda from Europe. The company wanted to move to India the production of four product families comprising 67 models which would result in an increase in annual export potential of $2.6 million. The company also started a repair and rebuild facility in Naroda to increase recurring revenues. IR’s former chairman and chief executive officer Henkel stated in an interview in 2009 that the company planned to make India a major manufacturing hub and that in the following three years the company planned to invest about $100 million in its Indian operations to double the size of the company. Energy efficiency climate-control and security technologies were key focus areas for the company in addition to local manufacturing innovation and market-centric product development in areas such as food preservation. The company was also looking to start a new manufacturing facility that would primarily cater to manufacturing products for the heating ventilation and air conditioning industry. It would also focus on products for transport air conditioning and food security. The foundation of this growth appeared to be customer-driven innovation a robust infrastructure to support after-sales services a significant investment in facilities to transform the company into a world-class manufacturing operation with a customer-first mindset and a drive to fulfil customer needs. In May 2009 for the first time the company named a president of Indian operations and outlined three focus areas for IR’s India operations: growth innovation and productivity. The Engineering and Technology Centres The ETCs were started in 2004 with ambitious goals: accelerate innovation; leverage key India-based competencies in advanced software design next-generation controls automation solutions mechanical design and systems simulation; and design energy-efficient competitive products and solutions for India and emerging markets. Every SBU of the company had its own set of engineers such as product engineers (for mechanical) or controls engineers (for electrical and software). The ETCs worked with the company SBUs in emerging economies and took on jobs that the in-house development teams of the SBUs did not have the time or expertise to complete such as new product development and product improvement. The two centres located in Bangalore and Chennai aimed to contribute to IR’s global growth by providing high-tech niche engineering solutions and technologies as well as providing support for regional product development. The centre at Chennai had been a part of Trane before it was acquired by IR in 2008.The focus of these technology centres was to support product development needs of the SBUs and create market opportunities “in India for India by India.” The ETCs were to invest 30 per cent of their time creating products and services for India and the rest creating products and services for the global businesses. The ETCs were able to develop B-100 a refrigerated transport technology for the Indian environment. The product—designed for “last mile” distribution of temperature-controlled and refrigerated products to ensure that perishable food items such as fruits and vegetables remained fresh during transport—was designed with a bare minimum of special features which was necessary and affordable to meet the needs of the local customer. Another product that was developed by ETC was the Trane residential split air conditioner with a Zigbee wireless remote control capability. Trane the air conditioning brand acquired in 2008 catered to the commercial space segment which included hotels and offices. Trane wanted to enter the residential segment in India because it was a growing market. The idea received instant support and a compelling business case was created. The climate-control business leader also liked the idea and prepared a product portfolio for both short- and long-term plans. The team developed an advanced interactive remote control device (see Exhibit 4) that was a key differentiator in the drive to educate the customer in the running efficiency of the air conditioning unit. Internal studies suggested that to feel comfortable within an office environment a differential of 5°C from the external environment was adequate. However people were known to keep their homes and offices at 18°C which did not allow the air conditioner to work efficiently. The industrial design of this residential air conditioning segment was completed and the product was launched. The product was well received but did not meet the forecasted sales volumes. It was felt that Trane’s lack of brand image in the residential segment its premium pricing and the connected home solution with automated locks made this product appear too futuristic for the Indian market. Structure of the ETCEach ETC was divided into two functions: mechanical product engineering and controls engineering. Mechanical product engineering dealt with both design and manufacturing aspects of a product. Controls engineering on the other hand used sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements were then used to give feedback through intelligent software logic to the input actuators that made corrections towards the desired performance. Controls engineering also housed the software development team. However because IR was a traditional engineering-focused organization the team’s software capability did not meet the desired level. The teams of mechanical product and controls were housed at each SBU who reported to the ETC head. New employees who joined ETC would become associated with a particular SBU and would dedicate time working for that specific SBU. Normally these employees would not be reassigned to a different SBU because they usually worked on specific product domains and technologies. This also meant that each SBU always needed to be ready to support these employees by providing an adequate number of projects. Problems Faced by the ETCsAfter his arrival Madhavan found that for many of the ETC projects its clients (i.e. SBUs) would change the initial project specifications at a later stage leading to confusion misunderstanding and delay in the project delivery. The project’s documents were unable to resolve such issues. Many unintended conflicts with clients emerged. The ETCs were at a disadvantage because in most cases they would have to accommodate the SBUs’ demands and work on the changed specifications. SBUs would also ask for periodical updates on the projects undertaken which the ETC teams working on the project would find difficult to satisfactorily provide in many cases. Often the engineers working on the projects would provide vague answers such as “we are on schedule.” However the concerned business unit would not be given details on aspects of the project that were completed or that remained to be done. If the SBU employees asserted that the ETC team had not delivered it was difficult to prove otherwise with available data. To address a query about the status of the project a meeting of all the counterparts involved had to be called requiring numerous meetings to obtain the status of all projects. Most projects would involve a team where members worked in different geographic locations. The updates would be sent by e-mail and it would be difficult for managers to monitor the status on a dashboard. Different SBUs also had different systems for product development making it difficult for the ETCs to align their own systems to all the different SBUs thereby adding to the chaos and confusion. The situation was even more complex due to some third-party vendors involved in the process. For example the ETCs would enter into a partnership with a vendor for a project’s specific need without specific deliverables confirmed upon the contract’s signing. This would result in the client (i.e. the SBU) not accepting the final output and the vendor sometimes refusing to redo the work claiming that the work was delivered as expected. This process would result in a blame game ultimately affecting the project at hand.Problems related to people development processesIR India also lagged behind in people development processes which were common across the company’s global counterparts. For example the U.S. company had a strong emphasis on development planning meetings between employees and their managers. However managers in India did not actively participate in the development planning process. In fact managers would just write down their employees’ development requirements each year with no follow up during the year. Human resources (HR) required employees to complete development planning forms every year. One of the managers in India recalled his experience with the development planning process stating that “development planning is just something on paper . . . we used to just copy and paste the same thing since the last five years. Nothing ever happened with reference to what we wrote.”The local talent review process was weak with no data available on key talent and successors. Talent prospects were weak at the leadership level and at the next two levels and no potential future ETC leader had been identified. There were no potential successors for 20 per cent of positions at the next level nor for 51 per cent of positions at the level after that. At the results announcements of each employee performance evaluation employee promotions were also announced. Many employees who were not promoted after the performance review (conducted biannually) would choose to leave the company at that time as they saw this as a twice a year opportunity to get promoted.In 2012 a new HR team was established by the IR India management. The new team headed by Savina Verma realized that a lot of work was needed to make the ETCs more efficient in terms of process and people practices in order to create best-in-class ETCs. In one of its first initiatives the new HR team implemented an employee pulse survey called “Your Ideas Our Future” (see Exhibit 5). The survey invited employees to identify their pain points and suggest ideas for improvement. One survey question asked the employees if they felt that they received the right kind of training. The feedback from employees to this question was generally negative. Employees felt that training was based mostly on managerial nominations and the choice of training programs for employees was left to the discretion of the manager. One manager recalled his experience with the training program as follows:Every year there used to be a program on root cause analysis. Every year we used to attend because my manager used to nominate me. So we used to attend. . . . I had undergone the same training three times. Did it add any value to me? Probably not because I never got to work on any project that really used that. Why this used to happen I will tell you. We used to do competency mapping. So every time they used to ask me “Do you know the subject?” I would say “Yes.” Then they asked “Have you implemented it?” I would say “No.” So they would say that is why we need to give you another training [session].After further probing from the HR team it was found that employees wanted technical training. For example geometric dimensioning and tolerancing training for mechanical engineers was common in the U.S. company but it was a skill that engineers in India particularly struggled with. There were several such technical areas where training was required but the HR team members had little information about the kind of technical competency needed because it was beyond their level of expertise.There also appeared to be a sense of distance between various units and hierarchy levels. For example the engineering services team and technical publication team at the lowest level of the business hierarchy did not see themselves as important parts of the organization. The engineering services team designed computer-aided design jobs based on input received from product designers. The technical publication team wrote the manuals for the products. The employees at this level could only be promoted to product engineer which was the lowest position in the mechanical and controls division. Individuals who loved to do technical work were promoted to people management positions. However only some of them were considered competent in their new roles. Other managers who had been promoted still preferred to do technical work rather than to manage people. The HR team however had little knowledge of the competencies of each manager. If a manager’s post for one of the client SBUs became vacant the HR team would find it difficult to identify a suitable successor. Additionally the transfer of talent from one project to another was difficult to manage. The ETC employee engagement survey reported an engagement level in 2011 of 68 per cent which dropped slightly to 67 per cent in September 2012. The Road AheadIn the years that IR existed in India the company grew from a firm selling imported products manufactured outside India to a company assembling and selling products in India. The recent strategy was to manufacture products in India primarily for the Indian market as well as for export. Because India was a price-conscious market it was important to develop relevant products to capture available gaps in the market. The ETCs were created specifically to partner with the Indian SBUs in climate-control products and industrial technologies to help them develop relevant products useful for emerging markets. According to NASSCOM the Indian offshore engineering research and development market was expected to reach $37–$45 billion by 2020 driven by an increase in global spending.In his new role Madhavan assessed how the ETCs could be leveraged to support IR and how best to align people places and processes with a strategy to prepare for the future. He knew that although the ETCs were supported by the global businesses the SBUs were also free to explore other private vendors for projects if the ETCs did not meet their needs. The ETCs were created to be innovation-driven units. It was difficult to think about increasing the rate of innovation when employees were dealing with organizational frustrations. The ETCs needed to change to ensure that they could develop as an effective organization focused on the IR goals.

Reporting to the bank’s vice president (Fraud) McKenzie had been appointed as head of Enterprise Fraud Strategy a department tasked with protecting RBC’s global customers from fraud. McKenzie’s immediate priority was to prevent fraudulent transactions by RBC’s own customers—a phenomenon called first-party fraud—by implementing a bourgeoning technology called social network analysis (SNA). The technology used predictive analytics to forecast the occurrence of first-party fraud. McKenzie reflectedAs we begin to deploy predictive analytics in preventing first-party fraud at RBC I am facing three managerial dilemmas. First how should SNA be used to bring down the ratio of fraud alerts to actual frauds at RBC? [As of October 2013] the incidence of false positives as they are called [is high] at 85:1. We must bring it down to 10:1. Second how should the cost of maintaining SNA protocols be reduced? SNA is characterized by data intensity. The process of extracting transferring and loading large data sets (known as ETL) is expensive. We have to strike a balance between fraud loss avoidance and operational efficiency. Finally how should the issues around systemic performance of SNA be resolved? We should reduce the time lag with ETL processes and make ETL real time.RBCEstablished as Merchant’s Bank of Halifax in 1869 and renamed the Royal Bank of Canada in 1901 RBC was Canada’s largest bank as measured by assets and market capitalization. The bank was also the largest card issuer in Canada with 6.5 million cards. It had about 80000 full- and part-time employees and served more than 15 million clients in Canada the United States and 49 other countries. RBC was driven by a vision of “earning the right to be our clients’ first choice.” The bank was pursuing this vision through three strategic goals: (1) to hold on to the leadership position in financial services in Canada; (2) to provide capital market and wealth management solutions outside Canada; and (3) to offer in targeted markets products and services complementary to its core strengths. The bank’s strategy for growth and profitability had remained consistent over the years while its structure was being fine-tuned regularly.In October 2012 RBC had restructured its business into five segments: personal and commercial banking (meeting the banking needs of individuals and businesses) wealth management (serving high-net-worth individuals) insurance (offering insurance and reinsurance products through various channels) investor and treasury services (serving the needs of institutional clients) and capital markets (comprising global wholesale banking). These five business segments were supported by two streams: technology & operations (forming the technological and operational bedrock for the organization) and functions (including finance human resources risk management corporate treasury and internal audit). McKenzie explainedWe have four objectives at RBC with regard to fraud prevention: reducing losses; enhancing customer experience lowering costs; and minimizing overall risk. In balancing these objectives we have given high weighting to enhancing customer experience in two ways. We have converted areas of potential customer inconvenience into areas of customer care. It is mandatory in every . . . wire transaction for example for a bank to make telephonic enquiries with the home branch which in turn calls up the sender with specific questions to confirm the veracity of the transaction. Invariably the protocol causes processing delays often hours. The information would also fall short of requirement. What we have done at RBC is to set up a dedicated team to call the sender directly within minutes. Customers appreciate such calls. The resolution time has come down from an average of two hours to less than 20 minutes. Secondly we look for customer service opportunities in deploying fraud solutions. We have leveraged big data to provide a snapshot of each customer to the call centre to make [customers] feel better about offers made during the conversation fulfilling specific needs. RBC had more than six million customers but it was conservative about who it lent money or granted credit cards to. The core anchor of RBC’s fraud prevention program was the service reference file (SRF) which was specific to each individual customer. Each SRF provided multiple frames of reference as it unfolded progressively over the life cycle of an RBC customer. Before the bank introduced SNA fraud detection fell under the domain of the bank’s Corporate Investigations Services (CIS) division. CIS was similar to an internal police service but had other ongoing responsibilities as well like offering protection services for the bank’s senior executives. There was a dollar threshold to be met before the CIS could intervene in a fraud investigation. The CIS would interview the suspects and build a case for prosecution while RBC would “demarket” a customer proven to be indulging in fraudulent transactions.FIRST- AND THIRD-PARTY FRAUDIn general a banking fraud had five characteristics. First it was uncommon: the number of fraud cases in a data set was small usually less than 1 per cent rendering the data set imbalanced and making it difficult to achieve predictive accuracy. Therefore it was necessary to reconfigure the data in a bid to restore balance and make it work and this was usually done by over-sampling the minority class or under-sampling the majority class. Second each fraud was preceded by a well-considered plan of action and was never ad hoc. Third fraud was not an individual phenomenon; it was invariably the result of a networked organization. Fourth fraud was typically concealed so well that it would not be noticed until after it had been committed and so required expert intervention for detection. Finally fraud methods evolved over time meaning that the detection experts were always trying to catch up with the latest techniques. The two main types of fraud were first-party fraud and third-party fraud. Third-party fraud happened when a third party stole the identities of honest/legitimate RBC customers and used these identities to steal money both from the customer and the bank. Third-party fraud was difficult to detect because fraudsters went to great lengths to seem like those they were pretending to be. The account was usually put through the conventional collections treatment to be written off over time as bad debt. Third-party fraud was subject to a fuller investigation because it was officially classified as fraud (unlike first-party fraud). First-party fraud occurred when customers applied for credit cards loans overdrafts or unsecured lines of credit with a clear intent to swindle their own bank. Their applications would be backed by a good credit history built by conscious design over several years (through well-orchestrated moves like making regular payments from their accounts and purchasing high-profile products from the bank such as property insurance). During the period of build-up the fraudsters would also use a technique called “cash cycling” wherein they would create an illusion of legitimacy by circulating amounts at intervals among several other accounts both within their own bank and at other banks. The accounts would all be part of a fraudulent network sharing some common data elements (like name date of birth phone number address Social Insurance Number etc.). The account behaviours would be normal and would therefore pass through conventional customer analytics without raising any red flags. Once they secured sufficient lines of credit however the customers would “bust out” within days purchasing high-priced goods and withdrawing cash from various accounts that would be seemingly disparate but interconnected. McKenzie described the disastrous effects of first-party fraud:A unique feature of first-party fraud is the exponential nature of the relationship between the number of fraudsters and the overall dollar value being defrauded. Ten fraudsters sharing 10 common data elements can create 100 false identities; and if they defraud four financial instruments per identity each with a CA$5000 credit limit the potential loss to the financial system would be $2 million. This ability known as connected explosion is a source of strength for organized crime involved in first-party fraud but it is also its Achilles’ heel. It is their connectivity that renders first-party fraudsters vulnerable to modern fraud detection tools like SNA which leverages the very connectivity that is the basis of first-party fraud.National estimates of the magnitude of first-party fraud were not readily available because first-party fraud was not officially classified as fraud although the value of consumer credit being written off as bad debt provided some indication. In the United States for example the Federal Reserve System reported that out of US$850 billion outstanding in revolving consumer credit US$85 billion was written off annually as uncollectible. Roughly 5 to 20 per cent (US$4 to US$17 billion) was misclassified as bad debt when it should have been categorized as first-party fraud. In the United Kingdom the British Bankers Association estimated that 10 to 15 per cent of bad debt losses incurred by the banking sector were from first-party fraud. The United Kingdom had a higher proportion of “transient” people—students short-term workers—leading to a higher rate of “bust out” behaviour. Similarly the value of receivables being written off by an individual bank provided a clue to the extent of first-party fraud among its customers within its own premises.Financial fraud affected all stakeholders in the value chain to varying degrees. For instance the Federal Bureau of Investigation had estimated that fraud cost U.S. insurers US$30 billion each year and that in turn insurance fraud cost the average U.S. family between US$200 and US$300 per year in the form of increased premiums. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS SNA was defined as “the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people groups organizations computers URLs and other connected information/knowledge entities.” The concept had its beginnings in the 1930s as a metaphor for complex sets of relationships among members of a social system. In the 1960s and 1970s SNA was positioned at the intersection of psychology anthropology sociology organizational design and mathematics. The application of graph theory in particular enabled SNA’s evolution from suggestive metaphors to analytical models. SNA’s perspective of networks of human relationships and its provision for their visual and mathematical analysis enabled data scientists to make key assumptions about the frequency quality and expansive nature of interactions among individuals. A flow of money between two individuals was seen as evidence of a firm and clear link between them. McKenzie defined and described the role of SNA in detecting fraud:At its simplest SNA identifies interpersonal relationships among a group of individuals and also provides a degree of evaluation (see Exhibit 1) but it is different from social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. SNA focuses on interactions among customers of financial institutions. It enables financial institutions to examine collaborations of their customers as individuals by pooling information from multiple data elements. SNA picks up nuggets of information from seemingly unrelated data in order to identify motives of people with suspicious transactions and pinpoint for pre-emptive action those on the verge of committing a fraud. The volume of transactions flowing through banks was so huge that spotting evidence of fraud was usually like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. However SNA was unique in the sense that it used a single uncovered needle to identify other needles in the haystack and expose rings or patterns of fraud. SNA had its own terminology consisting of nodes (representing persons locations or companies) and edges (establishing connection between two nodes). Each node was assigned a weighting in terms of the level of its crime and each edge was assigned a weighting in terms of the intensity of its involvement. Because networks were very large making it difficult to extract features from them the focus of investigation was usually the neighbourhood of a network. There was also a distinction between first-order networks (comprising direct associates of a network) and N-order network (comprising all others). The manner in which a network structure was represented was also critical. The link representing financial resources transferred between two nodes could be binary (attesting to the shared resource) absolute (stating the number of resources shared) or relative (stating it as a percentage). The visual representation was mapped to a matrix with rows and columns to make it easier for investigators to work with. Resources were represented as diamonds. Several sociological tests were deployed to convert network knowledge however minimal into a fraud detection tool; an example was “homophily” a term borrowed from sociology where it represented the tendency of people to associate with “people like themselves” (e.g. those from the same city or with common interests). In the context of fraud networks homophily meant that fraudulent people were most likely to be connected to other fraudulent people. Data sets containing statistically significant patterns of homophily were called clusters which for that reason were subject to closer scrutiny by investigators. An important step in SNA was the extraction of features. The focus would usually be on the first-order “neighbourhood” as RBC referred to it internally. It was known more generally as egonet. The neighbourhood (or egonet) had two components: the specific node of interest (known as ego) and its direct associates (known as alters). The features would be egonet-generic (measured through metrics like degree relative degree and triangle) and alter-specific (measured through metrics like similarity fraud score and weighted fraud score). The nodes were ranked in terms of fraud risk probability on lines similar to Google’s PageRank algorithm.Because fraudsters were densely connected to one another network models like SNA were known to perform better in terms of parameters like accuracy (by using skewed distribution as the basis to distinguish fraudulent customers) precision (by identifying potential high-risk customers from a long list) and recall (by detecting fraudulent customers).FRAUD DETECTION ISSUES AT RBCMcKenzie identified several objectives in moving forward with fraud detection systems at RBC: Lowering the False Positive RateWhen fully implemented at the beginning of each week the SNA system would provide McKenzie with a visual representation linking individual entities that would potentially perpetrate larger-scale frauds (see Exhibit 1). The system would also provide him with a percentage of claim alerts scoring high for fraud potential.Attempts to identify fraudulent customers would sometimes lead to alerts that proved incorrect after further investigation (i.e. the customers were not fraudsters). As a result the false positive rate (FPR) or percentage of alerts that were found to be honest customers was a key metric of any detection system. Lowering the FPR was critical in avoiding the expense of investigating false positives. If McKenzie received 85 alerts at the beginning of a week and only one of them was actually a fraud perpetrator the remaining 84 alerts resulted in a huge waste of time money and human investigative resources. Bringing down the FPR also meant focusing on the most “high-likelihood” cases. This focus was important because false positives created undesired side effects. The last thing a financial institution would want to do was chase off legitimate customers by considering them as potential fraudsters. A fraud detection system was amenable to a high FPR because there was no customer interface. One possible solution to this issue was to replicate the model used by credit card systems which had no provision for a high FPR because it had to approve or decline the transaction within seconds. The system had a direct interface with the customer who would be waiting for closure of the transaction. Reducing the Cost of the Analytics SystemsThe analytics system had cost RBC $10 million upfront. The recurring annual costs of hardware maintenance were about $1 million but the major cost element was due to the data intensity of the system. The system was processing 30 terabytes of data every week. The system had to find the data make sense of it extract the data and format it in a way that was actionable; all of this was costly and time consuming requiring dedicated resources in terms of both staff time and machine capacity.McKenzie was considering two cost-reduction options in the long term. One was to store the data in the online server (cloud) but this option contrasted sharply with RBC’s traditionally conservative approach to protecting its customers’ data. It was unlikely that RBC would pursue this cloud approach unless the requirements of the technology were very strong. The second option (one that demonstrated RBC’s desire to embrace the latest technologies) was to outsource ETL; the limitation here was that the vendor ecosystem had not developed enough and there were not many individual vendors with the scale that RBC required.Resolving Issues around Systemic Performance of SNAThis objective was also linked to the issues regarding data acquisition. A giant server at the data centre of RBC had crunched data for five days straight providing historical rather than real-time data. The slow pace of the batch-processing backend was in contrast to the frontend wherein a potential fraudster did not have to wait for five days to get a credit card or open a new account. An alternative would be to run the analysis over the weekends (lasting for two days at a stretch) with incremental processing during four consecutive weeknights. The second performance problem with SNA was the prevalence of what were known as “super clusters.” A super cluster was a formation in which everybody was linked to everybody else. A super cluster required frequent changing of entry thresholds so that the clusters were manageable. Every time there was a change the network had to be run all over again. In a network of for instance one million there were bound to be frequent changes in composition.NEXT STEPSFraudsters were currently being detected using rule-based logical searches. A customer was selected and the pattern of that customer’s financial transfers to other RBC accounts was investigated by applying rules that searched for internal transactions that would reveal the types of networks illustrated in Exhibit 2. The complexity of the rules required the detection of complex networks and the large number of RBC accounts made executing the rules through the RBC customer database a prodigious data-processing task.In considering his next steps McKenzie decided to look at the data from a recent analysis. This historical analysis was summarized in an Excel spreadsheet where 16 fraud detection rules had been applied to 13731 customers who had been found to be “fraudsters” or “not-fraudsters” following extensive further investigations. McKenzie was interested in finding out which rule or combination of rules provided the best fraud detection and how effective this rule (or combination) would be if implemented for all RBC customers. Since applying even a single rule was very time consuming and costly it was also important for McKenzie to know if he could discard some rules as ineffective.Exhibit 1: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSISSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: TYPES OF NETWORKSNote: The above diagrams provide five hypothetical social networks involving a small number of nodes to illustrate some of the wide variety of networks possible. The first network involving five nodes is close to the situation where everybody goes to everybody else. In the second network involving 10 nodes the ties are all reciprocated but the network is highly fragmented. The third network comprising five nodes is connected but shows a concentration of power. It is held together by a single node whose disappearance will disintegrate the network. The fourth network involving six nodes is also connected in the sense that everybody can go to everybody else—but through a large number of intermediaries. The fifth network involving 13 nodes displays a strong hierarchy and although it is connected the ties flow in only one direction.Source: David Knoke and Song Yang Social Network Analysis 2nd ed.

Che Jianxin (CheChe) founder chairman and chief executive officer of Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. (RSM) was providing the finishing touches to a growth-oriented action plan he termed the “1001 Strategy.” RSM was the largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in China. CheChe was to unveil the plan at RSM’s upcoming 30th-anniversary celebrations. While preparing to host the event at the sprawling New International Expo Center in Shanghai CheChe was also weighing his options on implementing the strategy:The “1001 Strategy” is about two action plans: building 1000 brick-and-mortar shopping malls focused exclusively on home-centric business all over China and integrating them into a seamless ecosystem of our offerings and their end-users through a single overarching Internet platform. The goal in the short term is to convert RSM into a technology-driven enterprise that leverages data in real-time. In the long term the strategic intent is to make RSM an O2O [online to offline] leader in China. Our guiding post in the imminent journey will be to take all complexities out of the ecosystem. We want to make it easy as a result for our customers and vendors to transact with one another and for our employees to facilitate those transactions.RSM had for many years considered physical stores as its core medium for reaching customers in its shopping malls. In 2012 however it launched online shopping with what was known in China as O2O (online to offline) functions. Targeted at individual consumers O2O enabled shoppers to order and pay for goods online and receive delivery at their nearest store offline. In 2015 RSM launched an upgraded version of O2O at selected shopping malls. It was targeted at business customers who would use the same functionality. However in both formats the model encountered two specific problems: the online service was not always consistent with the offline service and the prices displayed online often differed from those displayed offline. As a result of his pursuit of an integrated and interactive model CheChe was now moving towards an omni-channel strategy as his “1001 Strategy” was generally known worldwide. An omni-channel strategy provided an environment wherein customers shopped through a variety of online and offline channels while also switching easily and seamlessly between them. It was challenging in the age of the Internet for a home improvement and furnishings company to operate in a standalone mode of either brick-and-mortar stores or e-commerce. Building a new Web 2.0 mode integrating the two channels was crucial to exploiting business synergies. CheChe was keen that RSM should be the first to do so in its industry in China in an effort to stay ahead of its competitors. RSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015 mobilizing ¥5.6 billion. In mid-2016 it announced an initial public offering (IPO) on the A-share market to mobilize an additional ¥3.95 billion. The company had set aside ¥1.45 billion toward the construction of an exhibition mall ¥600 million for the construction of a unified logistics service system and ¥500 million for upgrading projects to the O2O platform. To execute its strategies RSM had also recruited a team of 200 professionals from top Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft. Bin Li (Lao Li) the new president of the company was to orchestrate the projects. Lao Li had previously worked as executive president at Suning Commerce Group Co. Ltd. a large home appliances retailer in China where he had headed its O2O project.THE OMNI-CHANNEL STRATEGYHistorically retailers displayed their products in brick-and-mortar stores and walk-in customers could examine the products and buy them. The launch of the commercial Internet in 1995 led to numerous channels in addition to the physical channel. For example customers could log on to company websites to buy their products online. They could order through designated kiosks and call centres and more recently through social media and mobile devices. Also launched were online pure-play companies in categories that did not require customers to touch and feel the products before buying—for example books movies music and office supplies. Their end prices were lower because the online distribution costs were lower. Very soon two trends had become evident. One was “showrooming” wherein customers would visit a physical store to examine merchandise and then make their purchase online. The other trend was “webrooming” wherein customers would research products online but visit a physical store to make their purchase. The latter was particularly evident in such categories as shoes sports equipment and cosmetics. Omni-channel retailing was the result of the convergence of the two ongoing trends. In omni-channel retailing a customer could switch channels—buy online and pick up in-store or use a mobile device in-store to research a product or make a purchase or buy in-store and make a return online. The retailer also gained a 360-degree view of a customer’s purchases across all channels. Two retailer capabilities were thus crucial to the success of omni-channel retailing: enabling the customer to order online and pick up in-store; and enabling the customer to buy in-store and return online. In building those capabilities technology came into play. Online retailers were establishing what were known as “storefronts” in their attempts to build customer relationships engage in real-time market research and provide hands-on assistance to those wary of shopping online. These retailers saw a storefront not just as a store but also as a space where opinions reviews social media and technology combined to create “connections.” A storefront was particularly relevant for products where the customer experience associated with touch and feel were crucial to closing the sale. Said CheChe:The proposed omni-channel platform will allow our customers to view design scenes for their home interior ideas examine the products of their choice write reviews save and share images with family and friends and purchase those products online. It will provide our tenants with an additional point of contact with potential customers. It will enhance our customer stickiness and increase their conversion rate resulting in higher gross sales at our shopping malls. The first-hand consumer data collected through the omni-channel platform further improves our data pool for analysis of and research on customer tastes and industry trends providing us and our tenants with valuable market intelligence.The HOME IMPROVEMENT AND HOme FURNISHINGS INDUSTRY in chinaChina’s home improvement and home furnishings industry had recorded sales revenue of ¥3704.1 billion in 2015. It was forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent over the next five years.The growth was being driven by four factors. First urban per capita disposable incomes were rising in China—having increased at a CAGR of 10.3 per cent during the period 2010 to 2015—leading to individual families demanding larger and well-furnished living spaces. Second the rate of urbanization in China was rising steadily: at 771 million the urban population had exceeded the rural population of 603 million in 2015 leading to demand for home improvement and furnishings products as migrants from the interior settled into their new urban locations. Third with the gross floor area having increased and the refurbishing cycle of existing homes having decreased to six years both the furnishing of new homes and the refurbishing of existing homes were on the rise in China. Fourth notwithstanding the rate of growth of the industry China’s per capita expenditure on home improvement and furnishings was lower at US$425.50 in 2015 as compared with $1033.40 in the United States and $867.10 in the United Kingdom indicating potential for market expansion.The industry had two major segments: business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B). The B2C segment consisted of households and individuals purchasing home improvement and home furnishings products for their own use and represented 64.1 per cent of the market in 2015. The B2B segment consisted of centralized procurement by real estate developers and wholesale purchases by contractors and represented 35.9 per cent of the market.The home improvement and home furnishings industry consisted of three broad product categories: furniture home decoration products and light building materials. Furniture was the largest subsector by retail sales value. The demand for light building materials was tied to new home sales and was therefore cyclical.China had more than 14000 home improvement and home furnishings manufacturers. Some were located along coastal export hubs serving as offshore manufacturing centres for overseas firms. Among those manufacturers some focused on the domestic market and manufactured and marketed products under their own brands. The majority of the brands had limited recognition among consumers because home improvement and home furnishings products were typically low-frequency and low-quantity purchases. The companies themselves had limited marketing expertise and low marketing budgets. Said CheChe:Raw materials such as wood plastic and metal are available in China in plenty. But because they are also commoditized low cost is the basis of differentiation at that phase of the industry’s value chain [see Exhibit 1]. The most important element of the value chain is distribution at the downstream end. That is where the source of competitive advantage lies. That is where a lot of innovation has also been happening. Other key success factors include brand recognition the location of the shopping mall the product mix offered by tenants and the ability to understand customer needs. The quality of customer service is also a differentiator.  China’s home improvement and home furnishings industry was highly competitive. Prominent foreign players included B&Q plc (the United Kingdom’s largest home improvement and garden centre retailer) and IKEA (a Swedish company which had located eight of its 10 biggest stores in China). Prominent domestic players included Easy Home (a furniture retailer with approximately 50 stores that marketed high-quality brands from around the world) and Ayd Home Furnishings (one of the largest retail furniture mall operators). Many other local operators worked in the brick-and-mortar space. Major competitors in the e-commerce space included Jia.com (which sold home furnishings and decoration) and the home improvement retail businesses of Tmall.com (the country’s largest B2C platform) and JD.com (another online B2C company).An important characteristic of the home improvement and furnishings industry in China was that Chinese consumers preferred the do-it-for-me (DIFM) model over the do-it-yourself (DIY) model. The latter was typical of retailers in North America and Western Europe which offered semi-finished products and simple tools to go with them thereby enabling customers to complete the work in their own homes. Chinese preferred finished products that were ready to go with no additional work needed. Their preference was both historical (i.e. driven by the low availability of tradespeople low labour costs and the need for convenience) and cultural (i.e. the DIFM model carried a premium in the mindset of a Chinese consumer). Another characteristic was aggregation at the point of sale of diverse product categories from diverse manufacturers. The system had evolved in China because product manufacturers had found it expensive to develop their own distribution channels or invest heavily in their own brands. They pooled their resources to build a one-stop shop a mall in its own right to attract foot traffic and generate sales volumes that would justify large investments in marketing. As a result the mall rather than the company was the brand. Consumers recognized and trusted mall brands over individual product brands. This approach was in contrast to the North American and Western European trends of standalone firms such as Home Depot becoming brands in their own right and marketing diverse products under a single brand. A recent trend was that many home improvement and home furnishings retailers in China were moving beyond their traditional brick-and-mortar presence and launching online shopping; however the transition was creating tensions for many of these retailers. For a majority of the industry products physical factors such as touch were important at the point of sale. Retailers were struggling with providing the suitable customer experience.China’s CHANGING CONSUMER PROFILEChina was in a state of transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. The transition had been triggered by several government actions aimed at increasing national incomes. For example the Chinese government was progressively increasing the retirement pension coverage in urban areas (it had increased by 40 per cent from covering 250 million people to covering 350 million by 2015). It was also launching several financial-sector and industrial reforms which would lead to new job creation countrywide. The process of urbanization was also fuelling consumption-led growth. The consumption of upper-middle-class and rich families was estimated to account for 55 per cent of all consumption and to contribute 81 per cent to the total consumption increment by the end of 2016.An important trend in China’s consumer profile was the growing weightage of the “mainstream” consumer (defined as having an annual income of between $16000 and $34000) accompanied by a shrinking weightage of the “value consumer” (defined as having an annual income of between $6000 and $16000). The percentage of value consumers among the urban population was expected to decrease from 82 per cent in 2010 to 36 per cent in 2020 while during the same period the percentage of mainstream consumers was to increase from 6 per cent to 51 per cent of the urban population (see Exhibit 2).The mainstream consumers would comprise 167 million households or nearly 400 million people who would be the trendsetters for consumption. In terms of spending patterns three broad shifts had already become evident in China. First mainstream consumers would be more willing to spend on discretionary items (which included home improvement and home furnishings) as a result of those items becoming affordable to increasing numbers of consumers. Discretionary categories were forecast to show the strongest overall growth at 13.4 per cent between 2010 and 2020 (see Exhibit 3). Second mainstream consumers would be trading up to high-priced goods because they were aspirational about the way they lived and their perceived social standing. Third mainstream consumers would be among the most dedicated and sophisticated of online shoppers and would seek such shopping conveniences as easier price comparisons unique assortments of products freshness of goods quality of service and a social networking experience.China’s online retail market was already the world’s largest with e-commerce accounting for more than 13 per cent of the country’s total retail sales of consumer goods. In top-tier cities roughly 90 per cent of Internet users and 70 to 80 per cent of consumers as a whole were shopping online. As Chinese consumers enjoyed the options and transparency available online they were also becoming increasingly choosy often visiting four to five sites before reaching a purchase decision according to McKinsey research.Overview of RED STAR MACCALINERSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015. In mid-2016 it announced an IPO on the A-share market. By the end of 2016 RSM had opened its 200th mall. It had in fact announced in 2012 its goal of opening its 200th mall by 2020. The goal had been accomplished four years ahead of schedule. By June 20 2016 RSM had become China’s largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in terms of three metrics: number of shopping malls (181); operating area (11814928 square metres) and geographical coverage (129 cities). The company had generated revenue of ¥8.76 billion and net profits of ¥4.37 billion for the year ending December 2015 (see Exhibit 4). RSM had 17086 full-time employees. Its mall tenants had their own employees only at the sales counters.CheChe had founded the company in June 1986 with capital of ¥600. A high-school dropout CheChe had taken up carpentry with his apprentices in the city of Changzhou in the province of Jiangsu. By 1988 they had put together 500 sets of furniture and sold them for $80000 before setting up a furniture warehouse in 1992. It was a year later that CheChe thought of leasing a shopping mall focused on furniture. He rented a decrepit building divided it into small shops and rented them out to small individual furniture traders. The idea became so successful that he replicated the model to establish 20 similar malls in cities big and small in Jiangsu Province. Within a year he had progressed to purchasing freehold land in metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai on which he built malls. In 1998 CheChe switched to the franchise business model. Franchising required less capital on his part because the investment was shared with the franchisee. The model ensured faster geographical expansion nationwide. Said CheChe:In 2003 we launched garden-style malls which are environment-friendly and followed it up in 2005 with what we called “experience shopping” by combining the Chinese traditional store mode with the Western shopping mall mode. In 2008 we opened a new park-style home furnishings mall in Shanghai as a flagship store for home furniture brands from around the world. Built on an investment of $1 million and housing more than 2500 individual stores the mall has a monorail the first of its kind in the world spiralling its way up and down six floors ferrying shoppers. In 2014 we brought in the concept of “spatial art” wherein live theatre performances averaging 40 per annum are held at RSM malls for shoppers to enjoy free of cost.The business model of RSM was built on a combination of portfolio shopping malls and managed shopping malls. By June 30 2016 RSM had 56 portfolio shopping malls and 125 managed shopping malls (see Exhibit 5). The former were spread over a total area of 4457050 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 95.4 per cent. The latter were spread over a total area of 7357877 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 92.2 per cent. Portfolio shopping malls offered comprehensive services to their tenants including designated shopping space staff training sales and marketing daily operations and management and customer services. In exchange RSM received a fixed monthly rent and management fees. Managed shopping malls provided full-scale operating services to their business partners including site selection construction consultation design and decoration tenant sourcing and daily operation and management. In exchange RSM received fees during different stages as part of the contract management agreements.Most of the portfolio shopping malls were located in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities providing recurring and predictable operating income through rent and management fees. Most of the managed shopping malls were located in Tier 3 and other cities. They were asset-light. Said CheChe: Our hybrid expansion model is one of a kind in the Chinese home improvement and furnishing industry. It has created high barriers to entry. It is difficult to replicate. We have firmed up prime locations in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities for our portfolio shopping mall footprint. There is nothing left for our competitors present or potential to source. We also have deeply entrenched industry relationships supporting our managed shopping mall footprint. Our success with the hybrid model has led to a virtuous growth cycle for us our partners our tenants and our customers.RSM was shifting its focus from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where most of its malls were located to smaller county-level areas where urbanization was accelerating.RSM had expansion plans for the future in its core business of mall development. It had identified attractive market opportunities in the 2500 Tier 3 and other downstream cities across China. According to RSM each such city could support at least one branded shopping mall. RSM would have a first-mover advantage on the strength of its asset-light strategy which could generate rapid growth and high returns on capital without straining the company’s cash flow. It had already shortlisted the cities it planned to expand into in the next three years based on size population local market conditions and the disposable income of residents. The company was working on launching a “mini mall” format of 15000 to 30000 square metres in some of those cities.Since its inception RSM had positioned itself as a trading platform for the home improvement and home furnishings business. The imminent launch of the 1001 Strategy had led to the company being repositioned as a “home-centred” enterprise that was extending its reach to five interrelated industries: residential real estate home decoration home commodities (e.g. appliances vases and curtains) finance and service. The company was also entering into three non-core sectors aimed at reinforcing its core offerings. The first was consumer and vendor financing. Customers were in need of financing because of the high costs of home improvement and home furnishings products. Vendors were in need of financing to cover their rental expenses and procurement costs. RSM had taken the first step in this regard by establishing a consumer financing joint venture with Haier and Greentown in December 2014. It had applied for its own consumer financing licence. The second non-core section was logistics and fulfilment services. By leveraging the company’s existing nationwide footprint these services were meant to provide so-called “last-mile services” such as warehousing assembly and delivery. These services helped vendors manage their inventory better and reduce their costs of operations and enabled customers to track their shipments from the comfort of their homes. The services enabled RSM as a company to aggregate its orders and deliveries leading to better control over resources. It also enhanced the stickiness of manufacturers vendors and customers. Another potential area of related diversification was home design services which prevailed at the upstream end of the industry value chain. RSM was planning to identify talented home design professionals invest in their start-ups and endorse their business with its premier brand. In exchange the start-ups would agree to purchase 80 per cent of their home improvement and home furnishings products from RSM shopping malls. The move was aimed at promoting agile and nimble innovators within a large organization. In addition RSM was also expanding into bulk procurement services connecting home improvement and home furnishings suppliers and vendors with construction contractors and real estate developers. It was focusing on small- to mid-sized developers who did not have the scale to set up their own centralized procurement. RSM was the first in the home improvement and furnishings retail industry in China to implement a comprehensive enterprise resource planning system which was known internally as “Star Cloud.” It had been rolled out across the group at a cost of ¥80 million. Star Cloud was serving two objectives: it enhanced operational management particularly with regard to inventory and it helped commercialize the data collected through its system to better analyze consumer preferences. Said CheChe:The home improvement and furnishings industry is characterized by product offerings where physical touch remains a valued aspect of the purchase decision. Hence an online strategy will be successful only when combined with a physical mall network. The shopping experience is an integral part of our brick-and-mortar stores. Our online platform will be designed around the customer experience and our strategy is to leverage our shopping mall network to offer a synchronized shopping experience for our consumers.THE WAY FORWARDRSM’s 1001 Strategy had two components: building 1000 malls as physical infrastructure and building one Internet platform.On the physical front RSM had shown evidence that it could deliver. Having already built a total of 181 malls by mid-2016 RSM opened its 200th mall at the end of 2016. The company had then set a new target of building 1000 malls.The new malls would still be part of either portfolio shopping malls or managed shopping malls. They would be designed to upgrade from home malls to family malls permeating not only Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities but also key counties from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The new malls would be integrated into the local business community infrastructure and the public facilities serving local residents and consumers.On the digital front RSM had already designed a mobile application (app) for its malls in Shanghai and a peer-to-peer platform for furniture buyers commercial tenants and factories partnered with the malls. The way ahead would involve replicating these offerings enterprise-wide. Lao Li the company’s president had outlined three 100-day plans for implementing the omni-channel strategy: launch the fundamental platform in the first 100 days; launch the full chain product in the second 100 days; and open for sharing and collaboration in the third 100 days. In deploying the digital medium Lao Li needed to manage the tension between the traditional brick-and-mortar model and the e-commerce model.Executing the 1001 Strategy would also be an opportunity for RSM to take a fresh look at determining its core competitiveness. Lao Li saw the emerging competitive advantage in terms of three components: RSM as a brand RSM as a repository of omni-channel talent and RSM as a digital enterprise. Lao Li was keen that the user interface be easy and convenient to handle and that all the complexity should be limited to the back end. Simplicity should be the hallmark of the 1001 Strategy. He was keen on having no more than four layers of reporting relationships (i.e. President → Person in charge of the business unit → Person in charge of department → Common employee). This reporting structure was in contrast to the approximately 17 to 18 layers prevalent in traditional enterprises of the size of RSM.

(Wal-Mart) had shaped purchasing power for more than a million U.S. workers. Wal-Mart’s economic muscle was so profound that one could assume that the corporation’s wage policies had had a significant impact on the struggle for a living wage in the United States—but did this assumption have any merit? Wal-Mart had set the benchmark for low-cost retail labour practices. Understanding how Wal-Mart set the agenda with wages invited the investigation of a few pertinent questions: What socio-economic forces were in play and what was the environmental context that shaped Wal-Mart’s approach to managing its labour force? What were Wal-Mart’s wage-related practices and how did the hourly rate paid to workers by the corporation affect prevailing wage rates? Finally what were the benefits for Wal-Mart if it pursued a progressive wage rate agenda related to a living wage and what were the disadvantages if it did not? BackgroundThe living wage discussion was not unique to the United States nor was it solely a contemporary topic. In 1906 John Ryan noted professor of moral theology and industrial ethics at the Catholic University of America declared that a living wage was not merely a right but a natural right possessed by any labourer. Ryan asserted that a clear distinction existed between a personal right and a social right and argued that a living wage was not something society owed to a worker or something that should be provided to a worker for reasons related to the common good but rather a condition where the worker was entitled to a living wage as a moral and natural right.For many people in 2017 a living wage had become an idea synonymous with economic justice. The notion of a living wage had its genesis among industrial workers in the United Kingdom in the 1870s when organized labour used the living wage campaign to challenge the prevailing supply and demand policy of the time. This situation influenced the progressive movement in the United States as well as contemporary events involving the minimum wage that transpired in both Australia and New Zealand where the idea of a living wage was embraced by trade unions and minimum wage laws were enacted in the 1890s. The idea of a living wage subsequently spread to the United States and Canada. One definition of the living wage argued that a living wage should be a standard of living substantial enough to ensure that no more than 30 per cent of one’s working income would be spent on housing. Although the precise method of calculation varied with the contextual variables chosen a living wage was calculated by identifying annual living expenses and then translating that information into an hourly wage rate appropriate to the specific geographical context of the worker. Typical annual expenses used in this calculation included food child care medical costs housing transportation miscellaneous expenses for personal care items and income taxes. The hourly wage was further refined after the household was categorized (that is as one adult one adult and one child two adults with one working and so forth).The Living Wage DiscourseThe first living wage municipal ordinance was enacted by the city of Baltimore in 1994 but it affected only a scant 1500 workers. This victory for higher wages resulted from activism by a coalition of interfaith religious denominations labour organizations and community groups. Organized at the grassroots level a combination of 50 Baltimore churches had joined forces with the union of American Federation of State county and municipal employees and various lower-wage workers. This church activism was a response to soup kitchens and food pantries that were full of the working poor. These workers not only needed ongoing assistance from churches in the Baltimore area but were also frequently forced to turn to public assistance (i.e. food stamps and subsidized housing). Opponents of a living wage argued that the practice established a wage floor that caused companies to hire fewer employees. The result of this wage floor would be higher unemployment and a deadweight loss a cost society endured because of market inefficiency. According to this thinking overpaying a worker prevented other low-skilled workers from finding a job. Supporters of the living wage disagreed and argued that higher wages had other benefits such as more satisfied employees a lowered turnover rate decreased recruiting costs improved morale and higher worker productivity. Moreover opponents of a higher wage standard also predicted that many businesses that could not afford to pay a higher wage would have to close or be forced to lay off workers—in short wage increases made it much more challenging for businesses to operate and for low-skilled workers to find jobs. Others pointed out that the federal wage level had not considered regional variations in the cost of living. Some states reacted to this cost of living discourse; by 2014 for example 11 states had indexed the minimum wage standard to the cost of living. There was evidence that instead of causing a reduced workforce paying a higher wage caused employers to cut labour costs in other ways. In the United Kingdom for instance after raising hourly wage rates some employers later reduced overtime pay rates removed premiums for evening or weekend work ended meal allowances or even reduced pension contributions.Some opponents predicted that an increase in prevailing wages would affect the cost of food. It was further suggested that a rise in food prices resulting from the cost of higher wages would vary by industry. One study found that food prices would likely increase overall by about 4 per cent if the federal minimum wage increased by 10 per cent and suggested that price increases in the fast food industry would probably increase the most by about 10 per cent with the same percentage increase in wages.Proponents of a living wage argued that higher wages would grow the economy by creating new jobs. There was a precedent that paying higher wages increased profits and turned workers into consumers with more money to spend but the lessons that had been learned in that scenario in the past were not applicable to 2017’s global context. In the early 20th century Henry Ford had doubled the daily wage of his assembly line workers to what he considered a living wage amid widespread criticism from business leaders and stockholders; the move dramatically reduced turnover and reaped Ford even greater profits while he turned his workers into consumers of the product they produced. Minimum-Wage Workers and the Living WageThe struggles for a living wage and the federal minimum wage movement in the United States were related. Essentially economists and researchers were at odds about whether a mandated minimum wage grew or destroyed jobs. Confusing matters further was the impact that inflation had in eroding wages. In 1968 for instance a US$1.60 per-hour minimum wage was worth $10.56 per hour by 2017’s standards yet the 2017 federal minimum wage standard was $7.25. By 1996 because of inflation the impact of the minimum wage had deteriorated about 30 per cent while simultaneously wages continued to stagnate forcing many low-wage workers onto community and public assistance. Since 2009 U.S. worker productivity had increased while wages declined—and those workers at the lowest end of the pay scale were affected the most. Despite the efforts of some cities and counties economists remained divided over the issue of a $15-per-hour minimum wage. Some argued that the replacement of workers with technology was a bigger issue others stressed the need to proceed incrementally with any wage increases and still others cautioned about the risks to industries that did not pay the rate and provoked a general slowdown in hiring.Contrary to widespread belief minimum-wage workers were not mainly teenagers working their first jobs while still attending school. Besides young people entering the job market minimum-wage workers quite often included part-time workers older workers and women of any ethnicity. Overall in 2012 minimum-wage workers comprised about 2.1 per cent of the hourly workforce—approximately 1.5 million workers. More than 60 per cent of those workers were concentrated in the retail/wholesale leisure and hospitality industries. When hourly workers at or below minimum wage were classified by gender ethnicity and work status it was noteworthy that in every category women greatly exceeded male workers as recipients of minimum wage or below. In 2012 about 5.2 per cent of hourly workers in the private sector were at or below minimum wage compared to 1.9 per cent of public sector hourly workers. Additionally there were differences in workers at or below minimum wage between industries in both the private and public sectors. The percentage of workers at or below minimum wage in the leisure/hospitality industry was especially great when compared to other areas of the private sector and was more than four times greater than the wholesale/retail industry which followed the leisure/hospitality industry in number of workers at or below minimum wage.Local living wage ordinances differed from federal minimum wage legislation in their ability to have an impact on a large number of workers. Most living wage ordinances at the local level were limited in their scope and especially in the number of workers affected. The context was often about companies that had received contracts from a municipality or local government entity or some type of business assistance in the form of grants low-interest loans tax abatements and so on. Thus in huge cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco only a small minority of the overall workforce benefited from local legislation and in smaller towns and rural areas the number of workers affected was inconsequential. In fact these local ordinances had little impact on workers with low skills or those living at the poverty level although there was some evidence that the poverty rate was lower in locations benefiting from the ordinance where city contractors received meaningful assistance. State minimum wage laws often contained provisions to induce employers to provide health insurance holiday pay or even to index the wage to inflation. Many cities developed their own wage ordinances. In Los Angeles in 1997 for instance the Los Angeles Living Wage Ordinance included a provision that allowed employers to put a small portion of the hourly wage into employee health benefits but research indicated that the practice had little effect on persuading employers to provide health care benefits. The ordinance seemed to have reduced turnover and absenteeism but it may also have prompted the employment of a greater number of part-time workers.  By 2001 all locally enacted living wage ordinances in the United States affected only about 100000 workers. Despite this number some people continued to view the living wage movement with optimism. The largely grassroots approach created a sort of national momentum for the concept and living wage activist organizations sought to expand the idea into the national discourse more forcefully. Wal-Mart and the Living WageWal-Mart’s wage policies affected taxpayers (who were ultimately the payers for public assistance programs) and the public sector which faced increased demand for services. Wal-Mart’s low wage employment model did not provide workers with enough income to contribute to meaningful consumer spending and thus became a negative drag on the economy. At a wage of $10 per hour even a full-time worker in the average state made only slightly more than half the income needed to support a family. Americans for Tax Fairness declared that employees who made $10 per hour still needed taxpayer assistance in the form of food stamps and Medicaid to survive.One way to explore the notion of a living wage was to compare what a corporation said it would do regarding compensation to what it actually did. This comparison was essentially a discussion about espoused versus enacted values. Wal-Mart clearly understood the impact this discussion could have on public opinion and on its corporate reputation. On Wal-Mart’s corporate website for instance the section titled “Opportunity & Advancement” positioned Wal-Mart regarding a living wage and provided a detailed reasoned and deliberate exposition of its strategy. Wal-Mart asserted that it offered competitive pay—but especially stressed that the corporation offered upward mobility.  A similar promotional piece on Wal-Mart’s corporate website touted the $2.7 billion the company had invested in higher wages training and education. The website reported that 75 per cent of store managers had started as hourly employees and now earned between $50000 and $170000 annually and that more than 300000 employees had been with the company 10 years or more. This investment included the development of 200 training academies in the United States and classroom and sales training for hourly supervisors and department managers. A website infographic indicated that after one year the project had resulted in over 200000 promotions the conversion of more than 150000 part-time positions to full-time positions and 8000 new department manager positions. Developers expected to serve more than 500000 trainees at the new academies. When it came to compensation Wal-Mart had raised the pay of more than 1.2 million workers at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores in the United States. On the other side of the discussion posted public comments about this information included those by a worker who had inquired about the lack of upward mobility in her department.Wal-Mart had other contextual challenges: over the past few years many stores had gained a reputation for having dirty bathrooms shelves that were either empty or inconsistently stocked checkouts that were tedious or employees who provided a generally unhelpful or unfriendly shopping experience. Even though overall revenue in 2015 showed that earnings were positive sales had plunged for five straight quarters in Wal-Mart stores that had been open for at least a year. Considering that only 16 per cent of stores had met their customer service goals Wal-Mart executives reevaluated their minimalist approach to workers’ pay. 2015 was a pivotal year for Wal-Mart. Under pressure from investors the corporation’s new executive team sorted through analysis related to the company’s slide in sales and the news was unfortunate. Besides the environmental challenges at many of its stores Wal-Mart’s profits were contested by global currency manipulators intense competition from brick-and-mortar rivals and even more intense competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s online juggernaut. Wal-Mart reduced its workforce consistently from 2008 through 2013 even as the square footage of its stores increased by 13 per cent. In February 2015 chief executive officer (CEO) Doug McMillon admitted to employees watching a company-wide video feed that Wal-Mart’s obsession with cutting labour costs had been a mistake and that accordingly the company would be making adjustments. However certain Wal-Mart labour practices seemed ambiguous in intent; for example employee hours were restricted to less than 40 hours per week and 34 hours was considered full-time for in-house practice. These policies meant the corporation did not have to offer benefits such as health care to those employees—a noteworthy practice from the largest private sector employer in the United States with about 1.5 million employees. At $10 per hour the annual salary for those workers amounted to less than $18000. Employees making that annual income could not afford the necessities of life yet their employer had an excess of $480 billion in gross revenues and more than $16 billion in profits in 2016. In 2015 Wal-Mart’s CEO received a salary of $19.4 million—more than $9323 per hour based on a 40-hour week.  	Some commentators suggested that Wal-Mart could easily afford to pay a $15 per-hour minimum wage and asserted that the company’s low wages had been subsidized by the taxpayers who paid for public assistance. Wal-Mart’s wage-related policies affected not only those taxpayers but also the public sector in general which faced increased demand for services. At $10 per hour an adult with one child qualified for both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; in short this family was eligible for food stamps. Wal-Mart’s Walmart 2015 Diversity & Inclusion report committed the corporation to $10 an hour or more for employees as of February 2016. Competing claims about Wal-Mart were not always easy to sort out. Wal-Mart’s announcement in early 2016 that it would raise wages again for its hourly employees was largely met with skepticism. A spokesperson for Making Change at Walmart a labour advocacy group pointed out that following the much-marketed pay raise to $9 per hour in 2015 workers subsequently saw their hours cut and annual pay raise reduced. Wal-Mart’s sheer size and profitability contributed to the public pressure on the corporation to increase its wages. In fact even though a considerable amount of minimum hourly-wage workers in the United States worked at smaller businesses Wal-Mart’s detractors focused on the corporation as one that had engaged in an incredible amount of commerce in terms of sales and paid its CEO a mind-boggling salary yet still refused to pay higher wages so its employees could avoid having to apply for some type of government living assistance.  Wal-Mart’s detractors included many former employees who published articles and commented in public forums. Alleged abuses of employees included Wal-Mart purposefully capping workers’ weekly hours which in some instances ranged from 29 to 39 per week. Work schedules were changed almost weekly in many cases which resulted in chaos for work–life balance when it came to family medical appointments and other life activities common to most workers. Employees were not allowed to leave when their shift ended until the store manager granted permission for everyone to do so after ensuring the store was sufficiently clean. Additionally employees were not allowed to use their cellular phones to call babysitters during this indefinite period. DiscussionProponents who advocated for Wal-Mart to increase its wages pointed out the potential benefits of paying a $15-per-hour wage. Foremost of these was the expectation of a ripple effect of purchasing power throughout the retail industry. Proponents also cited the efficiency wage theory—the idea that paying higher wages than the prevailing rate would translate into loyal motivated workers with high productivity. Wal-Mart had not paid an efficiency wage in the past so a shift to a minimum rate as high as $15 would be a game-changing decision. Significantly Wal-Mart had the economic power to set the retail agenda when it came to wage practice. The corporation’s pay increases to $9 per hour (in 2015) and to $10 per hour (in 2016) were quickly copied by other large retailers including Target Corporation (Target) Ross Stores and T.J. Maxx Companies. Target rapidly followed Wal-Mart’s lead on pay increases in early 2015 and matched the increase to $9 per hour for workers and then in 2016 again matched Wal-Mart with an increase to $10 per hour. According to one source Target’s move reflected strong competition in the retail industry for workers and was a response to union-inspired pressure in some cities across the United States. A Target spokesperson would not disclose how many of its approximately 341000 employees received a raise; however employees who had been making over $10 per hour were entitled to some sort of annual merit raise or pay increase. Yet the move had some downsides for Target: the increased labour costs affected its gross margin projections for 2016 and Barclays analysts downgraded the company’s stock. Further aside from the anecdotal evidence from part-time employees that Target responded to the rising labour costs by cutting the hours of some employees Target was also plagued by union-building activities.  Ross Stores followed Wal-Mart’s lead and matched $1 per hour wage increases in 2015 and 2016 and like Target experienced lower earnings forecasts. The story was the same for T.J. Maxx Companies which included Marshalls and HomeGoods with two pay increases of $1 per hour matching Wal-Mart’s moves. T.J. Maxx Companies CEO Carol Meyrowitz remarked that the move was needed to retain the best talent and to remain competitive. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) had already been paying higher wages than Wal-Mart and Target but it also raised employee wages in 2016. Although not specifically linked to Wal-Mart’s increase with sales up and cardholders on the increase Costco’s chief financial officer Richard Galanti remarked that the move was partly because of the physical nature of many of the company’s jobs and that the company wanted to be known as a premier employer. Like Wal-Mart competitors Target and Costco featured expressions of espoused values on their corporate websites. Target was committed to issues such as sustainability community relations volunteerism diversity and corporate social responsibility. It had an extensive list of benefits and perks available to employees—but what was missing was any reference to the quantity or quality of its compensation for employees and there was no mention of a minimum or living wage standard. Like Target Costco made no direct mention of compensation or a minimum wage standard on its corporate website. Costco too provided extensive information on employee opportunities benefits and career possibilities. In some regions of the United States there had long been clear indications that it was time for Wal-Mart to reconsider wage increases. Over time California and New York two of Wal-Mart’s most profitable markets raised their states’ minimum wage to $15 per hour. One prediction for Wal-Mart was that store sales would increase between $4 and $28 for every dollar spent on payroll at that store. By some estimates the tremendous cost of replacing employees was a bigger issue. Turnover costs at Wal-Mart were estimated to be $4275 per lost employee so improving retention through higher pay was possibly a reasonable approach. In sum Wal-Mart’s wage-related activities had been so important to the U.S. economy that the results of these somewhat tentative pay increases could have far-reaching consequences. Questions and ChoicesDid Wal-Mart’s wage-related practices influence the struggle for a living wage in the United States? There was little doubt this was true for the retail industry which cut across all regions of the country. Wal-Mart’s competitors had quickly matched each of Wal-Mart’s recent pay raises in the context of competing for workers; Wal-Mart’s wage increases must also have been considered trendsetting moves for other typically minimum-wage industries such as hospitality and prepared food. It was significant that some states had recently mandated a $15 per-hour minimum wage over the coming few years.What were the socio-economic forces that influenced Wal-Mart and what was the environmental context? Certainly the living wage and federal minimum wage movements were active socio-economic forces that continued to affect Wal-Mart deeply. Wal-Mart viewed labour as an area for cost-cutting and savings on operations. Labour was not considered a valued resource for the company as evidenced by the manipulation of workers’ schedules to keep them below 40 hours per week—a decision that committed the corporation to a reduced workforce—and by the other heavy-handed labour practices used by some managers. Paying low wages resulted in many Wal-Mart workers applying for public assistance. In the political/legal dimension because the federal minimum wage had proved inadequate for providing workers with a living wage legislation was passed at the local and state levels that mandated an incremental increase in wages over time founded on thinking that favoured a living wage. When Wal-Mart’s wage practices were viewed over time it was clear to the company’s top leadership that the harsh approach to labour management had failed miserably. It was also evident from publicly posted comments by former employees that Wal-Mart’s labour practices had been a source of tension in some stores. The corporation faced two basic choices: it could return to the mainly cost-cutting and compliance-oriented labour practices of the past or the corporation could embrace a culture of engagement and participation with its employees. Because of its impressive cash reserves and continued profitable operations Wal-Mart could likely afford to pay a higher wage even with the huge number of workers it employed. The disadvantages Wal-Mart faced if it continued with its past wage practices included loss of morale and loyalty in its workforce increased union-building efforts criticism from public sources and loss of reputation and serious worker retention problems. The advantages for Wal-Mart if it embraced a paid wage closer to a living wage and pursued labour policies of engagement and participation with employees included better morale higher productivity lessened union activity and higher retention of workers. Regardless of what it chose to do Wal-Mart needed to establish consistency across its stores’ practices. The caveat was a lack of research on the effects of paying an efficiency wage though it was recognized that higher labour costs caused lowered earnings forecasts. This result seemed to be an obvious outcome but those labour costs might also have been offset over time by savings from higher retention and increased productivity. Wal-Mart’s leadership was at a crossroads of strategic choices: how should the corporation proceed? ENDNOTES,17.0,

In recent years the company had been struggling with operating profits and by December 2014 the company had experienced three consecutive quarters of decline. In addition to its financial issues the company’s former president and CEO Patrizio Di Marco and creative director Frida Giannini had abruptly stepped down leaving the company with limited strategic direction and a desperate need to once again be at the top of the luxury retail market. Bizzari was faced with a tough decision and difficult task: how could he turn Gucci around?Industry DynamicsThe luxury goods market had experienced a growth rate of 7 per cent in 2014 exceeding €850 billion. The current core within this market was personal luxury goods in which Gucci competed. A Deloitte report defined personal luxury goods as the “aggregation of designer apparel and footwear (ready-to-wear) luxury bags and accessories (including eyewear) luxury jewellery and watches and premium cosmetics and fragrances.” In 2014 this market reached sales of over €223 billion tripling its size over the past 20 years. However due to the slow recovery following the financial crisis in 2008 the growth rate was slowing to a rate of 5 per cent per year. As the economy began to recover and establish a “new normal” demand for luxury goods continued to rise. This was primarily driven by Chinese Japanese and U.S. consumers. Moreover specifically within the personal luxury goods segment accessories captured over 29 per cent of the market more than the next two largest categories of apparel and jewellery and watches.The shopping experience for consumers was split between shopping at stores that offered single brands (mono-brand shopping) shopping at multi-brand stores and shopping online. With the high growth in the industry competitors were aggressively vying for market share in terms of growing their brand strategies assortments or product offerings. The luxury industry was unique in that large conglomerates owned a majority of the individual luxury brands within their portfolios. In order to offer a diverse selection to individuals conglomerates expanded through mergers and acquisitions of individual fashion houses. For example Gucci was held under the Kering group umbrella. The fashion market in particular was further segmented into various categories (see Exhibit 1). Many luxury fashion houses operated mainly in the haute couture and ready-to-wear segments. Haute couture was the smallest of the segments; here designers created exclusive and limited pieces to be worn by celebrities and the upper echelon of society. As luxury retailers began looking to reach other segments in the market many established ready-to-wear lines. These lines were much more accessible to high income individuals and were more widely available in the markets either through online or boutique locations. Some fashion brands had further entered into more accessible product line extensions to target younger audiences who strove for brand association at more affordable prices but Gucci had never employed this strategy. Fashion House and Conglomerate StructureVarious roles within luxury fashion houses contributed to streamlined design processes and collections that fit with the brand image. The creative director or director of design headed the design department coordinating all the designs of each product line. This person worked alongside the product manager and purchasing directors to make sure each collection was created on time and was synonymous with the brand image of the fashion house. Regional directors or sales directors were in charge of either geographic areas or product lines to market and merchandise.Traditionally luxury fashion houses created haute couture collections. Members would design made-to-order items for exclusive lists of private clients according to strict guidelines which included having a minimum of 15 staff members and creating a minimum of 50 original pieces for each of two seasons in January and July. Over the years designers began to create ready-to-wear collections that were more accessible to the market and were less difficult operationally due to standard sizing with no alterations. These designs were presented at multiple shows almost six months ahead of the season. Most designers created over 10 collections per year.Gucci’s Group: KeringKering was a global group that operated in various lifestyle sports and luxury goods markets. The group’s revenues grew over 4 per cent by the end of fiscal 2013 to €9.748 billion. Kering was in charge of 19 different apparel and accessory brands. Specifically within the luxury retail space Kering dominated with brands including Bottega Veneta Yves Saint Laurent Balenciaga Alexander McQueen and Ulysse Nardin. Gucci was considered the group’s flagship brand and over 55 per cent of the revenue in Kering’s luxury division stemmed from this brand. Kering’s operations and brand distribution spanned over 120 countries worldwide.Luxury Fashion Brand CompetitorsGucci’s primary competitors were other major luxury fashion brands that were either independent fashion houses or held under conglomerate umbrellas. Moreover given the nature of each fashion house Gucci further competed with companies and brands under the Kering umbrella (see Exhibit 2). Louis Vuitton Established in 1854 Louis Vuitton Malletier SA (Louis Vuitton) had continued to dominate the luxury retail industry with its recognizable print and assortment of products including ready-to-wear collections leather goods and other accessories. Behind the powerful luxury brand was the group LVMH Moët Hennessy–Louis Vuitton (LVMH) which owned over 70 other distinct brands. In 2013 LVMH generated over €29.149 billion in revenue and €9882 in just the fashion and leather goods business group. In 2013 Louis Vuitton re-established its dominance in the luxury industry by creating new interpretations of iconic pieces and timeless collections and by continuing to collaborate with major artists and designers for limited edition collections. Given its creative momentum in 2013 Louis Vuitton continued to expand its presence in various locations worldwide including London Tokyo Beijing Venice and Munich. However its distinct brand had brought unwanted attention from the counterfeit market. As a result the brand had been through multiple legal disputes surrounding the mass production of counterfeit purses and items with similar or identical prints. BurberryFounded by Thomas Burberry in 1856 Burberry Group PLC (Burberry) was one of the most distinctive global luxury brands. Burberry took pride in maintaining its British identity and enjoyed a strong reputation related to design capabilities innovation and craftsmanship. The brand had carried itself through decades of quality design including adapting its design for the First World War. Moreover Burberry had established a well-known pattern and creative pieces such as its trench coat which was synonymous with the brand. In fiscal 2014 Burberry generated over £2330 million in total revenue. In fiscal 2014 Burberry operated 427 locations worldwide. The company’s strategy was to continue its global expansion through opening over 25 stores worldwide enhancing its digital marketing strategy and continuing to leverage its brand recognition into complementary segments.ChanelGabrielle “Coco” Chanel established this well-known luxury fashion house in 1909. Primarily known for its haute couture collection Chanel International BV (Chanel) continued to dominate in every specialization including ready-to-wear collections leather goods perfume and cosmetics. In comparison to the other luxury brands Chanel was one of the higher-priced fashion houses. The company’s global operations consisted of both boutique locations and items sold at high-end third-party retailers. In 2013 the company generated €$6.862 billion in revenue. Given the smaller size of this family-owned private company Chanel operated its businesses through regional heads that reported to the global CEO. This structure differed from that of many luxury conglomerates including Kering and LVMH as it provided regional managers greater autonomy in managing their areas of the business. Yves Saint LaurentFounded in 1961 Yves Saint Laurent SAS (YSL) began as an haute couture house. In 1966 the brand expanded into the luxury ready-to-wear segment through Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and it had since been known for capturing “the impulses of youth freedom and modernity.” In 2013 the brand generated €557 million in revenue and continued to add company-operated boutiques to its existing 115 locations. As of June 2013 YSL had invested in establishing its online presence by adding over 30 more countries to its e-commerce platform. The brand also continued to utilize social media to build a loyal brand following and promote its products. As of December 2013 YSL was one of the most popular brands on Twitter Inc. with more than 1.7 million followers on the social media platform. The brand continued to enhance its modern fashion nature by collaborating with various artists: in March 2013 it established the Music Project with celebrities including Daft Punk Courtney Love and Chuck Berry all embracing pieces from the YSL collection.Fast-Fashion CopycatsThe increasing power and growth of fast-fashion companies including Zara SA Forever 21 and H&M placed pressure on the luxury retail market. All of these companies offered affordable alternatives and they had often been accused of stealing the creative designs or implementing similar creations in their collections. Given the cheap production costs and efficient operations of many of the fast-fashion companies they were able to outpace luxury retailers. Because there was a six-month lead time on the delivery of collections in luxury goods fast-fashion companies were sometimes able to bring their versions of luxury designs to market before the original brands were for sale. Company HistoryInauguration of GucciFounded in 1921 by the talented leather manufacturer Guccio Gucci in Florence Italy Gucci established itself as one of the world’s most recognizable luxury fashion brands. As a successful leather manufacturer Gucci was known for its ability to create timeless classic pieces out of various materials. Due to the League of Nations’ embargo against imports from Italy in 1935 Guccio Gucci found creative ways to incorporate other materials including hemp and diamonds to create the company’s signature print. As a classic Italian brand Gucci did not expand outside of Italy until 1953 when it opened its first store in New York. Although Guccio Gucci passed away 15 days after the store opened the brand continued to establish well-known pieces including its iconic loafer with metal horse bit. In 1994 Tom Ford was appointed as the creative director of the company and established its first successful collection focused on jet-set glamour and sexy pieces in 1995. The brand was known for risqué commercials and advertisements that drew attention and media coverage for the brand in turn creating brand awareness. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s Gucci continued to relaunch and revamp fashion-forward pieces and various celebrity features including its beloved Jackie bag renamed for the former U.S. First Lady Jackie Kennedy. In 2000 the company experienced a hostile takeover bid by LVMH; however it was ultimately purchased by investment firm Pinault Printemps Redoute (PPR) now known as Kering which was looking to expand its portfolio of luxury brands. Gucci continued to establish itself as the “it” brand of fashion in the early 2000s and continued to expand into various complementary avenues including fragrances with the help of Giannini who joined the company after previously working for Fendi. In 2004 Ford left the company after he and PPR failed to come to terms on a new contract and in 2005 Giannini became creative director. As of 2015 the company had over 514 company-operated locations and headquarters in Italy.Recent HistoryFollowing her promotion as creative director Giannini continued to work within the template of Ford’s designs. The brand was product focused; however given the quickly changing trends of consumers especially in the fashion industry Gucci found itself experiencing creative stagnation and its overtly sexual marketing approach was no longer as successful. The brand began to lose its credibility and by the second half of 2013 Gucci experienced three consecutive quarters of declining sales. With over 55 per cent of revenues for Kering being driven by Gucci (see Exhibits 3 and 4) Kering was highly concerned about the brand’s ability to remain competitive in the ever-changing luxury market.Opportunities Given increased competition in the luxury goods industry and the rise in fast fashion many observers felt that Bizzari needed to reposition Gucci. In December 2014 Kering announced that Giannini would be leaving Gucci. Under pressure from Kering and dealing with the departure of Giannini the brand had no creative direction to move forward. Industry observers recognized an immediate need for a decision in the increasingly competitive personal luxury goods market. Repositioning and RehiringGiven the limited success of the previous three quarters industry observers began to wonder if Gucci’s brand needed a new direction; what would a new brand position entail? Ford and Giannini had left the company with an image and direction that had been successful for decades and had only recently began to lose credibility in the market. Was this just a bad period? Was it time for Gucci to divert itself from the sexy image for which it had been known for so long? If Gucci were to reposition itself what would its new image be and what message would the company send? Moreover Gucci needed to find a new creative director. Typically directors needed to have several years of experience in the industry as they would be responsible for the brand image and all the collections of the company. The company had some candidates in mind and long lists of individuals with decades of experience at luxury firms. In the luxury fashion industry it was common to switch firms and change directors. However industry observers were intrigued by one candidate: Alessandro Michele. Michele had been with Gucci’s creative department since 2002 and brought a young flair to his work. He was not as well-known as the other candidates nor did he have as much experience. However he had been with the company through many stages and understood the nature of the business. Picking the right creative director was key in this situation as this position held the key not only to Gucci’s performance but also to its relationship with Kering and its shareholders. Thus industry observers wondered how perceptions of the company would change depending on whether it hired an insider or a new celebrity outsider.Digital Marketing InvestmentsLooking at Gucci’s major competitors observers wondered whether this was the time for the company to establish a greater digital presence. In 2012 Kering had launched a digital strategy to revitalize its online presence by designing an interface for each brand’s website. In 2013 Kering entered a joint venture with online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter Group (Yoox) to distribute its brands and boost their e-commerce presence. In 2013 Gucci was ranked 38th out of the best global brands (Zara was ranked 36th; H&M was ranked 21st; and Louis Vuitton was ranked 17th). This ranking not only incorporated brand value and equity but was also based on brands’ digital and social media influence. By 2014 Gucci had dropped to 41st while Zara and H&M had maintained their positions and Louis Vuitton was ranked 19th. With brands like YSL continuing to expand their digital platforms and marketing strategies what should Gucci do next to remain competitive in this market?Product Line ExtensionWith the success of accessible luxury brands including Marc by Marc Jacobs Armani Exchange and DKNY Bizzari wondered if it was time to consider entering the affordable luxury market and creating an alternative line at lower price points. This strategy had driven growth from a younger consumer market and generated significant income for other brands. In luxury consumption millennials were three times more likely to be driven by trends than older consumers. Was it time for Gucci to consider following these other brands? The brand had stayed away from this strategy for fear of brand dilution; however could this segment be a new way for Gucci to grow? The DilemmaIn short Bizzari was faced with several interrelated decisions. In regard to Gucci’s brand position he needed to decide whether the company’s positioning should remain as it was created under Ford or if it was time to change the perception of the brand. Following this decision he had to decide whether it would be better for the company to hire internally or externally for a creative director. Additionally what digital investments if any should the brand make? Was this the time to focus on building a digital strategy? Lastly should Gucci attempt to create a product line diffusion similar to some of the other luxury brands? If so what should be the new line’s value proposition? All of these decisions would end up determining the future of Gucci’s empire.

He realized his company which he had set up in 2007 was growing and doing reasonably well in the Indian pharmaceutical market. By 2016 the company had achieved sales revenue of ₹500 million and by 2017 it had registered a 31.8 per cent growth over the previous year and achieved sales worth ₹670.2 million (see Exhibit 1). Kureshi thought it was natural for the company to set an ambitious growth target of nearly 50 per cent in 2018 aiming for a net revenue of ₹1 billion.He set the target for the current year keeping in mind his vision for MRL in 2020: a pan-Indian presence and sales revenue worth ₹2 billion. By 2017 MRL had a strong footprint in the western states; in order to realize his vision Kureshi decided to expand rapidly over the next year expanding into the northern part of India in July 2018 the southern part in October 2018 and the eastern part in March 2019. To do so the company had to answer a few urgent questions that would be key to deciding its sales targets: How should the sales organization be designed? What would be an appropriate sales force structure? Should the company opt for a generalist sales force structure or a specialist sales force structure? What was the optimal size for the sales force? What processes should the company follow to design the sales territories?company BACKGROUNDMaha Research Labs which was set up in 2007 with an initial investment of ₹3 million five employees and seven brands was a manufacturer and supplier of pharmaceutical products including included imports and exports. During its initial three years the company had marketed its products in eight sales territories and Kureshi had taken care of all the marketing and sales activities. The company began its expansion in 2010 by marketing 22 brands in 10 sales territories. By December 2017 the company had a portfolio of 50 brands and 75 employees. The company was committed to delivering high-quality international-standard products to Indian and overseas markets. It followed good manufacturing practices and all of its products were procured from government-approved pharmaceutical companies that adhered to proper quality controls.MRL’s product line included analgesics antibiotics anti-allergy medications cough syrups and a range of nutritional products (see Exhibit 2). Its product portfolio was focused and its distribution network was broad: three carrying-and-forwarding agents and more than 100 stockists distributed its products to customers through retail pharmacies in different sales territories (see Exhibit 3). This network gave the company distinct strategic advantages that facilitated both integration and consistently good performance in the competitive pharmaceutical market. SALES MANAGEMENT AT MAHA RESEARCH LABSThe company’s biggest promotional investment was its sales force—people who worked hard to build customer relationships with the right focus and targeting enhance call efficiencies acquire new customers and increase the accountability of resources. Kureshi believed that an effective sales force was essential for pharmaceutical companies and central to maximizing coverage improving sales and optimizing costs. He felt that a well-structured organized and forward-looking sales force would guarantee consistent revenue growth and profitability. According to Kureshi “a more organized and efficient sales force meant less wasted time and more productivity.”Sales OrganizationUntil 2017 MRL had thrived with a location-based sales structure and a generalist sales force. The generalist salespeople sold all the company’s products in their designated sales territories. This approach was similar to the structure of most competitors with a product range such as MRL’s. The sales team was divided according to geography. The major advantage of following a location-based structure was that it reduced selling expenses avoided duplication of effort and reduced the travel burden on individual sales representatives. The company tried to maintain parity between the number of sales representatives and the number of customers in each geographical region.Pharmaceutical companies that had specialized ranges of products for cardiology cancer and diseases of the kidney lung and liver preferred a specialist sales force structure. Most leading and multinational pharmaceutical companies were moving toward a specialist sales force structure as generalist salespeople might find it difficult to explain new complex and high-margin drugs. A specialist sales force structure was expensive and it involved duplication of sales efforts and increased travel time for the sales team.While MRL’s decision regarding sales targets hinged on past performance the decision regarding sales territories depended on the number of potential physicians in a particular area. As of March 2018 MRL’s sales force was made up of 50 professional sales officers (PSOs) and seven area sales managers (ASMs). Eight PSOs grouped geographically reported to an ASM. The ASMs were answerable to a zonal sales manager who reported to Kureshi. Each new PSO underwent 14 days of training at the company’s facility and all PSOs attended an annual week-long refresher course in the same facility. ASMs worked with each PSO for three days each month for field training and performance reviews.Role of a Professional Sales OfficerPharmaceutical selling differed from regular selling and the PSOs were the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry in India. They were directly responsible for both generating demand and ensuring an unhindered supply of products in their sales territories. In terms of demand generation the PSO’s role was similar to that of a missionary: selling by persuading physicians and other health professionals to prescribe the company’s products. This role included reaching out to physicians to share knowledge on product formulation usage and dosage; taking feedback about products; addressing queries and complaints; keeping physicians aware of recent developments in the industry; delivering samples; and building a rapport with individual physicians. The PSO’s job was to get more physicians to write more prescriptions to help increase sales revenue and profits.On the supply side the PSO ensured that products were available for consumers by reviewing the sales data and stock levels of retail pharmacies and dealers. PSOs were also responsible for product withdrawals due to breakage or expiry. Hence they acted as intermediaries between the company and its customers. The non-selling responsibilities of PSOs included maintaining records (e.g. client-information analyses of sales data) and preparing various reports (e.g. daily call reports expense reports travel plans and monthly reports). MRL also used its sales force to gather information on customers changes in the general market environment and key consumer insights. The most important skills and competencies companies sought in PSOs were good communication skills a result-oriented focus good product knowledge good negotiation skills and strong ethics.PSOs were required to make at least 10 physician calls and six pharmacy visits per day and a minimum of 220 physician calls and 132 pharmacy visits per month. They also had to divide their time between physicians in different categories spending 50 per cent of their time dealing with A-class physicians 30 per cent with B-class physicians and 20 per cent with C-class physicians. The PSOs each had 180 customers of which 50 were in class A 100 were in class B and 30 were in class C. They also had to achieve the required growth of value and volume targets on monthly and yearly bases.Sales ProcessMissionary selling was the main sales style used in pharmaceutical selling; thus a PSO’s role was to convince physicians of the effectiveness of a branded medicine they could prescribe for their patients. Missionary salespeople were also referred to as detailing salespersons. Detailing which involved discussing the features and benefits of products with physicians and pharmacy retailers provided a platform for physicians to learn about products’ indications dosages side effects and prices. Kureshi stressed the importance of the sales force’s effectiveness in the different selling activities; it was critical for PSOs to execute marketing priorities. PSOs were required to follow a disciplined planned calling system for regular visits to physicians pharmacy retailers stockists and hospitals. PSOs were also instructed to detail no more than three products to each physician in order to maximize the likelihood that physicians and others would recall the brand.THE INDIAN PHARMAceutical INDUSTRYThe Indian pharmaceuticals market witnessed growth at a compound annual growth rate of 17.90 per cent during 2005-16 with the market increasing from US$6 billion in 2005 to US$36.7 billion in 2016 and it was expected to reach US$55 billion by 2020. The primary growth drivers for the industry on the demand side were an improved standard of living increased accessibility of drugs the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases increased penetration of health insurance and a thriving export market. On the supply side primary growth drivers included a skilled workforce and low-cost manufacturing capabilities. The industry also had ample government support in the form of several key reforms and investment commitments.By 2020 the Indian pharmaceutical industry would likely become the sixth-largest in the world by absolute size. Some notable trends in the industry included increased expenditure on research and development (R&D) growth in the export of generic drugs (20 per cent of the global market) due to the national industry’s cost advantage value creation through joint ventures and acquisitions (more than 70 per cent of all merger and acquisition deals in the past three years) international expansion and reduced wait times for drug approvals and new facilities.The pharmaceutical industry was divided into four segments: (1) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) producers; (2) formulators; (3) contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS); and (4) biosimilar markets. The API producers manufactured common and generic drugs. These firms had low bargaining power and played on high volumes. However a smaller number focused on niche drugs and enjoyed high margins. With a 7.2 per cent market share India was the world’s third-largest generic API merchant. It was also the global leader in terms of drug master file applications in the United States. Most Indian companies started as API producers but with the advent of patents in 2005 and increasing competition some had moved up the ladder to become formulators (e.g. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited). While the API producers dealt with bulk manufacture of drugs the formulators made tablets capsules and other formulations. The domestic market for formulations was US$11.2 billion in 2016. In 2016 India was the largest exporter of formulations by volume and 12th in terms of export value.The third segment CRAMs was where India’s skilled workforce and cost-effectiveness gave a distinct advantage to this fragmented industry of more than 1000 players. The last segment the biosimilar market segment was small (US$300 million in 2015 in India) but was expected to grow to US$40 billion by 2030 as a large number of biosimilar drugs would be going off patent in the United States.While the top four players in the highly competitive Indian pharmaceutical industry held 20 per cent of the market share the top 10 companies held 39 per cent of the market share. The first strategy of these companies was achieving cost leadership through the acquisition of API producers. Second they invested in R&D to achieve differentiation; and third they focused on new markets or segments. The opening of the country to 100 per cent foreign direct investments and India’s attractiveness as a manufacturing hub meant that domestic firms would soon face tough competition from financially robust international players.Future opportunities seemed bright for the industry in India because of its genetically diverse population which would likely be a magnet for investment in the clinical trials market. Rising incomes were expected to increase the demand for high-end drugs which would likely pave the way for high-end drug production in the country. The rural market which accounted for 70 per cent of the population was largely untapped so there was high-demand growth there and firms were investing in expanding their distribution structures. However with the presence of innumerable pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical marketing industry in India had become hyperactive and this put pressure on the operating expenses of companies such as MRL and affected their future growth opportunities. Government price controls on many medicinal products further reduced the profitability of the pharmaceutical companies.MISSION 2020MRL’s target was to have a pan-Indian presence with sales revenue worth ₹2 billion by 2020. The company planned to build on its strong presence in western India and expand across northern southern and eastern India in three phases through 2018.Sales Force ExpansionAccording to Kureshi in 2017 India had approximately 900000 doctors distributed across urban semi-urban and rural areas in different zones of the country. Most pharmaceutical companies using the generalist sales structure followed the strategy of having their PSOs each with a physician list of 220 doctors meet 10 physicians and six pharmacy retailers daily. The PSOs with companies that followed the specialist sales structure aimed to meet seven physicians and four pharmacy retailers daily and had physician lists of 160 doctors each. MRL aimed to target 10000 A-class physicians 18000 B-class physicians and 7000 C-class physicians in each of the four zones. Its PSOs were expected to make visits to each of these categories of physicians at a specific frequency: they were to meet with A-class physicians every fortnight with B-class physicians every month and with C-class physicians every month and a half. MRL wanted its PSOs to work at least 22 days a month making the mandatory 10 physician calls and six pharmacy retailer visits daily as well as devoting 20 per cent of their time on non-selling activities such as training and administrative tasks. Following an industry analysis of competitors Kureshi’s team suggested that MRL should locate 75 PSOs in the north 70 in the south and 60 in the east with the intent that each PSO would achieve a yearly sales target of ₹8 million. THE DILEMMAMRL was poised to expand helping to realize Kureshi’s vision of achieving sales revenue worth ₹2 billion by 2020. While the company’s location-based sales structure had helped it achieve steady growth since its inception in 2007 would this same sales force structure continue to be successful as MRL expanded over the next year? Sales targets depended on past performances and sales territories on the number of potential customers in a particular area. Would MRL need to revisit the decisions on its sales targets and its design of the sales organization now that expansion was imminent and the ₹2 billion revenue target had been announced to be achieved by 2020? Would Kureshi do better to opt for a generalist or specialist sales force structure? While the existing sales model had worked so far would the expansion plans affect the optimal size of the sales force or the process MRL should follow in designing its sales territories?EXHIBIT 1: SELECTED FINANCIALS FOR MAHA RESEARCH LABS 2013–2017 (IN ₹ MILLIONs)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; ₹65.03 = US$1 on March 25 2018.

That morning Niehaus had landed in Germany after an exhausting overnight flight from South Africa. She appeared pensive in the window’s reflection as she contemplated the previous day’s eventful TSSA board meeting. Niehaus had been the CEO of TSSA between 2005 and 2012 after which she became chairperson of the board of the same company. In 2016 from her position as chairperson she was considering the recommendations she would offer Gert Schoonbee to sustain TSSA’s culture transformation. Schoonbee had become the CEO of TSSA in 2012. Niehaus was mindful of not interfering with Schoonbee’s management of the company but wanted to direct some of the company’s approaches. She had been promoted to the position of senior vice-president Middle East and Africa for T-Systems International which required her to move to Bonn Germany the location of the head office of TSSA’s parent company Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom). Her challenging role required intense focus; therefore she purposefully needed to limit her involvement in the South African operations.Company background When Niehaus took over TSSA as acting CEO in 2005 the company’s revenue was declining 14 per cent year-on-year and she needed to turn the company around. Niehaus was often asked how she had been able to turn the organization around from being number 12 in the market to number one. In four and a half years TSSA had grown its headcount from 600 people to 2500 people and its revenue from R600 million to R3 billion.Niehaus recognized that the turnaround occurred because TSSA was able to execute what it had promised. The strategy and the story on paper were not extraordinary. Most of TSSA’s competitors had similar strategies; however the difference was in the implementation.Deutsche Telekom offered fixed-network and mobile services Internet and television (TV) services for consumers; and communication and technology solutions for multinational corporations. Deutsche Telekom operated in 50 countries across the world and employed more than 300000 people. The company recorded revenues of €62658 million (US$83241.2 million) during the financial year ended December 2014. The operating profit of the company was €7247 million (US$9627.6 million) in 2014 an increase of 47 per cent from 2013. The net profit was €2924 million (US$3884.5 million) in 2014. In the United States Deutsche Telekom had 55 million mobile customers at the end of 2014. In Germany Deutsche Telekom catered to 20.7 million fixed line customers 2.4 million pay TV subscribers 12.4 million broadband customers and 39 million mobile customers at the end of 2014.With a footprint in more than 20 countries 46000 employees and external revenue of €8.2 billion in 2015 T-Systems International of which TSSA was a part  had a global influence on the telecommunications industry. T-Systems International had partnered with 90 other companies including Avaya Cisco Systems Inc. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Informatica Microsoft Corporation Salesforce.com Inc. and VMware Inc. to offer business customers various cloud models from tailored private clouds and low-cost public cloud services to hybrid clouds. Information technology outsourcing (ITO) was growing at a rapid pace and Statista reported that in 2015 the total contract value of the worldwide ITO market was US$88.9 billion.Niehaus’s backgroundNiehaus was a clinical psychologist who started her career at Anglo American plc’s Maccauvlei Learning Academy in Vereeniging South Africa. She was trained as an assessment centre assessor then later moved to M-Net a South African subscription-funded TV channel in a training and development practitioner role. At age 27 Niehaus was a general manager on the executive committee of M-Net and managed human resources at MultiChoice a South African video entertainment company. She then became the human resources director at Debis Systemhaus GmbH (Debis) an outsourced technology company (then Daimler Chrysler). Deutsche Telekom acquired Debis in 2000 and restructured the company as TSSA. When Nieuhaus went on maternity leave with her third child TSSA’s revenue was declining. The struggling company was not acquiring new customers and decided to reorganize and downsize 20 per cent of the workforce. On Niehaus’s return from maternity leave the CEO offered Niehaus the role of head of sales. The CEO gave her a week or so to decide and advised her that in the meantime while they took over sales Niehaus also needed to become deputy CEO. Since no deputy role existed then this appointment caused conflict with the German parent company. TSSA’s CEO explained that in the South African development environment such a role was important to grow people into positions. After about a week Niehaus accepted the position.TSSA needed to conduct a massive transformation because it now had only 600 employees was number 12 in the market and was not a clear player in the South African information and communications technology (ICT) market. At the time TSSA was one of the smaller players a small multinational company that was not successfully securing any of the big deals that were being acquired by its competitors such as Dimension Data Business Connexion Group (BCX) EOH Holdings (Pty) Ltd. and Gijima Group Ltd. Within three months of Niehaus’s appointment as deputy CEO TSSA’s CEO had a disagreement with the shareholders and left the organization. Niehaus became the acting CEO and remained in that role for nearly a year. It was an interesting gender dynamic since according to Niehaus men would never have remained in an acting role for a full year; instead after three months most men would have expressed their frustration and delivered an ultimatum. In 2005 the leadership at Deutsche Telekom changed and the company underwent intense discussions about its investment in South Africa. On Niehaus’s return from a conference in Germany after the new T-Systems International CEO had been appointed Niehaus called a meeting and announced that the company had one of two choices. TSSA could either close down because it would not receive any support to grow inorganically and the parent company was considering divesting its business in South Africa or it needed to grow itself out of the problem. If the latter TSSA needed to create its own organic growth and scale up operations since ICT and especially outsourcing was all about scale. TSSA urgently needed to develop a strategy for increasing its size to become a larger player in the market. It was a highly uncertain time at the organization and several good employees left; they could see the ominous warning signs as revenues declined. TSSA was still profitable because it had reduced costs and restructured six months earlier. If left as it was TSSA would become totally insignificant but if successfully restructured the company could be a serious competitor. Leading the turnaroundNiehaus needed to put a team together to lead the turnaround. However members of the board and the executive committee resisted her role as acting CEO. Their concern was that Niehaus was a clinical psychologist had limited ICT knowledge and skills and was a woman with three young children. Niehaus did not consider herself a technology expert; it was not what motivated her. Niehaus was aware that others in the industry thought that it was the beginning of the end for TSSA. Deutsche Telekom conducted a worldwide search to find a suitable candidate to be TSSA’s new CEO.Niehaus decided that she needed to make changes. Some people on the executive committee were uncomfortable staying and resigned to pursue other opportunities. Niehaus had to ask a brilliant senior manager who was unable to make the necessary changes to leave the organization. One of the trusted team members was Schoonbee an engineer who was the strategist. Schoonbee supported Niehaus and together they made an excellent team. It was as if they were performing a dual CEO role making decisions jointly with the involvement of the other executive members. Schoonbee and Niehaus had lively discussions and regularly engaged in constructive conflict about decisions. Their combination of skills made a difference to the strategic direction of the organization. For example where Schoonbee as chief operating officer would consider strategic direction and task-related matters Niehaus had well-developed skills to influence people’s mindsets and solicit their support of the strategies. It was a kind of tandem leadership since the complexity of the work called for a range of skills that were not often found in one person. Employees believed in the dreamEverybody believed in the dream and that was the first step. Everyone was exposed to all of the information. The second step was to build an environment that created hope. In addition to the dream the introduction of hope created the view or the belief that it was possible to be successful at implementing the company’s strategy. This hope linked everything that employees did to the success of the strategy. The dream was translated into clear achievable daily tasks and the achievement of those tasks was monitored and measured. Niehaus and her executive team provided employees with regular feedback about their progress. The executive team also needed to change direction when necessary. For example when they realized the strategy was not yielding the desired results they came together and discussed what was not working and made decisions about what to do differently. It was not complex decision-making but the strategy was consistent and ensured that every single practice tied into the story. Nothing was done on the side; everything was seen as part of the story and the implementation needed to achieve the end result.Niehaus brought a softer angle by focusing on bringing people together on the vision the customers and the parent company. Schoonbee focused on actively driving the translation of those dreams and stories into real action. Their partnership was part of the success of the turnaround. Sanlam a South African financial services group was an important TSSA client as was Daimler AG the multinational car manufacturer; however for years TSSA had been unable to add any new contracts. TSSA thus needed to make a change and from a sales perspective the company was ruthless in its focus. TSSA had lost many employees and being cost-conscious it lacked the funds to acquire a notable headline name in the industry. At that stage TSSA was perceived as a declining company so it could not attract the best talent. TSSA needed to take what it had and make the best of it. TSSA needed to create something extraordinary with ordinary people—an expression that some people objected to as not sounding like a compliment. However the approach did not mean that ordinary people were not good. Niehaus also described herself as an ordinary human being with some brilliant and some not so brilliant characteristics that needed to be developed. Niehaus worked with a range of people who had varying competencies and turned those people and their various competencies into a ruthless sales team.In September 2006 after a year of acting in the role that Deutsche Telekom permanently appointed Niehaus in the role as CEO—and she had to prompt them to make the decision. The world was running up to the financial crisis of 2008 and TSSA’s biggest growth took place exactly in that time. The board and the executive team held a fundamental belief that TSSA’s leadership should not cut the important things. For example TSSA continued the activities that would make it sustainable through the bad times but it did not reduce any people practices. The tougher the challenge became the more time Niehaus spent talking to people. She made a commitment that she would personally visit every single office in the company four times a year. When she met employees she told the story about what TSSA was doing.People quickly began to see results indicating that things were going in the right direction. During this time Niehaus was adamant that TSSA would not stop providing coffee to employees. The company executives were very careful with their travel but they did not cut the activities that Niehaus believed were necessary for sustainability including training and spending time with people to ensure that they understood what was meant by the dream of creating an ICT company that had a soul. It was not easy to explain what that meant; nonetheless people felt that the dream was becoming tangible and understood that “an ICT company with a soul” meant capitalism with a conscience. TSSA’s management realized that the company needed to be financially sound to provide opportunities and training and there was no shortcut. Niehaus would however never ask anyone to do anything that they might not feel comfortable with; nor would she give in to unreasonable pressure for certain things. The leadership team purposefully created a company where people were more than just a number—a place where they had a real voice and a chance to make a real contribution. The leadership team wanted to become the number one company in ICT.Winning the big dealAt the beginning of 2008 TSSA won its first big deal which was with Old Mutual Limited (Old Mutual) a South African-based financial services group. TSSA asked a manager at Old Mutual why the company had chosen TSSA. The manager a particularly difficult person recalled his experience when Old Mutual had been conducting site visits. TSSA had a hundred employees busy preparing for this visit because Old Mutual was on the short list of two companies and TSSA needed this deal. The employees realized that they needed to win this deal because the company had identified three big deals and had said no to one and lost another. Thus the Old Mutual deal was the only one that could enable TSSA’s much needed growth. At the time Old Mutual was offering the biggest telecommunications outsourcing deal in the country. Outsourcing deals were worth R1 billion at that stage and the press coverage around the deal had been extensive. The deal would require an increase of more than 600 people so TSSA’s staff component would suddenly grow substantially—doubling to 1200 people. On the day of the site visit TSSA felt the pressure because nothing was assured. TSSA’s leadership had prepared the employees well for the visit and chose a young team leader whom they believed could do a good job. The leadership team briefed the team leader on how and what he should say when speaking with the potential customer. However when the Old Mutual entourage entered the centre with the particularly difficult manager and the TSSA executive introduced the team leader the difficult manager said that TSSA’s team should wait. The manager suspected that the team leader had been briefed so he chose to speak to another person on the floor. He chose to speak with a young woman who had probably worked at TSSA for only a year and a half. This young woman stood up and spoke about what she did and what the company was doing its purpose who they were and why they were doing it. She did it so well that it appeared to be scripted. When Niehaus conducted a debrief the Old Mutual manager admitted that up to that point he had thought that they were brilliant salespeople. Niehaus knew that the woman he spoke to was a very good salesperson; she had to play a key role in sales as a CEO of an outsourcing company. The Old Mutual manager said when the young woman spoke so authentically from the heart so passionately he saw and felt everything Niehaus spoke about including TSSA’s culture of ICT with soul. Recovering TSSA through a sense of purposeThe recovery of TSSA was enabled through a sense of purpose. TSSA’s leadership shared with people the story and the way in which they would like to work; these leaders engaged people and modelled their expectations by the way they interacted and answered people’s questions even very difficult questions. This approach led to the trust that people started to develop in the leadership and in the organization. It transcended and became a visible manifestation of the dream that people started to feel. People outside TSSA—even potential customers—started to feel the change.Niehaus realized that what made a company magic was a fundamental truth of people who wanted to feel a sense of purpose. People also wanted to feel acknowledged and heard in that purpose and in the execution; they wanted to share in the success of that business. Niehaus ensured that employees felt recognized through benefits or any of a wide variety of activities such as being rewarded as employee of year or having excellent training. Niehaus believed that what had initially driven her and the team in creating the magic had not changed but what they created had changed the company.  Looking aheadNiehaus believed that whether TSSA should change or sustain its culture it was up to every single management team to take notice of their current reality and capture some of its strengths. For Niehaus the truth that remained was that people wanted to feel a purpose do something worthwhile and be recognized for that; they wanted to be heard seen and feel important. For its message to remain current they might need to change aspects of its culture to fit its evolving reality. However Niehaus thought that it was not a totally new approach that was needed.Niehaus handed over the company to her successor Schoonbee in 2012 when she became a member of the TSSA board. She insisted that Schoonbee should be appointed because she was convinced of his strategic skills and acknowledged that she would not have been able to turn the company around without his support. She wondered what difference she could now make on the TSSA board.,20.0,"[{""start"":971,""end"":985,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1181,""end"":1184,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1267,""end"":1274,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1331,""end"":1334,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1382,""end"":1385,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1447,""end"":1454,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1514,""end"":1517,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1584,""end"":1587,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1612,""end"":1615,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1652,""end"":1655,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1771,""end"":1778,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1908,""end"":1911,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2037,""end"":2040,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2162,""end"":2165,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2217,""end"":2220,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2250,""end"":2253,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2322,""end"":2329,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2432,""end"":2435,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2471,""end"":2478,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2499,""end"":2502,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2732,""end"":2739,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4572,""end"":4579,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4592,""end"":4599,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4913,""end"":4920,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5551,""end"":5558,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5067,""end"":5070,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5324,""end"":5327,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5497,""end"":5504,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5599,""end"":5602,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5638,""end"":5641,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5690,""end"":5697,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5978,""end"":5985,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6527,""end"":6534,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6642,""end"":6649,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6773,""end"":6780,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7087,""end"":7094,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7194,""end"":7201,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8311,""end"":8318,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8427,""end"":8434,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8512,""end"":8519,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8709,""end"":8716,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8730,""end"":8733,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8868,""end"":8875,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9088,""end"":9095,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9280,""end"":9287,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10395,""end"":10402,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10407,""end"":10410,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10994,""end"":11001,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12220,""end"":12227,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12071,""end"":12078,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12466,""end"":12473,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12497,""end"":12500,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":12963,""end"":12970,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12996,""end"":12999,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":13283,""end"":13290,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13459,""end"":13466,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13992,""end"":13999,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14099,""end"":14102,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":16562,""end"":16569,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17512,""end"":17519,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18308,""end"":18315,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18784,""end"":18787,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18602,""end"":18609,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18981,""end"":18984,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18840,""end"":18843,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

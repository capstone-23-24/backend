He sat back in his chair and drank his tea. May was chief executive officer of Paillasse International SA (Paillasse) a Swiss bakery. He had just returned from a business trip to Spain where he signed a licensing agreement with one of the major retail chains which would begin selling Paillasse’s bread in 2017. May shared the good news on the phone with the company owner Sindy Pouly daughter of the company’s founder Aimé Pouly. May’s telephone conversation ended with Sindy asking “Where do we go next?” Sindy asked May to prepare a presentation for the next board meeting identifying major European markets and outlining the company’s internationalization strategy for the next few years. She also asked him to explore North American markets as a possible avenue for growth. This was not an easy task; the company was already present in 15 European countries including Switzerland. The challenge for May was to come up with a solid recommendation for expanding even further internationally. COMPANY HISTORYAimé Pouly founder of Paillasse was a far-sighted and intelligent baker who was passionate about baking and the baking business. He started working for a baker at the age of 13 making bread deliveries. Later Pouly did a baking apprenticeship in Biel a little town of about 50000 people in the French part of Switzerland. His apprenticeship was with a master baker who happened to also be the president of the Swiss Bakers’ Association. It was at that time that Pouly learned and developed his commitment to and appreciation for the taste of quality bread. Pouly finished second-best of all the apprentices of the Canton (state) of Bern in 1972. At the age of 24 Pouly opened his first bakery in Geneva. Over the next few years he opened 10 additional bakeries. He and his wife Catherine who was his business partner built their bakery business growing to 80 bakeries by 2016. While opening new bakeries Pouly also developed a new type of bread Pain Paillasse which was first introduced to the Swiss market in 1993. In 1994 Pouly registered the trademark “Pain Paillasse” in Switzerland and patented the recipe for making the bread (see Exhibit 1). In 2004 Pouly and his wife acquired the Novafood bake house in the little Swiss town of Satigny. The acquisition added nearly 100 people to the business bringing the total number of employees to 450 by 2016. Awards followed and in 2009 Pouly won the prestigious prize of Swiss “Master Entrepreneur” of the year. Pouly died suddenly in 2011 at the young age of 62. Since then his daughter Sindy and her brother had been running the Pouly family business to ensure the future of one of Switzerland’s flagship bakery companies.THE PATENTThe method of producing Pain Paillasse was based on years of research and development to achieve a bread that released no fewer than 80 flavours. This traditional bread with a rustic look was made with wheat flour natural leaven and pure water which were left for a long fermentation process then twisted by hand before being baked to obtain a golden and crunchy crust and a light open crumb. The main ingredients were a specific blend of flour and a confidential premix prepared with a unique production method. The premix and production method were both protected by patent (see Exhibit 1). The company had been considering launching a new Pain Paillasse product in 2017—the “Paillasse Tritordeum” with low levels of gluten to facilitate digestion. INTERNATIOnAL EXPANSIONFour years after Pain Paillasse was introduced to the Swiss market the first Pain Paillasse license was signed in Germany in 1998. In the following years the company executed licensing agreements with bakers in Italy Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg and Denmark. In 2006 Pain Paillasse continued its international expansion by entering Austria Hungary and France. Sindy wanted to continue with her father’s vision for their bakery including the internationalization strategy. In 2013 Paillasse celebrated its 20th anniversary and with its latest license agreements began sales in Russia and the Czech Republic. In 2016 the company obtained the prestigious International Certification Award for innovation of its bread. By the end of 2016 Paillasse had signed an agreement in Spain which brought the total number of points of sale to over 1400 globally (see Exhibit 2). BUSINESS MODELTo support internationalization Pouly had created a separate company Paillasse Marketing SA. This increased the business units in Groupe Aimé Pouly to three: Boulangerie A. Pouly (bakeries) Le Fournil Romand SA (bread and pastry manufacturing) and Paillasse Marketing SA. In 2016 the marketing unit generated about US$10 million in sales in the Swiss market alone. Paillasse served two primary market segments: domestic and global. In Switzerland the company either sold its bread in its own Paillasse bakeries or offered the premix under license to traditional bakeries. The business model Paillasse used in Switzerland was based on “pure licensing” with no additional investments needed for production or distribution. A key factor for success was finding licensees—producing partners such as a miller artisan bakery or industrial partner—that paid a start-up licensing fee of $3500 and a unit-based price for the premix (including a royalty fee) of $0.75 per kilogram. The Pain Paillasse premix—the secret and patented bread concentrate—could only be bought by licensees under contract with Paillasse Marketing. The licensee mixed the concentrate with regular flour or had a milling partner do it to produce the bread for market. Paillasse worked with about 600 partner bakeries throughout Switzerland. Once they paid their licensing fees Paillasse provided the licensed bakeries with the training necessary to make the bread properly and granted the bakeries the right to use the brand name “Pain Paillasse” (see Exhibit 3). Licensees also had access to marketing and communication materials provided by Paillasse (see Exhibit 4).The second market segment was international partnerships also built on the licensing agreements Paillasse had developed in the local markets. Paillasse normally designated one partner per country that was allowed to produce either fresh or frozen bakery products. The partner had to have its own network which varied between artisanal industrial and retail clients. The cost of the license in the international market included start-up fees between $10000 and $200000 depending on the market size and the partner’s network. The partner was also required to purchase the premix and pay the included royalty fees. As in the domestic market Paillasse provided international licensees with the necessary training and marketing support. GLOBAL BAKERY INDUSTRYIndustry SupplyThe global bakery industry grew about 2 per cent to $415.7 billion in 2016. The majority of industry growth was led by rising demand from emerging markets particularly in Latin America Asia and Eastern Europe. In the developed markets of North America Australia and Western Europe consumption was expected to be relatively stagnant (see Exhibit 5). While demand for traditional baked goods was expected to stagnate in mature markets globally a number of producers focused on introducing a greater variety of premium products in Western Europe’s and North America’s markets to offset the declining demand. The main growth in these markets was a result of manufacturers introducing a variety of new and innovative products meant to appeal to health-conscious consumers. These new products were generally in the areas of organic reduced-fat sprouted and gluten-free breads. Different types of flour were better suited for different products. Wheat flour was one of the main inputs used to produce bread. Any fluctuation in the price of wheat shifted the costs to the producers who often had to either accept the higher costs of doing business or pass on the additional cost to customers in the form of higher prices. It was expected that wheat prices would continue to decrease over the next few years. Due to the global nature of this industry the products manufactured by industry participants varied drastically from region to region depending on the local culture. The main products manufactured by the industry were generally classified into four segments: fresh and frozen bread and rolls; cookies crackers and pretzels; fresh and frozen cakes pies and other pastries; and tortillas and flatbreads (see Exhibit 6). Revenues in the tortilla and flatbreads sector increased over the previous five years with sales from North America leading that growth. In contrast sales of cookies crackers and pretzels continued to decline in part because of growing health concerns among consumers around the world. Global DemandThe demand for bakery goods depended on a number of factors including consumer taste which varied by country price levels per capita disposable income and product innovation. Producers in regions where bread represented a staple food item benefited from the steady demand for bread and other bakery goods. However in regions where consumers primarily made their own bread and baked desserts at home including the Middle East and Central Asia the demand for industrially produced goods remained relatively low. Moreover consumers around the world were becoming increasingly health-conscious and busy therefore demanding healthy and convenient yet tasty products. The emphasis on health and nutrition had adversely affected the demand for a variety of goods in the developed world. These included white bread cookies pastries and other products. In response to these consumer trends producers had introduced a variety of healthier and more nutritious products including whole-wheat bread and nutrient-enhanced bread to drive demand in wealthy countries. Bakery goods were sold in various distribution channels ranking from supermarkets (35 per cent) convenience stores and other grocers (27 per cent) food service and hospitality industries (22 per cent) and grocery wholesalers (16 per cent). Global CompetitionThe bakery industry was very fragmented with the three largest competitors accounting for less than 10 per cent of the global market. These market leaders included food manufacturing giants such as Grupo Bimbo SAB de CV based in Mexico (4 per cent) Mondelez International Inc. based in the United States (3 per cent) and Yamazaki Baking Co. Ltd. based in Japan (2 per cent). Most competitors were characterized as small commercial bakeries operating in a highly mature and fragmented market. Roughly 120000 establishments operated worldwide most of them as single entities. Price and quality were the two most important bases of competition. The industry was large with a number of small operators that specialized in generic products which were priced significantly lower than branded goods. The price sensitivity of consumers also varied between product segments. Consumer loyalty was strong but there was a high level of price sensitivity and buyers easily shifted to lower-priced substitutes. With the increase of affordable higher-quality private label brands competition for consumers continued to intensify significantly. As with any market the perceived quality of a particular product or brand in the bread industry influenced the price of a product. The higher the quality the higher the price. With regard to bread and bakery goods quality was considered the most important attribute followed closely by such factors as freshness and taste. Taken together these ultimately determined the competitiveness of the industry. Craft and artisanal bakeries were recognized for producing fresher products than supermarkets or convenience stores. Cost structures varied widely among industry players depending on the size or scale of production supply chain relationships and level of technology and capital investments. Typically larger manufacturers benefited from a lower per-unit cost of production because of their greater purchasing power and economies of scale. A typical cost breakdown consisted of 50 per cent for purchase of ingredients; 15 per cent for wages; 10 per cent for rent utilities and depreciation; 15 per cent for other costs; and 10 per cent for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).WHERE TO GO NEXTEarlier in 2016 May had hired Faustine Kesilber a young and enthusiastic business development manager and placed her in charge of international expansion. With the artisan bakery market in Switzerland decreasing at an average of 3 per cent annually Kesilber was tasked with conducting market research identifying opportunities for international growth and preparing an analysis that May could present at the next board meeting. Specifically May asked Kesilber to identify the top three countries the company should enter next (see Exhibit 7). Getting the market selection right was critical but there was another question May wanted to consider: Should licensing continue to be Paillasse’s mode of entry for internationalization or should the company use other modes such as franchising joint ventures or company-owned stores in certain markets?EXHIBIT 1: Bread-Making MethodsNotes: Hydration the weight of liquids to flour in bread dough governed the texture of the final bread crumb; kg = kilogram L = litre.Source: Aimé Pouly Method for Making Bread European Patent EP 0886472 B1 filed March 21 1996 issued March 6 2002 accessed December 2 2016 https://google.com/patents/EP0886472B1; and Aimé Pouly Method for Making Bread Swiss Patent CH20110000478 20110321 issued October 31 2012 accessed December 2 2016 https://worldwide.espacenet.com.EXHIBIT 2: PAILLASSE International SA INTERNATIONALIZATIONNotes: POS = points of sale.Source: Paillasse International SA documents.

Armour was a Canadian Red Cross-certified lifeguard who had been providing swimming lessons and lifeguarding services to families in her hometown of Burlington Ontario Canada for the past six years. Armour had been operating her business formally for the past two years under the SSA brand. She had recently graduated from the Management and Organizational Studies program at Brescia University College in London Ontario and she wanted to evaluate the possibility of expanding her business. She wondered if the business could provide her with an income comparable to what she would make if she pursued a career as an entry-level marketing professional. She was a passionate business owner and loved serving the needs of families in her community. To determine whether her compensation goal was attainable she wanted to assess geographic and service-delivery expansion options for SSA. Her profitability goal was CA$50000. Canadian Youth Sports IndustryAccording to a research report published by KidSport Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) 7 in 10 Canadians believed it was very or extremely important for children to participate in organized sport. Organized sport typically included team sports or structured physical recreational activities pre-scheduled at regular intervals where participants were required to pay a fee. Other findings from the report revealed that Canadians acknowledged the importance of organized sport to children’s overall well-being in addition to its health benefits; 84 per cent of respondents said sports participation was an essential part of a child’s social development and 80 per cent said it was an essential part of a child’s emotional development. Of those surveyed 91 per cent believed that sports participation taught children important life skills and 85 per cent agreed that sports participation built stronger communities.A report from the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute revealed that 75 per cent of 5- to 19-year-olds participated in organized physical activities and sports. In addition Canadian families spent an average of $953 annually for a child to play in organized sport and 79 per cent of parents reported contributing financially to their children’s physical activity through purchasing items such as equipment and membership fees. Sport participants were more likely to be found in higher household income categories than in lower household income categories. Soccer (38 per cent) was the most common sport played by children followed by swimming (22 per cent) and basketball (18 per cent). The organized sports in which parents most wanted their children to participate included soccer swimming and either baseball softball or T-ball. Swimming LessonsMany parents enrolled their children in swimming lessons because they viewed learning to swim as an essential life skill. Since children would find themselves in situations where they would be around water (for example on school and family trips) parents wanted their children to be confident and safe. Benefits of swimming lessons included: physical health improvements such as building strength stamina and flexibility without putting pressure on bones and joints; challenges and rewards that improved self-confidence; and personal growth and leadership opportunities. Another advantage of swimming lessons over most other sports was that children of any age or ability could participate.The most important factor for parents enrolling their children in lessons was time of day and the number one reason for ending lessons was that families were busy with other activities; this suggested that parents wanted as much flexibility as possible. When it came to cost most parents reported that swimming lessons were inexpensive compared to the other activities in which their children participated. Finally many parents believed that lesson regularity—that is taking lessons every day for two weeks in the summer season rather than once a week in other seasons—gave their children a significant learning advantage.COMPANY HISTORYArmour started teaching backyard swimming lessons to the children of three neighbours in the summer of 2011. Each year she gained more clients through word of mouth and referrals and her clients were satisfied with the quality of instruction she provided and the convenience of the service she offered. Armour decided to formally launch SSA in the summer of 2015 after creating a complete business plan as a requirement for a course she was taking as part of a degree in management and organizational studies. In 2015 Armour successfully secured a $2000 student opportunity grant from Brescia University College and a $3000 summer company program grant through the Halton Region Small Business Centre to formally launch the company. This money helped to support website design insurance coverage a business computer and start-up equipment.CURRENT OPERATIONSSSA was organized as a sole proprietorship and offered 2 core services: private swimming lessons and pool party lifeguarding services. Swimming lessons were offered in 5- and 10-lesson packages at a cost of $150 for 5 lessons and $250 for 10 lessons. Lifeguarding services for private pool parties were becoming a common request; SSA charged $25 per hour with a 2-hour minimum commitment.Swimming lesson registration began in March of each year and full payment for the lessons was collected as they were scheduled. Registration scheduling and pricing details were available on SSA’s website which was the company’s main communication tool. Armour had been extremely accommodating to clients over the past two years even if that meant that she or one of her instructors had to drive across the city to get from one lesson to the next. However she was considering a change to scheduling for 2017 so that she could have more flexibility to schedule efficiently based on instructor location. Clients would be asked to complete an availability form rather than request a specific time.The main drivers for client registrations and lifeguard-service bookings were referrals and word-of-mouth recommendations from local parents. Armour also advertised with the Halton Region Small Business Centre and in the Burlington Post and she had conducted a door-hanger flyer campaign in select residential areas of Burlington.In 2015 Armour had been the sole instructor; she had enjoyed being able to completely control service quality but by the end of the summer she realized she needed to make a change for the next season. Demand had outstripped supply. In addition to providing lessons or lifeguarding parties for 10 to 12 hours per day every day she put in additional hours managing communications scheduling and new bookings. She knew there was potential to grow the business and by the second year she had retained the services of 3 contract instructors at a cost of $20 per hour for both instruction and lifeguarding services. Armour continued to instruct and provide lifeguarding services herself and put in approximately 60 hours per week which left her more time to manage the day-to-day operations of the business. She was successful in securing a starter-company program grant of $5000 for the 2016 season which provided the company with much-needed funding and business support. In 2016 SSA served approximately 100 clients and had approximately 8 to 10 clients on the waiting list at any given time. Net income had grown by over 90 per cent from fiscal 2015 levels (see Exhibit 1). Since the business operated on a cash basis and had no outstanding receivables or payables at the end of the year the net income reported was equivalent to the cash generated and was available for Armour’s compensation.COMPETITIONSwimming lessons services were available through multiple providers in the city of Burlington. The city itself offered lessons at its 4 indoor and 2 outdoor pools starting with parent-and-tot programs and moving up to advanced leadership courses. The lesson sessions usually lasted 8 to 10 weeks and lessons started at various dates throughout the year. The ratio of teacher to students varied from 1:12 for parent-and-tot lessons to 1:6 for Red Cross levels 1through 6 and 1:8 for Red Cross levels 7 through 10. The cost for Red Cross lessons increased with the level: the highest cost for levels 7 through 10 was approximately $95 for 10 lessons. Although private and semi-private lessons were available through the city there was limited availability for these. For semi-private lessons parents had to find a child with similar ability who was available at the same time. Semi-private lessons cost $139 per child for a series of 5 lessons. City lesson registrations filled quickly and there were often waiting lists for popular times.The Ron Edwards Family YMCA location in Burlington had an indoor pool and offered swimming instruction for all ages. The YMCA did not offer the Red Cross program but had its own comparable program. The YMCA lessons were offered as “family” lessons where all children within a family could take their lessons at the same time regardless of their swim level. Once a family had registered for a specific time they could keep that time as the children progressed to new levels unless the family requested a switch. A YMCA membership was required to access swimming lessons: a family membership cost $438 per adult plus a $100 building fee annually and a membership for a child under 12 years old cost $282 annually under this family membership.AquaMobile Swim School (AquaMobile) had been in operation for over 10 years and provided the same at-home private swim lessons and lifeguarding services that SSA offered. It originally began offering services in the Greater Toronto Area and had since expanded to British Columbia and multiple states in the United States. Interested parents filled out an online form and were then connected to a local instructor who would set up backyard lesson times. Swimming instruction for children from 6 months to 3 years was priced at $48 per 40-minute lesson and 1-hour lessons for those aged 6 months to adult were priced from $65 per hour (this cost could be split between multiple students). Lifeguarding services were available for $60 per guard per hour. At this point Armour was not aware of an AquaMobile presence in Burlington but the city of Oakville and other cities west of Toronto were listed on its website.In addition to instruction through formal services and locations swimming lessons were also available through many instructors who operated independently serving neighbours and family friends as Armour had when she started. These service providers varied in terms of quality of instruction and pricing; however they offered parents the convenience of swimming lessons in their own backyard.2017 SEASONArmour planned to make a number of changes to operations in 2017 independent of any expansion decision. The prices for lessons would increase to $175 for 5 lessons $300 for 10 lessons and $500 for a 20 lessons. In addition lifeguarding rates would be $45 per hour with the same 2-hour minimum commitment. She did not plan any changes to instruction or lifeguarding compensation. Armour also wanted to require all clients to pay in advance using PayPal which charged a service fee of approximately 2.9 per cent.Regardless of any expansion plan Armour believed that swimming lesson and lifeguarding sales in Burlington for 2017 would increase by half the growth rate between fiscal years (FY) 2015 and 2016 and she was not expecting to apply for any grants in 2017. For projection purposes she wanted to estimate an average lesson-price increase of 15 per cent. She also planned to cap her instruction hours at 40 hours per week and she would hire out all lifeguarding bookings.EXPANSION OPTIONSArmour was anxious to investigate the feasibility of expanding SSA’s operations to increase both the number of clients served and the company’s bottom line. The two opportunities she was considering included expanding to neighbouring cities and running her business year-round by renting space at an indoor pool.Neighbouring City ExpansionSSA already had clients in the neighbouring city of Oakville and in the towns of Waterdown and Dundas so Armour was considering a formal expansion into one or more of those locations. From her business plan research Armour knew that there were approximately 6800 backyard pools in the city of Burlington out of a total of 71373 private dwellings. Although the city of Oakville was unwilling to provide her with their estimate of the number of backyard pools she did find that Oakville had a population of 193832 and 66269 private dwellings. Waterdown and Dundas were smaller communities with populations of approximately 111065 and 113024 respectively and 38111 and 44962 private dwellings respectively. Armour believed that the target expansion city and towns would have approximately the same percentage of pools per dwelling as Burlington and she estimated that SSA would be able to capture half the percentage of market share she held in Burlington in FY 2016. For projection purposes Armour felt it was appropriate to assume that most people would purchase 10-lesson packages; she also estimated that 20 per cent of her expansion-city clients would make one lifeguarding-party booking.If Armour were to expand into one or more of these areas she would see increases to advertising and promotion costs of approximately $500 per location and equipment costs of $250 per location. In addition she would need to cut back the hours she instructed to no more than 30 hours per week for the 10-week season to be able to manage the growth. She was pleasantly surprised to learn that her current insurance policy would cover this expansion plan.Year-Round OperationsMany clients asked Armour to offer indoor lessons in other seasons so that their children could maintain and continue to improve their skills. Armour had identified a facility at a private school in Oakville less than a 20-minute drive from Burlington which she could rent at a cost of $160 per hour. If Armour were to pursue this option she would consider renting the facility for 2 weeknights—from 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.—and Saturday mornings from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Given the size of the pool 4 different lessons with 4 different instructors could be held at the same time. Lessons would be 30 minutes in length and would take place over a 10-week session and prices would be consistent with those for the 2017 season. If Armour pursued this option she would communicate her plans to her existing client base so advertising costs would not change; however supplies and equipment costs would be $250. Again insurance costs would not increase; Armour’s insurance broker was able to quote the same premium for the additional indoor lesson coverage since Armour would be purchasing a full-year policy.CONCLUSIONTo reach a decision Armour knew she needed to assess the alternatives qualitatively and project income statements to determine the conditions under which she could reach her profitability goal of $50000. Since SSA primarily operated on a cash basis with no receivables or payables the net income was a good proxy for the cash generated which she could use to compensate herself and keep a small cash balance.

Ltd. (Midea Group) He Xiangjian (He) retired as board chairman to focus solely on Midea Group’s holding company. This was He’s second voluntary retreat from a chairmanship: in 2009 He had handed over the chairman position of Guangdong Midea Electric Appliances Co. Ltd. (Midea EA) a former listed company controlled by Midea Group before the group’s overall listing in 2013. Midea Group was a white goods empire built by He over decades and the Midea brand led the home appliance industry. He’s successor was Fang Hongbo a 45-year-old professional manager and the former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Midea EA. Fang faced a grim situation as he took over the position: business performance was plummeting Midea Group was urgently in need of a strategic transformation senior management would likely resist taking orders from Fang and at a basic level the organization was overstaffed and ineffective. In addition many senior managers felt that He’s son would have been a better choice as successor to his father according to Chinese cultural traditions.Fang was worried about how to handle his new position. His duties would be much heavier than those he had faced after becoming chairman of Midea EA in 2009. He knew that even if he did his utmost for Midea Group’s growth he might not be able to count on the allegiance of all of its senior managers who had been equally competitive in the successor contest. If they did not listen to—or deliberately sabotaged—Fang’s commands his leadership could lead to adverse business results and wild accusations. Fang reflected and came to a grave realization: “Only hard operating data is convincing enough. It is high time the old operating model was changed. Changing business operations while keeping key staff stabilized will be challenging [but it is] imperative for Midea Group to thrive in the future.”Before THE SuccessionHe Xiangjian Founder of Midea GroupBorn in 1942 He was the founder of Midea Group. Before founding the company He was an undereducated but sophisticated serial entrepreneur struggling to fit into a social system that did not acknowledge private businesses or market economy. After China’s market was reformed and opened up in 1978 his business shifted from producing fan parts to producing fans and then air conditioners. In 1993 Midea EA went public as the first private listed company transformed from collective ownership in China. From 1990 to 1994 Midea EA was among the top three companies in China in terms of air conditioner sales. Building Business UnitsIn the 1990s every competitor in the white goods market tried to bring down opponents by executing significant price cuts; most firms stumbled with across-the-board losses. In 1996 Midea EA’s air conditioner sales dropped to seventh place in the industry. The company’s only profits that year came from outside investment returns. In painful reflection He believed the root of this decline was bureaucracy. At that time Midea Group had built five product lines (mainly air conditioners fans and electric cookers) accounting for hundreds of product models. All operating decisions were centrally made by the headquarters and that caused inefficiency. In 1997 He decided to reform the organization into five business units (BUs)—namely air conditioners home appliances air compressors electric motors and kitchenware—and gave each unit a high degree of autonomy. Business relationships between BUs were market oriented and transactional. Meanwhile the company appointed several professional managers as heads of these BUs. For example Fang was in charge of domestic sales of Midea Group’s air conditioner BU. The head office mainly focused on overall strategic decision-making and management control. In order to clarify the boundaries of power and responsibility Midea Group laid out principles in a “Manual of Power.” This became the foundation of many future structural changes.Taking the opportunity to enact organizational reform and power decentralization He persuaded some founding members of Midea Group (including his wife) to retire early and purposely reduced family influence in the company. He also retired from most daily operations. Young professional managers replaced old ones in key positions soon after. Since 1997 Midea Group’s executive team had only professional managers and no family members. He believed that talent was naturally attracted to the organization because of “appropriate incentives power separation and accountability systems in place.” However after decades of a centrally planned social system China did not have a mature talent market especially for professional managers. In fact almost all of Midea Group’s newly appointed managers were promoted from within.Fang Hongbo’s Career in Midea GroupIn 1992 25-year-old Fang joined Midea Group as an editor of the corporate magazine working in the president’s office. His talent was recognized by He who promoted Fang repeatedly over the next five years (see Exhibit 1). Fang recalled “I do feel he was purposely mentoring me. He often called me to his office and took out a small piece of paper full of things that he recorded about me. He would specifically talk to me about some of my indiscretions he saw including a bad speech or impulsive reflexes.” In 1997 He promoted Fang to oversee Midea EA’s biggest business—domestic sales of air conditioners. Most of the company’s senior managers objected to this appointment but He insisted that he wanted Fang to execute his customer-oriented marketing philosophy and a flat channel system. Fang helped Midea EA’s air conditioner sales regain the number-three position the next year with a 200 per cent growth rate. His success impressed He who commented “What gratifies me more than anything else is not sales growth but being right in seeing the potential in young people.” After this first victory Fang was soon promoted to even higher positions (see Exhibit 1). The Problem of Countless SubculturesFrom 2000 onward nearly all home appliance manufacturers chose to prioritize rapid expansion; through mergers and acquisitions they aspired to build the world’s largest production lines seek product diversification and grow further. Fang recalled “In 2004 Midea Group did not have refrigerator or washer businesses. In only five years’ time Midea Group was already able to rival Haier Group Co. Ltd. the market leader at that time in the home appliance market.” Meanwhile Midea Group’s organizational structure became complicated. Management determined that the ultimate reason for repetitive investment and lack of synergy was due to the large number of BUs. In 2004 the group added a new management layer—so-called “secondary groups”—to oversee the BUs. He intended to make Midea Group an investment holding group. Some powers previously held by BUs were centralized to these secondary groups creating higher positions for professional managers. From this point onward Midea Group’s structure included four tiers: Midea Group secondary groups (such as the listed company Midea EA) 25 business divisions and product companies. Every tier had functional departments and staff; He believed that such a structure reflected the horizontal and vertical power balance.The 2009 Succession: The Listed CompanyRumour in 2004Around the end of 2004 it was rumoured that Midea EA’s board of directors was about to change. He’s only son He Jianfeng (Jianfeng) was expected to become a board member soon. This rumour collapsed when He announced a group restructuring plan in 2004 which actually gave two professional managers even more power. Yet the media quickly gathered evidence to support a new theory that Jianfeng was aiming for the chairman position of the overall group rather than that of the listed company Midea EA.He Jianfeng and Infore GroupJianfeng started his own business Infore Group (Infore) in 1994. Infore was primarily concerned with manufacturing products for Midea Group. By 2002 Infore had seven subsidiaries with more than 5000 employees. The firm was regarded by outsiders as a training ground that He had prepared for Jianfeng because if Jianfeng eventually intended to join Midea Group he would be faced with many senior executives who might dwarf him in business decisions. However Jianfeng chose not to follow his father’s path of home appliance manufacturing and instead declared that his company would pursue business opportunities in the capital market in 2008. He also had two daughters He Qianchang (QC the elder daughter) and He Qianxing (QX). He and his daughters invested in Infore. QC and QX were running a moulding company and a new materials company. Both daughters were undertaking upstream business in relation to Midea Group. Meanwhile QX also ran an electronic device company. He had long felt that “Midea Group was never a family business. The company needs professional managers to sustain future growth.” In 2009 after Jianfeng declared the strategic change for Infore Group He’s thoughts became more crystallized as he confidently stated “CEOs of the group will all be professional managers and my family will always stay in the role of shareholder.”Succession on the Fast TrackOn August 26 2009 He resigned as chairman and director of Midea EA. Fang then vice-chairman and CEO of the company succeeded He as chairman of the board. From then on the board of Midea EA contained no members of the He family. This was the point in time when Midea EA completely entered into a “professional manager era” as dubbed by many professional managers. Fang was not surprised by his appointment as chairman. Ten years before He had told him “You need to look beyond the current position and shoulder more responsibilities in the days to come.” Fang clearly remembered He changed his wording to be more concrete but without specifying a time: “In the future I will hand this over to you.” The handover of Midea EA was timely because Midea Group was experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. The company’s growth-oriented strategy led to revenues of over CN¥100 billion for the first time in 2010. At that exciting point in time He (who was 68 at the time) announced a five-year plan to “recreate a new Midea.” The new plan involved realizing ¥200 billion revenue by 2015. Employees and managers were excited about this goal and began to develop new business areas and projects. A senior executive recalled “We thought the ¥200 billion target could easily be achieved before 2015.”Business Downturn and Transformation EffortsSetback in ExpansionAt the end of the second quarter of 2011 Midea Group experienced some disturbing financial results. For example in the first quarter of 2011 Midea EA’s sales revenue grew by 59 per cent but net profit only increased by 13.7 per cent. Internal analyses concluded that actual market demand did not show substantial growth. Overstocking channels with inventory and conducting price-cutting campaigns effectively ballooned revenue figures but these measures inevitably undermined Midea Group’s profitability. In addition many projects had been hastened into operations to boost revenue levels. Midea EA Leads the TransformationMidea EA under Fang’s leadership was the first branch to transform within Midea Group. In the second half of 2011 Fang proposed a new product upgrade strategy: making premium products to boost prices and the Midea brand image. However it was hard for the whole management team to transform its old mindset of producing basic products and recklessly cutting prices. The inefficient and unprofitable businesses within Midea EA caused year-over-year (YoY) growth of revenue and profits to slow. As chairman and CEO Fang was able to close them (see Exhibit 2). In the first half of 2012 the number of product models decreased from 22000 to 15000. Fang remembered “It was like if you didn’t cut off the infected arm you’d lose your life.” From 2010 to 2011 Midea EA cut its 100000 employees by one-third. Fang also streamlined the channel system. At the peak of scale expansion Midea EA had distributors in every county in China. When China’s policy of “home appliances outreach to the countryside” stopped neither distributors nor Midea EA saw profits.Midea EA began to integrate channels and changed key performance indicators in accordance with the new strategy. In the previous performance measurement system profit was not as important as revenue which created a giant company that could not generate value to shareholders. Since 2012 it was required that profit growth must be higher than revenue growth so that profit margins would rise. New products that could generate higher margins were developed while many lines of low-price products were reduced. The company started declining large orders of low-profit products which was alarming to some managers who firmly believed that no order should be dismissed. The 2012 Succession: Midea GroupLargely due to the increased efforts in the second half of 2011 Midea EA’s operating profits jumped by 96 per cent although its YoY revenue growth dropped by 24.9 per cent (see Exhibit 2). He was satisfied with Fang’s success and began to contemplate how to turn around Midea Group as a whole. But Fang was worried: he knew that Midea Group was encountering a bottleneck after years of growth and expansion (see Exhibit 3). Fang felt that Midea Group needed a leader powerful enough to press the brakes find another direction and regain high speed soon afterward. He would be the perfect person for that role but Fang also knew that the role would involve reducing the interests of very senior people—something He would not feel comfortable doing on his own. The HandoverIn the summer of 2012 He’s idea of complete retirement from all positions in Midea Group came to fruition. He summoned key executives and asked them to discuss how they felt about Fang. On August 25 2012 He officially handed over the whole group to Fang the new board chairman. At the farewell meeting He made it clear to all that he no longer wanted to be involved in any “daily affairs and meetings.” The newly announced board of directors included Fang Jianfeng six other professional managers and two representatives from strategic investors. Fang and the other six directors had been at Midea Group since the 1990s and had all been promoted by He (see Exhibit 4). According to a former executive He had been monitoring professional managers’ personal performance for over 10 years assigning independent tasks to them and observing the results so that he could identify his ideal successor.Preparations for the HandoverOverall ListingBefore handing the Group over to Fang He planned for an overall listing; first Midea EA would be delisted then all other businesses under the Midea Group but formerly outside Midea EA would be combined to form a packaged portfolio which would be a new overall listing. The added businesses included small household appliances electric motors and logistics services. Midea Group became the largest listed white goods company in China’s domestic stock exchange market surpassing the market capitalization of Haier Group and Gree Electric Appliances Inc. Group RestructuringHe also restructured the group before handing it over to Fang. He dismantled the four secondary groups and split them into 15 product BUs. Many powers and resources were centralized in the head office to realize synergies in finance supply chains sales channels storage and other resources. The disappearing secondary groups had been on the same level as Midea EA. After Fang became group chairman the president of the home appliance group (Huang Jian) and the head of the electric motor group (Cai Qiwu) were appointed president and vice-president respectively reporting to Fang; both had seats on the board of directors. In a media report a previous employee suspected that there would be difficulties between Fang and these two heads: “When He was still the figurehead of the company the professional managers looked up to him and listened to him. Now they needed to learn how to live in harmony under the current power structure; after all their positions are no longer in parallel like before.” However these appointments paved the way for Fang giving him actual authority over the whole Midea Group. Fang quickly clarified Midea Group’s future organizational guideline: a small head office and an integrated system.Stock Ownership PlansMidea Group’s 2012 performance figures looked grim. Revenue was just over ¥100 billion meaning ¥30 billion in revenue had evaporated compared to the previous year. Fang knew that the senior executives’ mindset had to change immediately to facilitate the new operating model that he was calling for and he would need to convince these executives using hard numbers rather than wordy explanations. Fang also knew that appropriate incentive plans needed to be in place for the change in strategy to work. The incentive system needed to be oriented toward future growth rather than based on immediate financial performance. 2007: The First Stock Ownership PlanSince 2007 Midea Group had been trying to raise senior executives’ personal salaries to international standards to reward the executives’ contributions toward the company’s rapid growth in past years. A virtual stock ownership plan was developed covering seven core executives including all heads of secondary groups and several functional department heads. When Midea Group completed its overall listing in 2013 these executives immediately became very wealthy (see Exhibit 5). Only five of them remained at Midea Group. Midea Group’s compensation structure adopted a “low basic salary high performance salary” pattern. The year-end bonus could be five times as much as the basic monthly salary and the company mostly distributed bonuses in cash. Midea Group managers’ overall pay level was admired by their peers working for competing firms. One Midea executive commented “We worked [very hard] to achieve performance targets so that we could get the bonus but many business analysts thought we were pushing next year’s business ahead of time and this practice lacked sustainability.” The 2007 stock ownership plan did not cover BU general managers—not even for the biggest BU which had greater revenue than a secondary group.Meisheng Plan When Midea Group’s structure changed to encompass 15 BUs in 2012 the group initiated a new stock ownership plan the “Meisheng (MS) Plan” to cover 47 BU general managers deputy general managers and some departmental heads in the head office. These executives co-founded a partnership to purchase 3 per cent of the pre-listing equity of Midea Group (diluted to 1.75 per cent after overall listing) from Midea Group’s holding company at book value (see Exhibit 6). Because the executives could sell their shares at market price after a three-year lock-up period starting from September 18 2013 the actual personal income from the MS Plan could be remarkably high. As one executive understood it “[He] used his own money to motivate us and thus we were able to lead a decent life. The stock ownership plan supplemented the existing cash incentive system and urged managers to look seriously at long-term growth.”Future Stock Ownership PlansFang believed long-term incentives should be extended to middle management. In 2014 and every year afterward Fang planned to launch a new plan that might cover up to 1000 middle managers. Fang realized that such an incentive plan would not satisfy everyone and might even hurt some feelings but he decided that BU heads would have to be able to identify key talents and motivate them using long-term incentive tools. Challenges for Fang HongboFang was very sure of the direction that Midea Group’s transformation would take but there was no guarantee that the group’s financial results would rebound immediately. There were already doubts circulating throughout the company: what if things did not turn around soon? Fang tried to keep calm and resolute. He knew that selling unprofitable businesses and laying off employees could turn the group inside out so he decided to move quickly before employees started to raise questions based on speculation and rumour.Activating ManagersFang recognized a lack of willingness to learn new things among some managers. Many managers also resisted change. Fang analyzed their collective mindset: “It usually takes several years for a manager to be promoted to director. After that their personal growth stagnates. They resist learning new concepts like Internet-based business models. They form small circles protect members and do not work with others.” On many occasions Fang reiterated to managers how the company should change to conform to the new era (e.g. with respect to e-commerce and customer orientation). For those who did not want to follow Fang was clear and direct about the consequences: “At this critical point in time you either change or go. . . . Whoever you are no matter how senior you are I’ll remove you if you can’t follow my lead. I don’t care if this means I have to lose the chairman title because of this.” In fact after the head office BU restructuring Fang’s former competitors (the other former secondary group heads) were gradually deprived of most of their authority. Fang knew that he had disrupted many people’s equanimity by streamlining businesses and firing people. He believed that the moment he took over at Midea Group certain people had already secretly decided to leave. But there was no turning back. Fang had to boost performance results or else he would fall into a very difficult position with everyone turning on him. What was troubling for Fang was that even if the streamlining initiative did boost efficiency revenue would still drop in the short term. He also knew that his tough approach was in sharp contrast to He’s genial and easy-going style. Fang might not have been a “people person” but he tried to let everyone know that while he had high expectations of his staff members they should not take his attitude personally. To show his solidarity with the other employees Fang refused to use the exclusive elevator and private dining room for executives and started to take the ordinary elevator wait in lines and have lunch in the cafeteria like everyone else. Facing He XiangjianFang thought he had to report major changes to the board of directors. After 20 years of service He and Fang were almost like father and son. Would the succession change the nature of their relationship? He left enough power and space for Fang to do what he needed to do. In fact He only attended meetings to listen to Fang’s updates twice a year. Jianfeng also had a seat on the board but like his father he seldom gave feedback. However Fang thought he needed to guard against developing any arrogance and self-importance. He doubted that he needed to redefine his relationship with He as that of “agent and owner.” The trust between them needed to be solidified rather than sabotaged by doubts that could be triggered by unexpected events. Fang believed he needed to act as professionally as possible by reporting to He periodically even though he rarely offered feedback.Fang tried to analyze the subtleness of his relationship with He: “Our relationship had dozens of years of trust as its foundation. But every second after my succession it could go sour if I did not attend to [all necessary] details. It was not a blood relationship after all. It was much weaker as it was employment based in nature.” At the same time Fang realized that this relationship was stronger than those between other professional managers. He commented “I had followed [He] since the beginning. His every look every move and even how he put his hands—I knew exactly what he was thinking. No outside CEOs would be able to do this. I don’t think this succession case is replicable in the future.” This realization prompted Fang to think about the next generation of Midea Group’s leaders: “The situation between me and the next generation of leaders might be a lot different than what [developed] between He and me.”Fang sometimes asked himself why he was taking on this new role. His increased authority had isolated him from his peers. Performance pressures the resistant management team and his complex relationship with the He family were all heavy burdens for Fang. Excluding equity gains Fang’s nominal annual salary was only half that of his previous position. Fang knew he was driven by the need to repay He saying “If only driven by personal interest I would not be able to lead the company further. I was very grateful that [He] had dug me up and made me extraordinary.”Change in Top ManagementIn October 2013 the resignation of one BU president Huang Jian shook the whole company. Employees traded internal details about how fierce the power struggle was among top managers. In April 2014 senior vice-president Huang Xiaoming also resigned and in July of the same year Cai Qiwu followed. Huang took a new position in Midea Holding. Under China’s stock exchange rules if managers resigned their shares from the MS Plan were locked until September 18 2016. It struck Fang that every manager who had participated in the 2013 MS Plan would become very wealthy in 2016. He had to design a new plan to motivate them when that time came. The MS Plan based on He’s personal contribution was not sustainable. New sources of incentive shares needed to be in place. New Business DirectionHe assigned Fang a hard task: “accelerating while looking for new exits” as Fang put it. Midea Group’s past success represented China’s competitive advantage in terms of low manufacturing costs. However China was at a turning point; its labour cost was rising quickly. Midea Group had to find a new core competency to replace low-cost production while at the same time maintaining fast growth. Fang had a term for the new strategy: “second track.” From 2013 to 2015 Midea Group chose to pursue a mobile strategy developing smart home appliances that could be controlled by mobile apps. Encouraging new businesses might represent the way forward for Midea Group but it could also complicate the firm’s motivation system. Fang needed to bear that consideration in mind when designing the new stock ownership plans. It seemed that too many things needed to be balanced to achieve sustainable success.Exhibit 1: Fang Hongbo’s CareerSource: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Midea EA—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2013 (in ¥)Note: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan; US$1=CN¥6.8 on January 1 2010; YoY = year over year.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 3: Midea Group—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2015 (in ¥)Source: Company materials.Exhibit 4: PROFILEs of KEY MIDEA EXECUTIVES Note: All of the above individuals were Chinese nationals with master’s-level educations.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 5: ExecutiveS’ ShareholdingS and Value When Midea Group ListedNote: Shareholding value based on issuing price of ¥44.56 per share.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 6: Midea HoldingMidea Investments Holding was founded on August 5 2002 with registered capital of CN¥330 million and only two natural-person shareholders: He Xiangjian holding 94.55% and He Xiangjian’s daughter-in-law Lu Deyan holding the remainder. This meant He Xiangjian’s family held 100% of Midea Holding. He Xiangjian became executive director of Midea Holding; his wife Liang Fengchai was supervisor; and Li Jianwei was manager. Midea Group Midea Real Estate and other secondary groups were subordinate to Midea Holding.

Padmakar was the general manager of human resources (HR) at BPCL—a global Fortune 500 company engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The awards function was the culmination of an internal competition called IDEAS—a competition that sought innovative ideas from employees. In his welcome address Padmakar stated that the purpose of the IDEAS competition was to “nurture promote and recognize ideas” within the company. He observed that over the years the number of participants had increased (see Exhibit 1) that cost-savings estimated by participants were significant (see Exhibit 2) and that BPCL had benefitted from an influx of new thinking and cross-functional collaboration. Although Padmakar acknowledged the successes he was aware of the challenges facing the competition. Participation seemed to be stagnating quality of ideas was a concern and enthusiasm was waning. Additionally many people thought that winning ideas were not being adequately replicated across the company. This meant that BPCL was not reaping the full benefit that was being demonstrated in the competition. Padmakar wondered what might be done to revitalize IDEAS as a platform for innovation.BACKGROUNDBPCL was founded in 1976 by the Indian government after it acquired Burmah Shell Refineries Ltd. in India. In those years the Indian economy was heavily regulated with several restrictions on private enterprise. The Indian petroleum industry in particular was dominated by three state-owned companies including BPCL. Then in the early 1990s the Indian government began to liberalize its economy. To ensure that the company sustained its competitive advantage BPCL’s then chairman Uppiliappan Sundararajan initiated an organizational restructuring exercise. In order to encourage employee involvement in the restructuring he introduced a process called visionary leadership and planning (VLP). The VLP process involved workshops wherein employees across levels participated in creating the vision statement and business plans for BPCL. “The beauty of this process” explained Sundararajan “was that each one felt as if it were his or her own vision statement.” There was palpable excitement in the organization as employees across levels debated brainstormed and found ways to make things happen. For example in 1998 the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh experienced a severe shortage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Workers and management from a plant at Cherlapalli took the initiative to solve the problem. They located a piece of machinery that lay idle at another plant in Tuticorin in the state of Tamil Nadu. They moved the machinery repaired it and started working an additional shift to increase production and supplies of LPG. The following year BPCL achieved 27 per cent sales growth in the area and the Cherlapalli plant became the company’s lowest-cost LPG bottling plant.This new momentum clearly transformed BPCL into a powerhouse of ideas. But then the leadership team faced a dilemma: how could the company store disseminate and replicate these ideas across the organization? BPCL’s information technology (IT) department provided a solution wherein a database was created and employees were encouraged to post and access information. In addition an electronic newsletter was published to acknowledge and recognize innovative employee ideas. However these attempts seemed inadequate to recognize and reward employees for their contributions. Separately the HR team had initiated a suggestion-box scheme. Employees were encouraged to anonymously suggest improvements for the organization. However this scheme did not ensure the implementation of ideas and rewards for suggestions were not seen to be motivating enough. Thus the VLP process the knowledge management technology and the suggestion scheme generated a flood of ideas. The company then needed to channel those ideas while overcoming limitations of earlier efforts. BPCL’s leaders decided to initiate the IDEAS platform as an internal competition with wide-ranging expectations. Sundararajan wanted IDEAS to foster intrinsic motivation provide the freedom to think enable cross-functional interaction generate and implement ideas and ensure adequate rewards for employees. Sumita Bose expected that IDEAS would increase dynamism in the organization and in turn help improve efficiencies and profits. She said “We felt that we need to do something that would shake the company . . . to make an impact . . . [to] add to the bottom line of the company . . . so we thought of IDEAS.”According to George Paul IDEAS helped align BPCL’s brand promise business strategy and organizational culture. BPCL’s brand promise was about “innovation reliability and caring.” Paul believed that IDEAS had the potential to generate “innovative products services business processes and business models” and help BPCL achieve its strategy of differentiation. This view could be supported by an organizational culture where employees not only believed in the brand promise but also practiced it. Paul said “How do you make the beliefs into a habit and the habit into a culture [?] . . . so that [was] the genesis of creating a platform like IDEAS.”For this reason in 2000 BPCL introduced IDEAS with the objective of nurturing promoting and recognizing ideas within the company.THE IDEAS COMPETITION AND PROCESSBeing the brainchild of the company’s chairman IDEAS found easy acceptability within the organization. The HR team was given the responsibility of designing and implementing the IDEAS competition. Emails were crafted and sent to employees details were uploaded on the company’s intranet and posters were displayed in company offices and plants. All these methods of communication were intended to institutionalize IDEAS as a contest and convey its purpose criteria and award information to employees (see Exhibit 3).One of the guiding principles of the competition was that ideas had no meaning unless they were implemented. Therefore the following criteria were laid down for participation:Ideas should have been implemented during the previous financial year.Ideas should be about the development of new or better products processes or services. They could also be about doing things in a more environmentally friendly manner.Ideas should demonstrate financial benefits improvement in processes and reduction in cycle time or waste.In order to maintain consistency across the organization the HR department outlined a process through which entries were received evaluated and rewarded. The process involved the following three stages:Stage 1: Participant submissions had to highlight the significance of the idea the details of the process employed and the financial benefits accrued. The entry could be submitted in English or any of the following Indian languages: Hindi Marathi Gujarati Tamil Malayalam Kannada Bengali Telugu or Oriya. The purpose of allowing entries in regional languages was to encourage employees in BPCL’s non-management cadre who were not so well-versed in English to participate in the competition.Stage 2: Submissions were screened by an internal jury of senior leaders (general managers and executive directors). Evaluations were based on parameters such as degree of creativity feasibility of implementation benefits accrued (financial and non-financial) potential for replicability and overall impact. This screening served as a filter by which ideas would be shortlisted for the final presentation and evaluation.Stage 3: The final round was held in Mumbai and attended by shortlisted employees from all over the country. Participants had to present their ideas before a panel of jury members comprising subject-matter experts academicians and senior leaders. The final round would culminate in the awards celebration which had the glitz and glamour of a mega-event that employees aspired to be part of.Typically 10 awards would be presented at the annual IDEAS awards celebration. The best idea of the year submitted by a team or individual would receive the chairman’s trophy. In addition some deserving ideas would receive a token of appreciation. Also a special booklet would be printed that would showcase all the award-winning ideas and would be circulated across the company. Early Outcomes and Improvements Several entries from the first version of the IDEAS competition received external recognition. Participants won awards for “excellence in creativity and innovation” at India’s national petroleum management program. Internally BPCL’s HR department studied the outcomes of IDEAS 2000. That department found that an overwhelming number of entries—especially award-winning entries—were about technical innovations. For example 11 of 12 awards were flagged as technical entries. The jury seemed to favour submissions that demonstrated tangible benefits. In order to increase participation from support functions and to ensure a greater focus on measurable outcomes the following categories were introduced for IDEAS 2001: technical process and system improvement marketing and sales initiatives and HR.IDEAS 2000 demonstrated that substantial financial savings might be achieved by the organization. Consequently cash awards were introduced to increase employee participation and derive more value from the competition. In 2001 the chairman’s award carried a prize of US$1100 plus a trophy. The first second and third prize winners were awarded about $400 $300 and $200 respectively. Over time BPCL increased the prize monies to reflect the importance accorded to the competition. However the increases were nominal and when the prize was shared between members of a winning team the monies per individual were not substantial.With an 86 per cent increase in the number of entries (from 88 in 2000 to 164 in 2001) the HR department found it difficult to administer the competition in a centralized manner. Further they expected that the number of submissions would continue to rise; consequently shortlisting entries at an early stage seemed like a good idea. To address this need regional rounds were introduced in 2002 making the competition more of a tournament. Entries within each of BPCL’s four regions would be evaluated within the region itself. Each regional adjudication panel consisted of one internal and one external subject-matter expert. These regional rounds resulted in about 30 per cent of local submissions being shortlisted for the final round and enhanced the visibility of IDEAS at local levels. However decentralizing the process increased logistical requirements and raised questions about whether regional panels were applying evaluation criteria uniformly. Consequently BPCL eventually gave up the idea of a multi-stage tournament and reverted to the traditional format of a centralized competition.Due to sustained review and experimentation IDEAS continued to evolve and develop. In 2003 an online portal was introduced to manage greater numbers of entries and serve as an online repository of knowledge. Employees could use the portal to register new ideas view and comment on other entries and access information to replicate past ideas. Thus the IDEAS portal served as a medium for spreading ideas and building a culture of innovation.New Version of IDEASIn many ways IDEAS appeared to be a huge success; however a degree of sluggishness seemed to have set in. Informal conversations and data from past competitions indicated three trends. First some old ideas were being re-submitted by the same or other participants with minor changes in title or technical specifications. Second support functions such as legal finance HR and marketing had increasing difficulty coming up with radically new ideas year after year. Third most submissions were being received just a few days before the deadline indicating perhaps that innovation was topical and had not been sufficiently embedded in the organizational culture.Therefore the HR team wondered if the competition continued to serve its original purpose of nurturing promoting and recognizing new ideas. In particular was the goal of nurturing new ideas being compromised by the criterion that ideas had to be implemented before they could be submitted? As Jayesh Shah remarked “The condition was [that] unless you implement an idea you can’t participate even if you have a great idea . . . then we thought of introducing three new categories.”In 2008 BPCL’s HR team introduced a new version of IDEAS wherein entries could be submitted in three categories:Creative Stroke: This category was for ideas that had been implemented during the year. Entries in this category should have resulted in cost reduction or process improvement.Mind’s Eye: This category was for ideas that had not been implemented but had high potential for adding value to the organization.Echo: This category was created for successful ideas (from past competitions) that were replicated in a location other than that of their origin. Echo was meant to encourage the diffusion of innovative thinking that had already gone through the cycle of trial and experimentation. The objective of introducing these categories was to make the IDEAS platform more vibrant while maximizing participation. The new categories seemed to yield dramatic results for BPCL. Employees began to collaborate across departmental boundaries in their efforts at innovation. For example the following noteworthy entry surfaced in the Creative Stroke category. It had so happened that the Indian army had constructed a strategic advance landing ground (ALG) for helicopter operations in the Khirmu hills of Arunachal Pradesh. This ALG required a safe and reliable refueling system. Given extreme weather and a difficult terrain this was a daunting task. However BPCL’s employees from the engineering and aviation teams worked together to design and construct a pioneering solution.Another example was an entry in the Mind’s Eye category from the Piyala LPG plant located in Uttar Pradesh. The plant had a manual system of painting LPG cylinders. Typically two workers applied primer and paint to the cylinders through a pneumatic hand-operated spray gun. The working conditions were not particularly favourable. Because the workers had to operate in enclosed spaces for an extended period of time they ran the risk of inhaling toxic fumes leading to respiratory illnesses. The idea to solve this problem was to mount paint spray guns on the existing machinery and make minor technical adjustments that created a semi-automatic system at a reasonable cost.Examples such as these indicated that participation in IDEAS resulted in employees feeling increasingly motivated and engaged in the company. One participant remarked: “I started contributing [to IDEAS] from 2008 onwards. . . . What attracts me more than awards is . . . it’s a place where we can showcase our talent and get an opportunity to rub shoulders with top management.”IDEAS SINCE 2010In 2010 IDEAS completed 10 years of its existence. By then its value as an employee-engagement tool was fairly well established in the minds of the company’s leaders and employees. Dipti Sanzgiri BPCL’s then executive director of HR remarked “IDEAS is a unique initiative saluting the innovative spirit of our people of our organization. I’m sure that each year together we will take it to new heights.” However in 2010 participation in IDEAS dropped by about 40 per cent. By this time the members of the HR team that coordinated IDEAS had changed and Sanzgiri and her team considered a range of new questions. Were employees viewing IDEAS as being owned managed and executed by the HR department alone? Were line managers taking enough responsibility to create an environment to nurture and implement ideas? Was participation in IDEAS being seen as just another item on the to-do list? Was the competition genuinely inspiring employees at the grassroots level where innovation really mattered?Exploring the questions above led Sanzgiri and her team to conceptualize and implement what was called the IDEAS station. This station was a physical space accessible to employees in each of BPCL’s locations. The station would have colour-coded sheets on which employees could write their ideas. Colleagues could build and support the ideas. One manager at each location was appointed as a liaison and was asked to facilitate the process at that location. The model of a traffic light was used to track ideas from generation to implementation. Upon successful implementation an idea would be featured on the green sheet. Those that needed further work would appear on the amber sheet and any ideas that did not seem promising would be moved to the red sheet. The IDEAS station was expected to result in three main benefits. First being a physical space in local offices it was more likely that employees would associate IDEAS with being a local everyday feature of working at BPCL. Second the station might make IDEAS an ongoing process rather than a once-a-year event. Third because the station was accessible to all it was hoped that employees would build on each other’s ideas; this in turn would enhance cross-functional collaboration.Though the IDEAS station was launched with much fanfare and promise the expected momentum did not happen. People were hesitant to post ideas publicly and employees seemed concerned about losing credit for an idea that they thought was original to them. Some were reluctant to join teams involving others’ ideas. It was unclear who would be responsible for implementation. Others lost interest as they felt that the manager responsible had pre-judged the ideas as not having sufficient financial benefit. Sanzgiri was disappointed that the IDEAS station had not been successful. She remarked “I should have realized that it involved a big change management process.” Shah added “Things like this should be driven by top management. Secondly communication did not happen adequately; people could not appreciate the value of the whole process or maybe enough effort was not made to make them understand.”Over the years BPCL continued its efforts to improve IDEAS and celebrate its successes. In 2011 the award-winning ideas of former seasons were chronicled in a coffee-table book. The following year IDEAS was expanded to include joint venture partners and a subsidiary company of BPCL. Branding was also recognized as an important pillar of communication and a logo was created for IDEAS. In 2013 a mascot named “Idee” was introduced to give a face and personality to the competition.Yet IDEAS participants judges and BPCL’s leadership raised some concerns. First judges had observed that a few entries of former years were being repeated—either by the same teams after having made minor improvements or by other teams who did not know of earlier submissions. Second judges were somewhat skeptical about the savings claimed by participants. BPCL’s leaders felt that despite the Echo category award-winning ideas were not being adequately diffused in the organization; as a result the full potential of innovation was not being realized. Finally there were questions about the scope of ideas submitted. Were those innovations that were carried out as part of an employee’s routine responsibilities—for which that employee was paid a salary and had a periodical performance appraisal—to be considered valid entries for IDEAS? Should those submissions that were beyond the scope of the employee’s duties not be accorded additional importance?Amid the concerns and efforts to improve the competition IDEAS also yielded unexpected positive outcomes. For example IDEAS participants scored about 5 per cent higher than non-participants during BPCL’s 360-degree feedback (talent management) process in 2012 and 2014. Thus not only had IDEAS survived for 15 years it seemed to impact matters beyond employee engagement and innovation.WHAT NEXT? In July 2014 Padmakar was appointed as head of the HR department at BPCL. The awards night on January 9 2015 was an opportunity for him to reflect on the future of IDEAS in the context of the broader issues facing the petroleum industry. Three dramatic changes had been occurring in the global petroleum industry. First the international price of crude oil had declined 50 per cent since October 2014. By January 2015 crude was available at about $50 per barrel. Second the Indian government had stopped controlling the price of retail fuels. Third the above two situations had resulted in the Indian fuels market becoming attractive to competition. Now state-owned petroleum companies such as BPCL faced the prospect of losing market share to private companies such as Reliance Petroleum Essar Oil and Shell. In this context the need for innovation at BPCL was stronger than ever before. Yet in 2014 IDEAS participation fell by about 20 per cent. That year some roles and members of the HR team also changed. As he took stock of the situation Padmakar was aware that IDEAS was much appreciated in the organization. Winners in particular had been inspired and spoke highly of the impact of the competition. The leader of the team that received the IDEAS Echo award for 2013 had remarked “Those who have gone and experienced IDEAS are now self-propelled and this in turn has a rub-off effect on others. Now people don’t accept the status quo and [instead] try new ways.” One employee who had twice won the chairman’s award was of the view “In research and development each one of us is busy doing our own jobs. Some of our great works go unnoticed. But [due to] this platform one gets recognition and our hard work gets noticed by everyone. It motivates us to think differently and encourages us to put in extra efforts at work.”However BPCL’s leaders looked beyond apparent successes and asked deeper questions. Sanzgiri said “It is a strong engine for reward and recognition but a weaker engine for innovation . . . . it can become stronger if some other alchemy happens in the organization.” Padmakar wondered what that alchemy might be. He wanted hard data to determine the changes that could be made. Earlier he had asked his team to analyze IDEAS’ historical data from a range of perspectives. They had sent him a summary of their findings (see Exhibits 4 to 8). Among other things Padmakar was heartened to observe that by 2014 participation in IDEAS was inversely correlated with employee attrition (see Exhibit 4). Padmakar saw two distinct possibilities to take IDEAS to the next level—focus on the competitive spirit of IDEAS such that employees wanted to participate win and gain recognition or focus on reinforcing a culture of creativity such that employees collaborated shared knowledge and innovated without the expectation of awards.

It was March and neglecting the bright spring day outside Kelly Shawn director of marketing sat in her office but could not concentrate. Client Jamie Croce’s words lingered in Shawn’s ear: “The Bristol project needs to be launched by Thanksgiving Day. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects we plan to develop. Please make sure everything is on schedule.” However according to the current original equipment manufacturer (OEM) project-development model both the project schedule and the project’s quality were at risk of not meeting Croce’s request. Shawn stepped away from the laptop and looked out the window at the palm trees moving gently in the breeze. She took a deep breath. It was time to rethink the next step in the plan.COLIN CORPORATECOLIN CORPORATE (COLIN) was founded in 1946 after the end of the Second World War—a critical period for the U.S. economy. The business started out manufacturing electronic dry irons. Its original corporate owner Chris Martin paid significant attention to product quality and customer service. Soon after COLIN was founded its dry iron products gained wide recognition. For 70 years COLIN had been recognized as the number-one brand of garment care products including dry irons steam irons and garment steamers. The garment steamer was a new product category having been developed only in the past 20 years. With improvements in people’s living standards the garment steamer became more and more popular because it was convenient simple to use and could remove wrinkles from fabrics without touching the clothing which eliminated the risk of scorching. The garment steamer product accounted for 30 per cent of COLIN’s total sales and 50 per cent of the company’s total profit (see Exhibit 1).COLIN had a flat organizational structure. The interdepartmental relationships ran in parallel. Under the general manager of the company were seven senior vice-president positions: sales marketing finance research and development (R&D) operations supply chain and quality. These senior vice-presidents led their respective teams to perform their functions (see Exhibit 2).COLIN had its own industrial design and R&D group and had 20 years’ experience in garment steamer product development; however COLIN did not manufacture the products it developed. The garment steamer manufacturing was outsourced to OEM suppliers in mainland China. Each year COLIN developed approximately 10 new garment steamer products. The product development lead time for a new product with a medium degree of complexity was approximately 10 months: two months for the design quotation supplier selection and design finalization; two months for tooling fabrication; two months for production of the first component article product qualification tests and certification; two months for the component and assembly pilot and production; and a final two months for product shipment to the distribution centre and to retail stores. During the entire development period the COLIN project team at the U.S. headquarters were in intensive communication with both the OEM suppliers and COLIN’s subsidiary corporation project team in Zhongshan Guangdong Province China. The OEM suppliers COLIN selected and co-operated with had vertical manufacturing ability which meant they could complete the entire manufacturing process in house from the manufacturing of the component parts to the assembly of the finished goods. In this way the product quality could be controlled to the highest degree. When a new product needed to be developed COLIN’s R&D team created the design internally then the sourcing leader sent the design drawings to the OEM suppliers for their production price quotation. In general COLIN selected the supplier based on factors such as cost quality speed of delivery and service.COLIN also developed some original design manufacturer (ODM) projects sometimes working with existing OEM suppliers and sometimes with other finished-goods suppliers. When a customer needed a new product but COLIN’s internal design resources were occupied or the product was targeted at an open price point (OPP) internal development did not provide any cost advantage and COLIN would then move into ODM development model. Annually COLIN’s work was made up of approximately 70 per cent OEM projects and 30 per cent ODM projects (see Exhibit 3).The Bristol projectAccording to Shawn the Bristol project was one of COLIN’s most promising projects. It could finally resolve the most common customer complaint about garment steamer products: steam did not last long under low temperatures. With the currently available garment steamer products when the set-up temperature was low steam would begin to drip after one minute; when the set-up temperature was high there was a potential risk that the hot steam could damage clothing. The Bristol product was designed to use dual heater plates but a single heater system which avoided incurring a large cost and maintained a constant steam under low temperatures. COLIN had a patent on this new technology.The Bristol was targeted at a unit price of US$109 which made it a mid-priced product although its function would be superior to similarly priced products offered by COLIN’s competitors. If the Bristol could be launched according to plan in fiscal year 2017 it would lead to estimated sales of $20 million which was very high for the first year of a product’s launch.Shawn led COLIN’s retail market team and knew that consumers always wanted to see different and special products. She had been employed at COLIN for eight years; she worked the first two years in the sales department and then moved to the marketing department. In an attempt to meet customers’ changing needs garment steamer brands were constantly innovating—offering new functions new materials new technologies or a new appearance. Retailers such as Kmart and Costco annually reviewed the new products available. Any underperforming products were replaced by new products that offered better sales potential. Shawn commented that “If our company cannot deliver new product on time and the [currently available] product doesn’t perform well then our display shelf will be distributed to our competitors. We can see severe competition and how important it is to develop the new product on time.”Kmart was one of COLIN’S major retail customers. Purchasing manager Jamie Croce from Kmart was a very meticulous person: We plan to test sales in 500 stores. According to the test sales result we will determine whether to promote this product nationwide—in 2500 stores. We will leave the aisle shelf available to Bristol. The company’s website will introduce Bristol one month ahead of its in-store availability. We will also use Twitter Facebook to recommend this product. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects for us this year; anything going wrong will not be accepted.Achieving the development agreement with Kmart on the Bristol project was a milestone but Shawn had no time to celebrate. She felt that a tough journey had just started. One of her major concerns was the project timeline. Customers she communicated with about the Bristol project raised some critical-to-quality (CTQ) product factors such as steam volume and temperature which had all been revised. Kmart’s new-product internal review procedure was also very slow. Shawn had spent six months following the Bristol project’s progress which had recently been moving forward according to schedule.For the Bristol products to enter the market quickly Kmart required a one-month shorter launch time than for other OEM projects. Reducing the timelines by one month was a big problem as product development included many tasks: product design supplier selection component confirmation qualification and certification and mass production of the components and finished goods. In the end a shorter production development time would also affect product quality. If COLIN abandoned the Bristol project the discussion and collaboration with Kmart over the past six months would be lost and would become meaningless. Furthermore losing the project would affect the subsequent year’s total sales. However continuing with the project meant that the product might not be delivered on time which could lead both COLIN and Kmart to lose their reputations with customers. COLIN would also be penalized. “It is really a difficult choice” said Shawn.Shawn considered all the possible solutions such as seeking a supplier to complete the design so that COLIN could omit the first component article. Using the ODM supplier which was usually very fast could save time compared to going through the OEM project-development procedure. Alternatively could she identify opportunities to save time in the current OEM procedure? Could any tasks be worked on in parallel? Shawn felt she could not resolve this situation by herself; she decided to hold a Bristol project meeting and to consider the comments of other department leaders regarding how to complete this project on time.Current OEM project execution at COLINCOLIN currently had no dedicated project manager in new-project development. The Bristol project was being managed by a product manager from the marketing department (see Exhibit 4). Shawn’s team had four product managers: Sally Daniel Christa and Robert. Sally and Daniel had been with the company for 10 years and they worked well on project management. Christa and Robert had been with the company for three years and one year respectively and they were not as professional in their project management work. For example Shawn had attended a project meeting held by Christa and one of the engineers Kevin had argued with Christa. Kevin had doubted Christa’s project timeline and said he was too busy to complete Christa’s project design on time. Robert had also complained in front of Shawn about the project team he was leading. Sometimes the quality engineer and the design engineer differed on an issue and they were quick to argue with each other during project meetings. Their conflicts slowed the decision-making processes and affected the projects’ timelines.Under the current organizational structure product managers needed to spend much of their time doing product introductions maintaining customer relationships conducting market research and supporting the sales functions. They did not have enough time to perform their project management role. Delays in COLIN’s new-product development had become common. In the previous year COLIN had developed 12 projects and seven projects had been delayed. Some projects had been delayed due to the product manager’s overcommitment to a customer and some were delayed due to technical issues. The project timeline tracker had also not been developed very well. Sometimes when a project was developed to the middle stage someone suddenly discovered a task that needed to be done but had not been listed in the project’s timeline tracker. These problems led the project’s development time to exceed the time estimated in the original plan. In addition due to time zone differences when OEM suppliers in China encountered problems and their queries needed a response from the U.S. team they could not always receive a timely response and this led to more delays.COLIN’S OEM project management lacked a common set of expectations regarding processes (for example using weekly meetings or email communication to manage projects); instead the management format for each project depended on the project manager’s personal style. Some project managers were very proactive providing comments and suggestions and following the progress of projects’ development closely; but some project managers relied on other team members to allocate their time to work on projects and exhibited a weaker influence on project execution. Project timelines did not have buy-in from all team members and did not represent the progress of projects accurately.The quality of OEM products also varied. Among the engineering team some engineers had worked with the company for more than 20 years. The products they designed had fewer problems and their projects progressed relatively smoothly when moving to mass production. Some of the younger engineers however lacked design experience. The products they designed typically encountered more problems during the development stage which led to more customer complaints after the products were sold.Shawn and the R&D director Frank Pennings were both aware of these issues and they considered making changes to the current project management and product design processes; however other tasks always seemed to occupy their attention and they had not yet had sufficient time to think deeply about the next steps for improving the processes.COLIN’s suppliers and customersALICE CORPORATION (ALICE) one of COLIN’s major suppliers was located in Xiamen City Fujian Province China. Besides providing OEM and ODM garment steamer products to COLIN ALICE was also proactive in developing co-operative opportunities with other major garment care brands such as Koninklijke Philips NV (Philips) and the Bosch Group (Bosch)—the two leading brands in Europe and Mexico respectively—and Akai—the leading brand in the United States. These brands were COLIN’s direct competitors in the garment care business.COLIN also had a business segment that provided private-label products to large retail customers who had their own brands. For example Kmart had its own brand Natural which included clothing small home appliances and other household products. Kmart had no design team or manufacturing factory. Instead its private-label products were all supplied by business partners or ODM suppliers. The private-label business represented 5 per cent of COLIN’s business. COLIN purchased ODM products from its own suppliers and then supplied these private-label products to supermarkets or big retailers.Shawn had recently heard that representatives from Kmart and ALICE had been meeting to explore the possibility of Kmart purchasing its private-label products directly from ALICE; however Shawn was not overly concerned. In the past another of COLIN’s customers had gone to COLIN’s supplier to buy private-label products directly; however two years later the same customer had returned to COLIN. Shawn was confident that COLIN could provide customers with a one-stop solution because of its comprehensive capabilities in R&D project management supply chain management and customer service. Customers that worked with COLIN needed only to clearly communicate what they wanted and COLIN would take care of everything. However customers that went directly to the ODM suppliers needed to spend much time discussing product specifications and CTQ requirements following up on the product development progress performing quality audits for each shipment from suppliers and dealing with customer service and complaints regarding product quality. If customers compared only the unit cost then going directly to the manufacturer plants would lead to savings; however if they considered the total cost and service efficiency COLIN was the more reasonable choice for private-label products. BUREY CORPORATION (BUREY) another supplier that had long co-operated with COLIN was located in Zhongshan City Guangzhou Province China. BUREY had a world-class operating facility and could provide large quantities of high-quality products within a short time. During its long co-operation with COLIN BUREY had always maintained a high service level. Since it had a substantial manufacturing capacity and consistent high-quality performance BUREY also provided private-label products to Kmart. However these private-label products were basic models only not innovative products. Compared with ALICE BUREY was weaker at R&D. It lacked core patents and competitively innovative products. BUREY mainly completed the manufacturing process in accordance with the customer’s design.The Executive MeetingShawn held a two-hour meeting to discuss the Bristol project and invited her colleagues from R&D sourcing quality and marketing. She began by reviewing the background of the Bristol project the customers’ CTQ factors the expected launch time and the current difficulties. She then asked the team to provide their comments.The R&D director Frank Pennings was the first speaker: We need to consider the Bristol project very carefully. We should make sure we have enough time and resources to complete this project. If we just speed through this project and push the timing even skipping some necessary steps it will be very risky for product quality. In recent years our NPI [new product introduction] timing has been getting shorter and shorter meanwhile product quality is becoming more unsteady. Use Orono as an example. Usually a garment steamer new-product development needs around 10 months. But Orono only took eight and a half months under pressure from the customer. Although we launched that project on time we received a complaint about a dripping issue soon after it launched. In order to resolve this issue we had to improve the design rework the finished goods and compensate the consumer. Our spending has exceeded US$500000 for this quality issue. We cannot develop a project  similar to Orono at whatever condition. The Orono project Pennings mentioned was developed in 2014; in order to meet a customer’s timeline request the project was rushed to market. At the beginning the marketing department had a very positive forecast for this project and the sales potential was good but almost within a day Orono encountered customer complaints. Sales marketing sourcing quality and engineering—all departments—were pulled in to this emergency. Even today the customer service team continued to receive complaints from end users about the Orono product dripping issue. “Let’s think about whether  we move ahead or put a hold on the Bristol project” Pennings emphasized. Shawn responded to Pennings’ opinions promptly:Although the Orono project was not developed successfully we have held several meetings to talk about it and summarized its failure reasons such as lacking customer CTQ [elements] lacking a full qualification test; communication with suppliers was not clear. Now if we develop the Bristol project we can just refer to the lessons we learned on the Orono project. This year our new projects’ quantities are not so high. If we give up the Bristol project now the new product contribution to sales will be below our target. In addition our competitor Akai has already posted advertisements on what they will launch—a new garment steamer with constant steam. As far as I know it is similar to our Bristol project. If we don’t launch Bristol this year some end users who want to buy our brand will move to Akai. This will be harmful for our brand and our sales. COLIN has been a market leader for a long time. We don’t want to be a follower.Sally voiced her concerns: “If we decide to move on the Bristol project how can we select the proper supplier? Are we going to use OEM or ODM for this project? Can we meet the launch deadline?” Shawn found that the meeting was filled with questions and she tried to steer the discussion to resolving the deeper issues.Simon Suffert the senior sourcing manager spoke up:Could we ask ALICE and BUREY to quote on the Bristol project? Let’s see their proposed timeline then make a final decision. BUREY has done some private-label business with Kmart; ALICE has also developed many ODM projects with us before. Their capability is trustworthy. We can rely on them to do ODM design and our engineer can take responsibility for the qualification and certification. If that works I have full confidence that ALICE and BUREY can meet the project timeline. The Newport project was developed in that model and the timeline was shortened by about one month. Pennings reminded Suffert The Newport project was quite simple; the steam volume was not adjustable. That product didn’t need to move. It was an OPP [opening price point] product. Bristol is an MPP [medium price point] product. It has four wheels and is the first product that can supply constant steam under low temperatures. If we choose to go with ODM we cannot control the detail design and the risk of quality problems will increase.Sally commented:Supplier selection needs to be considered together with the project development model. If we decide to go with ODM and shorten the lead time we may go with ALICE. They already had a product with a constant steamer feature on sale in the U.S. market for a year. The product connects with power and achieves a pre-set temperature and the steam brush will release constant steam. Our patented feature is that our product has a button to control the steam on and off. Regarding the operational experience COLIN’s patent will be superior to ALICE’s patent. But ALICE’s product is also acceptable as we learned during market research.Shawn who was sensitive to the project’s timeline responded:If ALICE has already had a similar product for sale and has a patent to shorten the Bristol timeline and meet our sales target why don’t we just leverage their patent? Our patent hasn’t been applied on a physical product yet. Wouldn’t doing so just represent a higher risk? If ALICE could just change the product appearance to Bristol and share the existing components from their current products wouldn’t that be a good way to speed up the time to market?Pennings who was reluctant to choose the ODM option commented: If we go with ALICE’s patent in order to share the service part we would have to change our design direction for the next round of new products and still use ALICE’s patent for our constant steam product series. If this happens we will be in a very passive position. If ALICE choses to implement a price increase next year we would be forced to accept. And if we go with ODM but give ALICE our patent there is no doubt that we will grow our competitor. But if we insist on using our own patent with the OEM option we can easily move to other OEM suppliers if ALICE has any cost or service issues.Although COLIN’s dual heating plate patent had not yet been applied on a physical product the application of the new technology would still take time. Based on his technical experience Pennings was confident that COLIN could realize this process on the Bristol project in the standard 10 months’ development time. Luis Almanza from the quality department had his own view:In the past we have only run the ODM option with the OPP product and the sales were relative small. According to the sales forecast Bristol’s annual sales will be over 200000 units. We should pay high attention to the quality risk. As I heard although ALICE’s product has been selling for a year they sold only about 2000 units. This small quantity cannot prove any product quality reliability.Final DecisionListening to the heated discussion Shawn fell quiet. In what direction should the project go? She needed to come to a decision as soon as possible. The meeting had lasted almost two hours and still no agreement had been made. How should COLIN move to the next step? Shawn looked out the window of the meeting room at the bright spring day outside. She took another deep breath.Exhibit 1: COLIN CORPORaTE’s Income Statements 2015–2016 (in US$ million)Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: COLIN corporate’s Company structureNote: VP = vice-presidentSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: COLIN Brand garment steamerSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: COLIN corporate’s Project teamNote: R&D = research and development; QE = quality engineer.Source: Company files.,5,"[{""start"":1027,""end"":1051,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1156,""end"":1167,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1197,""end"":1200,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1274,""end"":1281,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5494,""end"":5499,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7143,""end"":7148,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8110,""end"":8115,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8485,""end"":8490,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9543,""end"":9548,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9549,""end"":9554,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9961,""end"":9966,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10392,""end"":10399,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10732,""end"":10737,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10996,""end"":11001,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13581,""end"":13586,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15063,""end"":15068,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15250,""end"":15255,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15457,""end"":15462,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17137,""end"":17142,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19117,""end"":19122,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20294,""end"":20299,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22129,""end"":22134,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":24119,""end"":24124,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":24350,""end"":24355,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6646,""end"":6649,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8142,""end"":8145,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17266,""end"":17269,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":20353,""end"":20356,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":24178,""end"":24181,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1776,""end"":1779,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1776,""end"":1779,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6532,""end"":6537,""labels"":[""PERSON""]}]"

It was the last week of September 2014 and the staff at JSW Steel Ltd. (JSW) was frantically focused on last-minute efforts to achieve the company’s quarterly targets. Kumar was the senior customer relationship manager to Jindal SAW Ltd. (JSAW) a long-time client of JSW and he found himself in a difficult spot because he had only a short window of time to decide whether to transport finished materials to JSAW by barge (sea route) or instead use the faster but more expensive method of transporting it by rake (rail route). On a routine day Kumar would have had no second thoughts on the matter but today was an exception because JSAW needed the material urgently and Kumar certainly did not want to shut down his customer’s production process. The JSW logistics team was putting pressure on Kumar to release the material and send it by rake to JSAW; however Kumar thought that shipping the materials by barge would still ensure that they reached the client in time with additional savings for his own company during the crucial quarter-end period. Kumar had less than 12 hours to decide on the mode of transportation and release the material. The CompanyJSW Steel Ltd. was a steel giant that operated five manufacturing units in India. The company generated annual revenues of ₹512196.2 million in 2013–14 (see Exhibit 1) and was the nation’s leading private steel manufacturer. JSW produced a variety of steel products including hot-rolled (HR) coils cold-rolled (CR) coils thermo-mechanically treated sheets wire rods galvanized steel and galvalume sheets. It also manufactured special grades of steel that were used extensively in high-end applications such as the manufacturing of large-diameter pipes prefabricated metal structures and components for auto sectors. The company’s largest plant—the Bellary plant in the village of Toranagallu Karnataka—was strategically located in south India close to the ports of Goa Chennai and Mumbai. In terms of its corporate vision JSW aimed to become a globally respected organization through sustainable industrial and business-development practices. The steelmaker had received several awards for its initiatives in cultivating a green philosophy among its employees processes and products. One such initiative involved the operation of a responsible supply chain that assessed the benefits to people planet and profit throughout its corporate decision-making. Thus apart from the regular railway routes the company made every effort to supply its clients with materials that were shipped by barge to locations that were close to ports (see Exhibit 2). Shipping by barge reduced the time needed to transport material and offered an additional benefit of reducing in the company’s carbon footprint. SteelMaking and LogisticsJSW manufactured steel using iron ore coke and limestone either in a blast furnace or in a Corex furnace which was a more environmentally friendly alternative to the blast furnace. The end products of reduction and melting were hot metal and slag. The hot metal was processed further by blowing it with oxygen to remove the unwanted carbon. Finer elements such as vanadium nickel cobalt and titanium were added to enhance the features of the steel and to make it suitable for specific applications. The steel slabs were rolled through a critical method to manufacture HR coils which were then shipped to customers who manufactured pipes and tubes. The customer put the HR coils through a flattener and used a special technique called submerged arc welding to manufacture pipes. This process required clean coils to avoid strains on the pipes and tubes produced. The pipes were further processed and used to connect water resources natural gas and fuel lines around the world. The timely supply of these HR coils to the customers was obviously an important concern for JSW’s logistics department. The logistics team used different transportation modes for different locations. The customer—in this case JSAW—was located in the Mundra region of Gujarat so the closest port was Mundra and the closest railway siding was Gandhidham (see Exhibit 3). The material for JSAW products had always been transported by rail route from the time the two companies started doing business together; however with JSW’s recent focus on a responsible supply chain the sea route was also considered as a viable alternative. Indian railways charged JSW based on a price list that was approved every year and JSW’s accounting department shared this price list with all other departments within the company so they could refer to it to make cost-effective shipping decisions (see Exhibit 4).The Indian railway system classified its rake services based on the number of rail wagons attached. For example 45 wagons constituted a BOXN rake and 59 a JUMBO rake. A JUMBO rake could carry 3500 tons (3175 tonnes) while a BOXN rake could carry 2500 tons (2267 tonnes). Indian Railways’ monopoly gave it the authority to sanction the type of rakes it supplied. The chance of attaining a JUMBO rake on request was just 30 per cent since the railway operated only a small number of JUMBO rakes and availability was limited. Prior to 2014 Kumar’s experience had taught him that the railway authorities usually gave permission for the requested number of BOXN rakes 80 per cent of the time and 20 per cent of the time the allocation was one BOXN rake less than the number requested. Also from experience Kumar knew that for a rail shipment the odds of late arrival were approximately 30 per cent. South West Port Ltd. Goa operated the nearest port to Bellary. This port was mostly used for the export of HR coils CR coils steel plates and steel sheets to international customers; it was also used for the import of raw materials such as coal and iron ore. Gates 1 to 4 were used for exports gates 6 and 7 for domestic activity and gates 8 to 10 for imports. Because South West Port Ltd. was owned by JSW Group Kumar had always enjoyed the availability of the required number of rakes between the plant and the port.Most of the barges that entered this port for domestic purposes were carrying coal shipments and thus a significant amount of coal and iron dust could damage the surfaces of the coils that were being transported. The vendors who supplied barge transportation that offered clean storage space (Class I) charged a premium (₹30 per ton) beyond the normal delivery charges but the availability of such clean-storage barges was only 30 per cent. Kumar knew that he could place a request with port officials to have Class II vendors provide clean storage space on their barges. In such a case the vendors would charge an additional ₹25 per ton and Kumar estimated only a 75 per cent chance that the cleaning would actually be done. He remembered that Class I vendors had a record of 80 per cent timely delivery whereas the Class II vendors had a record of only 35 per cent. The combined cost of transporting coils to the port in Goa by rake and then to the Mudra port by barge was approximately 22 per cent cheaper than that of transporting the coils directly by rail. JSW’s past records showed some variation in activity times across both modes of transportation (see Exhibit 5).Kumar’s problem The quantity of steel ordered by JSAW was 7000 tons (6350 tonnes) of which 5000 tons (4535 tonnes) had already been produced; the remaining 2500 tons (2267 tonnes) was under production and was scheduled to be ready for dispatch by 10 p.m. that same day Sunday. The conditions for delivery of the coils were decided through a memorandum of understanding and a negotiation document had been drawn up between JSW and JSAW. All terms and conditions were clearly defined for every project (see Exhibit 6).The intricacies of this logistics problem were growing with every minute that passed and Kumar knew he needed to make his decision in less than 12 hours. He was under tremendous pressure since this was the last week of the quarter. As well timely delivery to JSAW was high on Kumar’s list of priorities but the logistics department could not confirm the availability of JUMBO or BOXN rakes until the next day Monday at 10 a.m. As he pondered the situation several important questions ran through Kumar’s head: Would it be best to wait until Monday morning to get confirmation on the rail rakes? What if he could not obtain the required type or number he needed? Should he talk to the port officials now and at least try to get a confirmation on the availability of a clean barge? JSAW shipments had always been transported by rail. Would it be risky to rely on a recently developed sea route to make a rush delivery for an important customer such as JSAW? Would the final decision affect the goodwill between JSW and JSAW? As Kumar considered the possible answers to these questions he felt he could not agree more with the well-known adage “Too tired to stay up yet too awake to fall asleep.” Exhibit 1: Revenue of JSW Steel Ltd. 2008–09 to 2013–14 (IN ₹ Millions) Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹60.53 on September 1 2014.

The weather fit the sentiments of Federica Santos country head of PharmaCorp Ukraine a global pharmaceutical company’s local unit in Ukraine. “Sales down by 40 per cent and 25 per cent loss of market share. . . . that is the worst performance ever” Santos sighed while scanning the latest figures of her firm. “When will the war stop?” Santos was suddenly interrupted by her phone ringing. It was the Ukrainian Secretary of State for Health telling her that it would not renew PharmaCorp Ukraine’s licence to participate in public tenders. “That’s really bad news” she thought. “Being excluded from public tenders will cause a 10 per cent slump in sales.”After all Santos had experienced during the past few months in crisis-ridden Ukraine this kind of message no longer surprised her. She had always known it would be a tough task to steer PharmaCorp Ukraine through the ongoing political and economic crises. Still she felt stuck and frustrated. So far she had not found a way to avoid further damages and boost sales. Now with the annual meeting with the regional headquarters (RHQ) fast approaching she was under even more pressure. During this meeting at the end of January Santos would need to present her ideas for strategic moves to revive sales at PharmaCorp Ukraine.PharmaCorpPharmaCorp was incorporated in 1896 and had its corporate headquarters (CHQ) in Munich Germany. In 2014 it employed about 54000 people worldwide and generated €20 billion in sales. Its portfolio covered more than 40 drugs in human- animal- and bio-pharmaceuticals.As one of the leading global pharmaceutical companies PharmaCorp ranked second in 2014 in terms of the percentage of its total revenue spent on research and development (R&D). It conducted R&D in Germany Austria France Japan and the United States had production in more than 11 countries and operations in more than 150 countries.In 1991 PharmaCorp started its operations in Ukraine and since then had been a premium brand recognized in the market for its high-quality drugs. Owing to the economic development of Ukraine and Ukrainian patients’ demand patterns PharmaCorp’s product portfolio was relatively small in Ukraine and contained mainly long-established well-proven drugs.PharmaCorp Ukraine was founded as an operating unit (see Exhibit 1) which meant that the office in Ukraine was an extension of PharmaCorp’s RHQ in Milan Italy and conducted local sales activities in comparison with a full-fledged subsidiary that was relatively independent. The RHQ issued all documents (e.g. working contracts legal documents and invoices) and was liable for the PharmaCorp transactions in Ukraine. PharmaCorp Ukraine was responsible for local operational tasks whereas most of the tasks related to strategic decision-making were located at the RHQ to which PharmaCorp Ukraine reported.The RHQ was responsible for 30 affiliates in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries as well as five Central Asian countries. In its intermediary position between the CHQ in Germany and the 35 affiliates the RHQ had a bridging function: It reported to the corporate CHQ in Germany and communicated the targets set by the CHQ to its own regional affiliates. In doing so the RHQ aligned the corporate strategy with the regional strategy and acted on regional opportunities. It also undertook intra-regional coordination and control activities. Intense co-operation between the RHQ and the Ukrainian operating unit was encouraged after the onset of the Ukrainian crisis in late 2013 which was marked by riots and the escalation of protests in Kiev (known as “Maidan”) and the Crimean crisis in early 2014 (followed by war in parts of Eastern Ukraine). The crisis pushed both the RHQ and the operating unit in Ukraine beyond their usual work practices and patterns.A New Manager ArrivesAs of August 1 2014 Barbara Haas the head of the RHQ in Milan faced major challenges in Ukraine which led her to assign a new country head for the operations in Ukraine. Haas felt that Federica Santos was the right person for the job. Even though she was fluent in neither Ukrainian nor Russian Santos had proven her ability to handle difficult markets. For example Santos had started working for the RHQ after graduation and soon after was given the chance to establish PharmaCorp’s subsidiary in Croatia after the war in the 1990s. Later she assumed responsibility for the whole Balkan region. When Haas offered Santos the chance to head the Ukrainian unit Santos enthusiastically agreed.Briefing by the RHQ“We entered the Ukrainian market in 1991 and we always made profits” said Haas as she briefed Santos on the situation in Ukraine. The local unit’s function was to manage marketing and sales activities. “And we always encourage our units to come up with initiatives. The RHQ might support them financially as well as with experience gained in other markets.” Santos knew the autonomy of the local units was restricted meaning that constant communication with the RHQ was necessary.So far Ukrainian health-care professionals and patients had appreciated PharmaCorp’s high-quality drugs. Therefore although PharmaCorp faced severe competition in Ukraine it had steadily gained market share. In fact the unit managed to outperform other PharmaCorp units in the CEE region in terms of sales and profitability. Even in 2008 when the economic downturn had severely hit businesses in Ukraine PharmaCorp managed to meet its internal targets.This time however the crisis was different. PharmaCorp Ukraine was going through the most difficult time since its establishment: All of a sudden the company was in the red. Furthermore PharmaCorp Ukraine’s responsibility for Crimea (a local region with a population of approximately 2.3 million) had been shifted to the Russian subsidiary and due to war some regions in Eastern Ukraine were cut off from supply. “We are losing ground in Ukraine” Haas emphasized. “Our performance in the market is devastating. And it is highly irritating that most of our global peers in the Ukraine are suffering from a slump in sales of only 10 to 15 per cent. Imagine some local competitors have even increased their sales.”Haas also informed Santos that PharmaCorp Ukraine’s local management team had recently made a request for an adjustment to the internal targets for Ukraine and for more local decision-making autonomy. However the RHQ did not see any need to change the internal targets (see Exhibit 2) which were identical across all RHQ affiliates. The RHQ was convinced that Ukraine would again be an attractive market once the crisis was over. RHQ did not expect profitability to continue to decrease in the medium and long run and it predicted that sales would soon return to their pre-crisis levels (referring to the growth rate of the gross domestic product: 5.2 per cent in 2011 and –6.8 per cent in 2014; see Exhibit 3).Santos was well acquainted with PharmaCorp’s procedures and standardized processes. She was also aware of the multinational corporation’s preference to act in accordance with the global strategy in order to maintain the established global reputation. Legal or any other issues in one single market could quickly spill over and cause damage to PharmaCorp as a whole. She also knew that at the very same moment other PharmaCorp operations were also struggling with major challenges resulting from unstable environments economic or political crises and turbulences.First Impressions: Assessing PharmaCorp Ukraine’s SituationOn September 21 2014 as Santos entered the modern building where PharmaCorp Ukraine had its offices someone called across the entrance hall “Wow—now the currency is up to 16.5.” (This value referred to the exchange rate between the euro and the Ukraine hryvnia (₴)). The atmosphere in the building was extremely chaotic and it took Santos a while to make her way to the elevators. She squeezed into one of them and learned that international exchange markets had started to fluctuate wildly after that day’s morning break in the ceasefire in Luhansk. Although she was aware of those turbulences when she exited the elevator Santos was stunned to hear that the exchange rate had risen to €17.4 per hryvnia up from 15.8 when they had started from the ground floor. She immediately started to check her smartphone for updates.During the past 30 minutes Santos’s inbox had been flooded with messages about the latest happenings in Ukraine—and at PharmaCorp Ukraine. While scanning the subject lines she read: “Massive bombings again” “Two distributors vanished in Eastern Ukraine” “Head of the Law Department resigned” “Inflation up at 15 per cent” “Today’s price of Silovma ₴295 (+ 50 per cent of last week’s level)” and “New health minister assigned.” Santos was overwhelmed by this news and eager to learn about the sentiments of her local management team in its first meeting.Unfortunately this meeting turned out to be chaotic: Everybody was talking at the same time providing different opinions and solutions to the topics Santos had addressed while constantly checking their phones for messages or answering calls. It dawned on Santos that finding a solution to PharmaCorp’s struggles amid the turmoil in Ukraine was now only a remote possibility.During her first weeks in Kiev Santos had met with numerous people from employees to business partners to get an idea of all the problems the crisis had brought about.Since the onset of the crisis health-care professionals including doctors heads of the medical centres and pharmacists had decreased the amount of PharmaCorp drugs being prescribed. In a meeting with the product manager Santos was toldOur best seller Silovma accounts for 20 per cent of total sales and was available for ₴100 before the crisis. Now purchasing power has dropped dramatically and Silovma has become a kind of luxury drug. Depending on the currency rate the price was between ₴180 and 250. One pharmacist stressed this in an amusing way talking about “Coco Silovma.” Salespeople were concerned about the future of their jobs. Those working in Eastern Ukraine were afraid of being attacked because of pro-Russians’ hatred for people who had Kiev licence plates on their cars. These fears were aggravated after some distributors of PharmaCorp’s drugs in the Eastern region of Ukraine had disappeared without a trace.During her first week in Kiev Santos had an odd experience. She went to a pharmacy to buy a pack of vitamin pills and was surprised when she was asked “How many blisters do you need?” Answering that she wanted to buy a full pack the pharmacist explained that pharmacies had started to sell single blisters on their own initiative in an effort to accommodate local demands.Santos also learned that the sharp devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the euro (see Exhibit 4) had led to severe consequences for PharmaCorp Ukraine which imported its products from the RHQ in prices that were denominated in the euro. The devaluation of the hryvnia combined with increasing inflation had led to decreases in local consumers’ purchasing power which made it more difficult for them to afford PharmaCorp’s drugs. The situation had been further aggravated because of rising unemployment more careful spending behaviours and a new value-added tax of 7 per cent on drugs. In addition PharmaCorp Ukraine incurred a duty of 5 per cent on import. In sum it was not only patients who were struggling to afford to pay for drugs; wholesalers were also struggling to pay.One wholesaler stated “I can’t afford to transfer money to you unless I have collected money from my customers the pharmacists.” Santos also heard that banks did not concede liquidity to their clients and granted loans only rarely. In response some firms had started to modify their terms of payment in favour of wholesalers for example by extending dates of payment. If Santos wanted to change the terms she would need the RHQ’s agreement.Santos was bothered by some additional issues including corruption and laws and regulations that continually changed. Since the political situation had been unstable several different people had held—and subsequently been removed from—the very same public office at short intervals. Public offices were characterized by a generally high fluctuation. For example between November 2013 and September 2014 three different people had held the position of health minister. Each one had a different idea about how to organize the health-care system and therefore each one had initiated new rules concerning manufacturing standards price regulations and registrations drug authorization advertising restrictions and much more. To counter these issues the local unit of PharmaCorp introduced some minor initiatives. To revitalize operations for example it granted more and higher discounts. Yet profits continued to fall.One sales manager who had been with PharmaCorp Ukraine for more than 10 years expressed her concerns about the structure of the global organization which hampered local decision-making. The operating unit in Ukraine lacked flexibility and autonomy. Only recently she had to talk to several people in Milan Italy just to get approval for granting a higher discount to a long-time customer. Furthermore she had to wait for two weeks to get a signature from the RHQ so she could hire new drug distributors.Santos also worried about her unit’s expenditures. For example she had learned that the rent for PharmaCorp’s office space in Kiev accounted for a high share of total fixed costs; she also discovered that the operating unit’s number of employees was relatively high compared with its profits and that spending on internal training was much higher than the RHQ average. She was particularly surprised about the high number of internal training sessions. Santos understood that the daily workload of her employees had risen due to the crisis so she asked herself “Why additionally strain them with internal training sessions?”What was Next?Facing the upcoming annual meeting with the RHQ at the end the month Santos needed to develop ideas for further strategic moves. She therefore found herself in a tight position: She needed to find an approach that responded to local challenges while also conforming with PharmaCorp’s global strategy. Identifying such an approach was tricky in itself. Yet Santos and her employees were continuously busy responding to local events encouraging short-term thinking rather than focusing on the development of medium- or long-term solutions. She had thought of some solutions already but she had thus far not deliberated all their pros and cons. One of the first major decisions Santos needed to make was whether PharmaCorp Ukraine should stay in the market or because the situation in Ukraine had worsened recently she should recommend to the RHQ that the organization exit the market.EXHIBIT 1: FLOW OF PRODUCTS AND PAYMENTS BETWEEN PHARMACORP HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS AND WHOLESALERSNote: RHQ = regional headquarters; R&D = research and development; EUR = euro; UAH = Ukrainian hryvniaSource: Created by the authors.

For the previous 12 years Midea Refrigerator had been pursuing globalization via direct export but the high cost of exporting products was depleting its profits and undermining its competitiveness in the international market. Therefore a transition from direct exporting to foreign direct investment (FDI) was necessary. However the exact approach to securing FDI was unclear. Securing investments and a domestic environment in either India or Russia would help the company but which one was right for an initial trial? Further once Midea Refrigerator decided on the target nation it would also have to choose the most suitable FDI model: greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture.CHINA’S “GO GLOBAL” STRATEGY AND HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE INDUSTRYBefore the 1980s there were hardly any competitive domestic manufacturers of household appliances in China. The situation changed with China’s economic reform and opening in 1978 as well as the implementation of two strategies: “bring in” and “go global” which referred to the goals of first bringing in foreign companies and technology to develop China and then encouraging Chinese companies to develop their overseas markets. Accordingly China’s household appliance manufacturers started importing equipment and production lines from developed countries learning these new technologies and producing new appliances of their own. In addition foreign manufacturers set up branches in China. By the end of 1994 more than 20 Sino-foreign joint ventures had been established to make household appliances. A number of brands sprang up and waged a nationwide battle of acquisition producing some giants in the field including Midea TCL Gree and Haier. These companies competed against each other and the foreign companies for market share in China. To increase profits they also manufactured electrical components or products for foreign brands acting as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For many household appliance manufacturers in China being an OEM was the first step on the path to go global.In the 21st century even more Chinese enterprises were exporting or operating abroad but foreign household appliance enterprises were pursuing their own strategic shifts after China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Hitachi Toshiba and Matsushita simultaneously set up innovation centres in China. Samsung LG and A.O. Smith greatly increased their numbers of production lines and investments in the Chinese market. To carve out more market share these brands lowered their prices and forced domestic enterprises into a price battle in which the fledgling Chinese companies paid a heavy price. Suffering from decreasing profits in the Chinese market Chinese household electrical appliance manufacturers had to accelerate their overseas market development. In 2013 Chinese companies looking to go global had a historic opportunity. The “One Belt One Road Initiative” proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping provided a new insight into global expansion. “One Belt” and “One Road” referred to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road Economic Zone which connected Asia with Europe via Russia and Southeast Asia respectively. The initiative was proposed to strengthen ties between China and the countries along the “Belt” and “Road.” With national preferential policies reducing transnational operation risks a number of enterprises had already elected to invest in the “Belt nations” and some household appliance manufacturers were preparing their next move with regard to this changing landscape.MIDEA GROUP AND MIDEA REFRIGERATORMidea GroupEstablished in 1968 Midea Group was a publicly listed Fortune 500 company that offered one of the most comprehensive product ranges in the home appliance industry. It produced diverse equipment for lighting floor care and refrigeration as well as laundry machines large cooking appliances small kitchen appliances and water appliances. In 2015 Midea had 260 logistics centres in more than 200 countries and global revenue of US$22.17 billion.Midea RefrigeratorMidea Refrigerator was established in 2001. In 2004 Midea Group acquired Royalstar Company by acquiring 50.5 per cent of its shares as well as Hefei Hualing Co. Ltd a foreign-invested company whose main business was exporting refrigerators. These acquisitions greatly improved the company’s capability for refrigerator manufacturing. By 2017 Midea Refrigerator had three manufacturing bases in Hefei and Guangzhou with more than 6000 employees. Midea Refrigerator produced products under the brand names Midea Royalstar and Hualing. Both Midea and Royalstar were very well-known brands in China—especially Midea whose value exceeded $4.6 billion in 2016. Gradually Midea Refrigerator became one of the largest refrigerator suppliers in China. Further the firm was continually increasing its development earning $5.4 billion in 2015 in the global market.THE PRODUCT “GOES GLOBAL”Unable to compete directly with the largest corporations in the global market (e.g. Siemens LG Electrolux and Panasonic) Midea Refrigerator like many refrigerator manufacturers in the early 21st century opted to pursue the OEM path. With the advantage of low labour and material costs in China Midea Refrigerator could make a profit by manufacturing refrigerators for international brands like Electrolux Sears LEC and Morita; this arrangement resulted in the shipment of Midea products to dozens of countries and regions and the OEM market came to account for half of Midea Refrigerator’s business.However the landscape changed after 2001. China’s development was reducing OEM profit due to the rising cost of production even as competition in the national market was becoming increasingly fierce. The expansion of Midea Refrigerator also called for more capital. The tide of globalization after China’s WTO entry and the requirement to develop drove Midea Refrigerator to choose one of two options: struggle against adversity and attempt to flourish or watch its profits dwindle away. It was high time to make a transformation. Therefore despite all the uncertainties the company’s manager made the bold choice to launch Midea-brand refrigerators in the global market. But the question remained: how should the company implement this launch? THE BRAND “GOES GLOBAL”The Choice of Channel In 2004 there were hardly any household appliance enterprises in China pursuing global expansion. The only significant player in this category was Haier which adopted a “difficulty first” strategy—occupying the market that was hard to enter first before dealing with the easier ones. Established in 1984 Haier imported China’s first foreign refrigerator manufacturing production line from the German firm Liebherr and proposed a brand-building strategy early in 1985. It exported the first shipment of refrigerators to Germany in 1990 making Europe its first step to entering the global market. In 1995 Haier began to establish overseas factories and in 1996 it opened its first international factory Haier Sapporo in Indonesia. In 1997 Haier set up LKG Electrical Co. Ltd in the Philippines and Haier Industrial Co. Ltd in Malaysia. In 1999 the company established its first industrial park in the United States (in South Carolina). In this way Haier had pursued a direct localization path from the outset.Because it was successful for another large Chinese appliance company Haier’s FDI strategy seemed to be feasible for Midea Refrigerator but Midea Refrigerator declined to follow Haier’s example and turned to a safer path instead: direct export first. He Xiangjian the chairman of Midea Group said “For us low velocity was much better than going astray.” Thus 2005 witnessed the beginning of Midea Refrigerator’s direct export for overseas brand building. The daunting task that remained for the company was to find the right channel and market.Overseas Subsidiary and the Commercial Agent ChannelEarly in 2000 Midea Group’s U.S. subsidiary European subsidiary and Japanese subsidiary started operations and its branches in South Korea and Singapore were established in 2001 which laid a solid foundation for Midea Refrigerator’s export business. The subsidiaries were empowered by the headquarters to draw up their own marketing plans to suit the real conditions of the local market. In this respect Midea Refrigerator benefited from the subsidiaries that the headquarters had opened taking advantage of local expertise. In the process the company honed its skills to set the right prices and conduct the appropriate marketing activities to promote overseas sales. To broaden its existing channels Midea Refrigerator had to make a new path for itself. To export to more overseas markets the company had to cooperate with commercial agents in the target markets. Opening the commercial agent channel was not easy because Midea Refrigerator had to decide which country to start with and then find the appropriate agent. The company was primarily operating as an OEM and the United States was the largest market of Midea-manufactured refrigerators but did that make the country a promising prospect for Midea Refrigerator’s exports? A glance at the U.S. market at the time (i.e. 2004) revealed that its refrigerator market was almost totally carved up among several American giants including Whirlpool and General Electric and some time-honoured foreign brands such as LG and Electrolux. These prominent brands not only had high-quality products but also had the greatest brand awareness among North American consumers which was truly indomitable; the same was true in Europe and many other developed nations which left newcomers only a marginal possibility of success. New geographical locations had to be considered. The manager of Midea Refrigerator carefully considered this vital first step and before long he recognized one area that presented great potential: Australia.Australia: A New Prospect? Early in 1978 the Australian government had included China in a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP was a preferential tariff system that provided for a formal system of exemption from the more general rules of the WTO. A low tariff of 5 per cent greatly benefited Chinese firms that exported to Australia. Moreover Australia was different from many developed nations because of its rarity of resources and the fact that most of its industrial products including household electrical appliances were imported. Most importantly there were not many local refrigerator manufacturers there so Midea Refrigerator’s management reasoned that it might be easier to carve out a market in this less competitive environment. The market prospect was also quite positive because Australia as a developed nation had positive economic performance and rising purchasing power in terms of household appliance consumption. In spite of this generally positive environment the path to Australia was not smooth. The first difficulty was to find the right agent. This agent needed to be powerful and have multiple distribution channels. It took months for Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team to search and assess candidates before they finally made the decision to cooperate with “X Agency.” Even more difficult was the choice of retailer and this negotiation consumed even more time. It was hard to persuade retailers to change the current product structure. To establish the partnership Midea Refrigerator’s manager had to make significant compromises including full support in terms of resources personnel and technical training as well as offering an agency commission that was 10 per cent higher than the market price and granting exclusive agent rights for the contract year. Ultimately however the deal was settled. Yet finding a place in the Australian market was still far from easy. Foreign giants that had entered the Australian market early (e.g. Electrolux and LG) were strong. Electrolux and LG had 30 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the Australian refrigerator market so Midea Refrigerator would have to work hard for its own share. To gain this crucial hold the manager and his team used three strategies:First target the “middle-” and “low-end” markets. The high-end market had already been captured by much larger companies. To find out what consumers in the low-end market really needed Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team conducted market research across the whole Australian refrigerator market. They found that consumers in low-end market attached great importance to the price and energy-conserving qualities of household appliances. In response Midea Refrigerator managed to raise its devices’ energy-conserving abilities and obtained a government certificate for highly energy-efficient products. The company also repeatedly emphasized energy conservation in its marketing while still maintaining a low price point to attract the low-end market. Second make the services localized. In providing services Midea Refrigerator insisted on employing local people to serve the local market especially in positions that involved direct contact with consumers. Third quickly raise brand recognition. Midea Refrigerator held roadshows undertook promotional activities and sponsored popular local events. Most Australian consumers were sports fans and many important sports events were held in Australia making these events ideal national advertising platforms. Midea Group seized the opportunity to become the premier partner sponsor of Melbourne City Football Club so that the brand of Midea Refrigerator could also be widely circulated. The battle for market share in Australia was challenging but opening its first overseas market was highly beneficial for Midea Refrigerator and taught the company many lessons to be used in future expansions as well. By 2015 Midea Refrigerator had entered the U.S. Canadian Malaysian Indonesian Chilean and Vietnamese markets through the company’s subsidiaries and established partnerships with many commercial agents including UE Tech Co. Ltd. in South Korea VSK International Co. Ltd. in Myanmar and Tovarischestvo in Kazakhstan. The growth rate of its direct exports in the global market was buoyant.GLOBAL STRATEGYCompetition in the global market remained fierce. To increase its profits Midea Refrigerator had to lower its costs and make greater breakthroughs in terms of technology. The company was constantly increasing its efforts to achieve these goals.Efficiency ImprovementMidea Refrigerator adopted the “T+3” model to improve efficiency and lower costs. This customer-order model was first developed by the Midea Washing Machine department and was then adopted by the whole company to shorten each cycle (i.e. order receiving material preparation manufacturing and delivery) to less than three days. By adopting the T+3 model the company could quickly respond to orders from anywhere in the world and promptly transport the necessary products or product components to the corresponding market. Technology BreakthroughTo enhance its core competitiveness around the globe Midea Refrigerator continued to strengthen its technology by cooperating with global refrigerator giants like Electrolux and Whirlpool; this cooperation included employing refrigerator experts from Japan and South Korean among other initiatives. Midea Refrigerator received many international certifications including safety certification from US Underwriter Laboratories Inc.—the most authoritative organization in the United States engaging in safety appraisement EU Energy Star certification and TUV quality certification—a widely recognized quality certification in Europe granted by TUV Rheiland. The company also invested more in intelligent refrigerator development. Experts predicted that the intelligent refrigerator was the future of the refrigerator industry around the world and that the global market for intelligent refrigerators would increase at a rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Midea Refrigerator invested in this business niche and was soon a world leader in intelligent refrigerator development. The firm collaborated with Chinese online commerce company Alibaba to formally launch its intelligent refrigerator with the Alibaba Cloud system on September 8 2016. This launch made Midea Refrigerator’s “intelligent system” more localized to consumers in different countries.THE COMPANY “GOES GLOBAL”Despite these efforts Midea Refrigerator’s global market continued to depend solely on direct export which restricted further development and its market share was still limited in some countries. The costs of cross-country transportation and tariffs continued to rise which gave the company little leeway to lower its prices in order to compete with other multinational firms. Twelve years after the decision to launch the brand using direct export Midea Refrigerator opted to take the next strategic step: FDI.Which country should serve as the company’s starting point for FDI? The manager of Midea Refrigerator felt that there were only two clear options: Russia or India. Both countries fit the “One Belt One Road Initiative” which meant that the investment could enjoy favourable national conditions. On the one hand Russia was a large market: 80 per cent of its household electrical appliances were imported from abroad and its consumption rate was increasing by nearly 15 per cent annually. Moreover the country’s refrigerator market comprised 30 per cent of the overall household appliances market. On the other hand India was an emerging economy in Southeast Asia with rising national gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing power. India’s refrigerator market had significant potential because its climate required the use of refrigeration to keep food fresh. In addition the Indian government had been encouraging FDI in its manufacturing area.Yet another question presented itself to Midea Refrigerator’s manager: which FDI model—greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture—was most suitable for each of the prospective countries? These decisions were key to Midea Refrigerator’s future.

SRF was a ₹38 billion multi-business entity. Having completed its third round of share buybacks at ₹380 per share SRF paid an interim and consistent dividend of ₹7 per share. The company had engaged in a series of share buybacks since 2006.In light of India’s falling economic growth and pessimistic global economic outlook Padma needed to analyze whether the company would be able to maintain its growth. Should the company go ahead with another round of share buybacks and increasing dividends? In order to conduct her analysis Padma gathered the company’s financial statements (see Exhibits 1A 1B and 1C) and relevant data on various important ratios (see Exhibit 2) on dividend and earnings per share (EPS) (see Exhibit 3) and on stock prices (see Exhibit 4). She also needed to know what the analysts’ opinions were about SRF but could find very few analyst reports. Based on these inputs and analyses she had to give her recommendation to her CFO.Company BackgroundIncorporated as Shri Ram Fibres in 1970 the company changed its name to SRF Limited in 1990 when it became a multi-business entity engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical-based industrial intermediates in India and internationally. SRF operated in three broad business segments (see Exhibit 5). The technical textile business (TTB) comprised 52 per cent of fiscal year (FY) 2012’s sale of products the chemicals and polymers business (CPB) comprised 29 per cent of FY 2012’s sale of products and the packaging films business (PFB) comprised 19 per cent of FY 2012’s sale of products. Through these segments SRF catered to various industries including automotive infrastructure consumer durables pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. SRF exported its products to nearly 60 countries across the globe. SRF was a global entity with operations in four countries: India Dubai South Africa and Thailand. The company had eight manufacturing facilities in India and one each in Dubai South Africa and Thailand. The South Africa and Thailand facilities had been acquired the most recently and were fully integrated into the company’s overall business.SRF was a market leader in India in technical textiles refrigerants engineering plastics and industrial yarns. The company was controlled by Arun Bharat Ram Group which consisted of various individuals and corporate bodies with promoters holding 49.95 per cent of equity in the company.Industry ProfileTechnical Textile BusinessThe TTB segment was mainly diversified into tire cord fabrics belting fabrics coated fabrics and industrial yarn. It accounted for the largest share of business for the company with a contribution to the sales of the firm in FY 2012 down from 48 per cent in FY 2011. In actual terms however sales of the TTB segment had increased during 2011–12 to over ₹16.7 billion from ₹14.5 billion in FY 2011–10 (see Exhibit 6).Revenue for the TTB segment was mainly driven by the sale of tires to the auto industry for trucks buses multi-utility vehicles and two-wheelers.Nylon Tire Cord Fabric and Polyester Tire Cord FabricNylon tire cord fabric and polyester tire cord fabric were SRF’s main products. These two products were used as a reinforcement material in the bias tires for all major categories from two-wheelers to light and heavy commercial vehicles. As the market leader in Asia SRF was the second-largest tire manufacturer of Nylon 6 tire cord and the fifth-largest tire cord producer in the world. SRF began its operational journey in 1974 with 2500 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and currently stood at 70000 MTPA after continuous periodical expansions and acquisitions. SRF was the only company with a fully integrated polyester tire cord plant with a capacity of 6000 MTPA and had become the only company in India to produce polyester tire cord fabric. Having set up India’s only polyester industrial yarn plant in 2009–10 SRF had been the country’s market leader in nylon tire cord fabric for decades. Demand for nylon tire cord fabric and polyester tire cord fabric depended on the growth of the auto industry and the demand for replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).According to industry estimates tire production was expected to grow by 9.3 per cent in 2012–13 and 13.4 per cent in 2013–14. The OEM demand for tires which consisted of 45 per cent of total tire sales was expected to increase by 10 to 14 per cent each year during 2012–14. However this demand depended on the growth in automobile production. Replacement parts demand was expected to rise by 7 to 11 per cent each year during 2012–14 due to the increase in vehicle sales in recent years. The demand for replacement tires was considered healthy. In March 2011 nearly 80 million automobiles had been sold in the previous six years. Exports were also expected to rise by 19.4 per cent during 2012–14.However raw material costs had been rising steadily especially the cost of natural rubber. In response tire manufacturers had raised their prices during 2011–12.Belting FabricBelting Fabric was used as reinforcement material for conveyor belts. SRF was the second-largest manufacturer of conveyer belting fabric in the world. It was also the market leader in several countries with a market share of 60 per cent in belting fabrics and had a presence in Europe Asia the United States and Latin America. The overseas market accounted for 55 per cent of SRF’s belting fabric business.This segment’s growth potential depended on growth in the domestic mining and infrastructure industry. However this business segment was adversely affected in the second half of 2011–12 due to the fall in mining activity in the country and a freeze on key infrastructure and power projects. During the previous five years SRF had increased its belting fabric business at a compound annual growth rate of about 11 per cent.Coated and Laminated Fabrics Coated and laminated fabrics had a wide range of applications including protective covers dynamic tarpaulins static covers auto canopies and awnings.As India experienced changing lifestyles urbanization and massive investments in infrastructure products such as signage awnings and hangar covers were expected to see double-digit growth. Increased use of tensile structures with fabrics as evidenced in stadiums homes and exhibition centres was also expected to mean double-digit growth for SRF’s high-end product sales.The company’s new state-of-the-art project was expected to produce 1.7 million square metres per year of coated fabric through a new coating line at its existing plant location in Gummidipoondi in Tamil Nadu state. With a total investment of approximately ₹1.43 billion work was progressing on schedule. Commercial production at the new plant had started in the second quarter of 2011–12. The new facility would offer a wide assortment of products including hangar covers auto canopies awnings lacquered tarpaulins and fabrics for tensile structures. Polyurethane-coated fabrics for various applications were also expected to be introduced.Industrial Yarn (Nylon and Polyester)Industrial yarn was used for conveyor belts transmission belts hoses ropes geo-textile applications fishing nets and stitching threads. SRF continued to enjoy a substantial market share in this segment.Chemicals and Polymers BusinessThe CPB segment included chloromethane pharmaceuticals certified emission reductions (CER) and allied products refrigerant gases and engineering plastics.During 2011–12 SRF posted record performance in this segment (including CER income) with sales growth of 61 per cent and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) growth of 106 per cent. The fluoro-specialties business had continued to grow at a brisk pace with sales growth of 48 per cent and earnings before interest depreciation and taxes growth of 99 per cent in this same period.Chemicals—Refrigerant/Chloromethane/Fluoro-SpecialtiesRefrigerant/chloromethane/fluoro-specialties were primarily used as a cooling medium (refrigerants) in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. The market for refrigerants was estimated to grow at about 20–25 per cent per year. SRF was the market leader in this area with about a 40 per cent share of the Indian domestic market. Exports accounted for 60 per cent of the volumes produced and were spread across 45 countries worldwide. In response to market concerns the company had focused on producing and delivering new-generation hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blends and HFCs in place of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons. During 2012–13 the company planned to increase the production capacity of HFC-134a an ozone-friendly refrigerant and set up new production facilities for multi-purpose chemicals at Dahej in Gujarat state. New projects were planned every year for the fluoro-specialties business.Polymers—Engineering PlasticsEngineering plastics were used widely in the automotive and electrical industries. Performance in this area was mainly driven by those industries which consisted of the user segments of engineering plastics.Packaging FilmsDuring 2011–12 the packaging films industry saw a drop in the domestic market of around 30 per cent. The drop in business was partly due to a ban on plastic laminates that were used in the packaging of gutka an extremely harmful mixture of tobacco and other substances that was found to cause cancer. The ban was issued by the Supreme Court of India. SRF’s packaging films segment saw a decline of 92.91 per cent in EBIT from almost ₹3.5 billion in 2010–11 to ₹245 million in 2011–12 (see Exhibit 6). SRF responded to this challenge by venturing into value-added product variants and two international projects at Thailand and South Africa to be commissioned in 2013–14.SRF competed against several companies in major business segments (see Exhibit 7).CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: GROWTH EXPANSION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTDuring 2006–2012 the company embarked on a journey of growth and expansion of its production facilities and market both in India and overseas through various organic and inorganic opportunities. In 2008–09 SRF acquired Thai Baroda Industries Limited a Thailand-based tire cord company which enabled SRF to emerge as the third-largest tire cord fabric manufacturer in Asia and fifth-largest in the world. In 2008–09 SRF acquired the belting fabrics business of Industex Technical Textiles (Pty) Limited in South Africa. The company was then renamed SRF Industex Belting (Pty) Ltd. The acquisition’s price was ₹200 million. In 2009–10 SRF set up the first and only producer plant of polyester industrial yarn in technological collaboration with Toray Industries Japan. It would serve the growing segment of polyester tire cord fabric used for radial tires for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles—a one-stop-shop for all kinds of fabric for tire manufacturers. It would also provide backward integration with the company’s belting fabric and coated fabric businesses.In 2008–09 SRF purchased two businesses—an engineering plastics business and an industrial yarn business—from the holding company SRF Polymers Limited.Two international packaging films projects were started at plants in Thailand and South Africa. The plant at South Africa was expected to have a production capacity of 25000 in biaxially oriented polypropylene film with an investment of ₹2.5 billion. The African plant would begin its production in July 2013. Both units were scheduled to be commissioned during 2013–14. In October 2010 SRF’s board approved an 80:20 joint venture with Nitol-Niloy to establish a plant in Bangladesh for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate a polyester film used for its high tensile strength. The plant had a capacity of 28500 MTPA with an estimated cost of ₹3.2 billion. The project was commissioned in 2012.By the fourth quarter of 2011–12 production began at the multi-purpose chemical complex in Dahej Gujarat state for flourine-based specialty chemicals and hydrofluorocarbons to be used as intermediates in the manufacture of drugs and pesticides for customers in Japan Europe and the United States. During 2012–13 this plant was expected to increase its production capacity of HFC-134a. SRF would have invested over ₹2 billion by that time. The commissioning of a state-of-the-art coating line plant was expected at an existing site in Gummidipoondi with a total investment of approximately ₹1.4 billion. The plant had the capacity to produce 17 million square metres per year of coated fabric starting in the second quarter of FY 2011–12.SRF had also actively invested in research and development centres at Chennai and Bhiwadi for chemicals and at Manali for TTB (see Exhibit 8). The company planned to spend another ₹1.4 billion for acquisition new projects research and development facilities and upgrading existing facilities.Carbon Emission ReductionsSRF’s income also included receipts from the transfer of CER also referred to as carbon credits which were added to capital reserves (see Exhibits 9 and 10).The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change an international environmental treaty for stabilizing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere to prevent the deterioration of the earth’s ozone layer provided SRF with approval in principle for 3833566 CERs per year. However income from CERs would be generated only until June 2014 and the amount would depend on CER value which had seen a fall in price.Dividend History—Buyback of SharesOn June 24 2006 the SRF board of directors decided to buy back the company’s equity shares from the open market through stock exchanges. During FY 2006–07 the company purchased 16084 equity shares at an average price of ₹194.29 resulting in the disbursement of ₹3124934 to its shareholders (see Exhibit 11).On April 25 2008 the company again decided to buy back its equity shares from the open market through stock exchanges. The buyback started on July 2 2008 and ended on April 16 2009. During this period the company was able to purchase a total of 7381425 equity shares at an average market price of ₹94.83 per share. This buyback of shares cost the company nearly ₹700 million reaching the maximum allowed buyback amount of shares for that time.On July 28 2009 the SRF board of directors announced another buyback of fully paid-up equity shares for an amount not exceeding ₹650 million at a maximum price of ₹160 per share from the open market through stock exchanges. However the company was not eligible to make a second buyback offer before the completion of 365 days from the date of the preceding offer of buyback according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s Buyback of Shares Act. Consequently SRF withdrew its buyback offer.On February 26 2011 SRF announced a buyback of fully paid-up equity shares for an amount not exceeding ₹900 million at a maximum price of ₹380 per share from the open market through stock exchanges. The buyback started on April 6 2011 and remained open until February 25 2012. A total of 3083080 equity shares at an average market price of ₹291.89 per share were bought back for a total amount of approximately ₹900 million by February 10 2012. SRF’s share buyback history included several different buyback events from 2008 to 2012 (see Exhibits 12A and 12B).SRF in 2012During FY 2011–12 the company was affected by a multitude of factors and combined effects including an adverse demand–supply situation higher energy costs and higher input costs which resulted in a decline of 36 per cent in its net profit after tax of ₹870 million compared to ₹1.36 billion the previous year. SRF’s net sales also declined from ₹8.46 billion to ₹8.22 billion during the same period.Unlike the CPB segment both the TTP and PFB segments showed a decline in profitability. The company’s performance in light of the global economic crisis European economic problems the falling index of industrial production data and falling gross domestic product figures (see Exhibits 13a and 13b) raised many questions. With healthy cash balance reserves a consistent dividend payment history and many capital expenditure projects in the pipeline could SRF maintain robust growth in the coming years? What was the strategy behind the past three buybacks of shares? Would the firm engage in such an endeavour again in the future? With SRF’s zero share premium amount left in the reserves Padma also had to determine if the company could reward its shareholders by paying a higher dividend in the coming years (see Exhibits 14 and 15) and understand why there were so few reports from analysts about the company. Based on her analyses what should her recommendation be to the CFO for the next two years?Exhibit 1a: Balance Sheet (in ₹10 million)Source: Prepared by the authors with information from the Capitaline Database accessed July 8 2015 www.capitaline.com.Exhibit 1b: Income Statement (in ₹10 million)Source: Prepared by the authors with information from the Capitaline Database accessed July 8 2015 www.capitaline.com.Exhibit 1c: Cash Flow Statement (in ₹10 million)Exhibit 1c (continued)Note: P/L = profit/loss;

Sethi was the chief information officer of Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) the world’s largest two-wheeler company. Although HMCL and other companies in the industry carefully considered safety features for their vehicles it was not enough. Road safety was also dependent on the driver and other factors in addition to the safety features of the vehicle.By the end of 2017 after Sethi had undertaken many road safety initiatives and awareness campaigns he was faced with a dilemma. There was no easy way to measure the success of the road safety marketing campaign and he had already spent a significant amount of money on the program. Now he had to decide whether to continue or end the program. THE COMPANYIn 1984 Hero Cycles Ltd. (Hero) of India and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (Honda) of Japan entered a joint venture to manufacture two-wheelers in India. The joint venture Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (Hero Honda) grew rapidly. In December 2010 Hero and Honda decided to separate and Hero bought out Honda’s stake. The company was re-named Hero MotoCorp Ltd. in July 2011 and in the subsequent month it revealed its new logo. HMCL aimed to provide “world class mobility solutions with renewed focus on expanding [the] company’s footprint in the global arena.” By March 2017 the company had sold more than 70 million units of two-wheelers since its inception and had an annual capacity of 8.1 million two-wheeler units. The company had a market share of 51 per cent in motorcycles in India. The company also sold two-wheelers across 35 other countries.HMCL had a net revenue of ₹313 billion and a net profit of ₹34 billion in 2016–17. It had an excellent return on capital employed—49 per cent—and earnings per share of ₹169 (see Exhibit 1).The company focused on social activities an initiative that came from its founder Brijmohan Lall Munjal who had once stated “We must give back to the society from whose resources we generate wealth.” HMCL’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities were branded Hero We Care and organized around four key initiatives: education safe riding the environment and girl child empowerment (see Exhibits 2 and 3). The education program aimed to promote education with a special focus on girls; the safe riding program aimed to promote road safety by addressing issues that led to road accidents; the environment program promoted cleanliness and making India green; and the girl child empowerment program targeted girls aged six and above from the underprivileged sections of society with the aim to help and support them in their overall development. Awareness among people about road safety was a key area for the company and was enabled through social and electronic media.During 2016–17 HMCL spent ₹851 million on CSR activities amounting to 2.4 per cent of the company’s average profits over the previous three years. As required by law the company had also formed a CSR policy and a CSR committee to oversee corporate spending in that area. The company had performed well financially and its social development initiatives had been well received. The road safety program had worked well in terms of grabbing people’s attention. The question uppermost in Sethi’s mind was whether the awareness generated by the road safety program had actually led to behavioural change and an impact on the ground. He was concerned that while people might have approved of the program they may have forgotten its message over time. What could he do he wondered to measure its success and determine the future direction for the program?TWO-WHEELER INDUSTRY IN INDIA By 2016 the Indian automobile industry was one of the largest in the world. The automobile industry accounted for 7.1 per cent of India’s gross domestic product. The two-wheeler segment was the leader in the industry with 81 per cent of the market share. The growth had resulted from a growing middle class and a young population.The two-wheeler industry was composed of three product categories: scooters motorcycles and mopeds. The industry had evolved significantly since its inception in 1950 and had grown rapidly with annual sales of over 20 million units in 2015–16 (see Exhibit 4). Two-wheelers constituted the bulk of sales in the automobile industry. Apart from HMCL the three major companies in the Indian two-wheeler industry were Bajaj Auto Ltd. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. and TVS Motor Company.Bajaj Auto Ltd.Bajaj Auto Ltd. manufactured motorcycles three-wheelers and automotive parts. Its Pulsar brand of motorcycles was very popular.Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd.Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. manufactured motorcycles and scooters at its plants in Manesar Haryana; Tapukara Rajasthan; Narsapura Karnataka; and Vithalpur Gujarat. It offered popular models such as Activa and Deo in the scooter segment and Shine in the motorcycle segment.TVS Motor CompanyTVS Motor Company was primarily an automotive parts manufacturer. It had collaborated with Suzuki Motor Corporation to venture into the motorcycle space in 1982 but the companies had subsequently separated. TVS Motor Company produced strong brands such as Scooty in the scooter segment and Apache in the motorcycle segment.There were several other relatively smaller players in the Indian two-wheeler industry including Yamaha Motor Pvt. Ltd. Royal Enfield (manufactured by Eicher Motors Ltd.) Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt. Ltd. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. and Piaggio Vehicle Pvt. Ltd. (see Exhibit 5).The FutureIn 2017 new developments were taking place in the automobile industry in India. New advances in electric vehicles—including automobiles trains aircraft and ships—were increasingly being announced. By 2030 100 million electric vehicles would need to be deployed to reach the target set by the United Nations Framework on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement. The Indian government had said that India could cut its energy demand by 64 per cent by making its transportation industry electric which had significant implications for India’s automotive sector. In a move toward making this happen the Indian government had set up the National Electric Mobility Mission. The mission planned to create a potential demand for between 5 and 7 million electric vehicles by 2020. These vehicles would include buses light commercial vehicles two-wheelers and three-wheelers and electric cars. Most automobile companies had announced plans for electric vehicles and even the cab sharing company Ola had started a pilot on electric vehicles in India. Almost all major motorcycle manufacturers in India had scheduled launches of electric two-wheelers from 2018 onwards. HMCL: KEY STAKEHOLDERSProducts and Customer PreferencesBy 2017 consumers’ preferences in the two-wheeler market were evolving. Higher disposable income increasing urbanization and infrastructure turnaround were leading to structural and segmental shifts in the two-wheeler industry. The increase in scooter contribution to the industry was visible. The growth of premium motorcycles in the industry was led by the emergence of women buyers and millennials. To cater to a wide range of customers HMCL produced vehicles at different price points (see Exhibit 6).HMCL’s branding was characterized by the following traits: patriotic (i.e. the pride of being Indian) trusted (i.e. reliable honest caring and responsible) innovative (i.e. technology- and future-driven) young (i.e. aggressive and fast-paced) open (i.e. not selective or exclusive but inclusive and talking to everyone) and confident (i.e. big and omnipresent).SuppliersThe company had a large network of suppliers that produced the parts for the manufacture of motorcycles. Cost management at its suppliers was critical for HMCL to operate efficiently and be competitive in the market. The company ran a Green Vendor Development Program which was a supply-chain initiative taken to extend corporate environment responsibility down the supply chain.DistributionHMCL had an extensive sales and service network spanning more than 6000 customer touchpoints. These were a mix of authorized dealers service and spare parts outlets and dealer-appointed outlets.PROMOTION AND BRANDING AT HMCLHero was known for its strong brand recognition and it had successfully capitalized on this recognition. After the separation from Honda the company had rights to the Hero Honda brand until 2014. However the company realized that it needed to push a stand-alone brand. Hero carefully crafted its brand elements and ensured that they aligned with the company’s values. Hero chose the new name Hero MotoCorp with the word moto connoting motorized two-wheelers. Its global aspirations were indicated by the launch of the new brand in London in August 2011. The new logo was contemporary and futuristic in style with a three-dimensional “H” in red and black. The red in the logo stood for energy passion and confidence while the black stood for solidity and premium quality.Before the separation Hero Honda’s tag line had been Desh ki Dhadkan (The Heartbeat of the Nation)—a big success especially at events like the Cricket World Cup in 2003. The new tag line was Hum Mein Hai Hero (There is a Hero in Each One of Us). This helped the company connect with the consumer at an individual level.As part of the corporate brand makeover during 2011–2013 the company launched the Billion Voices program. The aim of the program was to use crowdsourcing as a means of attracting customers toward the brand. The company leveraged the increasing popularity of social media and the Internet and millions of people uploaded videos of themselves singing “Hum Mein Hai Hero.” Selected videos were combined into an advertisement and were broadcast on commercial television channels. Beyond promoting the corporate brand the company also released a series of product-specific advertisements. By 2013 the corporate rebranding program was essentially complete.In August 2016 timed to coincide with the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio the company launched the Hero Come Home Safe campaign. The campaign featured anxious family members from young children to grandparents waiting for their loved ones to return home safe. The minute-long spot was part of Hero’s CSR initiative Ride Safe India (see Exhibit 7). It was aimed to sensitize consumers by linking road safety to family bonds. The campaign generated close to 15 million views on social media platforms.Several automobile manufacturers also launched safety campaigns around the same time. Car manufacturer Ford India Pvt. Ltd. rolled out a Raksha Bandhan advertisement in July featuring Indian film actress Kalki Koechlin. The commercial showed Koechlin tying a rakhi on her own wrist as she drove off. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. rolled out eight television commercials urging customers to drive safely by wearing a seat belt following lane driving avoiding phone calls while driving and not driving drunk. Chevrolet India Ltd. piloted its first safety campaign Drive with Care during the monsoon season—a time when fatalities (of car passengers and pedestrians) increased.The slew of safety advertisements were linked to the public’s perception that vehicle safety was lacking. In May 2016 five Indian cars failed crash tests due in large part to the absence of airbags. The Global New Car Assessment Program a U.K.-based safety and testing organization had conducted the tests. Also in June 2016 the Advertising Standards Council of India reissued its guidelines for automotive vehicles which it had formed in 2008 clearly stating that no advertisement campaign should show reckless driving or stunts that required professional driving skills. Stunts depicted in advertisements were required to come with a disclaimer. The guidelines also urged two- and four-wheeler manufacturers to promote safe practices including wearing helmets fastening seat belts and not using mobile phones while driving.ROAD SAFETYIndia had the second-longest road network in the world and the government planned to add 30 kilometres of road per day. Therefore India’s growth depended on automobiles. An increased road network along with rising incomes led to an increase in the number of vehicles. At the same time there was a general lack of awareness of basic traffic rules road signs traffic lights and security precautions mainly due to lax standards in issuing licences and outdated traffic laws. A lack of road safety awareness coupled with weak policing of the roads led to the common occurrence of people driving without seat belts or a driver’s licence. Because the Motor Vehicles Act which governed traffic and vehicles in India had not been updated since 1988 safety features in automobiles were low in priority. Motorists were reluctant to help accident victims for fear of getting involved in long drawn-out court cases. Medical help was often late to arrive or unavailable. Safety initiatives undertaken by the government and non-governmental organizations had little effect.According to the World Health Organization’s 2017 report Managing Speed a major factor in road safety was rapid urbanization. Road traffic death and injuries could be attributed to the increased number of vehicles on the road; more traffic in urban areas had also led to a higher level of pollution resulting in respiratory diseases. Faster vehicles improved mobility and travel times but increased the rate of road accidents and caused more severe injuries at higher speeds. The World Health Organization suggested four approaches to improving road safety: safe speeds safe road users safe vehicles and safe roads and roadsides (see Exhibit 8).The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways reported 480652 accidents and 150785 deaths in India in 2016. According to the Managing Speed report “Approximately 1.25 million people die every year on the world’s roads as a result of road traffic crashes.” The importance of road safety was marked by the fact that it had become a part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. By 2020 the objective was to reduce the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 50 per cent.STRATEGIC ELEMENTS OF ROAD SAFETY PROGRAMSHMCL’s strategy to address safety issues was based on three main factors:Behavioural change: HMCL attempted to effect behavioural change through Traffic Training Parks where both adults and children learned about road safety and adopted good habits. Children were considered significant influencers. When a child asked the parent to wear a seat belt or a helmet the parent was compelled to comply.Formal education: Road safety classes were conducted in Delhi and through the Student Police Cadet program which trained 2200 students. The program considered children to be change agents and influencers within their family and society in general. The program was eventually expanded to colleges and universities. HMCL trainers used audiovisual equipment and mobile vans to motivate people through street play.Awareness: To ensure that behavioural change and formal education reached its target the company used social media and mass media (primarily television). The message was delivered in three different segments: Come Home Safe Afterlife and Buddy. The message in the Come Home Safe series was “Your family is waiting for you so be safe.” The Afterlife series focused on what would happen if the driver died. The Buddy series which focused on steps to take to be safe acted like an alter ego that pointed out mistakes and suggested corrective actions (e.g. “Listen to yourself.”). The promotions were delivered on a sequential basis. The company aimed to attack the safety issue by focusing on the individual first then on the family and finally on society. It pushed the message recipient to think about family (the Come Home Safe series) and about oneself (the Buddy series) otherwise there would be dire consequences (the Afterlife series). The approach attempted to raise awareness educate people and create social pressure. Having raised awareness about road safety the company engaged in ground-level activities to encourage safe driving.RIDE SAFE INDIA PROGRAMHMCL engaged in multiple activities to address issues that led to accidents and fatalities on the roads including the Ride Safe India program which became the company’s flagship CSR activity. Within a year of scaling up Ride Safe India was recognized by the Indian government’s Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The program also involved the police forces of various Indian states in running various road safety awareness campaigns for two-wheeler riders most of which were focused on school students. Participants underwent a structured training module aided by world-class training facilities. For building awareness around road safety the team from HMCL participated in activities including walks online campaigns blogs social media engagements and safety-focused “sensitizing” films.Traffic Training ParksThe objective of the Traffic Training Parks was primarily to address one of the root cause of road fatalities—driver error. Traffic Training Parks were set up in the cities of Gurugram Delhi Lucknow Hyderabad Nagpur and Rourkela and were adopted by HMCL to run its road safety programs. Some of the activities undertaken at the parks included two-wheeler riding training programs for all drivers. The training parks were equipped with riding simulators safety riding tracks stretches of road with varying conditions and safe-riding equipment. The trained faculty educated participants on road safety through specially prepared audiovisual aids. Student Police CadetsThe Student Police Cadets project was aimed at making students ambassadors of road safety while grooming them to become model citizens. The project run at schools in Gurugram involved sessions on road safety awareness traffic management community development skills leaderships skills disaster management and waste management. The project also involved physical training for children along with outdoor activities and sports. Awareness ProgramsTo spread awareness of the importance of road safety HMCL ran major social media campaigns on road safety. The company interacted with thousands of individuals through its sensitizing content delivered over Facebook YouTube and Twitter. The viral Afterlife videos had an impressionable message. The Buddy series which included a collection of animated videos on road safety for schoolchildren was given to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for its use. Various other videos were broadcast on prime time television during the UEFA EURO 2016 soccer championships and the Rio Olympics to reach the masses. The Ride Safe India program (see Exhibit 9) covered many people across many states. Over 160000 individuals including students teachers police personnel and HMCL customers participated in Traffic Training Parks and road safety awareness programs. About 1.2 million people participated in a road safety competition organized in association with the Delhi Police. The message of safe riding through 2400 various activities during National Road Safety Week reached 75000 individuals. Twenty-two hundred students from 50 schools enrolled as Student Police Cadets in association with the Haryana Police. Six Traffic Training Parks were operational in six states.LEVERAGING SOCIAL media TO GAIN SCALEWhen Sethi took over as the head of CSR at HMCL he quickly realized the potential of information technology to leverage the company’s CSR efforts. He used the Internet to spread awareness about the girl child empowerment program and to encourage people across the country to support the cause. Technology and social media increased the scale of HMCL’s CSR initiatives as Sethi explained:What were once silo efforts towards CSR were now being turned into holistic endeavours that were visible and had an impact on the ecosystem. . . . The way we wanted to use social media was to make sure that the right message is delivered to the right people using the most relevant medium. Targeted communication was done on a large scale helping in scaling up the awareness attempts.Sethi launched a video social media campaign for Hamari Pari (Our Angel) which was HMCL’s program for underprivileged girls. The response was remarkable with 2.8 million views on the first day and trending on Twitter for eight hours. “The social media campaign created such a buzz on girl empowerment with many celebrities and also Facebook lauding the social cause” he said.HMCL’s videos on social media promoting road safety received 28 million views. Sethi explained how they were distributed: We at Hero MotoCorp have been utilizing the power of social media a lot over the years in our marketing efforts. So when we were planning to find ways and means to supplement our CSR efforts and to create mass awareness on areas like girl child empowerment child education and road safety leveraging the power and reach of social media—be it Facebook You Tube Twitter or others—became a natural choice. We created some nice films and videos on these themes and the response has been fantastic with many of them getting 1 million plus views. We also used Twitter to create awareness among youth on safe riding. We did an hour-long tweet chat with youngsters to educate them on road safety. . . . As part of our Ride Safe India initiative we have also partnered with UP [Uttar Pradesh] Police in their Responsible Citizen program with Gurgaon Police as part of the Student Police Cadet Program and with Delhi and Telangana Police to create awareness on various aspects of road safety.A Time to IntrospectSethi was pleased with the growth of HMCL’s CSR program particularly the Ride Safe India program. He was also pleased with the success of the company’s social media campaign. Road safety was being discussed in the national media and many states had started making helmets mandatory. Although he was proud of the achievements to date he knew that there was much more to accomplish but he was unsure how to proceed: We have made a decent start. It’s a long road but hopefully a safe road. We do all these programs in schools and universities; [we] run social and mass media campaigns. Has this led to a reduction in accidents? I don’t know. Is it leading to people becoming safer? I don’t know. When you are spending so much money on this is it really bearing fruit? One way to look at it is to say that today more than 250000 families are more aware about road safety and therefore making roads a bit safer. Also compounding the problem is [that the] population is increasing roads are getting congested and chances of accidents [are] increasing. That is the dilemma I’m facing. Should we keep concentrating on the three approaches of behaviour change education and awareness? Or should we try something radically different? Should we dump road safety altogether and try something different. What should I do?EXHIBIT 1: HMCL KEY FINANCIALS (STAND-ALONE)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹63.85 on December 31 2017Source: Hero MotoCorp Ltd. Hero MotoCorp Ltd.

The boy with an office bag has a toy in his hand in place of a steering wheel. The girl holds on to his shoulder acting as if the duo is on a bike. They ask onlookers to join in while running before they fall abruptly on a carpet. The boy stays motionless on the ground while the girl looks on. A crowd gathers to see what has happened. Two other boys join in and here starts an impromptu street play. One of them points out that the crowd gathered is looking for tamaasha (entertainment) as there is action drama and emotion in this story (the accident). He goes on to deliver the message: when there is an accident do not gather there for the entertainment call for an ambulance instead to help the victim. The gathered crowd applauds the act while the film ends with this line from Ride Safe India: “Don’t be a bystander. Help accident victims.”Video 2Another video narrates a story through the eyes of a fly. The fly says that as a young man in its previous birth he always looked for danger and that is why he would not ride a bike but “fly” it. He died while riding a bike because he was not wearing a helmet. As the fly moves around the house it is attacked by everyone and this makes the fly feel as if it is living on the edge just as the young man did in the past life. The film ends with the line “Don't bank on the afterlife. Always wear a helmet while riding.”Video 3Another video follows a similar pattern as the video described above this time through the eyes of a snail. The snail reveals that in its previous life as a human it hated waiting for anything and that green or red lights on a traffic signal did not matter to him. So one day as he ran across the road a car ran over him and ended his life. Now he is back as a snail and has been waiting to cross the road for the last three hours.CampaignsAfterlife Series IndiaCampaign Insight: There is shock value in becoming a creature in the next life.Campaign Objective: Promote safe riding among youth by shaking them up and informing them about the perils of not driving safely.Come Home Safe Series IndiaCampaign Insight: Ride safe for the one who is waiting for you at home.Campaign Objective: Bring to the fore the sensitive issue of road safety.Buddy Series IndiaThe Buddy series is a collection of 40 animated videos on various aspects of road safety—such as wearing a helmet wearing a seat belt etc.—where the “Buddy” tells road the right way to practice road safety.Source: “Afterlife Series” YouTube videos posted by TheHeroMotoCorp last updated November 8 2016 accessed May 6 2018 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjoUvhEO2OPhS1B0TUsLb0fhrmfD6Pfwr; “Hero Come Home Safe” YouTube video 1:00 posted by TheHeroMotoCorp August 5 2016 accessed May 6 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_FNqL1w5I.

The company had made sound investment decisions in a growing industry but the industry was nearing saturation and a billion-dollar company had recently opened its doors in the city. Katz was feeling pressure. Fleetway had a great deal of land and building assets and the question was how to put these to better use. The board preferred to have an expansion plan operational by the summer when the company could capitalize on the surplus leisure time of students and families. Katz needed to have his proposal ready for the next board meeting in just a few days.FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT CENTRESAn FEC was a small-scale amusement facility usually marketed toward families with children or teenagers. Having multiple anchor attractions differentiated FECs from single-anchored leisure attractions such as bowling skating laser tag miniature golf or arcades. Demographic studies had revealed a direct relationship between the number of amenities offered and the happiness of consumers. Multiple attractions created an FEC’s identity and reputation leading to its appeal and popularity. FECs were known to have long wait-times during peak season but consumers did not mind because they could enjoy other activities or food and beverages while they waited. Offering food and beverages did not yield high margins but helped bring consumers through the door to play the higher-margined recreational games.The FEC businesses in Canada were small and under-developed compared to the international FEC industry. Canadian businesses would often look to the American industry for resources and direction. Not-for-profit organizations like the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions as well as the Bowling Proprietors’ Association of America hosted trade shows that offered consulting sessions half-day symposiums and networking receptions. These events helped attendees improve their efficiency marketing safety and profitability while providing them with an opportunity to stay ahead of their competitors. Active management was an important quality for any FEC especially in regions with a higher concentration of competition.The Canadian industry was highly fragmented composed of many small establishments that operated a single location and catered to a market niche of local consumers. In 2017 the largest industry operators accounted for less than 5 per cent of industry revenue. Of the more than 20000 establishments in Canada an estimated 99.2 per cent had fewer than 100 employees. However with the expanding presence of U.S.-based companies in Canada market share was expected to become more concentrated over the next five years. The number of new enterprises had increased 4.5 per cent annually due to growing demand and relatively low barriers to entry. The Canadian FEC industry saw revenues of CA$1.5 billion in 2017 and at an average rate of 4.5 per cent between 2012 and 2017 was growing faster than the gross domestic product. Continued growth of 2.3 per cent annually was projected (see Exhibit 1). Per-capita expenditure was between $10 and $17 for a typical visit where the average length of stay was two to two-and-a-half hours. Most FECs were subject to seasonality and fluctuation in revenue was dependent on weather location and product mix. Competing factors differentiating FECs were the type of facility level of technology location customer service and price offerings. Investing in innovative equipment and hiring technical expertise were key advantages to ensure customer safety and to extend the life-span of equipment. In turn this helped reduce operating costs increase profits and improve customer service and loyalty.The industry was expected to cope with many consumers being time-strapped over the next few years as per capita leisure time remained at 5.4 hours per day. Nevertheless health-conscious consumers and households who valued spending their limited leisure time with family preferred to fill their spare time with physical activities rather than watching television or participating in other sedentary activities. Furthermore the number of children under 19 and the amount of disposable household income were both expected to increase.REGULATION AND POLICYIndustry operators had difficulty developing brand awareness beyond their local community. Securing a large amount of space required to build an FEC was challenging because many Canadian municipalities allocated urban land for industrial and office use rather than for retail areas or establishments like FECs. This limited the opportunity for an FEC to expand its operations or to relocate close to large retailers such as shopping malls which would drive customer traffic. Furthermore FECs were required to comply with regulations related to the Amusement Devices Act. For example offering high-adrenaline activities such as a trampoline park or go-karts required taking steps to obtain a licence and complete a government mandated inspection. Small businesses in Ontario were facing increased rates for a few of their main expenses due to recent government legislation. Most notably in January 2018 the minimum wage increased by 22 per cent to $14 per hour and was set to rise again in 2019. Most FECs hired at minimum wage. The prices for hydro and utilities another substantial cost for FECs were also expected to increase. The government planned to institute a 2 per cent annual increase until the year 2022. Between 2022 and 2027 hydro and utilities were projected to grow 6.5 per cent annually followed by a significant 10.5 per cent increase in 2028. In 2017 rent and utilities and wages accounted for 8.9 per cent and 32.9 per cent of industry revenue respectively. To combat obesity among the general population particularly in younger individuals many provinces and territories had planned to invest in campaigns that raise awareness of health ailments related to obesity. FECs were increasingly incorporating physical activity into their offerings to attract health-conscious individuals.CUSTOMERSThe majority of FECs targeted families as their primary customers. London was the 11th-largest city in Canada and had over 100000 families up 3.5 per cent over the previous decade. However London was experiencing an increased number of households without children. The average after-tax income was $70000 for families without children and $90000 for those with children. The north and west regions of London were host to the majority of high-income earners. Families were not willing to travel more than 15 to 20 minutes per visit. In addition to proximity families valued price safety and a multitude of amenities for the whole family to enjoy. During the summer months they preferred to engage in outdoor activities and summer programs—something to keep the kids busy during their time out of school. Families were also known to choose an FEC to host their children’s birthday parties. They preferred an FEC that had party rooms and catered food and beverages. In addition where bowling was offered families with young children preferred five-pin bowling over the standard 10-pin bowling.Besides families FECs attracted young individuals recreational groups and local businesses. University and college students often visited because it was a fun date location or because it was a good way to decompress from their studies. They would grab drinks and go for a few rounds of bowling billiards or miniature golf. Typically they visited later in the evening when families had gone home. Students valued price and promotions as well as location—close to where they lived. Another type of consumer was the regular who thoroughly enjoyed a particular activity and visited weekly for recreational purposes. The most common recreational programs were bowling leagues that mainly engaged an older retired consumer who had a great deal of free time. Lastly FECs located at an upscale location hosted corporate events which made consumers out of a wide array of local businesses. Businesses looking to conduct team-building exercises or host holiday events would choose an FEC for their private rooms and amenities. They were not price-conscious but they did place a high value on service and reputation. Location was not a top priority; they valued the atmosphere as well as the food and beverage options.COMPETITORSPalasad: Thrilling Food and FunPalasad was a leading entertainment venue operator with two locations in London (see Exhibit 2) priding itself on a thrilling experience for both its guests and its employees. The founder Rob Szabo started Palasad with the conviction that bowling and billiards should be comfortable cool and accompanied by great food and drink. Szabo managed his family’s fitness club after getting a degree in economics and an MBA from Ivey at Western University (Western). Palasad opened its doors in the mid-1990s after Szabo capitalized on the closure of a rundown bowling alley in the same building as the fitness club. After a few years of success Palasad expanded to another location in south London. Palasad North was at the corner of a busy intersection a few blocks away from London’s downtown core. This location attracted many private events especially over the three-month span leading up to the holiday season. Revenues from this consumer segment represented roughly 35 per cent of the company’s total revenues. However this location was too far away from downtown to benefit from the high traffic during the summer months. In addition to competing with the nearby patios and festivals that graced London’s Richmond Row Palasad North was negatively affected by the departure of university and college students. Seasonality was not as prominent at the south location where the focus was more on families. Palasad’s upscale lounge and dining experience was the main attraction. Food and beverage accounted for over 50 per cent of revenues with the big draw coming from its wood oven cuisine. The strategy was to attract parents with the dining experience and have them bring their kids for the games. Palasad North occupied a 20000-square-foot (1800-square-metre) facility which offered 10-pin bowling (10 lanes) billiards and an arcade. Their long-standing liquor licence set them apart in the industry and their policy of no minors after 9 p.m. was attractive for millennials. The south location was a beautiful 40000-square-foot (3700-square-metre) facility that saw recent renovations worth over $1 million. In addition to the premier dining experience the location offered 10-pin bowling (20 lanes) billiards arcade games laser tag karaoke and ping pong. Palasad had maintained a high customer service standard over the years. However questions arose on how this standard would be maintained in the face of rising wages. Palasad’s emphasis on food and beverages meant it employed more workers than the industry average. The Rec Room: Canada’s Premier Eats and EntertainmentThe Rec Room (RR) would be the newest entrant in London’s family entertainment scene opening its north London location in April 30 2018. In 2016 Cineplex Entertainment Company (Cineplex) known for its movie theatres opened the first RR location in Edmonton followed by a second location in Toronto in 2017. Developing and scaling gaming-related amusement and leisure concepts including RR was one of Cineplex’s key strategic points of focus for future growth. Cineplex welcomed 75 million guests annually through its network of 164 theatres across Canada. Additionally Cineplex was a joint venture partner in SCENE which was Canada’s largest entertainment loyalty program. Membership in the program had surpassed eight million Canadians in 2017.RR was a premium FEC offering a wide range of entertainment options including simulation arcade recreational gaming and an auditorium-style live entertainment venue for watching a wide range of entertainment programming. The typical FEC activities such as bowling and billiards were complemented by exclusive experiences like virtual reality gaming axe throwing and next-generation racing simulators.The entertainment options were paired with an upscale casual dining environment featuring one of the largest wood-fired grills in Canada. The open kitchen design centre bar with a wide range of digital monitors and a large screen above the bar allowed customers to watch sporting and other major events. RR also offered exclusive use of the building and designated space for private meetings large groups luncheons team building and seminars. The premium products and services targeted families high- income earning adults or anyone looking for an alternative entertainment experience. The effect of RR’s opening on the industry and the other players in London has yet to be seen.East Park: London’s Place to PlayEstablished in 1963 East Park (EP) had grown to be one of the most popular summer destinations in London. EP was an entrenched institution and facility in the city. It was founded by a group of 10 prominent London families who had given much to the community providing jobs and contributing millions to various local not-for-profit initiatives. It was rare to have grown up in London and not to have had memories of going to EP as a child. EP’s general manager was well known within London. He was passionate about people and about his job. He received an honours bachelor degree in urban development from Western.EP was located on over 100 acres of parkland near the eastern boundaries of the city. Its combination of indoor and outdoor activities served all ages and attracted over 75000 annual visitors (in summers only). At its inception the park employed 20 people and offered just a few golfing related activities. It had since grown to employ 250 people and offered an 18-hole golf course driving range two miniature golf courses batting cages a go-kart track seven water slides a splash pad with a waterclimber a rock climbing wall bumper cars jungle gym a video arcade and two on-site indoor café and bar areas. Many recreational programs were offered over the years including Summer Junior Day Camp which ranged from golf and rock climbing to fun camps with over 700 campers each season. Other innovative programs included the East Park Corporate Challenge various team building events and most recently the East Park Amazing Race. The FactoryThe Factory was set to open its doors in London’s old east core in spring 2018. Located in the old Kellogg cereal plant that opened in 1913 the future FEC was projected to be the largest in London at 160000 square feet (15000 square metres). Dan Cassidy part-owner and prospective general manager had no previous experience in the FEC industry. He graduated from Mohawk College and had experience in supply chain management in the home improvement industry. The Factory had been under development since January 2017. Cassidy’s vision was to fill every last inch of space with endless fun catered to all ages. The FEC was expected to offer high ropes zip-lines a trampoline park an ultimate warrior course an arcade a kid’s jungle gym laser tag virtual reality escape rooms and a restaurant and lounge area with Wi-Fi. Cassidy and his financial partners believed that the London market was ready for a big recreational attraction.FLEETWAYFleetway was owned and managed by its parent company Esam Group which had its head office at the back of Fleetway’s facility. Sam Katz the co-founder was known as “the mayor of Cherryhill” having built what is known as the Cherryhill region of London on Oxford Street West (see Exhibit 2). After surviving six years in a Nazi concentration camp Katz came to Canada in 1949 and met German immigrant Ewald Bierbaum while standing in an unemployment line. In 1955 the new business partners combined their first names to form Esam Construction Ltd. Katz would eventually buy out his partner and take full control of the company. Katz was prominent and beloved among Londoners; he was named to the mayor’s first seniors’ honour list. Katz died in 2001—the father of high-rise living in London. The business had since been passed on to his two sons Howard and Harvey who earned degrees at Western in engineering and commerce respectively. Perhaps out of necessity running Fleetway had become a team effort where extended family filled up Esam’s offices to support the Katz sons who were also pastors at a local congregation of around 500 people. Esam had recently completed one of the biggest real estate deals in Canada selling off a portion of its apartment assets for over $200 million.Fleetway began in the 1960s as a bowling centre called Fleetway 40 (having 40 lanes) and since its inception had gone through many changes offering everything from rock climbing to a high ropes course. However Fleetway’s current operations included six business segments: 10-pin bowling (24 lanes) and five-pin bowling (20 lanes) billiards (14 tables) glow miniature-golf (18 holes) Fleetplay (a children’s jungle gym) arcade games and revenues from leased space to Dairy Queen and Pizza Projekt (see Exhibit 3). Fleetway also offered event rooms primarily used for children’s birthday parties (revenues from this segment were negligible). Dairy Queen had been in a lease agreement with Fleetway for 20 years and just recently teamed up with a local restaurant owner to open a new restaurant in the complex. This was Fleetway’s first venture into offering food beyond what was served at Dairy Queen. Pizza Projekt was a full-service restaurant that offered gourmet pizza using high quality ingredients. Additionally Pizza Projekt offered alcoholic beverages appetizers and fresh salads. Because of Pizza Projekt’s alcoholic beverage offerings Fleetway had licensed the whole complex for alcohol to be served at the bowling lanes and the pool tables. “Food on the floor” was a new service of which customers had yet to take full advantage. Fleetway appealed mostly to the family market (parents with children) because it was a clean safe and spacious entertainment facility. Its secondary market was students from Western and Fanshawe College and seniors who resided in the nearby apartment buildings. League bowling was popular among seniors which accounted for approximately 35 per cent of bowling revenues. The bowling industry had experienced negative growth forcing many bowling centres out of business. Fleetway had become the only bowling alley in London that offered five-pin league bowling and standard lane sizes. FLEETWAY FINANCIALSKatz wanted to make sure he had a strong understanding of Fleetway’s financial position before preparing his proposal for the board of directors (see Exhibits 4 and 5). He considered investigating the company's cash position as well as reviewing some relevant financial ratios (see Exhibit 6). Katz also wanted to evaluate the performance of Fleetway’s individual business segments (see Exhibit 7). The total revenue for all six segments was $2833274 in fiscal year (FY) 2018 (see Exhibit 8). To allocate FY 2018 expenses across the individual segments Katz needed to make a few assumptions. He thought expenses that were not easily traceable to individual business streams should be divided evenly between segments. He determined that staff wages should be allocated based on the percentage of sales each segment earned excluding the leased space. Moreover Katz thought it would be best to divide utilities and property taxes based on the measured area of each segment (see Exhibit 9). The depreciation for building computer and furnishings could also be allocated using measured area; however the remaining depreciation was attributable to each segment based on its respective assets. Finally 70 per cent of the advertising and promotion expenses would be split evenly between Fleetplay and bowling where the remaining 30 per cent was divided evenly between the arcade billiards and miniature golf.FLEETWAY’S FUTURE FOCUSAs London’s FEC industry grew crowded Fleetway’s management wanted to re-establish its identity in the market. Fleetway had three strategic options: position itself as a premium experience focus on providing the best experience for families or become all things to all people. As Katz weighed the long-term implications of such a positioning decision he wanted to evaluate the feasibility of a few different expansion options. Fleetway’s management agreed to consider the possibility of expanding the company’s service mix to offer an adventurous go-kart track state-of-the-art escape rooms or both.Go-Kart: Driving the Fun ForwardBehind Fleetway’s facility was an empty 13000-square-foot (1200 square-metre) warehouse that belonged to Esam and was available to Fleetway if Katz could convince Esam’s management that an expansion would be profitable. The closure of a few go-karting tracks left a single competitor in the market EP who was open for only half the year. Fleetway considered filling a need in the market by offering go-karting year-round rain or shine by building a go-karting arena in the warehouse. Such a transformation would require a significant investment. Katz wondered if this decision was worth all the effort and if there was room for another go-karting business in London. Fleetway considered choosing electric go-karts over gas-powered models to set itself apart. Electric go-karts were faster cleaner safer and easier to maintain.Fleetway would save $100000 by not having to build a structure for go-karting; however other significant investments were needed before business could begin. The major start-up costs included all new go-karting equipment the cost to build a track getting the warehouse up to code and building a corridor that connected the warehouse to Fleetway’s existing facility (see Exhibit 10). Furthermore $10000 was needed to cover an initial grand opening event; the cost was expected to be covered by re-allocating Fleetway’s existing advertising and promotion budget. Katz expected operating costs to include utilities insurance maintenance on the go-karts and supplies. Utilities would be a minimum of $4000 per month plus 1 per cent of the overall sales taking into account the electrical charging of the go-karts. Insurance and maintenance costs would be $2000 per month and 5 per cent of sales respectively. Supplies related to go-karting were projected to be 3 per cent of sales. Fleetway would hire a track manager at $17 per hour and a technician at $15 per hour; both would work 40 hours per week for 50 weeks per year. Three additional part-time employees would also be required and would work 20 hours per week. Part-time employees would be paid minimum wage and would require five hours of paid training before they began their job.The indoor facility would allow Fleetway to operate go-karting year-round. Daily hours of operation for go-karting would be between 12 p.m. and 10 p.m. daily. Fleetway’s pricing strategy was to charge the same amount as East Park—$8 per ride. At full capacity Fleetway expected to utilize all go-karts for each cycle. Interest in go-karting in London was relatively small and appealed mainly to thrill seekers. On average Fleetway expected to run at 13 per cent capacity for half the year and at 10 per cent capacity the other half of the year when EP was open.Katz expected the construction of the facility to be completed after two months with the licensing and government approval taking an additional one to three months. Because go-karting was different from the rest of Fleetway’s offerings Katz did not expect any cannibalization. However he wanted to be conservative in his estimates and analyze the feasibility of the venture with only half of the projected revenues being earned.Escape Rooms: A Suspenseful OpportunityAn escape room was a challenging group activity that took place inside a themed game-room. The objective was to discover clues solve puzzles and open locks that eventually led to escaping the room. Escape rooms were considered a premium form of entertainment due to their significantly higher price point which was between $25 and $30 on average. Escape rooms attracted an older and wealthier demographic while family groups accounted for just 14 per cent of total client groups (see Exhibit 11). The North American escape room industry had grown 300 per cent annually since its inception. However Katz wondered if the London market had reached saturation. The city already had five escape rooms—the majority concentrated in London’s downtown core. Still Fleetway’s management was intrigued by the idea of opening its own escape room to capitalize on a growing industry while diversifying its consumer base. Furthermore the decision would be independent from the go-karting opportunity. If Fleetway went forward with an escape room it would have to build a 7000-square-foot (650-square-metre) extension to the facility. The construction costs would average $125 per square foot ($1300 per square metre) and an additional $20000 would be needed to finish and furnish the welcome desk and lobby area. A brand new state-of-the-art facility was thought to be a potential competitive advantage; most escape rooms were not aesthetically welcoming. The design and layout of the rooms would be decided one of two ways: Fleetway would outsource it to an escape room in Toronto or they would hire a “puzzle master” to work in-house. Either option would cost about $70000 per year which covered the cost of the props and either the licensing fees or the manager’s salary. Both scenarios had their merits. Outsourcing would bring an instantaneous reputation for premium puzzles and would allow operations to commence almost immediately. The in-house option allowed for more control and the opportunity to earn money in the future from outsourcing the puzzle designs created by the puzzle master.Fleetway would need to hire a manager and four part-time employees to run the escape rooms. They would be paid the same rates as those listed in the go-karting opportunity. Annual maintenance utilities and insurance would cost $15000 $14000 and $12000 respectively. The escape rooms would be open between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays and between 12 p.m. and 11 p.m. on weekends. The weekend rate would be $28 per person up from the $25 weekday price. Like any other Fleetway activity customers would pay with cash or credit except for corporate clients who were all expected to exercise extended credit terms of net 30 days. Katz predicted that the escape rooms would operate at a capacity of between 5 and 10 per cent during the week and between 20 and 30 per cent on the weekend. Lastly 20 per cent of Fleetway’s existing advertising and promotional budget would be re-allocated to promote the escape rooms.CONCLUSIONAs Katz watched his grandson climb to the top of Fleetplay’s jungle gym he wondered what it would take to become the leading FEC in the city. Which option would help Fleetway better establish itself: offering escape rooms creating a go-kart complex or both? Fleetway had an internal target of between 20 and 25 per cent return on investment or an approximate five-year payback period. Katz did not believe it was necessary to project financial statements because Fleetway’s financials were seldom analyzed apart from the financials of the parent company Esam Group. The upcoming opening of RR and the future opening of The Factory had forced many industry incumbents to re-consider their strategy; Fleetway was no different. Katz wondered which would be better—continuing to position Fleetway as a fun-first location or operating more as a premium FEC? While Katz had a lot to consider he also wanted to maintain a faithful commitment to his congregation and grow the family legacy that his father had passed on to the next generation. He waved to his grandson as he pondered the company’s future strategy.EXHIBIT 1: INDUSTRY REVENUE GROWTHSource: “Solutions: Industry Research Reports” IBIS World: Where Knowledge Is Power accessed February 18 2018 https://www.ibisworld.ca/.EXHIBIT 2: MAP OF LONDON AND FEC LOCATIONSSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: SERVICES OFFERED BY FLEETWAYSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: STATEMENT OF EARNINGS For the Years Ending February 28 (in CA$)Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF FEBRUARY 28 (in CA$)Note: A/D = accumulated depreciation; *Accounts receivable are from bowling leagues; **Fleetplay was purchased March 1 2017 to replace the rock climbing wall; †Fleetway used accounts payable to make all purchases of supplies inventory Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 6: SELECTed Family Entertainment Centre RATIOS FOR 2018 Note: A/R = accounts receivable; A/P = accounts payable; ROA = return on assets; ROE = return on equitySource: Company files.

It supplied hydraulic manifolds—pipe fittings with several lateral outlets to connect to other pipes—for the steel plastics and valve industry. Manifolds simplified the numerous connections formerly provided by a series of hoses and tubes resulting in an accurate and simple design.Demag Plastic Group (DPG) a large firm with global operations had one facility near Terrell. DPG produced manifolds for its own use and also purchased manifolds from Terrell for additional requirements. DPG was Terrell’s most important customer providing more than 30 per cent of Terrell’s revenue. Toward the end of 2015 DPG decided to stop producing manifolds and approached Terrell with a proposal: Terrell could buy DPG’s Giddings & Lewis (G&L) Orion Machining Center (the Orion machine) and use it to process what would be additional orders from DPG. DPG would pay a 10 per cent markup on Terrell’s approved cost to process DPG’s orders.Terrell ManufacturingTerrell Manufacturing was established by George Terrell in 1954. In its early years the company provided manifolds primarily for the steel industry. The steel industry was growing at that time resulting in strong growth for Terrell.Terrell added the plastics industry to its portfolio in the early 1960s when Van Dorn Corporation (Van Dorn) a Cleveland-based producer of plastic moulding machines began to use hydraulic manifolds as a replacement for its current system of hoses and tubes. Van Dorn gave the order for its manifold requirements to Terrell creating Terrell’s first market diversification. As a result of its efficient work Terrell soon became well-known in the plastics industry for its ability to produce complex high-quality manifolds. As the plastics industry flourished in the 1970s Terrell grew again. By then Terrell had large machines capable of machining manifolds of up to 10000 pounds (4.5 metric tons).In early 1994 Van Dorn purchased an Orion machine and began producing manifolds in its own facility. The Orion machine was a technological feat in its ability to produce manifolds at speeds three to four times faster than conventional equipment. As a result Terrell lost more than a quarter of its business.When George Terrell died in 1996 he left his business to his three daughters none of whom was active in the company. Louis Palombo was acting as president of Terrell at that time. For nearly a decade Terrell remained stagnant without any major decision or initiative—no new investment no marketing and no strategic plan. Key personnel began to leave and overall sales declined from a high of US$3.5 million in 1994 to $2.1 million in 2004.In December 2004 Palombo bought Terrell. By then Vincent Palombo’s son was also working for Terrell. For the year ending December 2004 Terrell achieved profits of $44000 based on sales of $2.1 million. The company had 17 employees—three in management positions and 14 in production activity. As the new owner Palombo purchased a DeVlieg boring mill fully retrofitted it at some cost and placed it into production in March 2005. The DeVlieg boring mill became the most accurate and modern machining equipment in Terrell’s facility (see Exhibits 1 and 2).The OpportunityVan Dorn became Demag Plastic Group (DPG) after it was bought by a German firm in 2002. The new management continuously reviewed the company’s operations and strategies to improve profitability and focus on the main business. At one stage management decided to shut down the company’s manifold operation and outsource the manifolds from a reliable supplier. They naturally thought of Terrell which was already supplying DPG and was nearby. DPG approached Palombo and Vincent in December 2015 inviting them to bid on DPG’s line of hydraulic manifolds with an annual use that translated to sales of approximately $500000.Terrell did not have enough capacity to meet DPG’s total requirements without reducing Terrell’s other customer base. When this limitation was expressed DPG made an additional offer: DPG would sell its 20-year-old Orion machine to Terrell at an upfront cost of $200000. DPG was open to negotiating the terms of payment if doing so would help Terrell.The Orion machine would replace Terrell’s initial two processes (see Exhibits 1 and 2) and Terrell would use its existing machines for the remaining processes needed to complete the manifolds made on the Orion machine for DPG. DPG asked Terrell to establish the base hourly rate for processing DPG’s orders on the Orion machine and on Terrell’s existing equipment. DPG would then discuss and negotiate the markup to determine the hourly rate that it would pay to Terrell. The offer came with one condition: Terrell could not use the spare capacity of the Orion machine to process orders for DPG’s competitors.DPG was also concerned about Terrell’s capabilities because of the significant technological skills required to operate the Orion machine. DPG therefore offered to train Terrell’s selected operators and help with troubleshooting should the need arise all free of cost. If everything went well for both companies DPG would be willing to offer its second Orion machine to Terrell at some later date. Vincent thought this offer represented a great opportunity. The technological advancement backed by an experienced multinational customer such as DPG could give Terrell an additional advantage over its competitors. Vincent began calculating the hourly cost of processing on the Orion machine so he would have a base for negotiating the rate.Vincent’s AssumptionsAfter investigating the costs and issues and discussing them with his father Vincent concluded that the Orion machine could be used for 100 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This usage implied two shifts of operations every day for five days a week and 50 weeks a year. One skilled worker and one semi-skilled worker would be required on each shift to operate the machine. A skilled worker would be paid $20 per hour and an semi-skilled worker $15 per hour. Employee benefits could be calculated as an additional 30 per cent on employees’ hourly wages.Vincent’s accountant told him that the depreciable value of Terrell’s building was $500000. The Orion machine had a remaining life of 10 years. These assets could be depreciated on a straight-line basis at a rate of 10 per cent.Additional tooling expenses were expected to be $10000 per year and maintenance expenses for the Orion machine $10000 per year. Annual property tax of $10000 and real estate tax of $14000 would not change but the workers’ compensation tax would increase from $8000 to $10000 yearly. Insurance for the building was $12000 per year and unlikely to change. Utilities (water gas electricity and telephone) were $71400 annually but the Orion machine would add $15000 to those costs.The accountant also told Vincent that it would be appropriate to charge to the Orion machine 15 per cent of common expenses (such as depreciation on the building taxes insurance for the current building and utilities). General administrative expenses were unlikely to change due to the purchase of the Orion machine but Terrell could still charge 10 per cent of those expenses to the Orion machine.Jobs completed on the Orion machine would be further processed in four subsequent processes: deburr; grind; inspect; and stamp wash wrap and ship. The hourly cost for these processes for a job produced on the Orion machine would be as follows: deburr $6.50; grind $6.50; inspect $2.25; and stamp wash wrap and ship $1.20.Vincent decided to run his calculations by a consultant. The consultant visited Terrell; understood the industry and Terrell’s operations; talked to Vincent his father supervisors and some workers; and studied the complete facility. He then asked Vincent and his father a series of questions (see Exhibit 3).Consultant’s AssumptionsBased on the consultant’s inquiry the consultant changed some of Vincent’s assumptions and added others.The consultant fairly assumed that the productive use of the Orion machine would be 90 per cent of the gross availability estimated by Vincent. The consultant also learned that the Orion machine could be operated by a skilled worker in each shift without any help from a semi-skilled worker. This arrangement implied that each skilled worker would work a 10-hour shift including two hours of overtime every shift. The overtime hours would be paid a premium of 50 per cent of the base wage rate. The benefit rate would be applied to the regular wages and not to the wages paid for the overtime. Transportation of the Orion machine and its installation on Terrell’s premises would cost $10000. The new washing capacity and higher-capacity transformer would require an additional investment of $100000. Terrell would also require additional working capital of $25000 to support the additional sales coming from DPG’s order. After the fifth year the Orion machine would require an overhauling which could cost as much as $50000. The machine would likely then maintain its productivity for an additional five years after which it would be scrapped at no net gain or loss.The insurance for the building and existing equipment was $12000 per annum. The general insurance premium for the Orion machine washing capacity and transformer would be 2 per cent of the purchase price.The consultant estimated that the breakage and scrap of jobs would cost $1.20 per hour of work on the Orion machine. The consultant also proposed charging 20 per cent of the common expenses (including general administrative expenses) to the Orion machine rather than the 15 per cent estimated by Vincent.Terrell had obtained a current loan at 6 per cent interest but the new investments increased the perceived risk so they would need to be financed through the bank at an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. The consultant also advised Vincent that he and his father could attribute 12 per cent as a cost of owners’ capital to the Orion machine which had been set at 10 per cent. The consultant studied the owners’ tax bracket and suggested that their marginal tax rate would be 35 per cent.The consultant was confident that DPG would agree to a proposal of being paid for the machine in equal monthly instalments over 48 months and that DPG would not charge interest on the outstanding amount. The consultant found Vincent’s other assumptions to be in order.The consultant obtained the latest balance sheet of Terrell Manufacturing and prepared a projected balance sheet after factoring the proposal of purchasing the Orion machine and factoring all other assumptions. These balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 4. The consultant also prepared an Excel spreadsheet with the initial data and assumptions on one worksheet and calculated the full cost for pricing on another. The consultant then gave Vincent the detailed calculation of the hourly cost for processing the job order on the Orion machine and asked Vincent to submit that cost as the commercial bid for the Orion machine along with the suggested lower limit for the hourly rate. The consultant also discussed the negotiation strategy with Vincent. Exhibit 1: Manufacturing Processes at Terrell Manufacturing—the Manual process and the Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) processManufacturing Process (without a CNC machine)The traditional machined product ordinarily required nine sequences in an assembly line:Blanchard Grind: The Blanchard grinder used rotating stones to create a smooth finish on the top and bottom of the rectangular block of raw material.Mill: The remaining four sides were milled using carbide inserts to achieve a smooth surface.Program/Spot: This machinist created the blueprint and marked the block with small “dimples” to indicate the proper locations of the bored holes.Drill: The drill press operator compared the blueprint with the dimples and machine-drilled all the holes according to the blueprint.Finish Machine: The finish machine performed critical machining operations that included machining O-rings and diameters that required a tolerance range of 0.001 to 0.015 inches (0.025 to 0.381 millimetres). (A single thread of hair measured 0.001 inches or 0.025 millimetres.)De-Burr: The de-burring phase required employees to use a handheld device that rotated rolled sandpaper into every machined hole. This function cleaned out the internal block removing metal chips and other debris that contaminated the block during machining.Finish Grind: Finish grinding provided a smooth finish to the blocks. This process improved the cosmetics of the block and created a smoother surface on which to assemble valves and O-rings.Inspection: A full inspection was required for each machined block.Stamp/Wash/Wrap/Ship: Parts were then manually stamped washed wrapped and shipped.Manufacturing Process (with a CNC machine)Program/Spot: This machinist would create a CNC program using the coordinates on the blueprint to completely machine the block. This function included the use of milling cutters to mill and finish-grind and the use of engraving to eliminate the stamping procedure.CNC Machining (Milling Drilling and Finishing): The CNC machine completed these tasks at a high speed often 40 to 50 per cent faster than manual machines. De-Burr: The de-burring phase required employees to use a handheld device that rotated rolled sandpaper into every machined hole. This function cleaned out the internal block removing metal chips and other debris that contaminated the block during machining.Inspection: A full inspection was required for the first block produced on the CNC machine. Once the program was approved the subsequent blocks in the batch would not require inspection.Stamp/Wash/Wrap/Ship: Parts were then manually stamped washed wrapped and shipped.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 2: Terrell manufacturing’s Process DiagramNote: G&L = Giddings & Lewis; CNC = computerized numerical controlSource: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 3: Consultant’s Inquiry and Vincent Palombo’s responsesNote: DPG = Demag Plastic GroupSource: Victor Palombo (Partner Terrell Manufacturing) in discussion with the consultant Date: June 25 2016.EXHIBIT 4: Terrell manufacturing’s BALANCE SHEET at the End of 2015Notes: *Amount equal to additional working capital loan is added in the current assets; **Costs of Orion machine and washing facility of $300000 added here; ***Installation cost of $10000 added to other assets as a miscellaneous asset; **** Includes bank loans of $310000 ($10000 for installation $100000 for washing facility and $200000 payable to DPG for Orion machine).

This new form of commerce had been called the sharing economy the gig economy the platform peer sharing and even the on-demand economy. Within this context Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber) transformed itself into an international transportation powerhouse that dominated its sector of the sharing economy in just seven years. Uber had gross booking revenues of US$5.4 billion in 2016 and net revenue in the fourth quarter of that year of $1.7 billion. It operated in 70 countries had an approximate valuation of $70 billion in 2017 and maintained a polished web presence that was designed to reflect regional cultural norms. However Uber’s rise to prominence was controversial almost from the company’s inception. The corporation had an increasingly contentious relationship with its drivers and was the subject of numerous lawsuits which included a much-publicized sexual harassment lawsuit that eventually contributed to the departure of co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Travis Kalanick. What had been the substance of Kalanick’s tumultuous era and how had his leadership as CEO affected Uber’s organizational culture? How did Uber’s manipulation of its drivers through the use of knowledge derived from behavioural science affect the company’s operations? And finally after Kalanick had been fired what were the options for Uber’s next plan of action? KALANICK: The perennial entrepreneurKalanick was a product of the southern California suburbs. He attended high school in Northridge just outside of Los Angeles. Kalanick’s father was an engineer and his mother pursued a career as a retail advertiser with the Los Angeles Daily News. When he was young Kalanick was known for being confident persuasive and a particularly good salesman—a quality he demonstrated as he sold knives door to door for Cutco. Some described the young Kalanick as a perpetual hustler who always had his game face on. Those who had known Kalanick when he was young agreed in interviews and other commentary that he was a smart intense hyper-rational and driven entrepreneur. At the same time many viewed him as both an egotist and an opportunist who had no compunctions about stepping on people’s toes in order to succeed. Kalanick started his first business an SAT-preparatory service called New Way Academy when he was 18. His own impressive SAT scores helped him get accepted at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where he majored in computer engineering. This was where he met Michael Todd Vince Busam and Dan Rodrigues who were working on a peer-to-peer search engine enterprise called Scour which was supported by angel funding from their friends and relatives. Kalanick was hired at Scour in 1998 and he dropped out of college to work for the start-up. Although Kalanick was actually Scour’s second employee he often later described himself as one of the company’s founders sometimes to the dismay of the actual founders. Kalanick took no salary for a year but instead lived on unemployment insurance while he devoted considerable energy and talent to the file-sharing enterprise. Working out of Rodrigues’s apartment bedroom Kalanick handled business development and marketing for Scour and became known for the guerrilla marketing campaigns he undertook to push the product name. Scour was ultimately sued for $250 billion by a group of entertainment companies that claimed Scour had allowed consumers to obtain copyrighted content without paying for it. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000.After the demise of Scour Kalanick had a new venture underway almost immediately. He and Todd launched Red Swoosh a technology company that focused on delivering web content and worked by having users share bandwidth. In effect Red Swoosh was a networking software company. Kalanick called it his revenge company; he intended to make the customers of the companies that had sued Scour his customers. By mid-2001 the company had seven employees but was completely out of cash and struggled to meet its payroll obligations. Even worse the financial effects of the attacks of September 11 2001 meant that start-up funding—especially for companies in the software industry—was disappearing. As Red Swoosh struggled the company cut corners and neglected its financial responsibilities including the responsibility to withhold income taxes from employees’ paycheques. The company soon owed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $110000 for unpaid income tax—a criminal offence. The founders were able to pay the debt before the end of 2001. They avoided prosecution but the company was almost finished financially. Employees had gone through long periods without any pay at all and disputes arose over stock options that were promised but not realized. According to insiders both Kalanick and Todd had hidden business decisions from each other and each had accused the other in the IRS debacle. Their amicable business relationship was permanently destroyed and Todd left Red Swoosh. After Todd’s departure Kalanick managed Red Swoosh through a series of ups and downs until 2007 when he sold the company to Akamai for $23 million. Many former employees of Red Swoosh later made negative comments about their impressions of Kalanick noting his constant reinterpretation of events his pomposity and his winner-take-all attitude. Meanwhile Kalanick had been working for three years without a salary and had lived in his parents’ basement for a time after Todd’s departure from Red Swoosh. He had relocated the company headquarters to Thailand as a cost-saving measure and had made numerous changes to the team in order to make Red Swoosh a success.The sale of Red Swoosh made Kalanick a millionaire. He spent the first year after the sale travelling the world and investing in various projects. During his travels he met Garrett Camp from whom he first heard the idea for Uber. The company began as UberCab under Camp and co-founders Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan. Kalanick was brought on board in 2008 as an advisor and he quickly gave himself the title of chief incubator. UberCab was officially launched in 2010 with Camp as CEO but Camp in an amicable arrangement deferred to Kalanick at the end of the year. Kalanick became CEO while Camp assumed the role of general manager. Kalanick had earned a reputation for being a hard worker but he also spent much of his time embroiled in various controversies of his own creation. Kalanick made enemies quickly. His foes included regulators in jurisdictions where the company was located business and personal rivals the taxi industry and even customers who criticized the company. Kalanick expressed himself vigorously in speeches e-mails company blogs and videos. In early 2017 a video distributed by Bloomberg showed Kalanick losing his temper in an argument with one of his drivers about falling pay rates. Kalanick was verbally combative with the driver and used profanity—and was forced to quickly offer a public apology only hours after the video began airing. Kalanick did not deliver his apology to the driver in person but instead delivered an e-mail apology to all employees and referred to a different conversation with the driver. The apology was subsequently posted to the company’s public blog. At least one contemporary analyst noted that Kalanick’s approach was to win at all costs. This was a source of strength but was also the executive’s biggest weakness. Certainly Kalanick embodied the stereotype of a technology industry mover and shaker: he was young brash energetic known for his intensity and pompous style and was credited with being reckless although effective by many who had known him over the years. However the video of Kalanick’s argument with the Uber driver publicized the dark side of Uber’s top manager and shed light on another undesirable personality trait: immaturity. Employees who mimicked Kalanick’s full-tilt work- and lifestyle were known within the company as “Uberettos”—a comparison that was not meant to be flattering.Uber’s CultureLike that of all founders or early leaders of organizations Kalanick’s personality and style made a lasting imprint on Uber. The company’s organizational culture was influenced significantly by Kalanick’s demonstrated values and ethics. Some of these values and ethics were illustrated in a list of 14 core values Kalanick presented to employees before a company retreat in Las Vegas in 2014. Among the phrases in the list were “toe-stepping” “always be hustlin’” “super pumped” and “principled confrontation.” Kalanick demonstrated similar thinking early in the company’s history: a profanity-filled 2013 letter he sent to employees was found during an investigation into sexual harassment at the company just before his departure in June 2017. The document set “rules” for an upcoming company party in Miami; these included a monetary penalty for vomiting and a prohibition against throwing kegs from the tops of buildings and the document outlined explicit rules for sex between co-workers.Unethical behaviour was often the rule at Uber and the corporation’s highly publicized activities certainly influenced public perception of the company. Uber’s dispute with its drivers for instance was the source of numerous articles in the public press as well as the subject of blog posts from Uber itself and the topic of social media postings from current and former drivers. Uber’s internal measurement of driver satisfaction showed driver turnover averaged approximately 25 per cent every three months. The sexual harassment allegations levelled in 2017 by former employee Susan Fowler were certainly well-publicized. Uber used questionable tactics against rival ride-sharing company Lyft in San Francisco. Uber employees booked rides with Lyft drivers and then cancelled and Uber used “brand ambassadors” who booked rides with Lyft and then tried to persuade the Lyft drivers to work for Uber. Uber also purchased analytical data about Lyft’s customers and used the information to evaluate Lyft’s financial health. Additionally Uber gathered an intimidating legal team and hired a private investigator to interview friends and colleagues of its legal adversaries. It made extensive use of political operatives who argued the company’s merits with officials at all levels of government including the federal administration under President Obama. The corporation’s well-known aggressive philosophy and disregard for regulations was reflected in the observable artifact that hung proudly on a wall at Uber’s headquarters: the first cease-and-desist order issued to the company. The company’s reputation epitomized that of the Silicon Valley tech industry in general. For example executives had an overall disdain for regulation a penchant for flouting laws an active anti-union stance and a boy’s-club atmosphere that devalued female employees and was often rampant with sexual harassment. Uber also used technology such as Greyball and other cyber products that helped it evade government officials who were investigating Uber’s operations. Uber used surge pricing—that is raising rates at various times and locations when the corporation felt it could dominate the marketplace—to increase profits. Uber even instituted surge pricing during hurricanes and blizzards. Surge pricing infuriated users who perceived it as price gouging. controversial practicesIn early 2015 Kalanick had a meeting with Tim Cook the CEO of Apple Inc. (Apple). Although Kalanick showed up wearing his trademark hot pink socks and red tennis shoes his bravado was short lived. Cook had summoned Kalanick because Uber technicians had unsuccessfully tried to alter the company’s ride-sharing app so that its activities would be hidden from Apple’s technicians. Kalanick had used the app to identify and tag iPhone users—even those who had deleted the Uber app from their iPhones. Kalanick agreed to desist after Cook threatened to remove Uber’s app from Apple’s app store which would likely have decimated Uber’s customer base.In mid-2015 a privacy rights group the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a lengthy complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Uber. The complaint alleged that Uber’s information gathering practices were dangerous to consumers. EPIC claimed that Uber collected data about passengers after their rides were concluded by monitoring GPS data even after users had turned off their GPS location finders. This allowed Uber to access users’ contact lists for marketing purposes. This ability to track locations and identify and collect data about users was an internal program at Uber known as “God View” and the program worked without the users’ knowledge. EPIC further claimed that Uber had already abused users’ trust when it tracked the location of journalists who had reported on the app and then shared personal information about the journalists within the workplace.Uber similarly used a secret program called VTOS an acronym for “violation of terms of service” which identified potential abusers of the service as well as law enforcement officials who sought to ticket or otherwise compromise Uber’s drivers. VTOS included a tool called Greyball which was first noticed in operation in Portland Oregon in 2014 when the company used it to evade local officials who were trying to catch Uber drivers who operated illegally in the city. Greyball used an algorithm to identify where and when customers opened the Uber app; for example it identified those who opened the app in proximity to a government agency or building. After Greyball identified potential law enforcement agents the app tagged the users denied them rides or cancelled rides already accepted. It then sent them a fake app populated with ghost drivers to protect the actual locations of real Uber drivers. In May 2017 the U.S. Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation into Uber’s use of Greyball but neither the Justice Department nor Uber released any public comment about the situation. Uber had publicly announced in early 2017 that it would no longer use the Greyball tool.Economic Advisory CouncilThe year 2017 began poorly for Kalanick and continued that way until his eventual departure from the company in June. Kalanick joined President Trump’s economic advisory council in December 2016 and encountered a strong backlash from employees during the year’s first all-hands meeting in January 2017. Employees were primarily critical of the president’s immigration policies. In fact President Trump’s immigration stance was almost universally unpopular with workers and executives in the tech industry many of whom were immigrants themselves or believed strongly in globalization.When New York City taxi drivers supported protests against President Trump’s selective immigration ban by striking at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January 2017 Uber responded by saying that it was not going to institute surge pricing. This was perceived by the New York City taxi drivers as intimidation meant to break their strike although it was unclear if that was actually the intent of Uber’s press release.Kalanick announced his departure from the council after only a week but Uber employees had to convince him that he needed to distance himself from President Trump’s policies. Employees circulated a 25-page letter in the workplace that listed the reasons employees wanted Kalanick to resign from the council. Meanwhile more than 200000 customers had deleted their Uber apps and accounts since Kalanick had announced he would join the president’s council. There was considerable concern about how easy it was for them to delete the Uber app and replace it with Lyft’s. Uber’s Use of Behavioural ScienceUber used a variety of psychological techniques to influence where when and how long its drivers worked. These approaches used graphics and video game techniques and included noncash rewards that enticed drivers into working longer hours. The company intended to minimize its labour costs as much as possible and it often needed drivers to work in areas and at hours that were not as profitable for them as other times and places. At times the company’s own efficiency worked against it because faster pickup times overall meant more idle time for individual drivers and this led drivers to log off from service. To prevent this and because many individuals felt comfortable with earnings goals Uber alerted drivers to how close they were to achieving earnings targets which prompted some drivers to remain available. While Uber was concerned with shortages of drivers in areas where demand existed or was forecasted drivers were concerned with earning a sufficient wage. Uber tried to influence drivers to achieve dollar targets rather than working mainly when times were busy. One method Uber used to get drivers where it wanted them to be was by sending a continuous barrage of e-mails texts and pop-up boxes through the app to get the drivers’ attention. Sometimes these messages were accompanied by small maps with icons that indicated where they should go. Some local managers also realized that in areas with a high percentage of male drivers a female persona on the app produced better results in keeping drivers logged on for service. Uber also imitated an algorithm used by Netflix to keep its viewers watching. Uber automatically provided drivers with information on the next available fare opportunity in effect imitating Netflix’s technique that created binge-watching and was aimed at keeping viewers logged on. Uber’s version used a technique called forward dispatch which was an algorithm that sent drivers new fares before they had delivered their current customers to their destinations. This made Uber very efficient at choosing the closest driver but it also resulted in drivers working longer hours. Uber revealed that the number one complaint drivers had that led to them sign off was idle time. Unfortunately for the drivers Uber’s app did not allow them to see the next passenger’s destination before accepting the ride. Although drivers could pause the automatic forward dispatch feature it re-established itself as soon as the driver accepted another ride or logged on again.In addition to the persistence of forward dispatch drivers reported that Uber routinely resisted their efforts to log off. Uber usually responded with texts about earnings goals or encouraged the drivers to take another fare. Uber often showed drivers a graphic of a dollar sign with a needle that did not quite reach the goal. Uber was merely mimicking a technique that game developers had used for years: Uber had created a ludic loop—a psychological feeling of progress toward a goal that was always just out of grasp. Uber also used game-related metrics to influence drivers; these included graphics measuring passenger ratings and time logged on. Uber had recently developed a feature for its app that stored drivers’ preferences and gave them more control over their schedules by letting them set the times and places they needed to be. This would be good for the drivers and it also allowed Uber to forecast labour needs. However there was no evidence that this change was implemented or disseminated to the drivers. As a matter of practice Uber also gathered data on drivers’ driving habits such as braking and acceleration speeds and collected customer comments. Certainly Uber’s engineers could have discovered ways to use this data to improve driver and customer safety. It could be argued that Uber’s use of behavioural science was abusive to its drivers because the company maintained a low wage ceiling and influenced its drivers with gaming techniques that could be considered unethical. According to one perspective Uber manipulated its full-time drivers in ways that caused them to remain in a low-wage job and enticed others to continue to operate personal businesses that would not allow them to make ends meet. One commentator indicated that Uber’s drivers were paid with badges that did not cost Uber anything. By March 2017 the leadership at Uber knew they were in the midst of a serious cultural crisis and the realization was undoubtedly powerful. Top leaders called a press conference and announced they had been rethinking their relationship with their drivers who had complained about their indifferent treatment and shrinking pay for years. Self-Driving CarsUber’s attitude of principled confrontation was never more apparent than in the corporation’s quest to transition to self-driving cars. Uber had begun operations testing of self-driving cars in three states: California Arizona and Pennsylvania. In California 20 companies were certified to begin testing of self-driving cars on state roads. Uber was not on the list and the head of Uber’s autonomous vehicle program Anthony Levandowski publicly declared that the regulations limiting self-driving cars without state permits did not apply to Uber. Uber used self-driving cars beginning in California in August 2016 although the company neglected to inform the traffic division of the San Francisco Police Department. During the first day of the pilot run in San Francisco two of Uber’s self-driving cars were observed running red lights. Although Uber could have received permits for its self-driving cars if it had submitted to the regulatory process instead it had taken a defiant stance based on the form of technology it used. The corporation contended the technology made their cars different from other self-driving cars. Even after the mayor of San Francisco made a personal phone call to Uber to warn the company to stop using the self-driving cars Uber officials responded in blog posts that called the requirement for a permit debatable. The California Department of Motor Vehicles responded through the state’s attorney general with threats of immediate legal action. Uber’s woes were exacerbated even more in early 2017 when Alphabet Inc. the parent company of Waymo asked for an injunction against Uber’s use of self-driving cars and alleged that Levandowski had stolen the technology from Waymo when he was an employee there. Uber later suspended all operations with self-driving cars when one of its vehicles crashed in a highly publicized incident in Arizona although it appeared that the Uber car might not have been at fault. Despite setbacks Uber committed to a future business model that used self-driving cars. This was an example of automation at work: the replacement of the most expensive part of the business equation the human with a machine. One of Uber’s other strategic initiatives involved urban air transport using vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing—that is flying cars. Uber had already formed relationships with a variety of partners in the venture. Its primary goal was to transform urban transportation by creating an on-demand network of high-speed flight in cities facilitated by technology that was similar to the Uber driving app. The flying car initiative was announced in April 2017 and the notion immediately raised numerous questions. These related to issues such as noise problems in cities testing regulation implementation of the technology certification and control systems.Allegations of Sexual HarassmentIn February 2017 a blog post by a former Uber engineer who had left the company the previous December exposed the company’s entrenched atmosphere of sexism and sexual harassment. An investigation followed almost immediately 20 employees were fired and the executive group was restructured. The former employee Susan Fowler who said she had been ignored by Uber’s human resources department when she had tried to file a sexual harassment claim against her direct supervisor posted her lengthy public accusation after finding new employment. Fowler worked at Uber from November 2015 through December 2016. While she had gone so far as to supply screenshots of the executive’s offensive solicitations to the human resource department Fowler was told by upper management that they were uncomfortable punishing her supervisor because he had high performance reviews and that it was probably just an honest mistake on his part. Within hours of the publication of the blog post Kalanick delivered a public statement by e-mail to say that this was the first time he had heard of the allegations and to explain that he had instructed the head of the human resource department to open an urgent investigation into Fowler’s claims. Fowler’s post about the sexist corporate culture at Uber reinforced the widespread public notion that the tech industry was rampant with sexual harassment and sexism. Her allegations followed much-publicized incidents in 2015 when Ellen Pao had filed similar charges in a lawsuit against upper management at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and later in 2017 when six female employees at Binary Capital accused a co-founder of that company of sexual harassment.The atmosphere of sexual harassment at Uber began at the top with Kalanick who once bragged in a Gentleman’s Quarterly interview that his association with Uber had boosted his desirability with women and jokingly referred to his company as “boob-er.” In early June 2017 after the law firm Perkins Coie LLP had finished their internal investigation into the allegations of widespread sexual harassment Uber fired 20 employees for inappropriate behaviour. This was quickly followed by the firing of Eric Alexander the company’s president of business in the Asia Pacific region. Alexander had acquired the medical records of a woman in India who had allegedly been raped by her Uber driver. Alexander then shared those records with Kalanick and another vice-president. This resulted in a lawsuit by the woman who alleged that Uber wanted the records to destroy her credibility.Kalanick announced in early June 2017 that he would take an indefinite leave of absence and he handed over management of day-to-day operations to a group of executives. Within a week however five of Uber’s largest investors including Benchmark Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments demanded Kalanick’s resignation and forced him out of the company.Outlook for uberWhat options did Uber have for their next plan of action? While Kalanick had helped to build Uber into an international transportation powerhouse that operated in more than 70 countries and had a value of approximately $70 billion his often out-of-control style had also delivered the company to the brink of destruction. Uber’s U.S. market share declined in the first six months of 2017 as consumers and drivers alike reacted to the variety of negative issues that clouded the company’s future. By January 2017 approximately half a million subscribers had deleted the Uber app from their phones in a widespread campaign known as #DeleteUber. Rival on-demand provider Lyft gained 7 per cent of the Chicago market during the same time period.Uber had earned its reputation which was negative enough that having been employed at Uber was for some employees a black mark on their resumes. An anti-Uber website titled Why Everyone Hates Uber listed and described Uber’s controversial practices. Uber had needed to change its practices for some time. Top leadership at Uber perpetuated a hostile workplace that was rampant with sexism; the company was accused of using stolen intellectual property and it utilized behavioural science knowledge that manipulated rather than engaged its drivers. Many high-level executives besides Kalanick had left Uber by the middle of 2017. These included Jeff Jones the company president who left after a six-month tenure several high-level executives who left after the sexual harassment investigation the vice-president of product and growth and the top security researcher. After Kalanick’s departure top leaders at Uber quickly stressed the need for better top executives and an improved organizational culture while commentators speculated about the advantages of hiring a female CEO to help turn around the corporation’s culture. Uber had committed to self-driving cars but it had not developed a solution to the current challenges with its drivers which were significant because the cost of changing to an employee-based work system was prohibitive. Finally some analysts cautioned that Uber’s finances needed better controls that would generate cash and stimulate outside investment. There was no doubt that Uber needed to move quickly and decisively. Uber was especially vulnerable while it changed direction and leadership. Some analysts noted that it was a perfect time for competitors to steal Uber’s best remaining talent who had proven skills and it could be a dangerous time if company morale plummeted and consumer confidence in Uber faded.ENDNOTES,13,"[{""start"":2042,""end"":2058,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2090,""end"":2100,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2346,""end"":2354,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2460,""end"":2469,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2424,""end"":2432,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2586,""end"":2596,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2726,""end"":2734,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2902,""end"":2910,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2987,""end"":2995,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3272,""end"":3280,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3730,""end"":3738,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3831,""end"":3839,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3991,""end"":3999,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4195,""end"":4203,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4852,""end"":4860,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5854,""end"":5862,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6081,""end"":6089,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6298,""end"":6306,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6412,""end"":6420,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6748,""end"":6756,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7039,""end"":7047,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7254,""end"":7262,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7287,""end"":7295,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7355,""end"":7363,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7503,""end"":7511,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7704,""end"":7712,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7842,""end"":7850,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7933,""end"":7941,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8090,""end"":8098,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8377,""end"":8387,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8509,""end"":8517,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8775,""end"":8785,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8955,""end"":8965,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9164,""end"":9174,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9298,""end"":9308,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9418,""end"":9426,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9615,""end"":9623,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12472,""end"":12480,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12549,""end"":12557,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12673,""end"":12681,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12837,""end"":12845,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12956,""end"":12964,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15239,""end"":15247,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15326,""end"":15334,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16215,""end"":16223,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16486,""end"":16494,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16607,""end"":16615,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":25339,""end"":25347,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26116,""end"":26124,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26779,""end"":26787,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26924,""end"":26932,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27217,""end"":27227,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27354,""end"":27362,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28614,""end"":28622,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28903,""end"":28913,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2499,""end"":2509,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3449,""end"":3459,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":21710,""end"":21720,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":21750,""end"":21760,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":22090,""end"":22100,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":22853,""end"":22863,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2713,""end"":2715,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2519,""end"":2521,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2838,""end"":2840,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3001,""end"":3003,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4660,""end"":4662,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3536,""end"":3538,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":6561,""end"":6563,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8585,""end"":8587,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":16327,""end"":16329,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":23215,""end"":23217,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9717,""end"":9719,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Just over a month into her new job Brown was confronted by an internal memo posted by Google engineer James Damore espousing his views on the causes of gender disparities and problems with the company’s diversity programs. Damore’s memo was leaked to the public and he was fired two days later. The chain of events set off one of the most publicized controversies in the firm’s history. The incident brought chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai back from vacation and led to a high-level decision focused on protecting Google’s public image and employees’ well-being. Corporate communication with Damore was brief and the unrest had a chilling effect on what would otherwise have been Brown’s impressive transition as an up-and-coming high-tech executive.Damore’s memo provoked a dizzying array of viewpoints within the company and once public within the media. With the turmoil showing little sign of abating Damore’s memo reminded many women of the hurt they had experienced from discrimination and harassment. The company’s reaction also left many employees who held unpopular views frightened that they too could be targeted. Brown had to find a way to move people past debates over Damore and his memo. It was an opportunity to demonstrate the candour and character that could help her team regain hope set an example for others and build trust in her and in the company. In a circumstance where communication and relationships had become fractured her leadership would now be defined by how she chose her words in the wake of the crisis.DANIELLE BROWNBrown was appointed Google’s new vice-president of diversity integrity and governance in 2017. She arrived on the job just over a month before the Damore crisis broke in August 2017. In 2009 Brown was one of 15 master of business administration graduates nationwide who were accepted into the accelerated leadership program at Intel Corporation (Intel). Showing the versatility that allowed her to excel as a management consultant sales manager and product marketer in her early career Brown rose to chief of staff of global human resources (HR) within four years was appointed chief diversity and inclusion officer just a year later then vice-president of global HR three years after that.Although the Intel appointment was the first diversity and inclusion role in Brown’s career she boasted a record that exceeded the company’s goals for diversity hiring. She had achieved stretch goals for hiring and retention weekly reporting transparent metrics engagement of majority males a complaint hotline and confrontation of offenders. In 2015 when Brown had less than a year in the diversity role Intel’s CEO announced an investment of US$300 million over five years in diversity efforts. Brown’s value proposition was a culture where a “diverse range of perspectives and views” enabled business success. Intel boasted an “open door policy” that encouraged dialogue between employees regardless of their respective levels at times holding executives to account when they ignored concerns of others.JAMES DAMOREJames Damore was a senior software engineer in Google’s search division. He joined Google in 2013 with an extensive academic background in biology and computational biology and a reputation for competitive participation in chess and strategy games. He worked his way up to the project leader level which merited him a salary in the US$300000 range.In June 2017 after what he considered unpleasant experiences with Google’s internal culture and diversity programs Damore began typing his thoughts during a long business flight to China. Titling his memo “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber” Damore wrote in response to invitations from diversity program organizers to provide feedback. He submitted his memo in early July eager to hear a response. When he did not receive a reply Damore posted his memo through internal lists and forums.Early on August 5 2017 online news outlets reported that Damore’s memo had gone “viral” among Google employees the day before. The same day the memo was picked up and posted by a public website; labelled an “anti-diversity manifesto” the memo immediately attracted widespread attention. Damore described his experience of diversity training as one in which he was shamed and restricted from voicing unwelcomed ideas. Google fired Damore on August 7 two days after the leak with no apparent link between the decision to fire him and Brown’s responsibilities as diversity officer.After he was fired Damore attracted an instant following gaining 35000 followers on his Twitter Inc. account and inspiring an organization of protests across the country—which were later cancelled due to alleged terrorist threats. Damore first accepted online interviews with right-wing media outlets to avoid hostility from media unsympathetic to his views.In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Damore complained about the lack of “open and honest discussion” and his experience that employees’ identities were wedded to the company “almost like a cult.” In online question-and-answer sessions Damore expressed his disappointment over being “shamed” by his supervisor before the memo was leaked and he emphasized that his intention was not to attack others but to improve Google’s culture. Damore did not apologize for his memo or for upsetting others and he still believed his views were correct.Manifesto ContentDamore prefaced his 10-page document with a statement affirming that he valued diversity and inclusion recognized the existence of sexism and disapproved of stereotyping individuals emphasizing the need to stay focused on “population level differences in distributions.” In places throughout the memo he also alluded to the possibility of bias and limitations in his perspective and the need for “open and honest” discussion to address gender and ideological issues in the company.Damore began his memo by suggesting that the left and right biases that may be hindering discussion at Google were the “result of deep moral preferences” (a reference to Jonathan Haidt’s well-regarded research on moral foundations). He then proposed several non-socially constructed causes of the gender gap in technology (tech) specifically software engineering focusing on differences in biological and personality traits. He covered a range of purported “non-bias [sic] causes” including prenatal exposure to testosterone differing interest in people versus things levels of the personality traits extraversion and neuroticism (referred to by Damore as “higher anxiety lower stress tolerance” and by psychologists in the positive sense as emotional stability) and differences in drive for status. Based on the differences he discussed Damore concluded that “principled” and “optimizing” approaches to diversity were preferable to “arbitrary social engineering” (hiring quotas). He proceeded to list existing Google practices that he considered “discriminatory” including programs exclusively for “a certain gender or race” special queues and treatment for such candidates scrutiny of insufficiently diverse groups and any practices or goals that could result in inappropriate incentives or illegal double standards. In the next section of his memo Damore reiterated the importance of recognizing ideological biases—possibly veiled left or Marxist-style biases—that he believed “increase race and gender tensions” because they affect how the social sciences are studied and maintain “myths like social constructionism and the gender wage gap.” He identified other consequences of these biases as overprotection of females dismissal of gender issues affecting men and “extremely sensitive PC-[politically correct] authoritarians” who engage in “violence and shaming.”Damore proposed “non-discriminatory ways” to address the gender gap including making software engineering more people-oriented allowing co-operative behaviour to thrive and reducing stress and increasing flexibility in tech and leadership work. With the overall goal of restoring psychological safety and stopping discriminatory practices Damore ended his memo with a range of suggestions to reduce the level of intolerance moralization alienation and hostility including the reduction of over-empathetic support for the suffering and offences of select groups. He believed that discriminating merely to increase representation of women in tech was misguided and costly causing the same poor outcome as failed attempts to address problems with “the homeless work-related and violent deaths prisons and school dropouts.”Immediate ResponseCorporate ResponsesResponses from numerous internal and external stakeholders poured in once Damore’s memo had been posted. Before the memo was leaked to the public Ari Balogh vice-president of engineering and Damore’s supervisor wrote an internal memo stating that “Questioning our assumptions and sharing different perspectives” was an important part of Google's culture but “one of the aspects of the post that troubled me deeply was the bias inherent in suggesting that most women or men feel or act a certain way. That is stereotyping and it is harmful.”The day Damore’s memo was leaked to the public Brown responded in an internal memo to all staff (see Exhibit 1) sayingPart of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct policies and anti-discrimination laws.The day after firing Damore Pichai wrote to employees (see Exhibit 2) declaring We strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.Co-Worker ResponsesCo-worker responses to the memo were openly critical calling for Damore to be fired. According to Damore these were calls for “censorship retaliation and atonement.” Various voices labelled the memo “screed” “pure toxicity” “garbage fire” “bigoted” “misogynist” and “violently offensive.” Facilitated by Google’s collaborative communication platforms attacks directed at Damore and open messages to Brown effectively put both on trial. Leaked posts revealed that many of these communications were from middle-level managers using expletives to describe Damore and the memo refusing to work with his department questioning his competence to sit on hiring committees blaming him for attrition of employees and expressing intentions to silence and banish anyone sympathetic to Damore. Some posts openly disparaged Brown for not issuing a more severe criticism of the memo.Numerous women publicly expressed their disappointment and disgust with Damore’s memo and some were motivated by the controversy to look for work elsewhere. One female employee expressed that the memo was not considerate of women’s views and feelings and that the public response was too focused on freedom of speech issues and a debate about reasons for termination. “To have us all lumped into one sort of category like that” she said “and to have such a baseless claim made about who we are and to have it positioned as fact—as scientific fact—I don’t know how we could feel anything but attacked by that.”Using words like “unlawful” and “hostile” Susan Wojcicki CEO of Google’s YouTube criticized the memo for perpetuating negative stereotypes and unfounded biases that would now be exposed to a new generation hindering efforts to deal with a gender gap that existed in tech but not in other science technology engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. Expressing her alarm over what she believed were unacceptable comparisons between people she posed the question “What if the memo said that biological differences amongst black Hispanic or LGBTQ (lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer or questioning) employees explained their underrepresentation in tech and leadership roles? Would some people still be discussing the merit of the memo’s arguments or would there be a universal call for swift action against its author?”Few media articles covered employees who supported Damore due in part to the employees’ unwillingness to speak out except by leaking messages written by other employees who engaged in defamation and threatened to blacklist those they labelled as “anti-diversity.” However one reporter who spoke to employees anonymously found a range of viewpoints including some that agreed that the culture maintained its control by “shaming dissenters into silence.” The employees noted that the practice of shaming Damore publicly indicated that critics preferred to dominate the public discourse rather than to engage him in direct discussion. Through the anonymous corporate chat application Blind a Google employee complained about the “terrifying” discovery that “if someone is not ideologically aligned with the majority then he’s labelled as a ‘poor cultural fit’ and would not be hired/promoted.” Others applauded Damore’s courage and found it hypocritical to talk about diversity and inclusion and then exclude divergent opinions.To shed light on Damore’s claim that “there were many women who were empowered and that agree with me” Blind conducted a survey of 4000 employees across Silicon Valley. The results showed that 44 per cent of Google respondents were in support of firing Damore a result that placed the response from Google employees in the middle of similar responses from within other tech firms (see Exhibit 3).Public ResponsesThe negative response to Damore’s memo was unreserved. Megan Smith formerly vice-president at Google and at the time a chief technology officer of the United States was glad that Damore’s views were now out in the open to condemn. She called the memo “insidious . . . death by a thousand paper cuts . . . they are misguided they’re destructive to their colleagues.” Former Google engineer Erica Baker criticized Google for allowing an environment in which “racists and sexists feel supported and safe in sharing these views in the company.” Angela Saini science journalist and author of Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong argued that psychological studies showed the “tiniest gaps if any between the sexes including areas such as mathematical ability and verbal fluency” and said that brains could not be distinguished by sex. Cynthia Lee computer science professor at Stanford University believed that Damore’s “quasi-professional” but dangerously “beguiling” scientific arguments were a “red herring” distracting attention away from the “glaring evidence in individual stories and in scientific studies that women in tech experience bias and a general lack of a welcoming environment as do underrepresented minorities.”Multiple outlets expressed their disapproval of Damore’s dismissal. Their concerns were based on the view that he was mainly expressing an opinion about how diversity could be improved based on findings that were unquestioned among those who studied basic gender differences. A few female commentators were less alarmed by the gender differences in tech. Megan McArdle a policy journalist and former technology consultant found that her male co-workers showed a passion for technology that was not often shared by their female counterparts. McArdle was matter of fact about being in the minority around men even though the environment was naturally and regrettably less hospitable when representation was lopsided.A poll conducted by the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University and The Harris Poll found that 55 per cent of respondents said Google was wrong to fire Damore. The respondents were divided within their political groups with 50 per cent of Democrats 56 per cent of independents and 61 per cent of Republicans indicating they were opposed to Damore’s dismissal.Scientific ResponsesShortly after Damore was fired scholars responded vigorously many with lengthy impassioned arguments. Gina Rippon the chair of cognitive brain imaging at Aston University stated that something biological could be overcome with practise and that the biological gender differences were “so tiny that there’s no way that they can explain the kind of gender gap that’s apparent at Google.” Janet Hyde a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin concluded that “there’s every reason to think these gender differences in interests are caused by socialisation factors.” Rosalind Barnett senior scientist at the Women’s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University and Caryl Rivers journalism professor at Boston University cited several scientists in their conclusion that there was little biological evidence for sex differences and that the “anxiety gap” existed not because of biology but because competent women were seen as bitchy judged more harshly and given less credit. Suzanne Sadedin an evolutionary biologist at Monash University called Damore’s memo “despicable trash” criticizing it for being intellectually dishonest about its attacks on female inferiority misrepresenting research on sex differences and failing to provide evidence of influences on performance in tech.Cordelia Fine a psychology professor at the University of Melbourne thought that the memo “made many dubious assumptions and ignored vast swaths of research that show pervasive discrimination against women.” Nonetheless she felt sorry for Damore because his points were “very familiar to me as part of my day-to-day research and are not seen as especially controversial.” Similarly some scholars focused on the validity of the research on gender differences without addressing the effect that science has on perpetuating stereotypes about careers suitable for women. Lee Jussim professor of social psychology at Rutgers University said that the memo got “nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right” and was “certainly not a rant. And it stands in sharp contrast to most of the comments [criticisms] which are little more than snarky modern slurs.” Geoffrey Miller professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of New Mexico stated that “almost all of the Google memo’s empirical claims are scientifically accurate. Moreover they are stated quite carefully and dispassionately.” Debra Soh a sexual neuroscientist called the memo “fair and factually accurate” arguing that there were “sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our interests and behaviour.” Agreeing with Damore Soh noted that “gendered interests are predicted by exposure to prenatal testosterone—higher levels are associated with a preference for mechanically interesting things and occupations in adulthood.”Responses from scholars cited by Damore in the memo were mixed. Richard Lippa psychology professor at California State University called Damore’s summary of psychological differences “reasonably accurate” and Michael Wiederman psychology professor at the University of South Carolina believed that Damore made “reasoned arguments” about why men could be more keen than women to climb the corporate ladder. Catherine Hakim sociologist at the think tank Civitas believed that it was “nonsense” to link career outcomes to psychological gender differences. Jüri Allik professor of experimental psychology at the University of Tartu said that Damore’s extrapolations of personality research to career outcomes were “risky” and that gender differences in his research were “very very small.” David Schmitt psychology professor at Bradley University and founding director of the International Sexuality Description Project affirmed Damore’s conclusions drawing from cross-cultural data on personality differences; however he was hesitant to link personality directly to occupational differences between sexes. Schmitt did emphasize that occupational differences were quite large and that nations that treated women more equally saw larger not smaller differences in personality traits and occupational preferences.Diversity in TechnologyDiversity at GoogleGoogle had grown to more than 75000 employees by 2017. Women made up 30.8 per cent of Google’s overall workforce in 2017; only 2.5 per cent of the company’s employees were black and only 3.6 per cent were Hispanic or Latinx. Though the percentage of women in Google’s workforce had changed little since 2014 (when it was 30.6 per cent) the percentage of women in leadership and tech roles improved between 2014 and 2017 going from 20.8 to 24.5 per cent in leadership and from 16.6 to 20.2 per cent in tech compared with 48.1 to 48.4 per cent in non-tech roles (e.g. HR marketing and accounting). Attrition among women was lower than for men but gains in female representation were being made mainly among white and Asian women. These figures compared unflatteringly to figures from the tech industry and the private sector as a whole; female representation was 36 per cent in tech and 48 per cent in the private workforce overall. Black employees represented 7.4 per cent of tech staff and 14.4 per cent of the overall workforce and Hispanic and Latinx employees represented 8.0 per cent and 13.9 per cent respectively.In view of the relatively flat trends in the overall workforce it was unclear where Google could make improvements whether by addressing internal biases or processes or by working further upstream at the sources of female candidates. Such trends did not seem to accord with the substantial sum of US$265 million it had spent on diversity programs over 2014 and 2015. The company eventually stopped divulging its spending figures.In the wake of Damore’s memo female employees became vocal about the nature of their experiences. Wojcicki one of Google’s first employees shared her experiences in Fortune which had named her the 16th most powerful woman in 2016: I’ve had my abilities and commitment to my job questioned. I’ve been left out of key industry events and social gatherings. I’ve had meetings with external leaders where they primarily addressed the more junior male colleagues. I’ve had my comments frequently interrupted and my ideas ignored until they were rephrased by men. No matter how often this all happened it still hurt.Another woman expressed hurt and frustration over years of getting caught up in internal discussion threads “where men were louder than women on gender-bias and discrimination issues.” She attributed the problem with “discrimination harassment and mental violence” to hiring for a certain male stereotype that was not compatible with a hospitable environment for women.As a federal contractor required to conform to equal opportunity requirements Google had been involved in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Labor that alleged that Google was underpaying women. The day Damore was fired a representative of the Department of Labor testified in court about the ongoing investigation into Google. The department had found “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” at Google and “compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” Within a month Google was served with a class-action lawsuit launched by three underpaid women who said that they were placed at lower job levels and denied promotions and moves that could have advanced their careers.Inclusion at GoogleThe firm’s motto “Don’t be evil” encapsulated the high ideals Google put forth to make the world a better place and to be unbiased and objective it how it handled search results. In the years before Brown’s arrival Google had already embarked on ambitious diversity programming. As early as 2014 Nancy Lee vice-president of people operations wanted to fulfill Google’s original “don’t be evil” mandate by initiating the full disclosure of its diversity figures numbers that “weren’t great” but put Google “on the hook. There’s no turning back.” A spokesperson for Google emphasized that the company was “very committed to an open internal culture” of which “transparency [was] a huge part.” The company was known to operate a wide range of platforms for open expression based on promotion of the idea of “psychological safety” in which employees were encouraged to share ideas without being judged or embarrassed.Google applied considerable measures to improve hiring and promotion processes focused on women and people of colour. These measures included implementing unconscious bias training checking performance review processes and encouraging greater self-nomination. To address the challenge of an extremely low representation of black Googlers the company created an engineering residency for black computer science majors and embedded engineers at historically black colleges. It also worked to foster an inclusive culture by making sure its corporate events town halls and resource groups (e.g. Women@Google and Google Women in Engineering) were welcoming and supportive. Google’s community-based programs included partnerships with figures from Hollywood that aimed to inspire girls to pursue computer science and programs introducing coding to high school students from diverse communities.In an interview he gave after he was fired Damore elaborated on his negative experiences with numerous diversity events including a weekly company-wide meeting (TGIF) mandatory unconscious bias training calls to hold individual managers accountable for their team’s diversity and a weekly e-mail allowing 20000 employees to submit examples of micro-aggressions some of which could implicitly identify the perpetrators. In the lead-up to the Damore memo some employees had taken measures into their own hands openly creating blacklists of those labelled “anti-diversity.” The threat of being reported to human resources did not deter these list-keepers; rather they used the reactionary comments to identify others to add to their lists. It was not apparent from reports how prevalent this behaviour was or how severely it affected the targeted co-workers.Analysts highlighted the irony that despite Google’s moral mission the extreme views of controversial far-right figures were bolstered by the followings they gained on Google-owned YouTube. The video platform was accused of creating “filter bubbles” that drew users deeper into extreme content capturing the attention of disenfranchised groups. YouTube actively limited hate violent extremist supremacist or religious content that did not meet YouTube’s increasingly tough standards. With national politics getting more divisive analysts voiced their concerns that the company having a reputation for liberal views could use its vast power over online searches to contain conservative thought.Sexism in TechIn recent years Silicon Valley and the tech sector had been known to have serious problems with sexual diversity discrimination and harassment—issues that became widely known due to publicized cases at other tech giants such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Twitter Inc.. Women experienced being propositioned for sex dismissed and disrespected and they had to fend off gropes and recover from interruptions by men in meetings. Explanations for this behaviour attributed it to the origins of Silicon Valley in the “male realm” of hardware brotherhoods of young men coming out of college the perception that “genius” was held only by men and the persistent sexist view that women achieved less and were fair game for objectification.High-ranking executives were not immune to the problem. Former Tinder executive Whitney Wolfe was called a “whore” and “slut” by the firm’s marketing chief and unjustly denied the title of co-founder. Donna Harris a venture capitalist who had started out as a systems engineer remarked that her path to success was “littered with rampant sexism mansplaining unconscious bias and some downright ugly discrimination.” A coalition of seven women spearheaded a survey of 210 female peers working in Silicon Valley 25 per cent of whom were responding as top-ranking officers. A significant proportion of these women experienced exclusion disrespect and mistreatment in their workplaces (see Exhibit 4).Legal IssuesIn both the United States and Canada universal rights to freedom of speech generally did not apply in the workplace. Employers had a right to limit the types of speech that employees engaged in at work. Such limitations extended outside the workplace if the employees’ conduct disrupted the legitimate business of the employer. In California employers could “fire workers at any time for any reason as long as it’s not an illegal reason.” Illegal grounds for firing were covered under the National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.Damore filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board the same day he was fired. The unfair labour practice identified in the complaint referred to section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act which stated that “It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.” The section 7 rights under the Act protected employees who engaged in “concerted activities” to improve their pay and working conditions or fix employment-related problems even if the employees were not in a union.Cases governed by the Civil Rights Act were administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Commission. Title VII made it illegal “to discriminate against someone on the basis of race color religion national origin or sex.” Title VII also prohibited employers from “punishing job applicants or employees for asserting their rights to be free from employment discrimination including harassment. . . . Other acts to oppose discrimination [were also] protected as long as the employee was acting on a reasonable belief that something in the workplace may violate EEO laws.”Google’s decision to fire Damore left observers wondering what precise issue resulted in a code-of-conduct violation (see Exhibit 5). Neither party commented on any private employer–employee discussions that may have influenced Google’s decision. Damore described the lead-up to his dismissal this way:There is a dominant ideology at Google and anyone who dissents against that is either shamed or ostracized. And when it became apparent that I wasn’t backing down to the shame they had to fire me. . . . And it [the memo] was actually pointing out several practices at Google that went against the code of conduct. So there are many practices that harass conservatives that have illegal bias against certain groups. And I was simply pointing them out. And much of this is whistleblower stuff where they really should not have fired me for pointing out illegal practices at Google.a question of leadershipRiding high on the experience of success and harmony at Intel Brown hoped that she could continue making an impact as diversity officer of one of the most influential companies in the world. She was now part of a corporate environment that seemed progressive on the surface but was permeated by strong political views and simmering discomfort over the diversity program. With the controversy over the Damore memo at the two-week mark the company had taken a hard line on Damore and moved on. Multiple people had written lengthy opinions about diversity and inclusion—staff the press academics—but Brown’s communication had so far consisted of one short letter. With more than half of Google’s employees against firing Damore what steps should Brown take next to restore trust and promote candour?Exhibit 1: Memo to Employees from Danielle BrownGoogle’s Vice-President of DiversityGooglersI’m Danielle Google's brand new VP of Diversity Integrity & Governance. I started just a couple of weeks ago and I had hoped to take another week or so to get the lay of the land before introducing myself to you all. But given the heated debate we’ve seen over the past few days I feel compelled to say a few words.Many of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our engineering organization expressing views on the natural abilities and characteristics of different genders as well as whether one can speak freely of these things at Google. And like many of you I found that it [the memo] advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I’m not going to link to it here as it’s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses promotes or encourages.Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate. We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul. As Ari Balogh said in his internal G+ post “Building an open inclusive environment is core to who we are and the right thing to do. ’Nuff said.”Google has taken a strong stand on this issue by releasing its demographic data and creating a company-wide OKR on diversity and inclusion. Strong stands elicit strong reactions. Changing a culture is hard and it’s often uncomfortable. But I firmly believe Google is doing the right thing and that’s why I took this job.Part of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct policies and anti-discrimination laws.I’ve been in the industry for a long time and I can tell you that I’ve never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to express themselves—TGIF Memegen internal G+ thousands of discussion groups. I know this conversation doesn’t end with my email today. I look forward to continuing to hear your thoughts as I settle in and meet with Googlers across the company.ThanksDanielle Note: OKR = objectives and key results.Source: Sarah Emerson and Louise Matsakis “Google on Anti-Diversity Manifesto: Employees Must ‘Feel Safe Sharing Their Opinions’” Motherboard August 5 2017 accessed January 31 2018 https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/vbv54d/google-on-anti-diversity-manifesto-employees-must-feel-safe-sharing-their-opinions. Exhibit 2: Memo to Employees from Sundar PichaiGoogle’s Chief Executive OfficerThis has been a very difficult time. I wanted to provide an update on the memo that was circulated over this past week.First let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct which expects “each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment intimidation bias and unlawful discrimination.”The memo has clearly impacted our co-workers some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender. Our co-workers shouldn’t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting they have to prove that they are not like the memo states being “agreeable” rather than “assertive” showing a “lower stress tolerance” or being “neurotic.”At the same time there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again many points raised in the memo—such as the portions criticizing Google’s trainings questioning the role of ideology in the workplace and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all—are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics—we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions.The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree—while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I’d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.I have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there’s a lot more to discuss as a group—including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.Source: Sundar Pichai “Note to Employees from CEO Sundar Pichai” The Keyword (blog) Google August 8 2017 accessed January 30 2018 www.blog.google/topics/diversity/note-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai.Exhibit 3: Survey Conducted by Blind Evaluating Agreement with Google’s Decision to fire James DamoreQuestion: “Was Google right in firing manifesto author Damore?”Source: Created by the case authors using data from Blind an anonymous work talk app provided in Julie Bort “Over Half of Google Employees Polled Say the Web Giant Shouldn't Have Fired the Engineer Behind the Controversial Memo” Business Insider August 9 2017 accessed February 9 2018 www.businessinsider.com/many-google-employees-dont-think-james-damore-should-have-been-fired-2017-8.Exhibit 4: Selected Results from “Elephant in the Valley” survey on discrimination and harassment in silicon valleySource: Trae Vassallo Ellen Levy Michele Madansky Hillary Mickell Bennett Porter Monica Leas and Julie Oberweis Elephant in the Valley accessed February 12 2018 www.elephantinthevalley.com.Exhibit 5: excerpts from Google’s Code of ConductPreface“Don’t be evil.” Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But “Don’t be evil” is much more than that. Yes it’s about providing our users unbiased access to information focusing on their needs and giving them the best products and services that we can. But it’s also about doing the right thing more generally—following the law acting honorably and treating co-workers with courtesy and respect.The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put “Don’t be evil” into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be and should be measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people build great products and attract loyal users. Trust and mutual respect among employees and users are the foundation of our success and they are something we need to earn every day.So please do read the Code and follow both its spirit and letter always bearing in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate and to encourage other Googlers to incorporate the principles of the Code into our work. And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment don’t be silent. We want—and need—to hear from you.II. Support Each Other2. Harassment Discrimination and BullyingGoogle prohibits discrimination harassment and bullying in any form—verbal physical or visual as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at Google or by a Google partner or vendor we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor Human Resources or both. Similarly supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. HR will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.Note: Excerpted from the Code of Conduct in force in July 2017.

It was a job Chan still insisted on doing even though he was 89 years old. As usual Ming Li the factory director and several department managers reported on what was going on in the factory. At the meeting Li mentioned that “it was very difficult to recruit employees although they had been actively working on recruiting after the Spring Festival. Apparently it was insufficient to recruit a skilled worker with a ¥4000–¥5000 [US$640–$800] monthly salary.”China’s economy had been flourishing since the 1990s but labour costs had also increased. Due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the appreciation of the Chinese currency the yuan renminbi the quantity of orders was dropping. Since 2013 a nationwide shortage of workers had caused shoe factories toy factories and garment factories to gradually shrink. Because of improvements in hometown environments and higher living costs in large cities more and more migrant workers were unwilling to leave their hometowns for work in the cities. Fewer workers and greater management challenges resulted in the closure of many factories in mainland China and made it difficult to maintain and operate the businesses that surrounded and supported them. In the context of this restructuring of labour-intensive economic activities in mainland China Chan took time to consider how YGM could respond. The recent emergence of fast-fashion brands had made it necessary to consider how YGM Trading Limited could better implement its original brand manufacturer strategy by acquiring well-known brands and developing independent brands.YGM which Chan founded in 1949 with a mere 20 sewing machines had grown into a prestigious original equipment manufacturer/original design manufacturer (OEM/ODM) garment manufacturer and global organization (see Exhibit 1). Production headquarters were in Hong Kong and the business extended into mainland China and other countries in Asia. Its sales network extended globally. Chan had realized decades ago that it was unwise for the company to rely solely on factory production and he had therefore founded YGM which manufactured and marketed shirts with well-known brands (both licensed and self-owned) for Asian European and U.S. markets. YGM Trading Limited was spun off from YGM in 1987 and it became a separately listed public company based in Hong Kong. The company’s core businesses were garment wholesaling and retailing; its other businesses included garment manufacturing property investment and printing. While it had developed its apparel retail and wholesale businesses YGM Trading Limited also actively grew a franchise business. At this point YGM had a rich experience in brand management and had been very successful. However Chan was facing both challenges and opportunities and was considering how to keep YGM and YGM Trading successful in the future. The chinese Textile industryThe textile industry in China was labour-intensive and highly dependent on international sales. China was the largest producer and exporter of textiles and garments around the world. Compared with Europe the United States and other developed countries its labour costs were low. In addition the large scale of the textile industry helped companies take full advantage of economies of scale. The government of China had enacted special policies that encouraged garment companies to develop their own brands and it had also encouraged upgrading rural market consumption and utilized policies to safeguard corporations’ lawful rights and interests. The government provided preferential tax policies and in recent years a public research and development design platform was utilized to provide talent issue new financing and encourage companies to use brands for mortgages or issuing bonds. The government also encouraged spinning industries from eastern China to develop in western China. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China the total market volume for clothing increased from ¥102 billion in 2004 to ¥702.2 billion in 2012 representing a 26.58 per cent average growth rate over this period which was about 16 per cent higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. China’s garment industry went through a relatively long-term development process (see Exhibit 2). The third transformation of the global textile service industry in the 1980s resulted in China becoming a manufacturing centre and the OEM model became the major business model for Chinese textile and garment companies. After the 1990s with the maturation of the manufacturing technology used in the textile and garment industry the business model had changed from OEM to a more advanced processing model: ODM. However the industry was facing increasing costs. As a high-polluting industry the textile industry in China was under increasing social pressure concerning pollution control and abatement. The public was beginning to demand that companies protect the environment and the government intended to impose environmental pollution taxes. Hong Kong was also facing new operating challenges due to environmental concerns: developed countries were implementing environmental protection measures that formed a “green” barrier—a protective network for the global market. Green symbols provided permission for textile products to enter global markets and textile printing and dyeing companies invested more in environmental protection. The development of China’s economy and increasing household incomes also resulted in increasing labour costs. Migrant workers became more reluctant to leave their homes to work in big cities. At the same time the implementation of labour laws in mainland China led to higher production costs in the textile industry.As the textile industry was a traditional industry in Hong Kong most companies paid little attention to research and development which resulted in large gaps in relation to the global textile market in areas such as new fabric innovations. While the textile and garment industry was a relatively low-cost industry policy incentives such as the government’s encouraging eastern spinning industries to develop in western China led to the establishment of many emerging garment companies attracted by high gross profits. Garment companies were suffering from potential threats as the garment industry was a chaotic intellectual property-based industry with too many imitation and counterfeit products. In addition Britain’s intention to exit from the European Union (i.e. Brexit) and international turmoil were highly likely to affect companies’ profits.Recent Industry Statistics In terms of market size China was the world’s largest producer exporter and consumer of textiles and garments. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China with the increase in income levels and an increase in the proportion of the Chinese population living in urban areas China’s consumer market for apparel was expected to grow sustainably in the future. In 2014 China’s large garment companies had produced clothing worth US$29.921 billion with a year-on-year growth of 10 per cent. Over the same period China exported clothing and accessories worth about US$186.31 billion representing an annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent (i.e. a 6 per cent decline from the previous year’s annual growth rate) and an average price of US$2.7 per piece (i.e. a 0.7 per cent annual price increase). In terms of consumption garment retail sales of the above-normal wholesale and retail trade totalled ¥8935.8 billion with a year-on-year growth of 9.24 per cent. In terms of development prospects the annual growth rates for per capita expenditures on clothing by urban and rural residents in China were 4.73 per cent and 12.47 per cent respectively. However China’s per capita consumption on clothing was still at a low level much lower than that of some developed countries (see Exhibit 3).Middle- and High-end Consumption Trends In 2014 domestic middle- and high-end consumption suffered from a recession in the industry and the macro economy. A decrease in shoppers in malls and increased costs contributed to a temperate decline of middle- and high-end consumption. At the same time with the popularization of the Internet and WeChat the traditional business model was replaced gradually by the online to offline business model. Garment Industry TrendsThe garment industry was trending toward two ends. The first trend was toward international fast-fashion brands (e.g. the big four fast-fashion brands—Zara Uniqlo GAP and H&M). Compared with fashion leisure brands such as Baleno which were in decline the big four and other international fast-fashion brands were experiencing frenzied expansion in mainland China. Data showed that the top six fast-fashion brands (i.e. Zara Uniqlo GAP H&M C&A and MUJI) opened one new retail store every two and a half days. In 2014 fast-fashion brands opened 274 new stores in total including 13 Uniqlo stores and nine H&M stores in Guangzhou. The other trend emphasized luxury goods. In recent years the popular term “entry lux” was created to describe brands that had become the choice of white-collar consumers. These brands were affordable and fashionable. Moreover with improved purchasing power the top luxury brands had gradually become the main choice of a new wealthy class.China’s textile industry was currently entering a decelerated growth stage. On March 4 2015 the China National Textile and Apparel Council pointed to three main development characteristics that were present in the textile industry: decelerated growth more pressure for development and an urgent need for transformation. First the growth rate of China’s textile industry had slowed down. Second China’s textile industry was under pressure and differentiation was accelerating. The traditional production model was difficult to sustain while the new production model was still in the process of formation. Therefore for textile companies facing new challenges a competitive scenario emphasizing survival of the fittest would intensify. Innovation would become the key to transforming production power. Under the terms of this new normal the key to China’s textile industry was to promote transformation and upgrades. To promote the development of the whole industry instead of investment-driven and materials-driven development it was now more important to innovate and to develop new technologies and brands as well as more efficient management regulation governance and business models. Industry experts pointed out that as garments were necessities there was at least a fixed demand for textiles in the Chinese market. In 2015 it was predicted that the growth of Chinese textile sales would be at the level of the previous year (see Exhibit 4). Yangtzekiang Garment LimitedYGM was the largest multinational textile and garment corporation in Hong Kong. It operated under the names Yangtzekiang Garment Limited and Hong Kong Knitters and was listed on Hong Kong’s public stock exchange in 1970. YGM Group’s business covered a wide array of activities from spinning weaving dyeing and finishing to garment manufacturing and sales. While YGM also had an investment in electrolytic aluminum ingots the principal activities of the group were manufacturing and sales of garments and textiles provision of processing services and rental of properties. YGM’s textiles business included a wide line of products including yarn woven and knitted fabrics and woven and knitted garments (e.g. men’s and women’s shirts trousers shorts polo shirts T-shirts jackets and knitted outerwear). YGM handled both ODM and OEM garment businesses as well as garment procurement wholesaling and retailing (see Exhibit 5).YGM’s operations covered Southeast Asia the United States Italy France and the United Kingdom. With Hong Kong as its base YGM branched out to China and other parts of the world. YGM set up sales offices and representatives in the United States the United Kingdom France Singapore Bangladesh and China. Branch offices in China were set up in Guangzhou Shanghai and Beijing. The export business mainly targeted European Japanese and Southeast Asian markets. Production plants were in China and Southeast Asia. YGM grew into a global organization and had over 20000 employees (see Exhibit 6) and more than 1200 retail stores worldwide. Besides Hong Kong and places where YGM had factories YGM also had offices in Panyu (Guangzhou) and Shanghai China which took care of manufacturing needs and oversaw domestic sales in those regions. The company had factories in Hong Kong mainland China (in Wuxi Panyu and Guigang) Bangladesh Cambodia Malaysia Macao and other regions. Its headquarters in Hong Kong oversaw sales and the overall management of the group including its manufacturing facilities in China Bangladesh India Cambodia Myanmar and Vietnam. It also monitored and supported YGM’s subcontractors in China and abroad. YGM had wholly owned production plants in Panyu (Guangzhou) China. These production plants included Exquisite Knitters (Guangzhou) Ltd. (EQK); Whampoa Garment Mfg. (Guangzhou) Co. Ltd. (WGM); and Guangzhou Top Yield Garment Ltd. EQK and WGM were compliance plants that focused on the production of high-end clothing. YGM also had a 49 per cent share in Wuxi Talak Investment Co. Ltd. (Wuxi Talak Group) a jointly controlled entity that owned several textile-related companies in Wuxi China including Wuxi Changxin Textile Co. Ltd. Wuxi YGM Textile Co. Ltd. and Wuxi Yangtzekiang Textile Co. Ltd. (collectively the Wuxi Talak Group). The core business of the Wuxi Talak Group was the production of medium- to high-end yarns. Current PerformanceAccording to Tonghuashun Finance YGM Group’s revenue and pre-tax profits dropped considerably from 2012 to 2016 (see Exhibit 7). YGM Group’s five-year gross profit rate remained relatively steady but the net profit rates fell between 2012 and 2016 (see Exhibit 8). Data for the textile and garment industry overall in China in the first half of 2016 (see Exhibit 9) indicated that sales incomes had been continuously reduced over the past five years (from 2012–2016). Even though YGM Group’s gross profit for fiscal year (FY) 2015–16 had increased it was far less than that of the domestic garment industry (i.e. 28.55 per cent less) which implied that YGM Group’s costs were far higher than average costs in the industry. YGM Group’s net profit rate had continued to decline over the past five years especially in FY 2014–15 which had a negative profit. Although the company was profitable in FY 2015–16 its net profit rate was only 0.5 per cent compared with an industry net profit rate of 9.72 per cent—a huge gap.In terms of costs YGM Group’s sales costs rate was lower than the overall industry rate of 10.29 per cent in FY 2015–16 (see Exhibit 10) which indicated that as a well-established garment manufacturing company YGM Group had competitive advantages in its sales channels. However compared with previous years its overhead costs rate (see Exhibit 11) was higher than both its rate for previous years and the overall industry rate of 6.20 per cent. Domestic EnvironmentYGM’s aggressive innovation always caught the industry’s attention. Chan noted that he was the first to produce ready-to-wear suits that met international standards: According to the traditional concept of suits production each suit is customized by the tailor and then [sewn] as the whole suit. While I separated parts of suit to produce Hong Kong men could follow the pattern of Europe and the United States buying right away after trying [it on for the] first time. My masterpiece is the three-piece suit which was most popular in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s suits and Italian suits were well-known as the international style and the most exquisite clothing in the world because there were several exquisite Shanghai tailor masters in workmanship and several excellent Guangdong masters with consummate tailoring skills who [were] updating [their] styles constantly. What’s more with the decades of accumulated experience the art of Hong Kong suits were [at] the world-class level.In the 21st century facing opportunities and challenges from the rapid development of science and technology and intensifying competition from economic globalization Hong Kong had evolved into a high-value-added economy and the Hong Kong textile industry could no longer be rigid. The company evolved from a family-owned textile business by establishing YGM’s own Doctor brand exporting its products to the Middle East the Caribbean and other developing regions and setting up factories in Macao to take advantage of the Portuguese colony’s duty-free market. After 1959 American markets began to purchase Asian goods and YGM captured the European and U.S. markets in 1969. The improvement of the economic environment in mainland China in recent years resulted in increased labour and insurance costs. In addition the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi led to a decline in the number of orders. As a consequence Chan considered expanding into new businesses. At that time a friend who had won an agricultural award indicated that he could supply large quantities of duck down to YGM Group each year. Chan thus decided to open a new duck down business—a field that had recently seen high market demands. His old friend Li Feng helped in sales channels. Chan said “The business of producing a duck down jacket is equivalent to producing three pants and the quality is an important factor. I have confidence to produce duck down jackets and expand business for the new products.”YGM had a long history of delivering excellent product quality; its traditional approach Cantonese-style products and its value connotations matched current Chinese consumers’ new consumption concepts. In mainland China the medium- and high-end clothing markets were mostly captured by Uniqlo Zara H&M and other fast-fashion brands and domestic brands were in a weak position. This situation provided good opportunities for the emergence of high-end domestic clothing brands. International Environment Globalization helped multinational companies to manufacture and sell globally reduce costs and increase sales. However economic globalization also had disadvantages that led to new issues including fluctuating currency exchange rates and unfair competition caused by international tax treaties. The impacts of diverse economic and political backgrounds in various countries also led to losses for some companies. Regarding currency fluctuations since YGM Group’s main business operated in Europe and the United States and accounts were settled mainly in Hong Kong dollars U.S. dollars euros pounds sterling and Chinese yuan renminbi the devaluation of the euro and the pound had a serious impact on YGM’s export business. In 2016 the exchange rates for euros and pounds fell sharply because of Britain’s plan to exit from the European Union. In addition the fluctuation of exchange rates may have put YGM Group under greater economic risk business risk and accounting risk. Due to international tax treaties and taxation exemptions regarding China’s imports of yarn from Southeast Asia and South Asia during 2014–15 YGM Group’s yarn manufacturing business had to pay taxes when importing cotton which weakened the competitiveness of YGM’s manufacturing group. It was inevitable that YGM would be placed in a poor financial situation. In terms of economic and political impacts if other countries had high inflation YGM’s net income would decline; and if industries were nationalized in other countries this nationalization might pose a risk to YGM. After the financial crisis from 2009 a labour shortage emerged in the developed areas on the coast of China. In recent years this issue had been highly damaging to labour-intensive industries that manufactured toys footwear and textiles including YGM Group. The company’s factory in Bangladesh was in good condition and the benefit of the demographic dividend had not been demonstrated in its factory in Myanmar which was in the early stages of construction. However the main production plants were located in Panyu and Guigang in the Pearl River Delta which suffered from the labour shortage. The Panyu factory was most affected. Because it was too difficult to recruit skilled workers the Panyu factory had to reluctantly decline some orders and could rely only on high-end urgent and small orders. Therefore YGM Group’s garment business was in insufficient production. Manufacturing in China had always taken advantage of lower prices as a competitive advantage; however with the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi foreign currencies were in a weak position. Compared with the national corporations in Southeast Asian and South Asian countries Chinese textile enterprises including YGM Group had lost the advantage of low prices for their OEM and ODM businesses. Due to the financial crisis in 2008 European and U.S. markets had weakened and market demand had declined. (The demand for high-end garments had decreased significantly.) Garment orders from abroad had been reduced sharply and the profit margin of companies had been further squeezed. Furthermore major developed countries had again recognized the strategic significance of the manufacturing industry and had implemented re-industrialization strategies: The United States had proposed a U.S. manufacturing industry action plan and Europe had launched a “Factories of the Future” plan. These countries were looking for new technology and innovation strategies to support the development of their manufacturing industries which also forced China’s textile industry to transform and upgrade. Moreover higher production costs had resulted from rapid economic development in China; the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi; and increasing costs for labour raw materials energy and other production inputs. According to Made in China 2025 because China had lost its advantage of lower labour costs global manufacturing industries were moving to Southeast Asia South Asia and Africa where production costs were lower. Since the improvement of labour productivity and the energy advantages in the United States and other developed countries the manufacturing business of multinational companies presented a trend of accelerated back-flow toward developed countries. YGM Trading LimitedYGM originally manufactured shirts for local markets and exported products to Europe and the United States. At the beginning of the 1960s it expanded to also produce trousers and suits. In 1970 YGM was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (now Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited). In the 1970s it established retail outlets in Hong Kong Macau Taiwan Singapore and Malaysia. In 1987 YGM Trading Limited was established as a separately listed public company based in Hong Kong. YGM Trading developed an apparel retail and wholesale business and distributed a wide range of men’s and women’s wear for many world-renowned brands. It also licensed and acquired internationally recognized brands. The Chan family held controlling shares in YGM Trading Ltd. which had a close relationship with YGM Group.Business DevelopmentYGM Trading had a network of more than 800 retail outlets throughout Hong Kong Macau China Taiwan Southeast Asia and Europe. YGM had been actively developing the Greater China market for the past 10 years and had established retail outlets in major cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Guangzhou and expanding this network to many smaller cities. YGM now had more than 200 outlets operating in China and the company expected to grow further in core and developing cities.YGM Trading also actively developed a franchise business and distributed many world-renowned brands (e.g. Michel René Ltd. Aquascutum Limited of London Guy Laroche and Charles Jourdan of Paris Ashworth and Hang Ten of the United States J. Lindeberg from Stockholm and Harmont & Blaine from Italy). YGM Trading opened more than 200 stores in Hong Kong Macau Taiwan and mainland China for the Michel René brand. During 1950–1952 Chan developed the Doctor brand which became fashionable in South Asia. In the 1970s he introduced the American jeans brand Wrangler to China. Meanwhile Michel René was developed as a store brand and was positioned in the market as a “fast suit” brand. Recently YGM had launched a casual-wear series to offer tasteful high-end workwear separates for urban office workers professionals and executives. Clients were attracted by the brand’s exquisite tailoring and careful choice in materials. The company also invited well-known personalities to endorse its brands to increase awareness of the brands.In 2008 the first time that Beijing hosted the Olympic Games the Michel René Aquascutum and Ashworth brands launched limited-edition premium lines for three sporting events aimed at celebrating the Olympic Games with gorgeous practical and cheerful characteristics. YGM Trading focused on middle- and high-end brands (see Exhibit 12). YGM Group had three acquired brands: Aquascutum Michel René and Guy Laroche while Ashworth was an agent brand and J. Lindeberg was a dealer brand. Based on the sales from March 31 2015 to March 31 2016 Aquascutum and Ashworth were the main beneficiaries of the company and both brands’ sales together accounted for 95 per cent of the total sales.Dr. Sui-Kau ChanPersonal InfluencesChan served as a member of the eighth and ninth terms of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference until he reached retirement age. Chan was an honorary citizen of Dongguan Foshan Guangzhou and Wuxi (Jiangsu). He was also the former chairman of the Clothing Industry Training Authority (1986–1997) the founding chairman (1988–1994) and then honorary chairman of the Textile Council of Hong Kong the former president (1977–1988) and then life honorary president of the Federation of Hong Kong Garment Manufacturers the honorary president of the Hong Kong Woollen & Synthetic Knitting Manufacturers’ Association (since 1980) and a former member of the Textile Advisory Board of Hong Kong (1971–1987) and the Hong Kong Labour Advisory Board (1985–1995). In 2013 Chan was awarded Industrialist of the Year from the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. Charity Involvement Chan was renowned for his charity at home and abroad. He was committed to participating in charity work and strongly supported and promoted education in Hong Kong and mainland China. Chan and the Chan family set up several charitable funds including the Chan Yuqing Family Charity Fund and the Chan Yin Chuen Charitable Donation Funds. Decisions Facing the worker shortage in China the appreciation of the Chinese currency increasing labour costs and other costs and the transformation of the industry Chan brainstormed about how he could lead YGM forward and how innovation and transformation of traditional industries could help YGM to create a brilliant future in adversity.

GROWTH IN AFRICAAfrica’s middle-class population tripled from fewer than 5 million in 2000 to 15 million in 2014 which contributed to an increase in disposable income. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was 5 per cent for 2013 compared with a 6 per cent growth rate in East and West Africa showing a promising economic outlook. The number of Internet users in Africa had grown by 3600 per cent from 2000 to 2012 and the penetration of mobile phones in Africa increased from 1 per cent in 2000 to 54 per cent in 2014.THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN AFRICAThe African airline industry was highly regulated by the government and companies needed to follow the rules and regulations set by their home country. In addition when airlines wanted to fly internationally they needed to adhere to the rules laid out in a bilateral air services agreement which specified additional regulations that were unique to each pair of countries.Since 2010 air transportation passenger traffic had grown at an average annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent and was projected to continue to grow at this rate until 2030. This growth rate was slightly higher than the world’s average annual growth rate of 4.8 per cent revealing a significant level of consumer demand. Africa’s international traffic had grown rapidly and the continent was predicted to be the world’s third fastest-growing region in terms of international traffic by 2015. The expansion of the airline industry had contributed to the development of new market opportunities for local African entrepreneurs and businesses. It was predicted that from 2012 to 2032 879000 new jobs would be created throughout the airline industry value chain for the African population.Despite increasing demand the African airline industry still faced several challenges related to infrastructure development. General problems of poor infrastructure in the airline industry were related to a lack of quality human and physical resources a low level of technological connectivity and the absence of adequate transit facilities.The high capital intensity in the airline industry contributed to a low average return on investment of 7.84 per cent. Furthermore the global airline industry median values in 2013 for profit margin return on equity current ratio and quick ratio were 3.10 9.30 1.50 and 0.90 respectively.COMPETITION Precision AirPrecision Air Services Plc (Precision Air) a standard airline company offered its customers quick comfortable and reliable service through the application of a customer-focused approach. Precision Air aimed “to develop and provide superior air transport services that exceeds customer expectations” and wanted “to be the airline of choice.” Its main hub was located in Dar es Salaam and it operated on a regional basis with flights to 10 destinations within and outside Tanzania.Recently Precision Air had been struggling financially and experiencing challenges in earning revenue because of Fastjet’s entrance into the industry. In 2013 Precision Air incurred a loss of TSh30 billion in revenue with gross margins of 18 per cent. In 2014 the company reduced its deficit by 60 per cent with a loss of TSh12 billion and had an increase in gross margins to 28 per cent.Precision Air had recently decreased its fleet size from nine to six aircraft and started suspending unprofitable flight routes. The company also began to offer additional training to staff who lacked the skills required to provide top-quality service. Precision Air also planned on forming more partnerships and joint ventures to increase revenues and improve its financial performance.FASTJET INTERNAL DISCUSSIONCompany BackgroundOn November 29 2012 Fastjet launched its first flight from Dar es Salaam Tanzania to Mwanza Tanzania after acquiring Fly540 a low-cost airline that operated in Tanzania Kenya Angola and Ghana. Two months later Winter was appointed chief executive officer and headquarters were established in London England. East Africa specifically Kenya or Tanzania was considered the best region to launch Fastjet. Tanzania was chosen due to the relatively new Fly540 operations in the country and the Tanzanian government’s welcoming and positive attitude. Kenya was deemed the riskier alternative due to Kenya Airways Ltd.’s considerable influence over the Kenyan government and the associated Civil Aviation Authority.Edward WinterWinter had begun his career as a pilot with British Airways. Subsequently he gained more than 40 years of industry experience both in standard airline services and with the low-cost carrier airline model. He was both the chief operating officer and a founding director of the low-cost airline Go which quickly became profitable with 28 aircrafts. After the sale of Go Winter became the chief operating officer of easyJet a U.K.-based low-cost carrier and successfully expanded easyJet’s operations into Europe. Winter had also served as the chief executive officer of the National Air Services in Saudi Arabia.Upon launching Fastjet Winter had two overarching goals for the company: to become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline and to make reliable and safe air travel accessible to all.The Low-Cost Carrier ModelAs a low-cost carrier Fastjet offered low ticket prices to customers by minimizing expenses. The airline achieved major operational savings by purchasing one type of aircraft used Airbus A319s which reduced spending on spare parts and maintenance. Furthermore Fastjet prepurchased currency and fuel to lower its operational expenses and outsourced engineering and airport passenger handling to provide expert services and to lower its start-up costs. The airline also followed strict hiring policies ensuring that all staff were “clever people” so that exceptional customer service was offered in a responsive manner. Fastjet also cross-trained employees to maximize the company’s investment in its workforce.Fastjet was a “no-frills” airline with a ticket that included just one seat and one piece of hand luggage. Extra charges were applied to any additional items such as food drinks and checked baggage. Despite this pricing scheme 40 per cent of passengers still paid for additional services of some variety.Ticket prices ranged from US$20 to US$170. The earlier a customer booked the cheaper the ticket. This pricing structure allowed Fastjet to maximize the number of purchased seats per flight. This low-cost strategy attracted passengers who had never considered flying to be an affordable option. Approximately 38 per cent of Fastjet passengers had never flown before. In the past they would have travelled far distances by bus or might not have travelled at all.Current PerformanceFastjet’s consistently full flights and high percentage of first-time flyers demonstrated strong market acceptance in Tanzania. In particular Fastjet developed a reputation for reliability and punctuality with cancellations at less than 1 per cent. Fastjet embraced technological trends by developing a highly successful m-commerce platform with M-pesa and Tigo and utilized social media platforms to effectively lower communication and marketing expenses. As a result Fastjet’s African Grey Parrot logo gained significant brand equity.In 2013 yield per passenger grew by 106 per cent from January to December and capacity had increased by 68 per cent. However despite positive feedback from customers Fastjet had continually reported operating losses since its inception (see Exhibit 1). Winter and his management team attributed Fastjet’s losses to its operations in Kenya Angola and Ghana. To free up cash Fastjet terminated operations in these countries on June 24 2014 and began solely focusing on Fastjet Tanzania.To fulfil his goal of having Fastjet become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline Winter wondered whether now was a good time to expand. Before analyzing his options he wanted to determine Fastjet’s financial position (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3).PROPOSED SOLUTIONSTo overcome Fastjet’s recent expansion challenges and financial losses Winter needed to decide whether to expand to Kenya develop a Fastjet base in Zambia or maintain the focus on domestic flights. When considering the options Winter would need to take into account how each option would align with Fastjet’s low-cost model and short-term goals and would position the airline company for long-term success.Option 1: Partnership in KenyaKenya was located north of Tanzania and had a population of 45 million. Kenya was known as Africa’s hub for financial communication and transportation services and had positive economic prospects with a gross domestic product of 4.7 per cent in 2013. As of 2014 1.2 million Kenyan passengers flew annually making Kenya the fifth-largest domestic market in Africa based on seat capacity. This information was promising for Fastjet which expected to increase air traffic by offering low-cost plane tickets to those who currently travelled long distances by bus.Jambojet Ltd. a subsidiary of Kenya Airways Ltd. had recently entered Kenya as a low-cost carrier and planned to focus solely on the domestic market. Winter saw this situation as an opportunity to access the Kenyan market by working with Jambojet Ltd. to offer connecting flights. Although this option meant Fastjet would not need to spend time developing the infrastructure for establishing a base Winter was concerned about the Kenyan government’s strong regulations in the airline industry and how Fastjet should respond.Option 2: Fastjet ZambiaZambia was located southwest of Tanzania and had a population of about 15 million. Compared with other African countries Zambia was economically and politically stable and imposed fewer airline regulations. Although Zambia had a smaller customer base Winter saw the country as offering a great opportunity for entering the market because it did not have a low-cost carrier. He had already been in discussions with the government which was supportive of Fastjet bringing low-cost flights to Zambia.To pursue this option Winter would need to purchase new planes. He was looking to source two A319 models between seven and nine years old which would cost US$40 million each. The Zambia hub would also require a US$5 million investment for marketing and development costs. The costs incurred during the first year would include salaries and wages of US$4.7 million and a fuel expense of US$1.5 million. Winter and his management team estimated that expanding to Zambia would bring in US$11.2 million in revenue in the first year.Expansion to Zambia would also require approval from South African authorities because South Africa was Zambia’s largest market accounting for 37 per cent of total international seat capacity. Although Winter had experience working with South Africa—during Fastjet’s launch in Tanzania—it had been a long and tedious process. He wanted this expansion to happen quickly and he feared he would encounter similar delays with Fastjet in Zambia. Winter wondered how he could leverage his existing relationships in South Africa to speed up the process. Winter was also concerned with the size of the market and whether it would offer enough demand to justify the costly investment in building a new base.Option 3: Focus on Growth in TanzaniaWinter wondered whether it was even a good time to expand to other countries. Although Fastjet had secured US$25 million from new investors he recognized that the group would ultimately need more capital from both institutional investors and local African partnerships to finance the expansions. Considering the 2013 profit margin for Fastjet Tanzania was around −90 per cent he wondered whether he should wait until Fastjet had positive returns before expanding elsewhere. Fastjet Tanzania had made great progress in gaining market share in Tanzania and Winter wanted to continue this growth. To stay ahead of its largest domestic competitor Precision Air Winter aimed to attract more first-time flyers and expand the airline’s market. This plan would include increasing the frequency of domestic flights and expanding domestic flight destinations. In addition he planned to improve domestic infrastructure by working with governments beginning with the Mtwara Airport in southwestern Tanzania. Investing back into the Tanzanian community would showcase strong corporate social responsibility and help Fastjet gain access to parts of Tanzania not currently serviced by air travel.

It had capacity for up to 300 people although at that time Qualtrics employed only about 60 people in Ireland. Plans for global expansion were aggressive—to grow the business by many multiples and to fill the office within three years. Ryan Smith the chief executive officer (CEO) of Qualtrics had travelled to Dublin for this event. During his visit he sought to discuss the approach to quickly building Qualtrics’s EMEA operations with Dermot Costello the recently hired managing director for Ireland. It was critical to decide on the company’s next steps. Company BackgroundThirteen years after it was launched Qualtrics a U.S. software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm based in Provo Utah was continuing to experience significant and exciting change. Established in 2002 Qualtrics initially focused on building sophisticated user-friendly online survey tools. After years of operating the company on little capital and steady growth in revenue and despite external economic effects including the U.S. financial crisis of 2007/08 Qualtrics’s expanded product offering experienced increasing traction in the market. At this time many cash-tight companies started to replace their costly market research contracts with cost-effective do-it-yourself online surveys. Seeing tremendous growth potential the founders brothers Ryan and Jared Smith together with their father Scott M. Smith and family friend Stuart Orgill took on US$70 million in venture capital funding in 2012 to spur growth. Qualtrics like many other digital platform companies had recognized a multibillion-dollar global opportunity that the founders were keen to capture. As a result of its continued success Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 to accelerate growth particularly in international markets. With the abundant opportunities that international markets presented Qualtrics’s management was excited but equally concerned about balanced and sustained growth. On the one side management was conscious of the economics of many software and online-service markets. In these markets the mantra was to prioritize firm growth over margins and cost structure—to “grow fast or die slow.” However the company was unwilling to accept that it needed to choose between aggressive growth and maintaining cash-flow positivity. Qualtrics was equally committed to both goals. At the same time Ryan was aware of the dangers of overly aggressive expansion after the company lived through the dot-com tech bubble of the early 2000s: We’ve seen companies “fuel the jet.” They put the gas line in the jet [secure major funding from venture capitalists] and they’re paying for the gas and they let it fly. Hopefully one day it’ll fly on its own and you can pull the gas line out. But if they got to hold the line out before that thing is ready to fly it all falls. We’ve seen that in the dot-com bubble. Indeed Qualtrics needed to make some difficult and far-reaching decisions regarding its international expansion especially in relation to its expansion in the EMEA region and the expansion of its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland. The company principals wanted to play their cards right by focusing on the most lucrative opportunities within the EMEA region. Also management including Costello was aware of the immense task ahead to quickly develop its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland from which most of its EMEA expansion would be driven and coordinated. industry backgroundThe versatility and disruptive nature of online survey software delivered as cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) enabled firms to compete and indeed disrupt different markets. An industry born within the digital age online survey software provided an electronic platform for survey development use and analysis for market research product testing and customer satisfaction. Qualtrics had chosen to focus on three markets: market research customer experience and employee insights (see Exhibit 1). The market research industry was fundamentally premised on enabling firms to acquire additional information and insights on their target market; consumer preferences for products or product innovations; and potential needs of firms’ existing or future customer base. On the other hand customer experience management related to the process by which firms developed an understanding of consumers’ perception of their product and/or service to build a more extended relationship with their consumer base including operationalizing responses to customer feedback. Finally employee insights allowed firms to gauge the level of engagement among their employees evaluate and review their performance and acquire insights into potential opportunities for growth and development. These three markets showed evidence of strong growth as firms sought to become more data-driven in their decision making by integrating technological methods to gather process and analyze data in a more comprehensive and instantaneous manner. Online methods of collecting data facilitated the capture of a broader respondent base than was feasible with existing manual methods especially as the digital revolution had led to a greater use of mobile devices to complete surveys online. Moreover all of these markets could be disrupted by new technologies as many of these tasks were traditionally performed by administrative functions or outsourced to expensive third-party providers. In this respect Ryan estimated that companies spent $30 billion annually on outsourcing research projects to consulting firms. Depending on the market Qualtrics faced different competitors. In one sense Qualtrics had no direct competitors because no other company offered the full suite of products that could bring together insights from multiple internal functions to deliver holistic business insights that cut across market research employee insights and customer experience. In another sense Qualtrics had many competitors because it was competing on three separate fronts: customer experience employee insights and market research. Although Qualtrics was aware of competitors its leadership was clear that they did not pay much attention to them and remained focused on forging their own road. growth of Qualtrics The roots of Qualtrics dated back to the 1990s when Scott M. Smith then a professor of marketing at Brigham Young University became passionate about using the Internet to speed up market research (see Exhibit 2). Ryan in his early twenties at the time started to work on developing his father’s idea in the basement of the family home. Their goal was simple: to make sophisticated research simple using an online survey product. In pursuit of this goal they crammed racks of servers into closets of their home resulting in frequent power outages until eventually they bought a generator on eBay and located it in their garden. The current management imagined that many candidates who were invited for an interview with Qualtrics in the early days of operation never appeared spooked by the odd-sounding instruction to walk around the house to the basement door. Despite their idiosyncratic office space by 2006 Qualtrics was generating $1.3 million in revenue with 15 staff while still working from the basement of the Smith home. These early years and the experience of working with little capital embedded a deep sense of frugality and “scrappiness” in the company. The Qualtrics ProductIn terms of its product the Qualtrics offering was renowned for its sophistication ease of use and functionality. Initially Qualtrics focused on a niche market—universities—which in many ways was a result of Scott Smith’s personal experience. This target market allowed Qualtrics to build a top-notch online survey product by responding to the preferences and functionality requirements of demanding users— academic researchers. Although universities remained an important segment for Qualtrics it now served the three markets outlined above: market research customer experience and employee insights. Its SaaS offering was positioned as an insights platform built around value propositions that helped businesses gather data that would enable better business decisions. Most of Qualtrics’s revenues came from business customers including such major companies as JetBlue GE Yahoo and healthcare.gov. Ryan the CEO of Qualtrics emphasized that the advantage of the company’s offering related to it being an easy-to-use platform that didn’t require significant training or support thereby enabling all users to gather valuable insights for their organizations. In addition one of his favourite selling points was the product’s capacity to provide rapid-response insights or “fast data” to inform companies’ decision making instead of an overreliance on backward-looking approaches such as “big data.” The strategy seemed to pay off. Qualtrics started to gain more traction in markets than its competitors and generated substantial growth in revenues. In 2015 Qualtrics had more than 7000 clients running an average of more than 2 million surveys a day on the platform and the company was cash-flow positive. Having focused primarily on its U.S. expansion Qualtrics opened additional offices in Washington DC (in 2014) and Dallas (in 2015). Qualtrics’s Organizational CultureQualtrics management believed that it had created a special organization. Its unique characteristics included its customer orientation and sales culture. The goal was to have everyone focused on the customer. For example during the early days of the company if a customer called for assistance and had to wait longer than three rings for the phone to be answered a red siren flashed and low-pitched bells rang in the office alerting the entire company to drop what they were doing to pick up the phone and help a customer. The workplace also had a distinctly casual atmosphere where employees wandered around in jeans and T-shirts and employees described the organization as “fun” “energizing” and “stylishly nerdy.” At the same time Qualtrics was extremely results-driven with a heads-down hard-working approach. Ryan was a great believer in radical transparency and ensured that vast information on critical decisions and day-to-day operations were accessible to everyone within the organization. This transparency included for example visibility of employee performance allowing staff to approach top performers to learn from their expertise. On the Qualtrics intranet available to any company employee each team and department listed its quarterly goals; and each individual from the CEO to the newest intern listed their weekly activities and reported on how they had done the previous week. Hiring talented people with a tight person-organization fit was critical to Qualtrics management to ensure a high level of brainpower was available within the organization to work out any business challenge or problem. Although Ryan was not concerned about the culture of Qualtrics changing as the firm expanded he wanted to ensure that every decision made within the company bettered the organization. Given the rapidness of change in the technology industry Ryan also knew that Qualtrics needed to remain entrepreneurial and innovative: “We were successful in the basement we built a profitable company that’s valued over a billion dollars. . . . But we know that none of that’s going to matter anymore. How are we going to compete in the future? Our business is really like many start-ups in a row.” As Qualtrics focused on international expansion embedding entrepreneurship in its international offices to the same degree as it was part of the culture at the headquarters in Utah was integral to delivering on its long-term vision. Qualtrics’s Sales ModelThe heart of Qualtrics was its engineering and development department where new products were innovated. In addition Qualtrics had developed a large high-performing and proactive sales organization that was responsible for much of the company’s progress thus far. Indeed management believed that Qualtrics succeeded first and foremost because of a great product and an unparalleled sales force. Qualtrics largely used an inside-sales model whereby salespeople located in the organization’s offices engaged remotely with the customers over the phone. This cost-effective approach originated out of necessity during the early years of Qualtrics when there were insufficient funds for travelling to meet with customers face to face. Although Qualtrics had an effective inside-sales machine and trained young motivated graduates into their sales roles the reliance on an inside-sales model could face limitations when dealing with large businesses for high-value and more complex enterprise deals where personal interactions were critical to closing deals. Qualtrics management was also aware that many competitors invested in hiring seasoned field sales executives and that its inside-sales model might need adaptation when serving international markets on a larger scale and with greater geographic scope.Qualtrics FundingIn 2006 Qualtrics moved into a more conventional office space in Provo. In light of steady revenue growth Ryan convinced his brother Jared to join the company in 2009 to oversee the engineering and product efforts. It wasn’t an easy task as it required Jared acclaimed to be one of the elite engineers in Silicon Valley to quit a senior high-powered job at Google where he had previously helped in setting up the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. Jared had for example worked for several years in Beijing to help run the Google China office. During this period Ryan also warmed to the idea of seeking venture capital funding to support Qualtrics’s next growth phase. Pursuing venture capital funding was a far-reaching decision for the four founders who had treated their equity as gold and strongly preferred to maintain their financial and operational independence. Moreover as the company was not necessarily in need of cash this decision altered its approach to seeking investment. In fact Qualtrics was in such a strong position that it had its choice of experienced investors who would act as a sounding board for major decisions. In 2012 Qualtrics signed a deal with Accel Partner’s Ryan Sweeney (whom Ryan Smith had known for three years) and Sequoia Capital’s Bryan Schreier (whom Jared had known for seven years and was part of the team that had set up and scaled Google’s EMEA operations). Both Ryan Sweeney and Schreier became Qualtrics board members. The two venture capital firms offered to invest $100 million but Qualtrics ultimately decided to scale it back to $70 million. To further accelerate growth Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 led by Insight Venture Partners Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital. This deal valued Qualtrics at more than $1 billion. Rapid international expansion Ryan had a strong vision of Qualtrics becoming a global firm. However in 2013 only 3 per cent of revenues came from outside the United States with 10 per cent of Qualtrics customers located in Europe. Before Qualtrics expanded to Europe multilingual sales reps would work European hours in the Provo headquarters starting their sales duties early in the morning to bridge the time zone differences between the United States and Europe. This model followed Qualtrics’s philosophy of “nail it then scale it” so when the decision was made to expand internationally there was already a strong base group of customers and referrals ready to go. Initially Qualtrics opened a small office in Dublin in fall 2013. Dublin was an attractive location for Qualtrics because of the city’s technology ecosystem the availability of a multilingual and well-educated workforce and its proven track record as an EMEA regional headquarters location for technology firms such as Google Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter. Believing in the “nail it then scale it” model the Dublin office initially served as an experiment with one person working from the cheapest office that Qualtrics could find to prove the potential in the EMEA market. Around this time Costello a seasoned executive experienced in developing regional operations for software firms was hired to oversee this expansion. Similarly John D’Agostino an experienced executive in growing and leading international sales operations was hired as executive vice president of Global Sales at headquarters. The Dublin office quickly grew so much so that it ran out of space! In May 2015 about 20 months after first locating to Dublin Qualtrics Dublin moved into a large office in a prime city centre location.  At this time Qualtrics employed 700 people most of them at the Provo headquarters and had 60 people working in the Dublin offices. Both the Provo and Dublin offices were ready to scale up: wide expanses of open floor space were ready to be filled with new hires. The Dublin office had capacity for 300 employees. Although Dublin was thus far the only international Qualtrics office Qualtrics management saw opportunities beyond the EMEA region. One of its next moves for example was to set up an office in Sydney Australia. At this time Ryan mentioned: “I feel we’re only 10% of where we can go” and it was his intention to “go big.” Qualtrics was in “hyper-growth mode” and ready to scale and grow aggressively internationally. Ryan and Costello weren’t interested in cautious and slow international growth typical for many other firms. Rather they wanted to capture the potential illustrated by the Dublin office and internationalize across the EMEA region at a highly accelerated pace. It was their target for EMEA to generate 30 per cent of total revenue in five years which would require a yearly growth by many multiples. Ryan was committed to taking a “big bet.”The Next StepsIt was now Costello’s task to deliver on these bullish targets for the EMEA region and he knew that a clever approach was needed to achieve these goals. A couple of decisions had to be made. By May 2015 the Dublin office performed sales (mostly inside sales and field sales) and support activities and it relied on the U.S. headquarters to supply the other value chain activities such as product engineering localization marketing and financial/legal undertakings. However it seemed that the existing structure could quickly become inadequate. To support such a significant EMEA business a largely self-sufficient European business would be required whereby Dublin was the hub with satellite offices in selected countries across the region. This model raised the question of which value chain functions Costello should prioritize in developing and the optimal time for building out these functions. For example although Qualtrics had started to localize its software for some European markets as expansion broadened more country-localized versions needed to be added. Doing so involved not only translation challenges but also technical adjustments. For example within the online platform tailoring the system to a European audience required specific additions such as ensuring the appropriate punctuations for decimal-denominated numbers and Microsoft Excel integrations. Within the current model such localization requests needed to be sent to headquarters as was the case for marketing legal and finance support. Given the growth of the business in EMEA these requests became more frequent. Dublin time was seven hours ahead of the time in Provo Utah thereby requiring extensive efforts to manage the time zone differences. Another activity was recruitment which was currently handled by a local external provider. However given the importance of recruiting the appropriate talent (and much of it in a short time period) questions arose about whether this hiring should be performed in-house. Yet doing so would require significant investment and diverting resources from building out the sales team which was ultimately the key driver for revenue generation. Questions also surrounded the scalability of an intense on-boarding program that often saw new hires spending some time in the Provo offices. Also when setting up the EMEA headquarters Qualtrics saw the value in experimenting with different country markets using small-scale efforts initially to gauge the receptiveness of various country markets to its offering. Costello and his team also had a feeling that large markets and countries that were early adopters of technology would be high-potential opportunities. They noticed that the EMEA market was generally receptive; however certain countries seemed to be easier to crack than others and Qualtrics saw early wins from its initial efforts. In addition certain countries were sensitive about data security and showed some reservation toward SaaS offerings while customers in other countries were price-sensitive and hesitant to pay price premiums. To effectively allocate resources a more selective approach was required that prioritized certain markets. This approach would allow Costello to focus resources and build sales and support teams for countries that showed the greatest potential. The issue was how to prioritize this approach to ensure the most lucrative markets were selected first (see Exhibit 3 for a list of some countries and indicators). Also certain urban areas such as London (United Kingdom) seemed particularly attractive given some significant customer wins and the presence of many large firms within a tight geographic radius. Decisions also needed to be made in relation to the company’s go-to-market approach. For example in Eastern European markets the Qualtrics pricing model positioned in the middle to upper market was perceived by many companies as uncompetitive leading to questions of adaptation. Moreover if Qualtrics envisioned larger and more complex deals with enterprise customers would it be sufficient to rely mostly on a young inside sales team or would it be worthwhile to hire more seasoned sales reps and open offices across Europe to avoid time-consuming travel between Dublin and the European locations? Last but not least retaining the entrepreneurial culture was paramount including in particular the entrepreneurial “scrappiness” and “self-service” culture that was at the heart of Qualtrics. Yet transitioning toward a multinational corporation would increase not only the scale of the business but also its internal complexity which could hamper the flexibility nimbleness and agility needed to continuously recognize and exploit opportunities. This internal complexity also raised the question of how these entrepreneurial cultural values could be deeply embedded within a rapidly growing EMEA business where structures and processes needed to be developed to grow the business and integrate a considerable number of new hires.As Ryan and Costello celebrated the opening of their new office in Dublin Costello was highly cognizant that he needed to quickly decide on and execute Qualtrics’s next steps to pave the way for delivering on the ambitious growth targets for the EMEA region.Exhibit 1: Qualtrics’s target markets Source: “Customer Experience” Qualtrics 2016 accessed January 15 2017 https://www.qualtrics.com/customer-experience/.Exhibit 2: Qualtrics’S national and international expansion Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: Country indicators for qualtrics’s expansion plans (2014)Note: GDP = gross domestic product; SaaS = software as a service; unless otherwise indicated the information indicated for this sub-region refers to the average of the included countries.Source: Created by the authors using: “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD; “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG; Doing Business Understanding Regulations for Small and Medium Enterprises (Washington D.C.: World Bank) 2013 accessed January 15 2017 www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2014; “Travel Math Calculator” Travel Math accessed January 15 2017 www.travelmath.com/; information provided by Qualtrics management.Endnotes,17,"[{""start"":1037,""end"":1051,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1289,""end"":1299,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2383,""end"":2388,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2368,""end"":2372,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3420,""end"":3424,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6487,""end"":6491,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7504,""end"":7508,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9380,""end"":9384,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11165,""end"":11169,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11976,""end"":11980,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12208,""end"":12212,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14233,""end"":14237,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14727,""end"":14731,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15356,""end"":15360,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15375,""end"":15385,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15572,""end"":15576,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15993,""end"":15997,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18273,""end"":18277,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18465,""end"":18469,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18864,""end"":18868,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23922,""end"":23926,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2425,""end"":2430,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7352,""end"":7357,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8310,""end"":8315,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1364,""end"":1370,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4409,""end"":4423,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4146,""end"":4160,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16678,""end"":16684,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16699,""end"":16705,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17041,""end"":17047,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17536,""end"":17542,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17652,""end"":17658,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17669,""end"":17675,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17851,""end"":17857,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17886,""end"":17892,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18637,""end"":18643,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19126,""end"":19132,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19577,""end"":19583,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23155,""end"":23161,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23986,""end"":23992,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1155,""end"":1162,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1548,""end"":1555,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1404,""end"":1406,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":24028,""end"":24030,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

The fish pond held a special significance for the company. The water in the pond was from the water treatment plant of the manufacturing facility and the healthy colourful fish that swam in it served as visual reminders of Asahi Kasei’s corporate philosophy which was based on corporate responsibility and the creation of shared value for all stakeholders. The plant had the distinction of being the only facility in the world to manufacture a type of cellulosic fibre called cupro. Cellulosic fibres were often used as a low-cost alternative to silk. Cupro yarn was a superior quality cellulosic fibre made using the cuprammonium process. Cupro’s unique properties distinguished it from the more common viscose rayon and made it a useful fibre for producing clothing garments especially women’s traditional Indian garments (see Exhibit 1).While Asahi Kasei had various product lines cupro fibre had a special place among them. This was due not only to cupro fibre’s long history dating back to 1931 and Asahi Kasei’s status as the world’s only producer of cupro fibre but also to its unique value chain which included several small and medium-sized enterprises in India. Kamiyama started his career in the cupro division in 1990. After a stint with another division in Taiwan during which time he acquired an executive master of business administration degree he was back as general manager of the cupro division handling the Indian market. In 2014 Asahi Kasei expanded the capacity of its cupro plant in view of the market potential in India. However in 2015 the entry of finer variants of viscose rayon increased the competitive pressure in the market. During 2016 one of Kamiyama’s important goals was to address this challenge but he would not stop there. He also had to help the company achieve its goal of building an even more inclusive value chain in India. He wondered if the two goals were indeed compatible.Asahi KaseiAsahi Kasei a diversified company was established in Japan in 1922 by Shitagau Noguchi. The manufacture of cupro yarn was one of its earliest lines of activity. Since then the company continued to grow and diversify and in 2015 it had a total turnover of US$17.2 billion from operations in fibres and textiles chemicals electronics home and construction materials pharmaceuticals and medical devices.Asahi Kasei set up a corporate social responsibility (CSR) department in 2006 though it had been pursuing many CSR-like activities since 1976. The company was guided by its mission of “contributing to life and living for people around the world” and several CSR activities were embedded into the business practice. The four broad CSR areas were compliance responsible care (including environmental protection and safety) corporate citizenship and respect for employee individuality. Philanthropic activities were also undertaken by its international subsidiaries in Thailand Korea Taiwan China and India.Cupro fibre was a product of Asahi Kasei’s fibres and textiles strategic business unit (SBU). The unit’s other products were non-woven fabric spandex fibre and nylon yarn for automotive applications. Of the SBU’s total sales of $1.3 billion in 2016 cupro accounted for approximately 20 per cent. Cupro Fabric Production Value ChainThe technology to manufacture cupro fibre was originally developed in Germany in 1897 and was imported by Asahi Kasei in 1928. The fibre was used to manufacture unusually soft moisture-absorbent textile that was comfortable to wear throughout the year.The reason why Asahi Kasei was the only manufacturer of cupro in the world was because the manufacturing process resulted in waste water that contained copper. All of the other plants around the world had eventually discontinued operations due to their inability to meet environmental regulations. Asahi Kasei however had invested heavily in research and development and developed a process to reduce the copper content to only half of the level permitted by the stringent regulations in Japan. Thus it could continue cupro production (see Exhibit 2). In fact there was currently a research project in progress to further reduce the copper content of the waste water. Though the copper content was already at half of the permitted levels Asahi Kasei continued to develop processing technologies to bring it down to one-tenth of the permitted level with the ultimate goal of producing zero emissions.The main raw material in the production of cupro was cotton linter which was imported primarily from India North America and South America. Cotton linter was the short soft fibre surrounding cotton seeds. The process of extracting linter called “delinting” involved thoroughly cleaning cotton seeds and then separating the fibre from the seed. The linter was processed chemically to produce yarn with properties distinct from those of cotton. Ninety per cent of the yarn produced was filament yarn and the balance was staple yarn. One-third of the yarn was sold domestically in Japan; another third was sold in the Indian market; and the rest was sold in Europe China and other countries. In some markets the yarn was dyed and then woven; in other markets the yarn was first woven and dyed later. After weaving and dyeing the fabric was sold in wholesale markets or to large manufacturers of ready-made clothes. In some very small-volume businesses a third method called “piece dyeing” was used in which garments were sewn and then dyed.Cupro partnerships in India Asahi Kasei began selling cupro yarn in India in 1976 when the government of India allowed its import under the Open General License even though a burden of 100-per-cent import tax existed at that time. Its first sale of cupro yarn of 100 metric tons (MT) was made to a weaving unit in Surat an important textile centre in the state of Gujarat. An engineer from Japan had to subsequently visit Surat to guide the weavers on handling the delicate yarn. Even in 2016 98 per cent of the yarn exported to India was sold to weavers in Surat. These weavers sold the grey fabric to local fabric wholesalers and distributors who in turn sent the fabric to dyeing factories (see Exhibit 3). The wholesalers then sold the dyed rolls of cloth made from cupro yarn to designers and apparel companies to make traditional Indian clothes for women such as saris and dupattas (a kind of scarf worn as part of the Punjabi salwar kameez outfit). In 2016 the president of the fibres and textiles SBU Toshio Takanashi used the phrase “40 years of miracles” to describe Asahi Kasei’s long relationship with weavers in Surat. The partnership had continued despite challenges such as the Indian foreign exchange crisis in 1991.Asahi Kasei’s technical knowledge transfer to its Indian partners was an ongoing activity. Even in 2016 for instance some dyers faced problems with dyeing quality. When Asahi Kasei explored the prospect of selling to another important textile centre Varanasi in northern India some weavers faced problems such as yarn breakage. Asahi Kasei decided to send its technicians from Japan to help resolve the issues faced by the weavers and dyers.In 2012 the company’s partnerships in India were expanded to include a contract with a cotton ginning unit in Maharashtra for the regular supply of raw material—cotton linter. Previously the unit had only processed cotton and extracted oil from cotton seeds. The supply of cotton linter resulted in additional revenue which in 2015 accounted for 10 per cent of Asahi Kasei’s $18-million turnover. Asahi Kasei provided the unit with delinting machines worth $5 million in return for an exclusive bi-monthly supply of cotton linter. Initially the quality of cotton linter supplied by the unit in Maharashtra was very poor and did not meet the requirements of the Japanese factory. Engineers from Japan worked closely with the unit so that it could progressively reduce the level of contamination in the cotton linter and deliver better quality.Asahi Kasei officials regularly visited retailers to understand the latest fashion trends which ultimately determined the demand for different types of yarn. Realizing the need to make fashion designers in India aware of cupro and its unique features Asahi Kasei started collaborating with the National Institute of Design Ahmedabad and the National Institute of Fashion Technology Mumbai. By conducting lectures and seminars Asahi Kasei officials educated upcoming designers and apparel producers about how cupro fabric could add value to the garments they designed. The company also sponsored two students to visit Japan and intern at Asahi Kasei’s cupro plant.As a yarn manufacturer Asahi Kasei focused not only on the next stage in the value chain namely weaving but also on the entire value chain; it was aware that to build demand for cupro it needed to develop awareness in the entire ecosystem. This strategy led to increased sales of cupro fibre in the Indian market and increased India’s importance as a market relative to other countries (see Exhibits 4 and 5).Inclusive Value ChainWhile Asahi Kasei’s initial foray into India was motivated solely by market expansion considerations over time as India began to play an important role at both ends of the value chain the company also started considering the development implications of its activities in the country directly and indirectly. Besides contributing to child labour eradication efforts in India and ensuring that the cotton farmers were paid fair prices for corron linter. Asahi Kasei started focusing on making its value chain in India as inclusive as possible (see Exhibit 6). The company had already had some achievements in this regard. Since cotton linter was obtained from a part of the cotton plant that was previously thrown away Asahi Kasei’s fair-price purchases of cotton linter provided a welcome boost to local farmers’ incomes. By 2015 approximately 270000 farmers had benefited from this initiative and it was estimated that by 2020 approximately 390000 farmers would indirectly benefit. By bringing in experts in modern delinting weaving and dyeing technologies the company helped train factory employees to use these technologies and techniques. Asahi Kasei also provided training and internships to students studying textiles and design thus contributing to improving skill levels among the youth in India. By the end of 2015 it had partnered with 60 weaving and three dyeing factories and achieved sales of 4300 MT. By 2020 Asahi Kasei aimed to sell 6000 MT to 80 weaving and 10 dyeing units.In 2016 Asahi Kasei joined the “Business Call to Action” a global initiative promoted by the United Nations Development Programme and various donor governments and development agencies. The initiative challenged companies to advance core business activities inclusive of poor populations and to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Asahi Kasei committed to enhance the skills and productivity of 5240 employees in the cupro fibre industry to invest $40000 in developing the capacity of 700 young people (75 per cent women) between 2016 and 2020 and to increase the production efficiency of 97 small- and medium-scale delinting weaving and dyeing units.Outlook for cupro in IndiaIn June 2014 Asahi Kasei invested approximately $29 million in a new cupro production facility which increased its total capacity by 1000 MT (to 16000 MT). This capacity expansion was said to be the first new fibre production facility in 27 years in Japan. Further expansion of capacity to 18000 MT by 2018 was in progress. These investments were made in view of the Indian market potential as the domestic market was shrinking.While sales of cupro to India had been growing since 2010 in 2015 the product started to face intense price competition from viscose rayon fibre a fibre of a similar genre. In the past viscose rayon manufactured in India had been much more coarse than cupro. Now however it was available in finer variants which competed with it more directly. Cupro fibre offered advantages in terms of the drape of the fabric and being more suitable for embroidery and other embellishments. The manufacture of cupro was also considered better than the manufacture of viscose fibre in terms of the safety of workers and the impact on the environment due to its use of ammonia rather than carbon disulphide. However viscose rayon was 20 per cent cheaper and in a highly price-conscious market like India price was a significant factor. In addition the retail customer who bought fabric made with cupro yarn often did not know that it contained cupro because it was not always disclosed on the tag. Moreover customers were usually unaware of the unique qualities and environmental advantages of cupro compared to viscose rayon.Some segments of the ready-made market such as the designer segment were relatively price inelastic and were more likely to appreciate the superior nature of the cupro fabric. Asahi Kasei began discussions with leading Indian designers working with labels such as Anita Dongre to supply them with cupro fabric. Some designers responded positively but others were concerned that parts of the fabric value chain such as the dyeing units were not producing consistent quality. This was because dyeing was done in small dyeing houses that lacked adequate quality control; also these units found dyeing cupro fabric to be especially challenging compared to other kinds of fabric.Next StepsKamiyama considered various courses of action that could be implemented to help address the quality issues arising in the fabric dyeing process. He also pondered how to increase awareness about cupro among retail customers. Only if awareness was created about cupro could the company tap into growing niche markets in India such as segments that were highly quality-conscious or that were very concerned about the environment. But merely creating product awareness would not be sufficient; at retail outlets customers wanting to buy the fabric should be able to easily identify it. As Kamiyama wandered away from the Koi pond he thought about how to increase the sales of cupro in India.Exhibit 1: Cupro fibreCupro fibre was roughly three times more expensive than cotton yarn as the cloth woven from it had several features that made it unique:Cupro fabric had a soft and smooth surface.Its moisture absorption was better than other synthetic fibres even cotton.Various properties helped moderate the temperature inside the garment making the fabric comfortable to wear year-round.The manufacture of cupro fibre offered some advantages from an environmental perspective:Cupro was made by processing cotton linter a waste product obtained from cotton seeds before they were crushed for oil extraction.Production facilities were certified to meet both ISO 14001 and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements. ISO 14001 referred to a general set of standards regarding environmental management. Oeko-Tex Standard 100 was an environmental standard specific to the textile industry.Fibre was biodegradable.Uses of cupro:Cupro fabric was used for a lining material by premium European brands such as Gucci and Canali and for making innerwear by leading brands such as Uniqlo Wacoal and Gunze. It was also used to make socks sportswear and leggings.Cupro fabric was used selectively by leading brands such as Prada and Burberry for some garment designs. In India it was used for making traditional garments such as saris and dupattas.In Japan it was used to make fillings for cushions and futons. Staple yarn was used in the manufacture of quilts.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Asahi Kasei Cupro Plant at Nobeoka JapanSource: Photo taken by the authors with company’s permission.Exhibit 3: Weaving and Dyeing Units at Surat and Varanasi IndiaSource: Photos taken by the authors with company’s permission.EXHIBIT 4: CuPRO NET SALES TO INDIA (IN metric TONnes)Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.Exhibit 5: Sales Volume of cupro yarn by country (in METRIC tonneS)Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.Exhibit 6: Asahi Kasei’s plans to build an inclusive cupro value chain in IndiaSource: Company documents.,18,"[{""start"":1075,""end"":1082,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1085,""end"":1091,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":923,""end"":940,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2264,""end"":2272,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2767,""end"":2777,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14569,""end"":14577,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15154,""end"":15162,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5097,""end"":5102,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3075,""end"":3080,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6086,""end"":6091,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6935,""end"":6940,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8154,""end"":8159,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8912,""end"":8917,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":9677,""end"":9682,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12598,""end"":12603,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16593,""end"":16598,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16775,""end"":16780,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2387,""end"":2389,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2453,""end"":2455,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2853,""end"":2855,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2959,""end"":2961,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

As part of its sustainability agenda Standard Chartered had launched a community project in 2012 called Silver Lining which aimed to support elderly Singaporeans in meeting their financial and health care needs.Five years later Singapore’s social and community landscape had changed significantly and it was time to review the impact of Silver Lining. As the head of community engagement and sustainability Winnie Tan was responsible for ensuring that Standard Chartered was at the forefront of corporate giving. She sought to strengthen Standard Chartered’s outreach and effectiveness in order to balance generating growth and returns with minimizing negative effects on the environment health and safety of the local community. How could Silver Lining evolve to remain locally relevant? How could Standard Chartered rationalize the need for continual funding for community investment? STANDARD CHARTEREDStandard Chartered was part of an international banking group with more than 84000 employees and 150 years of history in the world’s most dynamic markets. The group derived the majority of its income and profits from Asia Africa and the Middle East which also represented some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Standard Chartered opened its first Singapore branch in 1859 and in October 1999 was one of the first international banks in the country to receive a qualifying full bank license.The bank offered a full suite of services for retail and small and medium-sized enterprise clients; these services included deposit taking wealth management services overdrafts personal loans credit cards auto financing and mortgages. The bank offered corporate and institutional clients services in trade finance cash management lending securities foreign exchange debt capital markets and corporate finance. The bank also provided private banking services through its private banking division. Standard Chartered’s brand promise “Here for Good” underpinned the organization’s commitment to ensuring the sustainable growth of the markets and communities in which it operated.STANDARD CHARTERED’S COMMUNITY INVESTMENT EFFORTSStandard Chartered’s purpose statement “Driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity” set the tone for the bank operations which aimed to create long-term value for its shareholders and society. The bank’s community investment strategy had two priorities: global sustainability and community investment. Global sustainability in youth health and education guided the bank’s worldwide community investment efforts. For instance its flagship charity Seeing is Believing was focused on treating or preventing avoidable blindness unlocking new opportunities and bringing economic and social benefits to communities. The Singapore office was a key fundraiser in this global initiative (see Exhibit 1). The bank’s community investment projects needed to be locally effective and relevant. This was important as the bank’s footprint covered vastly diverse communities across Asia Africa and the Middle East. The bank took on various initiatives to encourage its employees’ active engagement and contributions to local communities. For instance every Standard Chartered employee was entitled to three days of employee volunteering (EV) leave which was recorded (and therefore auditable) on the company’s human resource system. The company intranet hosted EV schedules best practices and a support network to catalyze employee-led initiatives. Top managers actively participated in all facets of the program and key project leaders in the workforce were also recognized as part of their annual reviews. This naturally led to a successful employee engagement program which enabled team bonding within and across various business and support functions. In 2016 Standard Chartered saw its employees devote 3605.5 volunteer days to support the local community—a 12-fold increase over 2007 when 290 volunteer days were recorded.Standard Chartered used a partnership model for all of its community initiatives as it recognized both its own areas of strength and those areas where it needed support from partners. As a financial institution the bank was an inherently good risk manager and governance steward. However it lacked the operational knowledge and the understanding of social and community issues at the grassroots level that were needed for community project implementation. Employee volunteering was a key tenet of the bank’s sustainability agenda; volunteers were full-time employees who applied their time experience and expertise to causes they were passionate about. Hence partnerships with the right social service organizations were critical elements of success. The bank was able to rally fundraising from key stakeholders who could support the projects.Singapore: The Local CommunitySingapore had experienced rapid growth over the past few decades developing into a city state with a high literacy rate and a good standard of living. However the rapid development and population expansion had not come without a cost. While an open foreign labour policy had initially contributed to growth in Singapore’s productivity it had also led to an increasingly competitive job market a greater strain on public resources and an inflated housing market. Furthermore due to the high cost of living couples were less willing to have children and fertility rates continued to decline despite the Singapore government’s incentives to encourage childbirth. Over the past few decades Singapore’s fertility rate had declined rapidly and stood at 1.16 births per female in 2017. The combination of a declining fertility rate and increasing average life expectancy due to advancements in health care meant that Singapore faced the pressing issue of an aging population. The proportion of Singaporeans aged 65 and above was set to increase significantly from almost half a million in 2016 to approximately 900000 people by 2030—around 20 per cent of the estimated population. By 2018 the number of Singaporeans aged 65 and above would be equal to the number of youths aged 15 and below. In addition the country’s resident old-age support ratio showed a generally decreasing trend of about 30 per cent from 7.4 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2017. A shrinking workforce and increasing costs for seniors’ health care could pose risks to Singapore’s economic development. SILVER LININGThe LaunchFollowing its incorporation in Singapore in 2012 Standard Chartered recognized the critical implications of an aging population in Singapore and shaped its community investment to focus on the theme of health specifically health for the local elderly population aged 65 and older (see Exhibit 2). The Silver Lining project comprised various fundraising and community engagement initiatives that supported elderly Singaporeans especially those living alone and with household incomes of less than SGD1500. Key initiatives under the project included improving the quality of these seniors’ lives by providing medical care daily necessities and food rations.The initial launch of Silver Lining focused on providing financial support and making health care accessible for the elderly population. However at the time of the launch not many corporations were addressing issues related to the aging population in Singapore and there was no existing approach that Standard Chartered could use as a point of reference. To ensure that the project was a success Standard Chartered partnered with organizations with relevant expertise and knowledge in order to leverage their complementary strengths. Such partnerships allowed Standard Chartered to carry out various initiatives to touch the lives of the elderly community; these included festive celebrations befriending sessions food distribution home refurbishment projects and health care support (see Exhibit 3).effects and SuccessesFrom 2012 to 2017 Standard Chartered invested over SGD1 million and involved over 5000 employee volunteers to reach out to elderly people in Singapore. By 2017 Silver Lining had touched the lives of more than 8000 seniors and Standard Chartered had received two awards (Corporate Platinum and Gold) from the social services agency Community Chest the fundraising and engagement arm of the National Council of Social Service that engaged the community through volunteer work and social service programs. Providing critical medical services medical screenings and food rations for the needy were some of the direct outreach initiatives the bank had undertaken in partnership with local voluntary welfare organizations. A participant in the Stepping Out into Active Life program at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)—someone who suffered from heart problems asthma arthritis and hypertension—commented that the program had helped her to stay fit as it ensured that she was doing her exercise every day.The employee volunteering element in Silver Lining also helped Standard Chartered deepen employee relationships and instill a community-giving spirit among employees. Standard Chartered saw improvements in employee retention and camaraderie as employees had a shared sense of purpose and derived fulfillment through these activities. The bank increasingly saw projects that were initiated from the ground up by employees themselves and this was a distinctive element of the bank’s community initiatives. Standard Chartered also gained intangible benefits such as a strengthened reputation as a firm that was committed to corporate giving. As the public became increasingly conscious of corporate community investment efforts Standard Chartered’s social causes resonated well with the community.Overcoming Past ChallengesChoosing the Right PartnersOne notable partnership success was Standard Chartered’s partnership in 2012 with TTSH. The TTSH and Standard Chartered Stepping Out into Active Life partnership benefited more than 1200 elderly people and involved more than 1500 Standard Chartered volunteers over a span of three years (see Exhibit 3). TTSH which provided holistic and integrated patient care already had programs for seniors in place and had a wealth of experience and knowledge about caring for seniors and operating initiatives related to their needs. The financial and human resources Standard Chartered provided enabled the program to reach out to a larger group of elderly people.Encouraging and Educating VolunteersTan knew that the success of Silver Lining required the support of both the organizations and employee volunteers. Although the number of volunteer sign-ups across the organization had increased some employees needed to be encouraged to consider volunteering with the elderly as they were concerned about communication barriers and a lack of common interests. The younger generation in Singapore was not as comfortable conversing in Chinese dialects and this created a communication barrier for some elderly people who were only comfortable conversing in dialects. Standard Chartered sought to overcome these challenges by conducting orientation workshops where employee volunteers were given tips on communicating with and caring for seniors especially those with disabilities. Standard Chartered also developed a dialect translation mobile application (app) in 2014 to help volunteers communicate and build a rapport with the elderly participants. The app which was also available for public use contained common phrases for various dialects grouped into five key categories: greetings conversation food health and recreation. Silver Lining at a Crossroad2015 was a watershed year: the Singapore government and other organizations introduced initiatives such as the Pioneer Generation Package and the Silver Support Scheme. These provided the elderly population in Singapore with comprehensive health care benefits at a national level (see Exhibits 4 and 5). The Singapore government also committed SGD3 billion to promoting successful aging by improving social and health care infrastructure. As health care supports for the elderly became institutionalized Silver Lining needed to re-evaluate the way it operated so that it could continue to offer meaningful services. Standard Chartered was at a strategic crossroads and had to address three key issues.KEY ISSUESAn Increasing Number of Elderly with Mental Health IssuesAs the population in Singapore began to age a worrying trend that emerged was the increasing number of elderly people with poor mental health. Mental health as defined by the World Health Organization was “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential can cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and is able to contribute to her or his community.” Tan noted that one of the main causes of poor mental health was increased social and emotional isolation among the elderly especially those who lived alone. Statistics showed that in severe cases some elderly people even resorted to taking their own lives. In 2014 126 seniors aged 60 and above committed suicide—an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2000. Although the rising trend of mental health issues among the elderly was pertinent most organizations did not actively target it as they deemed it too complex. Despite their enormous impact on the affected persons and their caregivers mental health issues were difficult to diagnose and it required a great deal of financial and human resources to provide care and services for these people. Tan recognized that this was an opportunity for Silver Lining to channel its resources to this underserved segment while staying aligned with its main objective of supporting the elderly. Tan sought to leverage the expertise of a partner who would be well-versed in supporting socially isolated elderly clients. To maximize the effects of the project with limited resources Standard Chartered decided to focus its efforts on constituencies that had a significant proportion of senior residents. Other factors it took into consideration included the density of the elderly population and the average household income of different geographic areas in Singapore.Building Thought LeadershipAnother option Tan explored was the notion of building thought leadership. As part of its existing commitment to sustainability Standard Chartered had joined Company of Good (CoG) in 2015. CoG was a platform under the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre that sought to empower businesses to give better and more holistically through a “4 I” framework that emphasized investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 6). CoG’s platform had a far-reaching effect on organizations and had developed a network of over 200 members since its inception in May 2015. In addition to empowering companies it helped organizations to collaborate and tap into each other’s highly diverse areas of expertise—which ranged from financial services to food and beverages—to achieve a greater combined impact. This presented a huge opportunity for Tan who had planned to contribute to leadership and mentorship in the CoG member community. By leveraging CoG’s network to share Standard Chartered’s best practices and frameworks she sought to inspire and assist other companies in contributing to the local community. For instance Tan could share how Standard Chartered had managed to build a strong employee volunteer culture through company policies and strong support from the management.Achieving a Multiplier EffectAs Singapore’s economy flourished the number and complexity of issues faced by the aging population also increased. It was clear that the efforts of a single organization were insufficient to bring about a significant change. Thus Tan sought to rally the resources of multiple organizations with similar community engagement objectives to maximize the effects of a combined effort.One project in particular caught Tan’s eye. Samsui Supplies and Services (Samsui Supplies) a subsidiary of Soup Restaurant Group Limited and a member of CoG had used its expertise in the food and beverage industry to run a sustainable food delivery program that could provide up to 1.8 million meals per year to beneficiaries. The elderly population was a sizeable proportion of these target beneficiaries. Standard Chartered considered investing in Samsui Supplies’ central kitchen which was located in Changi Prison. The kitchen—part of Samsui Supplies’ food delivery program—engaged 30 inmates who would prepare up to 6000 meals per day for distribution to nursing homes and volunteer welfare organizations. The inmates who were selected by the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises and Samsui Supplies were provided with culinary training that equipped them with skills required for integration back into society. If Standard Chartered took on this investment this tripartite collaboration could make use of the partners’ respective strengths and resources to deliver a sustainable long-term benefit to the local community. By investing in a social enterprise project and bringing it to scale quickly to maximize its benefit Standard Chartered would be able to meet the objectives of Silver Lining and create a win–win situation for all parties involved.MOVING FORWARDAs of January 2018 developing Silver Lining so that it remained relevant was still an ongoing process in terms of both business rationale and social needs. Tan needed to uphold Standard Chartered’s strong reputation and growth while doing good; she understood the delicate balance between effectiveness and resources and she sought to justify the firm’s community investment efforts. What should Standard Chartered continue to do that would provide the greatest benefit to its various stakeholders? What measures could be taken to encourage more organizations to partner with Standard Chartered to enhance the Silver Lining project?EXHIBIT 1: SEEING IS BELIEVINGSeeing is Believing was Standard Chartered Bank’s flagship global community investment program to tackle avoidable blindness.Standard Chartered Bank had for more than a decade helped more than 150 million people in Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America to tackle avoidable blindness and visual impairment. Through partnerships with leading international eye-care organizations such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness it had improved access to eye care in communities where help was most needed.Why Eye Care?Blindness was a common global problem that affected 36 million people worldwide. With proper cost-effective interventions 80 per cent of blindness could be prevented or treated. However eye-care problems were currently being underserved by charity organizations.

It worked with local communities to deliver programs focused on health and education. In 2016 Standard Chartered invested US$52.3 million in its communities and its employees contributed 67611 volunteering days.Standard Chartered’s largest community program Seeing is Believing provided funding to tackle avoidable blindness. In 2016 Standard Chartered raised US$6.5 million for Seeing is Believing through fundraising and group matching. In addition Standard Chartered’s Goal program an initiative to empower girls and young women through sports and life skills training had reached nearly 69000 girls in 2016. With a focus on building the financial capability of youth and micro and small entrepreneurs in its markets Standard Chartered’s financial education programs had trained more than 106000 youth and 1020 entrepreneurs.Sustainable Economic GrowthStandard Chartered sought to ensure that its core business of banking supported sustainable growth in its markets. In 2016 Standard Chartered provided loans and advances that supported the key sectors of the economy that were driving sustainable growth from infrastructure financing to microfinance. It also funded and facilitated more than US$800 million to the clean technology sector in 2016.To manage environmental and social risks Standard Chartered proactively engaged with various stakeholders such as its clients governments non-governmental organizations and communities to mitigate the impact stemming from its financing decisions. Its financing standards referenced industry-wide benchmarks such as the International Finance Corporation and it worked closely with its clients to manage these risks.Being a Responsible CompanyStandard Chartered sought to deliver long-term value by having the right culture structure and processes in place to practice strong governance and ensure a positive workplace environment. Standard Chartered ensured that it had a sustainable environmentally-friendly workplace. Between 2008 and 2016 Standard Chartered reduced its energy consumption by 37 per cent water consumption by 35 per cent and paper use by 71 per cent. Local suppliers and goods were also preferred as part of Standard Chartered’s promise to invest responsibly in local communities.In addition the bank prided itself on the diverse culture of its workforce as it held the strong belief that different views drove innovation and fostered an open and collaborative culture. In 2016 it engaged staff through more than 40 country-based employee networks and three global networks (women disability and LGBT and allies). Some processes that Standard Chartered put in place included its robust operational and compliance processes where efficient risk management and responsible selling were carried out.Note: LGBT = lesbian gay bisexual and transgenderSource: Created by the case authors based on Standard Chartered Bank “Sustainability Summary 2016” Standard Chartered Bank accessed October 10 2017 https://av.sc.com/corp-en/2016-Sustainability-Summary.pdf.

Liberty was an insurance company in South Africa and part of Liberty Holdings a leading financial-services group with representation in 24 countries across the African continent. As he drove along the highway he was aware of the ramshackle housing that lined the tarmac. He felt grateful for his recent exposure to this side of the city that had less privileged communities living there and wished more people could have exposure to these communities. He was considering the dilemma of how to encourage more business leaders at Liberty to get involved and ultimately contribute to improving the country’s public-education system.Traditionally the budget for community development would come from his company’s corporate social investment (CSI) budget. In Terblanche’s case however the opportunity to partner with a secondary school principal in an underprivileged school was less like CSI and more like a unique leadership and personal-development journey. Terblanche wished that more of his colleagues could have access to this opportunity for personal growth through the non-profit organization Partners for Possibility (PfP). He realized that he could encourage business units to use their marketing budget to sponsor individual managers to participate. That would mean using the schools’ infrastructure for brand-marketing purposes to justify the investment. He considered the implications (particularly the ethical implications) of using the schools in the company’s corporate marketing strategy.BackgroundOn arriving at the school Terblanche was greeted with smiling faces and felt welcomed. He noticed the well-kept lawn and colourful flower beds not at all what he had expected from a township school. Terblanche remembered his apprehension before his first meeting with the principal Lindiwe Ginya with whom he had partnered during the leadership-development journey of PfP. He had been surprised at how dynamic she was. He had expected a grey-haired career educator behind the desk but Ginya was energetic youthful and determined. Terblanche felt privileged to have been her cheerleader over the previous 18 months and was impressed by what she had accomplished. With Ginya as principal the school had achieved a pass rate of 84 per cent in 2016 and 93.9 per cent in 2017—compared to 69.9 per cent before her arrival. The achievement was all the more remarkable knowing that 30 per cent of these pupils came from child-headed households in the poorer Soweto communities. Ginya had been a teacher for over 20 years. She explained that when she started teaching she was employed after very little study. Later she was inspired to further her education and became interested in management. She likened her educational experience to a veil being lifted from her eyes as she began to realize that the way the school she worked in was being run was not how it was supposed to be. She completed both a master’s degree and a PhD focusing on the strategies employed by female school principals in disadvantaged areas. By the time she joined the PfP program and met Terblanche Ginya was running George Khosa Secondary School determined to make a difference to 1200 children the school’s teachers and the community in which she found herself.In one of his previous roles Terblanche had had an opportunity to expand STANLIB’s investment management business on the African continent. At the time STANLIB was jointly owned by Liberty and Standard Bank Group Limited (Standard Bank). In his role Terblanche visited 13 African countries. He experienced this role as if he were on a great safari dealing with the products and customer needs of these emerging and undeveloped economies. He considered it a unique opportunity which not many people would receive and continued to benefit from the experience. Standard Bank had extensive presence through its retail-banking business across the continent. Liberty having an interest in STANLIB also had aspirations in Africa and therefore eventually pulled Terblanche from STANLIB into Liberty’s head office.Terblanche was currently responsible for the relationship between Standard Bank and Liberty. There was a myriad of Liberty products that were being sold through Standard Bank channels. In turn Liberty had several bank products that the insurance company was offering through its own channels. With a high percentage of Liberty’s customers having relationships with Standard Bank bancassurance was a growing model. South Africa’s Liberty Group LimitedBased in Africa Liberty was a wealth-management group established more than 50 years earlier as the Liberty Life Association of Africa. The company had a reputation for developing and implementing innovative products and services that assisted customers with building and protecting long-term wealth. These included life insurance health insurance retail insurance pension plans funeral plans endowment plans income-protection plans provident-fund solutions and employee benefits. Liberty operated across South Africa Nigeria Namibia Swaziland Botswana Uganda Kenya and Lesotho and was headquartered in Johannesburg. In 2017 Liberty had 2.5 million policies in force. The company reported revenues of R62744 million for the fiscal year (FY) 2016 with operating margins of 10.2 per cent.Liberty aimed to be the preferred supplier of wealth-management services in Africa. The company operated according to five key guiding principles: involvement which reflected Liberty’s humanity and empathy; innovation which revealed the organization’s ingenuity and curiosity to find a better way; integrity which involved a commitment to fairness and the honouring of promises; insight which was the product of knowledge and understanding; and action which indicated a commitment to making things happen. Liberty was a subsidiary of Standard Bank.Standard Bank Group LimitedStandard Bank was a financial-services organization offering a broad range of transactional-banking savings borrowing lending investment insurance risk-management wealth-management and advisory services to individuals businesses and corporate clients. The bank operated in 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and was also headquartered in Johannesburg. Standard Bank reported interest income of R108060 million for FY 2016 an increase of 18.1 per cent over FY 2015. The bank operated through three business units: personal and business banking corporate and investment banking and the wealth business represented by Liberty.Terblanche’s personal leadership journeyDuring the Apartheid years Terblanche grew up in the affluent suburbs in Johannesburg in a typical white middle-class home. He went to the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit (named in Afrikaans one of South African’s 11 official languages) later renamed the University of Johannesburg. Terblanche received a law degree and completed his articles to qualify as an attorney. He started his corporate career in Standard Bank in project finance and later moved to investment management. Terblanche described his interest in social issues as a process that came with age and maturity. He had been building his career for just over 20 years and expected to further his career for about 15 more years. For a long time he had felt that his career was about what he could extract personally from his employer. More recently he had found himself looking back on what he had achieved and beginning to believe it was time to give something back. He had thought that his future career success would not only be measured by his paycheque but also by the contribution he would be making in the organization he had been part of for more than 20 years. He had set out to play a more meaningful role in the organization he served and to assist in moulding the next generation of leaders. The role of mentorsTerblanche had benefited from a mentor relationship he had with Johan Minnie to whom he had reported a couple of years earlier and who was currently head of sales and distribution for Liberty. Minnie had funded his own participation in a PfP program and was enthusiastic about the benefits for his own leadership development his organization and the education system as a whole. Minnie’s passion for PfP sparked the interest of Terblanche. Meanwhile Terblanche also had the benefit of meeting several of the leaders and principals who were on the PfP program at a workshop he attended. The energy and the special relationships between the partners touched him and he realized that this was something he really wanted to be involved in. Terblanche contacted Minnie and inquired about whether Liberty could sponsor him. Through Minnie’s lobbying Liberty sponsored Terblanche and four other partnerships in 2016. Once Terblanche had experienced the program’s value—not only for himself but also for the management team in the longer run—he presented the benefits of the program to the Liberty CSI team which subsequently agreed to fund five additional programs for the 2017 year.an Industry with heartTerblanche did not plan for a career in life insurance. It was only after he joined Liberty that he realized the importance of the industry in a developing economy. Every day millions of rand would flow into the economy due to life insurance claims being paid. These claims were often used to maintain the lifestyle of policy holders who would otherwise have been destitute after a catastrophic event affected them or their family. In 2016 Liberty paid out more than R3 billion in claims to policy holders. This money went straight into people’s pockets to support them in achieving their life goals. Terblanche bought into this higher purpose to the extent that he was able to see past the industry’s history of mis-selling and overhyped marketing. For him the value was delivered in the claims that the industry paid and in ensuring that they honoured their commitments to their clients. To illustrate his belief Terblanche remembered a story about witnessing an interaction between a manager and his claims team. The team had received a claim from the family of a long-standing client who had recently committed suicide. According to the policy terms suicide was excluded as a claim event under the particular circumstances. However the manager made an executive decision. Based on the company’s relationship with the client the manager instructed the team to pay the large claim. Terblanche felt that this demonstrated the heart of the industry and Liberty’s culture in particular. This incident encouraged Terblanche’s buy-in to the benefits of life insurance and helped him understand the importance of life insurance in society specifically in the lower market segments of South Africa and the rest of Africa. Terblanche realized that life insurance was a mechanism for wealth creation particularly for the creation of what he called “generational wealth.” For example Liberty sold simple life insurance products via Standard Bank to the lower market segments where clients would pay a premium of approximately R100 per month. In return clients would receive up to R200000 in life insurance coverage. Often when a client died the family lost a breadwinner. In such cases the R200000 payment would be the single largest asset that that family would ever have. If managed carefully it could benefit the next generation as well. For example this money could allow children access to tertiary education help pay off a home or enable the purchasing of a business. For Terblanche this phenomenon exemplified the culture of Liberty as a business with heart. Employees at Liberty believed that they were fulfilling a very important function in the life cycle of South Africa particularly in the country’s fight against poverty. Liberty’s ethos and Partners for Possibility’s objectivesEducation was important to Liberty. This interest went back as far as the founder Sir Donald Gordon. His philanthropy had founded the Liberty Foundation which supported education and a separate company called Mindset Network which was an educational-media non-governmental organization chaired by his son-in-law Hylton Appelbaum. Liberty’s CSI objectives had been focusing on education for several decades. Therefore Terblanche was sure he could elicit support from Liberty’s CSI business unit for the PfP funding as well as from Liberty’s executive committee. It was important to Terblanche to convince them to support PfP because he believed that it went to the heart of Liberty’ values the CSI unit’s objectives and the general challenges South Africa faced in education. In the past Liberty had funded the publication of exam papers in the national press to prepare students for the exam but if the groundwork in the schools was not in place it would be all in vain because the results would not be achieved. Terblanche thought that if the CSI budget of corporate South Africa could be consolidated it would be a substantial amount that could be used in a meaningful manner. Maybe the example of publishing past exam papers in the national press was of some value but was this the most impactful way to spend the CSI budget and could its financial effectiveness be measured? Was it truly meaningful to the kids writing exams? On the other hand the PfP program allowed him to get truly involved in accordance with Liberty’s guiding principles. For Terblanche the program actually faced the enemy—the educational challenge. He was grateful for the opportunity to help improve things alongside others in the trenches of the educational war. To him this was far more meaningful and satisfying than for example writing a cheque to a media company to publish past exam papers.Alignment of purposesAt Liberty the message was consistent—the intention of the organization was to secure clients’ financial freedom. This value proposition was pushed down the organization to everyone who worked at Liberty. For example whether cleaning windows or developing products all employees were part of the value chain. They enabled the company to deliver products that would pay a benefit to someone when it was most needed and that would allow the clients to maintain or improve their quality of life pass wealth on to their family or educate their children. It touched a heart string. For Terblanche it was a spiritual experience; he was in a place where he fitted in and had purpose. He was driven not only by what he did for the organization but also by what the organization allowed him to do for himself and for his community. He wondered whether he would have managed to get involved with PfP without having been at Liberty: he liked to believe that PfP was fulfilling a growing personal need and that he would have eventually found a way to make a difference. The experience and the support Terblanche had been given by his many bosses and mentors at Liberty could now be plowed back. Terblanche did not think that this was the type of dialogue he would have had many years earlier. It was only when he realised how he had changed that he fully understood the culture of the organization. He was in the fortunate position of being able to explain the organization’s purpose to the younger generation. He had been mentoring several young people in recent years which he had found incredibly fulfilling. It felt like a switch from pure capitalism into something that was a bit more social in nature. Therefore Liberty was the right place for him because of the culture value proposition and values that the organization stood for. The partnershipThe PfP opportunity had created a link between the educational burden of the country and the culture at Liberty that represented a higher calling to address massive social challenges. The social challenges started with a poor education system which led to chronic unemployment and ultimately to poverty. The education system was a key factor; it would produce better learners who in turn would produce better tertiary students and a healthier society. Terblanche did not see resource constraints as the challenge facing the education system; adequate funds were available. However the management of these funds was flawed. His own experience had showed him that with few resources and little management experience school principals were nevertheless responsible for shaping thousands of lives.For example Ginya Terblanche’s partner in the PfP program had 1200 teenagers in her school and 35 educators which meant that approximately 35 kids were relying on one educator. Terblanche perceived dysfunction in the school system which somehow expected the principal and educators to deliver results without adequate support.The first meeting between Terblanche and Ginya was spent talking about their personal lives and what had led them to this point in their careers as well as sharing their joint objectives for the PfP program. The commitment they made to each other on day one was that the program was mainly about the children. It was also about delivering a better product for them so that when they walked out of the school gates at the end of their grade 12 year they would be better prepared for the real world. When the two partners met Ginya had been in the role of high school principal for just over six months. South African public educationIn January 2017 The Economist rated South Africa’s education system as one of the worst in the world. The magazine reported that in 2015 South Africa was ranked 75th out of 76 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s league of education systems. In 2016 the Trends in International Maths and Science Study a quadrennial test taken by 580000 pupils in 57 countries consistently ranked South Africa at or near the bottom on various criteria despite some improvement since 2011. South Africa fared worse than countries that were generally regarded as less developed on the continent. Of all children who had attended school for six years in South Africa 27 per cent could not read compared to 4 per cent in Tanzania and 19 per cent in Zimbabwe. Of all children starting school in South Africa 37 per cent went on to pass the matriculation exam and only 4 per cent eventually earned a degree from a university.These poor results occurred despite public spending on education being at the comparatively high level of 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Ginya explained that children in the most disadvantaged areas did not pay school fees. In a government school like hers the government paid the school R1177 per child per year. Therefore for a school of 1200 children there was a budget in 2017 of R1.2–1.3 million to pay for textbooks stationery and service maintenance of the school’s facilities. The government also paid to feed the children twice a day and paid teacher salaries directly. Teachers were generally underskilled to deal with the social and economic challenges of the communities they served as were school managers. Principals were usually appointed without any regard for their managerial experience or expertise. Ginya’s PhD recommended that beyond the seven years’ teaching experience currently required each potential school principal should attend a management course rather than being placed in a management position without any preparation as was currently the case. Terblanche’s contribution Ginya soon experienced the benefits of her partnership with Terblanche which offered her more structure and created more capacity around her. For example one of the first changes Terblanche and Ginya initiated was to raise the skill level of her immediate support staff. Liberty sponsored a basic course for Ginya’s personal assistant (PA) which allowed the PA to spend time with that of Terblanche’s and other PAs of Liberty executives. Another educator was offered an opportunity to learn from a high-level project manager at Liberty to better understand how a project was managed including defining a project’s scope and monitoring its progress. One of Ginya’s staff members spent time at Liberty’s human resources department to better understand key performance areas and career management. Although it was generally a simple concept for a corporate institution the process was not common in public service education. Ginya was responsible for developing career paths for her staff with limited support from the Department of Education and little preparation for the role. To make matters worse the department often called meetings at the last minute and without notice which hampered the schedules of the educators. Historically the school had a very poor pass rate record. In September 2015 when Ginya started work at the school the pass rate was 69 per cent. Through her efforts passion and strategy the school managed to increase the pass rate to 84 per cent in 2016 and aimed for a 95 per cent pass rate in 2017. The goal was going to be incredibly difficult to achieve but the school had a program in place. The most important intervention was a one-week revision exercise for all students. The school had raised funds to host all of the students in a guest house in the Magaliesburg area for that week. The educators dedicated their time and the school governing body was also involved. The event was very successful. The learners were in a focused environment patiently supported by the educators to prepare them for the final exam. It was the catalyst needed for the students to develop the confidence and motivation to study.In the community where the school was situated there were problems with teenage pregnancies drugs and assault—even the practice of Satanism had emerged within the school. Ginya who was often the only adult in the school children’s lives offered support and encouraged them to pass exams and lift themselves out of their poverty-stricken environment. With his involvement in PfP Terblanche initiated several school programs including sports days a garden project and career days which also involved some of his colleagues. Partners for Possibility’s interventionThe award-winning social change initiative PfP was the flagship program of the global non-profit organization Symphonia Leadership Development (Symphonia). The South African wing of the organization Symphonia for South Africa had been in operation for only six years and had already tapped into the knowledge and skills of business leaders to help school leaders develop their skills. By focusing on enhancing the leadership skills of principals the PfP program was expected to alleviate one of the major problems facing the South African school system. The ultimate goal was to achieve quality education for all children in South Africa.Business leaders and school principals at under-resourced schools partnered in a year of carefully designed leadership-development processes that aimed to develop the principal’s capacity to lead the school with the goal to improve education outcomes at the school. Individual business leaders or their companies paid approximately R80000 per partnership for the costs of the program which included the school principal’s involvement for one year. In the six years since its inception over 500 partnerships had been established—in most cases with measurable benefit. But PfP program supporters argued that it was not simply the school leaders who benefited from the partnership; participating companies observed that their leaders had grown and honed their own leadership skills by learning more about how to do business in a South African context how to influence without direct authority and how to act and lead in complex situations where answers were not apparent. In other words both members of the partnership were learning new skills that helped to lead change in complex and ambiguous environments.Robyn Whittaker the stakeholder engagement lead of Symphonia for South Africa recalled that the PfP program was founded in 2010 when Louise van Rhyn the director and founder of Symphonia became the first business leader to partner with a school principal in an effort to improve a school’s education outcomes. Symphonia was licensed to deliver a range of the world’s best leadership programs which were also used to develop participants in the PfP program. These programs included Nancy Kline’s Time to Think and Peter Block’s Flawless Consulting and Community Building workshops. Van Rhyn believed that it was the responsibility of organizational leaders to engage and harness the collective intelligence of people around them and to engage their workforce with a sense of enthusiasm and possibility. This philosophy drove the structure and process of PfP.Although a primary goal was to ensure that the principal left the program with the energy and confidence to lead the school through a change process that would enhance the quality of the education it delivered PfP went one step further: it aimed to create readiness for change through an aligned and cohesive management team within the school that was capable of energizing the community of teachers and engaging the parents and community that surrounded the school to achieve the vision of quality education for all school children.Once the business leader and the school principal had established a relationship they attended a range of interventions together which both cemented the relationship and enabled each partner to develop new skills. They came together for three to five hours each month to grapple with real challenges at the school in an action–learning format. Eight to 10 partnerships commencing at the same time were then linked together in an activity called Community of Practice which met frequently during the year-long program to share experiences and provide mutual support. The participants also participated in monthly leadership coaching sessions and were expected to provide reports and complete journal entries.As a result of these interventions the principal and the executive developed techniques to enhance their thinking and the thinking of those around them. The partners developed the ability to create generative relationships and the skills to deal with challenging people and difficult situations in a complex and ambiguous environment. They also developed skills and tools that enabled them to mobilize stakeholder support for the vision of improving the quality of education at the school level.Making a differenceAccording to the PfP program over a period of two years a participating school could expect to see a confident and competent principal effective management of the school and more motivated teachers. The teachers would be able to achieve better coverage of the school curriculum as a result of reduced absenteeism and more involvement in professional development activities. Parents would be more engaged and would attend school meetings more regularly while the broader community would support school initiatives.By June 2017 PfP had involved 500 school principals and 500 business leaders. This meant that the program had reached 12700 teachers and enhanced the lives of 406000 school learners and their 180000 families. Schools had received new resources and had access to a broader range of cultural enrichment and sporting activities as a result of their participation in the PfP program. In many schools like Ginya’s there had been measurable improvements in the academic results that were achieved.Interestingly the positive impact of the PfP program was not limited to the school principals in the partnership; the executives also reported positive enhancements to their leadership skills because of their exposure to more ambiguous and complex environments than they were accustomed to. The executives experienced the process of building stronger and deeper relationships with stakeholders they had little or no formal power over. They also gained a much deeper understanding of the value of diversity.Growing the partnerships in LibertyIn 2016 five partnerships were funded by Liberty; in 2017 another five were funded. Assuming that favourable feedback was received Terblanche intended to grow the number of partnerships in future years. In 2017 the cost was R85000 for an executive’s involvement which also covered the cost of the partner principal’s participation in the program. Because Terblanche’s role was based in the organization’s head office the people he had nominated and later been accepted into the program were all based in Johannesburg and Pretoria. However there was great interest from other South African provinces including KwaZulu-Natal Free-State Eastern Cape and Western Cape. Several Liberty leaders indicated their interest in participating. Some of them would receive funding from other sources but central institutional funding through the CSI team would resume at the end of the year after budgets were confirmed. Terblanche’s aspiration was to grow the number of partnerships and build a body of evidence around the program’s benefits. He wanted to assemble colleagues internally to discuss the experience and in the process hopefully motivate other people. He believed that the CSI funding for these partnerships was only one possible source; the business units could fund the partnerships he thought specifically those that had a marketing budget. Great benefits for the Liberty brand would potentially result from participating in PfP as he had discovered. In particular benefit was felt through the schools and the school infrastructure and surrounding communities which represented markets that Liberty had yet to tap into. Terblanche considered contacting the branding team to suggest installing Liberty brand banners at the schools hosting information days selling products and providing services to clients directly from the school locations. If successful in making the initiative more nationally represented the Liberty footprint could reach areas that were currently not available. Coincidentally Liberty’s emerging consumer-market team which focused on the lower market segments was closely aligned with the areas where these previously disadvantaged schools were located and where the partnerships were established. Going forwardDespite the lack of support from her superiors Ginya had used her own efforts and credentials to rise above her peers. Other principals were contacting her for advice on how to better manage their schools and districts. Ginya was invited to Harvard University and to Atlanta Georgia in the United States to share her research and experiences. She was a bright star and would probably rise above her current environment. Thanks to her personal achievements growth opportunities were opening up for her and she would invariably move up. However there were several questions to consider. What would happen to the school after Ginya’s eventual departure? Would Terblanche stay with the school or would he follow Ginya? Was his partnership with the individual principal or with the school? How would he motivate even more of his colleagues to get involved? How could branding and social responsibility projects relating to the schools be better managed?,20,"[{""start"":1040,""end"":1055,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1224,""end"":1236,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5648,""end"":5662,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6189,""end"":6202,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7905,""end"":7920,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11871,""end"":11883,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12852,""end"":12864,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13717,""end"":13729,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14043,""end"":14055,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18433,""end"":18446,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18499,""end"":18513,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18600,""end"":18612,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18870,""end"":18882,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18962,""end"":18974,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19124,""end"":19136,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19263,""end"":19276,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23365,""end"":23378,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23418,""end"":23431,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23730,""end"":23743,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23830,""end"":23842,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":24669,""end"":24682,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25014,""end"":25027,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":29680,""end"":29693,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1348,""end"":1355,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4550,""end"":4557,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4701,""end"":4709,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5144,""end"":5150,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5693,""end"":5699,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5812,""end"":5818,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6546,""end"":6552,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":7346,""end"":7352,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11900,""end"":11906,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":995,""end"":1012,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1943,""end"":1955,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2145,""end"":2155,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2898,""end"":2908,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2725,""end"":2735,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3229,""end"":3239,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4679,""end"":4689,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5183,""end"":5193,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5234,""end"":5244,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7668,""end"":7680,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7990,""end"":8000,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8187,""end"":8197,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7735,""end"":7745,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8993,""end"":9003,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9421,""end"":9431,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9443,""end"":9453,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9729,""end"":9739,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9855,""end"":9865,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9908,""end"":9918,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10191,""end"":10201,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10792,""end"":10802,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11106,""end"":11116,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11575,""end"":11585,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11702,""end"":11714,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11908,""end"":11918,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12661,""end"":12671,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13392,""end"":13402,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13988,""end"":13998,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13556,""end"":13566,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14526,""end"":14536,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15451,""end"":15461,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15959,""end"":15969,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16053,""end"":16063,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17164,""end"":17174,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17523,""end"":17535,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17682,""end"":17692,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17857,""end"":17867,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20479,""end"":20491,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20565,""end"":20575,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20684,""end"":20694,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20893,""end"":20905,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":23022,""end"":23032,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29236,""end"":29246,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29460,""end"":29472,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30012,""end"":30024,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30728,""end"":30738,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":31998,""end"":32008,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1370,""end"":1372,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1459,""end"":1461,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1640,""end"":1642,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2317,""end"":2319,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2334,""end"":2336,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2551,""end"":2553,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2786,""end"":2788,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2858,""end"":2860,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3072,""end"":3074,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4720,""end"":4722,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4867,""end"":4

Ltd. (Balaji Wafers) ranked third among the top manufacturers of potato wafers in India. For the year ended September 2017 Balaji Wafers had a turnover of ₹21.22 billion following the market leader homegrown Haldiram’s Food International Limited (Haldiram) (₹42.24 billion) and global multinational corporation (MNC) PepsiCo India Ltd. (PepsiCo) (₹35.96 billion) (see Exhibit 1). Even though the Balaji brand had sold more than each of PepsiCo’s two brands (Lay’s and Kurkure) making it the second-largest individual brand Balaji Wafers needed to address some concerns. After operating for over three decades Rajkot-based Balaji Wafers was the leading manufacturer of potato wafers in the western state of Gujarat. Balaji Wafers’ 60 per cent market share made it the undisputed market leader in that state having continuously beaten global giant PepsiCo. PepsiCo had made numerous attempts to dislodge Balaji Wafers from its position including proposing a buyout but had failed in all of its efforts. Balaji Wafers had spurned offers for a complete takeover and was seeking investments for expanding operations. Though Balaji Wafers had publicly stated it was considering going national in pursuit of growth it had until then preferred to aggressively pursue high sales by expanding regionally into neighbouring states.Balaji Wafers had two options for growth. It could leverage its competitive advantage by remaining a strong regional player and continue to focus on the factors that had made it successful over the years or it could go national and compete with the likes of Haldiram and PepsiCo. The latter choice would require a robust business strategy marketing acumen and huge investments which could be either raised from external sources or funded by its own cash flows. Would Balaji Wafers be able to sustain its lead over PepsiCo? What should Balaji Wafers do for its pursuit of growth?HISTORYThe story of Balaji Wafers’ humble origins began in the 1970s. Chandubhai Virani and his three brothers Meghjibhai Bhikubhai and Kanubhai had come to Rajkot from Dhundhoraji (a small village in the Jamnagar district in Gujarat) with a dream of building a successful business. They had tried their luck in trading diamonds and agricultural kits but without much success losing the ₹20000 capital their father had given them. Chandubhai and Meghjibhai then took up a job selling refreshments in the Astron Cinema in Rajkot. Thereafter a dispute arose between the cinema’s management and the employees’ union in which the two brothers did not participate (since they were not willing to risk losing their jobs). The theatre owner gained confidence in the two brothers and in 1976 gave them the contract for managing the theatre’s food outlet on a revenue-sharing basis. By 1982 the Viranis had moved into the business of making homemade potato wafers outsourced from different vendors.OPERATIONS AT BALAJI WAFERSAs demand increased the brothers started producing wafers at home and sold these to a few nearby shops. The demand for their wafers soon encouraged the Viranis to gradually increase production. The brothers handled all functions personally since they did not have a team in that early stage. Their daily routine included purchasing 50 kilograms (kg) of potatoes manufacturing the wafers at home manually sprinkling on the spices and then selling the wafers personally to each shop in the local markets. Subsequently in 1989 the brothers set up a 1000-square-metre facility in the nearby industrial area Aji to manufacture 60 kg of wafers a day. In 1993–94 Balaji Wafers installed a semi-automatic plant raising its production capacity to 180 kg of wafers per day. In 2000 it invested an additional ₹50 million in a modern automatic plant with the capacity to manufacture and package 450 kg of wafers an hour. At that time Balaji Wafers produced 9000 kg of banana and potato wafers and 7000 kg of namkeen (a salty snack) per day. To meet the growing demand the Viranis set up three new plants in 1999 2003 and 2008 in Gujarat and by 2013 Balaji Wafers had invested approximately ₹5 billion in operations.By 2013 Balaji Wafers had grown from three employees to 2500 employees; had around 500 suppliers; was present in the states of Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Goa across 17 product categories; and was exporting its products to 35 countries worldwide. Namkeen comprised 60 per cent of the company’s total production while wafers made up the remaining 40 per cent. In 2013 the Valsad (Gujarat) unit produced 2200 kg wafers per hour making it one of the largest units for making potato wafers in Asia. By 2017 Balaji owned four plants in India with a total processing capacity of 650000 kg of potato wafers and 1000000 kg of namkeen per day which included around 30 varieties of salty snacks and savouries in addition to potato wafers achieving a turnover of ₹21.22 billion (see Exhibit 2).THE VIRANI FAMILYThe Virani family was comprised of the four brothers who had founded Balaji Wafers Bhikubhai Chandubhai Kanubhai and Meghjibhai and the next generation sons Keyur and Mihir (Bhikubhai’s sons) and Pranay (Chandubhai’s son). By 2017 the family had divided the roles among them and each family member was handling a specific function (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Bhikubhai was the chairman Chandubhai was the managing director and Kanubhai was the technical director. Chandubhai was also handling production while Bhikubhai and Kanubhai looked after sales and marketing. Mihir was the marketing director Pranay was the events director and Keyur was the research and development director. Chandubhai and Keyur were also the spokespersons for Balaji Wafers. The family was close-knit and often had lunch together at the corporate office just outside Rajkot. The family defined a set of values for the company which they used to drive their decisions. They wanted to build the business on traditional values of trust and quality without any compromise.MARKETING BALAJI WAFERSBalaji Wafers had the advantage of local market knowledge and like other regional players it had inherent strengths—extensive distribution and low overheads—which allowed an aggressive pricing strategy which had resulted in the tough competition the company gave to MNCs. According to a November 2014 report by the Nielsen Company on the snack market in India increased disposable income the need for convenience in a fast-paced lifestyle and cultural traditions of snacking between meals had fuelled explosive growth in the salty and savoury snacks market leading to six-fold sales growth in the category—from ₹80 billion in 2004 to ₹470 billion in 2013. Global researcher Euromonitor International stated in a 2016 study that Balaji Wafers was larger than Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. (Parle) and the Bingo! brand of ITC Limited (ITC) with about 60-per-cent market share in Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan and Goa and 15 per cent in Madhya Pradesh. Between 2013 and 2015 the market share of Lay’s dropped from 51.1 per cent to 49.5 per cent due to the growth of Balaji Wafers which had steadily gained market share annually in a market estimated to be around ₹70 billion to ₹100 billion.By 2017 the savoury snack market was a ₹295.4 billion market growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9 per cent (see Exhibit 5). This category was further broken down into many subcategories of which salty snacks constituted the majority in terms of both sales and growth rates. Potato wafers was grouped with salty snacks within the savoury snacks category and was estimated to be a ₹3–4 billion market. Furthermore salty snacks had a CAGR of 22.8 per cent between 2012 and 2017 and was forecasted to grow at 14.8 per cent for 2017–2022 (see Exhibits 6 and 7). According to Euromonitor International’s 2017 report the year-on-year growth rate of the savoury snack market was 14.9 per cent (see Exhibit 6) with PepsiCo and Balaji Wafers having a CAGR of −1.2 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (see Exhibit 5).Since 2013 packaged namkeen had replaced Western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within the branded salty snacks market. Euromonitor International’s 2017 estimates showed that the industry was expected to grow at a CAGR of 9 per cent to reach ₹446.9 billion in 2022. Balaji Wafers had managed to control the erosion in its market share (as a percentage share of retail value) which had dropped from 8.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 2011–2017 while PepsiCo’s share dropped from 15.9 per cent to 8.1 per cent in a market that had an average growth of 20 per cent (from 2014 to 2017) (see Exhibit 8). Balaji Wafers was very strong in Gujarat and Maharashtra and retained its leadership position by beating PepsiCo’s Lay’s. Nationally it was third after Haldiram and PepsiCo. In terms of brand shares of the savoury snack category (by percentage value) Balaji was ranked second after Haldiram (see Exhibit 9. Balaji Wafers saw a 14 per cent increase in sales growth in 2015–2016. The savoury snacks market had been declining since 2013 with all players facing declining sales but Balaji Wafers was able to continue maintaining its year-on-year growth even when PepsiCo was quickly losing its share (see Exhibit 5). According to Balaji Wafers some of the secrets of its success were the efforts to keep overhead costs low which ensured its products remained affordable along with the introduction of healthier varieties and expanding into the neighbouring states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In 2016 60 per cent of the Indian snack market was dominated by branded Indian salty snacks while the balance consisted of branded Western salty snacks including potato chips. Balaji Wafers attributed its success in the Indian market to the critical factors of quality price last-mile distribution and the right taste. Additionally the contribution of branded Indian salty snacks such as dal chivra bhujia and nuts within the overall snacks market was increasing and the industry players both multinational and domestic were using attractive packaging and pricing to penetrate newer markets in smaller towns.COMPETITORSBalaji’s total turnover was about ₹21 billion by September 2017 (see Exhibit 1). Over the previous five years it had earned a steady net profit at 10–12 per cent of revenue. By 2017 Balaji had garnered 6.85 per cent market share by value in India’s sweet and savoury snacks market and was the third-largest company nationally after Haldiram and PepsiCo (which had multiple brands in its portfolio) (see Exhibits 8 and 9). The market’s continuous growth attracted multiple new players. The salty snacks market was dominated by PepsiCo with Lay’s and Kurkure; ITC with Bingo!; and Haldiram and Parle products along with numerous regional brands. PepsiCo: PepsiCo with its Kurkure and Lay’s brands was the pioneer in the organized snacks market and the category leader. PepsiCo was focusing on the wafers segment and planning to leverage the Kurkure brand to extend into the pricier snacks segment to capture a larger share of the market. Its strategy was to focus on premium offerings and innovation by creating new demand spaces consequently pursuing a premium pricing strategy. For Frito-Lay PepsiCo bet on different pack sizes at different price points to improve penetration. It offered its smaller packs for ₹3 ₹5 and ₹10 and products for in-home consumption and family occasions at higher price points of ₹20 ₹30 ₹60 and ₹99. In 2011 PepsiCo launched a new brand “Lehar” which was 40 per cent cheaper than its flagship Lay’s.ITC: ITC was the largest tobacco manufacturer in India but it had focused on the salty snacks segment after it gained more than 7 per cent market share in 2014. It launched 18 flavours expanded its manufacturing sites to five from the earlier two locations widened its distribution network and revamped its packaging. ITC also introduced innovative formats based on multigrain pulses with distinctively better taste under its umbrella snack brand Bingo! to drive volumes. Parle: Parle owner of the brand Hippo decided to increase its research and development spending by 30 per cent to attract customers. It also started developing innovative products to drive volumes and proposed to roll out new products including potato finger chips called Aloo Lacha. The company had also started promoting namkeen in ₹5 packs and had improved its distribution and infrastructure having separate distributors for towns with populations of about 500000 with the intention to increase its total distribution network by 15 per cent in 2014.Haldiram: Haldiram another family-owned homegrown business was the leading player with an 11.7 per cent share of retail value in 2017. The company offered the largest portfolio of snacks across all retail channels. It had grown from being a brand of north India to becoming a large national player. In September 2017 Haldiram finally overtook PepsiCo to regain the position of India’s top snack company.Prataap Snacks Ltd. (Prataap): Prataap owner of the Yellow Diamond brand saw a 30 per cent increase in retail value sales in 2017. It challenged PepsiCo’s brands through aggressive pricing its distribution strategy and the fact that it had raised pre–initial public offering (IPO) funding of ₹500 million from Malabar Investments in exchange for a 2.5 per cent stake. This was in addition to the ₹2.65 billion in funding invested by Sequoia Capital in 2011 in exchange for a 63.15 per cent stake. Faering Capital invested ₹450 million in June 2016. Prataap’s IPO in September 2017 was oversubscribed 47 times when listed. The company had famous Bollywood actor Salman Khan as its brand ambassador. Prataap had a distribution network of 205 super stockists with over 3400 distributors. It owned and operated three manufacturing facilities—one in Indore and two in Guwahati. It had two contract manufacturing plants in Kolkata and Bengaluru and intended to use the funds to penetrate the existing markets and explore new markets.Local brands: Local snacking companies such as Balaji Wafers Prataap Bikanervala Bikaji Foods and DFM Foods together recorded sales growth of 8–35 per cent in the year ended March 2016 at a time when major international companies like Mondelez International Inc. PepsiCo’s food division and GlaxoSmithKline Plc were struggling to grow their businesses. Together these five local firms had combined sales of nearly ₹37 billion which was higher than Nestlé’s Maggi brand and Kellogg’s in India. With numerous funds investing in Indian players the competition among well-funded competitors was growing fast. Investment firm Lighthouse Funds had invested ₹1.25 billion in Bikaji Foods while Westbridge Capital Ltd. had invested about 25 per cent in DFM Foods. These well-funded new-entrant competitors were potential threats to the existing players.MARKETING COMMUNICATION Balaji Wafers focused on understanding the native tastes of its customers. The potential for traditional snacks was immense and smart companies were gradually converting traditional “eaten-at-home” products to packaged products that could be consumed on the go. Additionally because of the hygiene factor consumers’ preferences were shifting to packaged branded namkeen over unbranded products from local bakeries thus increasing the market shares of local brands. Consumers also perceived traditional Indian snacks to be healthier and preferred brands that contained commonly used ingredients often found in Indian kitchens. Indian consumers had discerning tastes and existing local players like Balaji Wafers experimented with tastes to keep its brands relevant to consumers. This was one of the strengths of regional brands—they understood Indian tastes better and could offer variety at low operating and marketing costs. Furthermore as the organized players increased the affordability and availability of their products they experienced increased sales from consumers who shifted from the unorganized market to these brands. The increased reach and new product launches also contributed to the growth of all local players.It appeared that Balaji Wafers understood the palates of its large regional customer base in India stepping in with products with localized flavours that catered to these tastes. This strategy of balancing price flavour and distribution helped the group capture a 90 per cent share of the Gujarat wafers market and 70 per cent of the namkeen market. In Gujarat the company’s product mix was just right and it catered to the Gujarati sweet tooth by making its products less spicy. The company offered masala wafers to cater to the Gujarati palate chaat masala for the Maharashtrian market and a range of spicy snacks for the Rajasthan market.Balaji Wafers spent negligible amounts on marketing and advertising. PepsiCo’s Lay’s its nearest competitor spent over 7–8 per cent of its snack revenue on advertising including endorsements from Bollywood superstars such as Ranbir Kapoor. Even though Balaji Wafers did not spend much on advertising and communication it had made inroads beyond its stronghold market of Gujarat into states such as Rajasthan Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Goa. It relied more on word of mouth publicity. There were apprehensions about whether such minimal expenditure on marketing would work when Balaji went national as local player ad spends could nearly double compared to those of global players in line with international trends.DISTRIBUTIONChandubhai believed Balaji Wafers had to focus on distribution to achieve growth. By late 2016 it had a network of 10–12 sole distributors and 700 dealers in Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Goa covering over 2000000 retailers and reaching millions of final consumers. Balaji Wafers had a strong hold on the retail channel and could reach the depths of the market. It encouraged its dealers to provide their own fleet of trucks which Balaji compensated for through higher margins. This not only reduced the role of intermediaries but also kept distribution costs low. Balaji Wafers wanted its product to speak for itself and ensured that it was easily available to the customer.According to a 2017 Euromonitor International report grocery store–based retailing constituted 99.9 per cent of the channel distribution for savoury snacks in India. Of this 83.7 per cent were traditional grocery retailers and 16.2 per cent were modern grocery retailers. Of the traditional retailers 70 per cent were independent kirana stores (local mom-and-pop grocery stores). However the traditional independent grocers were declining in number and being replaced by the growing number of modern grocery retailers. The remaining 0.1 per cent of the channel distribution for savoury snacks was made up by Internet sales and non-store retailing which was also a growing segment. Balaji Wafers’ distribution strategy had given it a 70 per cent market share in Gujarat. Balaji Wafers had also displaced PepsiCo’s Lay’s in neighbouring Maharashtra to gain a huge 60 per cent market share in 2014 just five years after entering this market in 2009. External industry experts believed the Balaji brand name was restricted to Gujarat and Maharashtra and virtually unknown outside these two states even though customers were extremely satisfied with Balaji products.PRICINGBhikubhai had stated that Balaji Wafers’ products were so affordable that even a school kid could buy them. He also believed that the products should be filling and their consumption should not cause concern among health-conscious parents. A ₹10 pack of Lay’s or Bingo! contained around 13 grams of chips while a Balaji Wafers’ pack for the same price contained 20 grams of chips. Consequently Balaji Wafers continued to sell its namkeen and wafers for as low as ₹1 and ₹5 per packet respectively.Chandubhai followed pricing for price-conscious buyers an increasing challenge because of rising potato prices. The company used economy pricing coupled with low operations costs and an intensive distribution model. Its low overheads helped in passing on a greater value share to its customers. Erratic potato prices and consumers’ unwillingness to consume more of the product had affected sales of potato wafers. The contribution of potato wafers to Balaji Wafers’ revenues declined from 70 per cent to 40 per cent. Balaji responded by increasing its concentration on snacks which also gave it higher margins compared to wafers.Rolling out nationally would not only increase the company’s overheads it would also lead to additional distribution advertising and marketing costs. If it went national Balaji Wafers would have to consider whether it would be able to use its penetrative pricing strategy which traditionally had given it a competitive advantage in Gujarat and Maharashtra.MANAGING THE FAMILY BUSINESSBalaji Wafers was hesitant to hire professionals and most of its existing employees had been groomed by Chandubhai himself. These employees were loyal unlike professionals who Chandubhai believed would not stick around. His experience had shown him that the people who were trained by him did stay and were loyal to the company. The sole exception was the head of production Nishika Bapat who had formerly been with PepsiCo. The next generation was skeptical of this mindset to avoid hiring professionals which had worked in the past. The new generation wanted to expand the skill base especially with the company planning to grow nationally and even export its products outside India. The next generation was involved in multiple initiatives within the company: Product Innovation: As consumer preferences were moving towards healthier snack options the company invested ₹2.5 billion for new machinery in Rajkot to make baked multi-grain snacks which were healthier. The challenge for Balaji Wafers was that competing products in the same category (PepsiCo’s Aliva and Parle’s Smart Chips) had failed in the past. The Viranis therefore wanted to ensure they could offer health benefits without sacrificing the taste of their snacks. They were also working on their traditional products such as potato wafers and namkeen to reduce the amount of oil used without compromising on taste.Market Expansion: Balaji Wafers invested in scaling up and upgrading the manufacturing unit at Indore to try and capture the northern India markets not only for scaling up investments to build capacity but also for brand building. Strategic Investments: The next generation felt that it needed strategic investments to take the business to the next level. A strategic partnership could get the company access to global best practices and funds for expanding operations.Chandubhai was not very keen on strategic investors stating “Strategic partners would only want profits. They will never grow the business with the same passion as we have done.” THE stake-sale PROCESSWith a growth plan in mind in 2013 Balaji Wafers started talking to private-equity investors such as the Blackstone Group L.P. and Actis Capital to raise US$100–125 million to fund its growth. These plans included investing ₹2 billion towards new manufacturing facilities planned over a three-year period focusing on the northern and southern markets. Until then Balaji Wafers had been a major player in only the western markets. It claimed that better management would be created by the stake sale. Keyur Virani director of Balaji Wafers said “We are now planning to enter [the] North and South India market within [the] next two years and for that we are looking to have strategic partnerships with local players.” Balaji Wafers appointed Ernst & Young to find buyers for the stake sale. By December 2013 the company was in talks with numerous investors including private equity funds and MNCs such as Kellogg’s General Mills Inc. and PepsiCo. Kellogg’s: Kellogg’s the multinational breakfast cereal giant was one of the potential suitors. Kellogg’s was looking for ways to grow as it was unable to establish a strong presence in the local Indian market. This was close on the heels of its recent US$2.7 billion buyout of Pringles which gave it a global presence in the wafer business. Industry sources felt that Kellogg’s taking over Balaji Wafers could help the Pringles brand in Tier 2 cities where the consumption of wafers was rising.Agro Tech Foods Ltd.: After conducting due diligence on all of Balaji Wafers’ brands and meeting the management Agro Tech Foods Ltd. an affiliate of ConAgra Foods Inc. USA concluded that with Balaji Wafers’ operations restricted to a few states it was too regional in nature.PepsiCo: PepsiCo launched its brand Lay’s in India in 1995. It had used Lay’s to spearhead its presence in the Western salty snacks segment and Kurkure for the Indian salty snacks segment. Both were losing market share to Balaji Wafers in the growing snacks market. Around 2009 Pepsi and Haldiram saw that Balaji Wafers was offering tough competition in the Gujarat and western India region. They sent a team of executives to identify ways to respond to Balaji Wafers. The team visited Balaji Wafers’ plant and its potato farms and were impressed by the simplicity and efficiency of Balaji Wafers’ operations. When PepsiCo realized that it was helpless in meeting Balaji Wafers’ challenge it turned around and offered to buy out a 51 per cent stake in Balaji Wafers trying to convince Chandubhai for a sellout. Media reports stated that the Viranis had asked for a valuation of ₹35 billion three and a half times Balaji Wafers’ sales of ₹10 billion (the norm being two to three times the sales in the fast-moving consumer goods sector). Prospective buyers found the valuation too high given that Balaji Wafers’ reach was restricted to a few states. One private-equity fund stated that since Balaji Wafers had a strong balance sheet and was internally funded it was not in need of funds and hence could ask for a higher valuation.Balaji Wafers had stated that it was not open to selling large stakes to the private equity funds which would loosen the family’s control over the company. The family maintained that the stake sale was intended to create better management for Balaji Wafers. Finally in June 2014 Balaji Wafers on finding that the valuations offered by the private-equity players were lower than expected gave up its plans of a stake sale or an IPO that year. Chandubhai commented on this stating “MNCs do not have the experience in the snacks category in India but we did not need the money. Now the matter is closed.” IPO PlansIn late 2015 Balaji Wafers again decided to sell 10 per cent though an IPO from which it expected to raise ₹3 billion valuing the company at ₹30 billion. The company needed the funds to expand into new markets in central and north India branching out from its traditional limited stronghold areas of Gujarat Goa Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Maharashtra. However Balaji Wafers subsequently delayed this by about a year because it wanted to focus on setting up its new plants in Indore.INDORE PLANTIn March 2015 Balaji Wafers announced a ₹4 billion investment in Indore Madhya Pradesh to tap into the north Indian market. Balaji Wafers had acquired land earlier and construction had already started on a new production facility which was expected to be completed in the next 18 months. This new factory was initially installed for the production of 1500 kg of wafers and other salty snacks per hour. The output could be gradually doubled based on requirements. The factory was intended to manufacture all the products of Balaji Wafers and to cater to Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Delhi and surrounding areas in north India. Under the first phase of the project the company invested ₹2 billion in the plant with the balance of ₹2 billion to be spent in the second phase on other requirements. The plant was finally commissioned on October 11 2016 increasing the company’s total capacity to 86.4 tonnes per day from 62.4 tonnes earlier.Financing by LoansThe company had raised a loan of ₹1 billion in late 2015 from creditors and banks to fund its expansion. It expected its financial requirements for 2017 to be about ₹2.25 billion part of which it expected to fund from internal accruals. Balaji Wafers at the end of 2017 had three plants—in Rajkot Valsad and Indore. It had invested ₹7 billion in these plants by funding them through bank loans. Chandubhai was quoted as saying “As long as banks are willing to lend there is no need to go public. There is no IPO this year although we have been thinking about it in the past.”BALAJI wafers’ EXPANSIONIn 2014 Balaji Wafers had 70 per cent market share in western India with a presence in the states of Gujarat Maharashtra Goa Rajasthan and some parts of Madhya Pradesh. Management claimed that the company had over 85–90 per cent market share of the potato wafer market in Gujarat. With the intention to expand beyond western India in the future Balaji had invested ₹500 million in doubling its production capacity in Valsad South Gujarat raising its hourly production of potato wafers to 1200 kg in Rajkot and 2500 kg in Valsad.PRODUCT Diversification In December 2014 Balaji Wafers announced that it would start manufacturing potato french fries by May 2015 taking on the largest seller of french fries in India McCain Foods India. This project costing ₹500 million was to be set up through Iscon Balaji Foods Pvt. Ltd. who at that time manufactured ready-to-cook potato flakes. Chandubhai visited German machinery manufacturers for sourcing machines in late 2014. McCain Foods India was the market leader in the frozen potato specialty market with products like french fries Aloo Tikki McCain Smiles and McCain Potato Cheese Shotz. The firm had a strong back end for sourcing potatoes and planned to start with french fries at its Ahmedabad plant before launching other products. The products would be sold directly to consumers at organized retail stores and would be made available for quick-service restaurants and institutional buyers.THE WAY AHEADIn 2017 Balaji Wafers had continued to make money and its turnover was continuously increasing compared to its competitors (see Exhibit 8). Chandubhai stated that his future plans were to go national and then even global. The company was planning a ₹1 billion potato wafers unit in London England and was considering setting up a unit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He wanted to grow the brand to double its current size in the global markets. Chandubhai also wanted to sell Balaji Wafers’ goods internationally under its own label and had rejected offers from superstores based in the United Kingdom and the Middle East that wanted him to co-brand his products for the large Gujarati diaspora there. Balaji Wafers also aspired to enter the fast-food restaurant business by setting up a chain starting from Gujarat and then launching it nationally. The concern however was about the future of the Balaji brand. Balaji Wafers had been a strong regional player that had defeated an MNC giant PepsiCo on its home turf and had spurned offers from General Mills and Kellogg’s its potential competitors in the national market. Additionally it had also faced the onslaught of local players like Haldiram which had grown from being a regional brand to becoming the leading national brand. Other regional brands like Yellow Diamond were also experiencing robust growth in their respective regions. The question before the Virani family was whether they should expand the Balaji brand nationally or stay regional and strengthen it further in Gujarat and Maharashtra.EXHIBIT 1: BRAND SHARE SALESSales for the year ended September (₹ billion)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹63.8838 on September 1 2017.Source: Created by the authors based on data from Sagar Malviya “Haldiram Topples PepsiCo; Regains Top Spot as Country’s Largest Snack Company” Economic Times December 21 2017 accessed March 19 2018 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/haldiram-topples-pepsico-regains-top-spot-as-countrys-largest-snack-company/articleshow/62185925.cms.

Gould had founded TFF in 2011 as a next-generation innovation platform for sustainable food and agriculture. In its first four years of operation TFF had helped more than 5000 university students generate viable business plans to address the vexing problem of feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 (see Exhibit 1). At least 18 new student-led companies had been launched and increasing numbers of professional mentors and support organizations were now joining the TFF global challenge and summit.In 2015 Gould had to make a difficult decision: to either maintain TFF’s current status as an internal initiative at Syngenta or register it as an independent non-governmental organization (NGO). Syngenta had provided critical financial support as Gould had launched the TFF platform and importantly it had allowed her to allocate some of her working hours to the initiative. But now that TFF had reached the scale that required significant funding and a dedicated staff and leader Gould wondered if it would be better to take the platform outside. Independent NGO status would enable the organization to raise funds from a wider base of supporters but there was no guarantee that those funds would actually flow. Gould wondered if the enhanced flexibility outweighed the increased risk. She also wondered how senior Syngenta colleagues would view the move. They had encouraged her to keep TFF as an internal Syngenta initiative back in 2011 when she had been planning to leave the company as an entrepreneur focused on nurturing early-stage food and agriculture start-ups. Would they once again push her to maintain TFF’s inside status now that the organization’s industry impact was growing but required additional resources?TFF’s OriginsGould launched TFF in 2011 convinced that next-generation innovation was the key to solving humanity’s most pressing food challenges. Her inspiration began when she studied for her master’s degree in agriculture system innovation at Columbia University where her peers and colleagues were passionate advocates of openness transparency and cross-sector collaboration aimed at altering the agricultural status quo through innovative business models. Later when she joined Syngenta she found that these ideals sharply contrasted those of the policy makers and industry leaders she encountered in her work. The complexities of agricultural regulations and the need for large-scale solutions led most industry experts to believe that global food challenges would ultimately be solved through traditional product-based technology research done by incumbent firms with laboratories scientists legal teams and other resources required to bring new ideas to market. For a firm like Syngenta to gain the approvals needed to launch a new active ingredient for crop protection for example it could take more than 10 years of research and legal processing at a cost of US$280 million. It was hard for industry insiders to see how business-model innovations and low-tech solutions from outside the traditional systems could have an appreciable effect on global food production in the near future. At the same time Syngenta executives were sensitive to ongoing societal changes that posed risks to their traditional business model. For example although investment in agricultural technology had been increasing rapidly in recent years there was a troubling trend of growing public distrust of big agribusiness in general and of technological innovations in particular (see Exhibits 2 and 3). Technological agricultural innovation primarily took the form of chemical modifications to pesticides and other crop protectors seed breeding using biotechnology and genetic methods or cultivation of bio-pesticides and all of these technologies were controversial in the eyes of the public. Regulators were increasingly recognizing public views on the wisdom of new product approvals and public distrust represented the growing risk that some long-term innovation projects would never be commercialized. Most Syngenta leaders felt that public opinion about the need for traditional agricultural innovation and the benefits of these would align with those of industry if citizens had a realistic understanding of how modern food systems worked and how much time and effort went into assuring the safety of new products before their release. Michael Kock global head of intellectual property at Syngenta pointed out the risks of weak public understanding: “People have a romantic view of how food security works and what it means to be an innovator. Many negative perceptions are based on a lack of understanding which in the end limits an innovation’s potential to solve problems.” A second worrisome trend for the industry was the changing work preferences of the millennial generation. University graduates increasingly chose to work in small- and medium-sized businesses or to launch their own entrepreneurial start-ups. Few young people entered the farming industry directly. According to Kock in 2011 Syngenta could “already see that the way of attracting researchers in the past by offering lifelong employment and a secure income was no longer attractive for the next generation [which] wants to work on projects in an open environment and change companies every few years.” There were concerns that this trend could drive fundamental changes in the nature of future research. Some company leaders were looking for ways to explore possible future innovation scenarios. Consequently when Gould announced her plan to leave Syngenta and launch TFF as an entrepreneurial venture senior colleagues encouraged her to launch it as an internal Syngenta project instead. Executives welcomed the opportunity to test new ways of speaking to young people and to gain perspective on youth employment needs and requirements. Gould was offered a newly created position in the department of external affairs dedicated to next-generation innovation and engagement (see Exhibit 4) and she was allocated a budget to support the first innovation challenge. Happy to have the freedom of an entrepreneur along with the structure and security of a corporate job Gould agreed to the arrangement.Launch and Early GrowthThe first TFF Challenge was a simple event that invited university students to think deeply about global food challenges and how to address them. Company executives who attended the event were pleased to see young people gaining a deeper view of both agricultural realities and the complexities involved in finding solutions. What they did not expect was the depth of passion that the challenge evoked in these young enthusiasts and the resulting speed of TFF’s growth. Participants spread the news of TFF over digital and university networks and the number of challenge participants grew significantly each year (see Exhibit 5). TFF and the winning teams from the annual challenge also attracted the attention of international media outlets like Huffington Post Forbes and Fast Company. TFF’s Facebook page had already accumulated more than 9000 followers by 2014. In response to this growing visibility and enthusiasm Gould continuously expanded the scope and professionalism of activities. By 2014 TFF had evolved into a multifaceted platform for cultivating and launching transformative food system innovations and building the human capacity needed to achieve that ambitious goal. The platform was uniquely designed to attract and empower the next generation of youth who had the passion for a more sustainable world the willingness to change the status quo and the cutting-edge technological knowledge of digital natives. TFF made an impact through three key pillars: the TFF Challenge an annual two-day summit and its diverse global community. The TFF ChallengeThe TFF Challenge invited university students from all fields of study to generate prototypes for previously unseen solutions to the complex challenges of global food security. Applicants were invited to use online training resources to improve their ideas and develop business plans. Gould commented “We expected to see bold and innovative technologies with the latest resources . . . [but] innovations are not enough. The projects had to be implementable with serious scalability potential on a global level.” Applicants who made it onto the competition’s shortlist received individual coaching to cultivate entrepreneurial go-to-market skills. As such the platform was instrumental in transforming students into innovative entrepreneurs regardless of their final placements in the competition. Participants found the experience inspiring and transformational and after four years several had already succeeded in launching start-up businesses (see Exhibit 6). Max Loessl co-founder of Agrilution GmbH (Agrilution) commented on the experience: “Before we got in touch with TFF our team was just developing ideas around vertical farming and brainstorming about how to get involved in this new technology. TFF pushed us to make our idea more realistic and business oriented.” Gerald Perry co-founder of FoPo Food Powder (FoPo) agreed: “TFF was the first single step for us to start our journey. [In response to] all the encouragements and pressures we went to Philippines and tested our business plan.” The Two-Day Annual TFF SummitThis second pillar brought together competing teams of students entrepreneurs investors and thought leaders working in food agriculture innovation entrepreneurship and science. TFF summits had a stimulating and unique style that prompted participants to call them their “best event[s] personally and professionally.” In addition to the final competition the program included inspirational talks from leaders at cutting-edge organizations like the XPRIZE Foundation IDEO and the Kirchner Impact Foundation. It also included skill-building sessions and learning games that explored innovation impact sustainability and emerging technologies like precision agriculture vertical farming and synthetic biology. Participants were encouraged to learn and to make the most of networking opportunities. The Diverse and Passionate TFF Global CommunityTFF’s third pillar was a stable community of individual enthusiasts and organizations that were leading the search for agricultural innovations in their respective fields. TFF sought to pool the expertise of this group to solve problems that no single person institution community or country could realistically conquer alone. Since next-generation innovation was an open collaborative experimental approach to finding solutions the TFF community served the important role of assuring ongoing collaborations among those who had initially engaged in competitions. Community members were committed to actively teaching and coaching one another and also to connecting and sharing resources.Choosing the Path to ScaleBy 2014 TFF’s rapid growth had made Gould and her colleagues question its long-term viability as an internal corporate initiative. The budget allocated by Syngenta had been increased each year to total $600000 by 2014. This covered platform development costs and direct expenses for the annual challenge and summit; nevertheless it was not sufficient to support a full-time dedicated staff and this created a critical bottleneck in TFF’s development. Taking TFF outside Syngenta would give Gould the flexibility to raise additional operating and investment funds from other individuals and institutions concerned about food security and agricultural innovation. Independent status would also make it easier for TFF to work with professionals who otherwise might fear conflicts of interest when collaborating on Syngenta-funded projects. Syngenta had always been hands off with TFF allowing Gould to build without directly promoting Syngenta interests. Nevertheless Gould saw a need to assure participants that TFF was not a public relations project for Syngenta but rather a truly collaborative attempt to find food-security solutions. Independent NGO status would immediately resolve all of those concerns and support TFF’s evolution into a third-party platform serving the interests of the entire industry. In fact by serving the industry TFF might offer even greater value to Syngenta. The entire agribusiness industry was gradually moving away from selling isolated products and toward selling integrated solutions. Gould’s colleague Kock had noted that Syngenta could “produce a building block for the solutions” but could not produce solutions in their entirety. He saw a need “to collaborate with others by design in order to integrate the building blocks into a solution.” An independent TFF might have even more opportunities to safely explore new technologies and collaborative business models without immediately affecting core business activities.  On the other hand the TFF competition and summit greatly benefitted from Syngenta’s commitment and industry-leading support as well as from the personal time devoted by participating company leaders and professionals. Gould knew she could count on Syngenta’s continuing support for TFF if she took it outside but if she wanted to appreciably grow TFF inside Syngenta she would have to identify and demonstrate its tangible value for the firm. Until now TFF had been housed in the external affairs department where Gould worked. Nurturing relations with the millennial generation and a broader community of interested professionals clearly delivered value to external affairs. Moreover Syngenta executives had been very pleased that TFF had provided more than the initially desired medium for delivering Syngenta’s views to the public. Indeed TFF drove deep dialogues and two-way conversations among people with very different views. As Steve Maund head of Syngenta’s global License-to-Operate platform said “I see value in talking to outsiders. If you have conversations only with those who agree with you you don’t learn very much.” Gould had regularly briefed Syngenta staff and executives about her insights on millennials and the firm had recruited several TFF alumni. Clearly TFF brought value to Syngenta’s human resource team. Maund noted an even broader contribution:People want careers with purpose. If you can [connect people] and express the ideas [of working together on solutions] as TFF and we in License-to-Operate try to do it brings meaning in itself. Corporations that engage in these types of activities will be much more attractive to the next generation of employees. . . . Some [TFFers] may develop a passion for innovation that lasts their entire life. They will study agriculture go into research or launch startups to work on agriculture innovation. Out of that process real innovation will emerge.Bangladeshi student Lamia Anwar Shama was a case in point. She noted “When I started my undergrad as a business student I thought I would become a banker. But after I participated in the TFF Challenge and won I shifted my interests and ended up working in the agricultural sector.”Nevertheless until the innovations emerging from TFF could be incorporated into the company’s product innovation cycle the business case for Syngenta would be difficult to assess. Despite repeated attempts by Gould and others the goal of leveraging TFF had not yet been attained. As Juan Gonzalez Valero Syngenta’s head of public policy and partnerships pointed out There were real discussions about whether we could help some of these ideas to grow by incorporating them in our innovation cycles but most ideas were not sufficiently developed to grow within an organization like Syngenta. We even looked at the possibility for joint sponsorship of some ideas but that did not materialize either.In practice the TFF ideas that had gone to market up to this point were either low-tech improvements to existing food systems—primarily in developing economies—or modifications to agricultural business models like vertical farming. As a product-driven company Syngenta struggled to see how business-model innovations could be of use. The seeds of some very interesting early-stage technology innovations had appeared in the TFF Challenge but no one had been able to bring those ideas into Syngenta’s business activities or research labs which of necessity had to focus on much more mature technologies.A Future Within Syngenta?With $13.4 billion in sales and more than 28000 employees in 2015 Syngenta was a leader in agricultural innovation (see Exhibit 7). Approximately 10 per cent of its revenues were allocated to research and development each year even in periods of market downturn generating a very strong pipeline of products under development. Company leaders were deeply committed to sustainability and Syngenta was one of four co-sponsors of the Vision 2050 project of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Former chief executive officer Michael Mack and Valero were key contributors to the WBCSD’s work of developing a blueprint for achieving the well-being of 9 billion people living within the limits of the planet. In addition to this external collaborative work with other multinational corporations (MNCs) Syngenta executives were formulating ideas for an integrated company strategy that would transform the traditional culture and mindset from its previous narrow focus on objective science and technology innovation to a more comprehensive view of technology serving the land and the people who worked it. In 2013 Syngenta announced its Good Growth Plan—a commitment to continuous improvement on six specific and measurable sources of value to society including resource efficiency ecosystem rejuvenation and the strengthening of rural communities (see Exhibit 8). The engine for achieving these targets remained firmly rooted in product-based technological innovation. That model had served Syngenta well and the firm had amassed critical skills and resources for maximizing its value. No one believed the fundamental business model should be altered but there was a growing view that broader change was on the horizon and would require more vigilance than the company had needed in the past. Maund elaborated: Gould and I tried to challenge the organization to think a bit more broadly than our traditional business model methods because both of us saw the need for our organization to evolve. You need your big machinery to scale and address a global market but you also need the lean mean fighting machines with the startup mentality to be sure that you avoid a Kodak moment of missing the new trends.Robert Neill Syngenta’s head of global product marketing addedThe big value for me of TFF was preventing narrow-mindedness. The TFF teams came up with fantastic ideas that addressed a huge variety of opportunities. Maybe their particular ideas wouldn’t immediately make it to market but they sure challenged you to think outside the box! It was very energizing.As Maund observed “There is a danger that in big companies we business-case new ideas to death. I recall a Silicon Valley speaker once saying that an innovation is unlikely to prove disruptive if it fits your current business model.”Although she was happy to hear these supporting views Gould questioned whether she could produce any measurable evidence of their validity. She was acutely aware that Syngenta like most MNCs facing an ongoing global market slowdown had in early 2014 launched a cost-cutting program intended to save $1 billion by 2018. In such an environment she would have to develop tangible impact measurements to justify TFF’s growing space within the organization. Some scholars and consultants were beginning to develop metrics for the softer elements of sustainable business such as employee and stakeholder engagement but no standards had yet emerged. She certainly could not devote her time to that problem when so much other work was needed to maintain the momentum she had worked so hard to build with TFF.An Independent Future?Although independence would allow TFF to seek new funding sources the work of securing the funds would put huge pressure on an already lean management team. Moreover Gould needed to sharpen TFF’s value proposition for everyone involved. She had to articulate the value to financial sponsors and the value that would keep TFF community members actively participating over time. Of course she also had to assure that there was value for new students so they would continue to enter the TFF Challenge each year. So far students had been motivated by sheer passion for starting businesses and finding sustainable food systems and by the opportunity to experience the unique TFF Summit and be coached by experienced mentors. Of course students also liked travelling to the summit which was held in a different national capital each time. If TFF were to have a real impact on food stability moreover Gould would have to further develop the potential of taking innovative ideas to market. Kock had noted “TFF brings together students industry academics startups coaches and sponsors but all of that is not so well orchestrated that you can say [TFF is] maximizing the potential for industry innovation.” The TFF Challenge and Summit did a great job of kick-starting the go-to-market process but sustained and continuous investments of professional time and money would be needed to fully nurture most of the TFF Challenge ideas. Building the TFF community into a formal incubator or accelerator might be one path to follow. Gould wondered what additional resources and activities she would have to employ to realize that type of solution. A very different possibility would be to reorient the TFF Challenge so that it was no longer strictly a student competition but a public incentive prize challenge instead like the XPrize which offered large crowd-sourced financial rewards to anyone who could provide answers. Gould knew such approaches had been used to generate late-stage prototypes to specific information technology and engineering challenges but it wasn’t clear that they could generate viable ideas to address a broader challenge like ensuring global food security. In her view these approaches had another more serious flaw: they had little potential to cultivate the dedicated community of next-generation innovators that she and other TFF mentors were so passionate about. Edward Silva executive director of TFF commented on this community:The communities that support incentive prize competitions are often an undervalued asset. They bring diversity that boosts the potential for creative interaction. It is clear from TFF summits that out-of-the box solutions—those that really push the edge of the envelope—happen when food and agriculture intersect with other fields.In his view large open challenges were unlikely to really push the edge. He therefore favoured small incentive prize competitions focused on issues like vertical farming or open data conducted in partnership with other organizations seeking insight ideas and talent. It seemed that no matter what path TFF followed there was work to be done. TFF had been successful so far in building interest and an understanding of global food challenges nurturing ideas to resolve those challenges and building the human capacity to put the ideas into action. With the right boost in resources and the right shift in focus TFF could continue on that accelerated path. As she pondered the next moves Gould realized that much was at stake. Exhibit 1: The Challenge of Feeding over 9 billion people by 2050In a presentation at the 2016 TFF Summit in Zurich scientist and agriculture change agent Mike Gould pointed out the following information: For 10000 years agriculture was sustainable. Productivity was low but the population was small (less than 2 billion before 1900) and resources were plentiful. However in the 20th century the human population increased at an unprecedented rate reaching to more than 6 billion by 2000. New technologies bring dramatic increases in agricultural production but also require massive inputs of non-renewable energy water and chemicals. This model is not sustainable as the world population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. This means we need to produce as much food as the entire human population has produced in the past 10000 years. As we are already using nearly all the farmable land on the planet and 70% of the earth’s fresh water we need to find new more sustainable agricultural technologies that provide very high productivity but require lower input of arable land fresh water and fertilizers.Compounding the problems of population growth and natural resource limits noted by Gould in his 2016 speech modern agricultural systems were stressed in the 20th century by a rapidly growing demand for protein. As poverty declined new middle-class families switched from plant- to meat-based sources of protein. Since livestock farming was more resource intensive (e.g. in terms of feed water and land) and emitted more carbon than crop farming planetary systems underwent a double hit as the population swelled. The poverty and low education levels of smallholder farmers posed another major challenge. In a short-sighted drive to boost crop yields and incomes uneducated farmers overused pesticides and fertilizers eventually triggering runoff that contaminated water and soil resources for future use. Smallholders also under-invested in safety precautions leading to injuries and toxic exposures. Finally the search for income growth drove younger generations of farming families off the farm and into the cities for jobs and education. Farm communities faced potential collapse or extinction as the pool of skilled labour declined.

(Niantic) learned of the phenomenal reception of his company’s newest augmented-reality mobile game Pokémon GO he must have been pleased. Not only had the game far surpassed internal company projections it had quickly become the best-selling mobile game of all time. Nevertheless Hanke was forced to deal with cheating applications (apps) and websites that told players where to find rare Pokémon allowed their mobile phones to appear to be in different locations around the world and let them immediately advance to higher levels in the game. It became Hanke’s mission to shut down these third-party developers so that the game could continue to develop according to his vision.In late August 2016 Niantic announced that it was shutting down the cheat sites because they were overloading the company’s servers and giving some players unfair advantages. “We continue to work to ensure the integrity of the game and the health of our servers by blocking unauthorized access and at times by banning offending accounts” Hanke wrote on the official Pokémon GO blog. “This includes blocking bots and data scraping operations and banning end-user accounts associated with those activities.”Many players were outraged by the changes and flooded the App Store with enough one-star reviews to bring Pokémon GO’s overall rating down to two stars. The backlash intensified when Niantic removed its own “steps away” feature which told players how far away Pokémon were. The combined effect was that players were left in the dark particularly in rural areas where Pokémon were few and distant. Without maps to guide players to remote locations players quickly tired of the game’s repetitive mechanics.Some of the game’s most ardent players worried that the game was getting worse instead of better. Meanwhile Pokémon GO’s popularity began to drop almost as fast as it had risen causing some observers to speculate that the game would be gone before the end of the year.BackgroundNiantic Labs: A Google CompanyIn 2011 Google Maps veteran John Hanke was asked to lead a new “ubiquitous computing” division within Google Inc. (Google) called Niantic Labs. “At the time that we started Niantic wearable computing was really just kind of coming onto the scene” Hanke explained. “So we were thinking about what is the post cell phone world going to look like what kinds of devices are people going to use [and] what kind of services would be enabled by these new kinds of hardware?” However at its core Niantic was about advertising. “There’s tremendous opportunity there for businesses that might want to change the behaviour of people to get them to go places they wouldn’t normally go to.”The first product launched by Niantic was a mobile app called Field Trip. Users of the app could walk around in the real world and view information about landmarks near them including photographs historical details and hours of operation. Content was supplemented by more than 300 partners such as museums tourist information centres and tour-guide services. Field Trip also launched on Google Glass a heads-up display mounted on futuristic-looking reading glasses.Augmented RealityAugmented Reality (AR) displayed artificial images on top of reality while virtual reality (VR) involved creating an entirely artificial reality. AR devices were either head-mounted hand-held or spatial. Head-mounted and hand-held AR was achieved through “see-through” technologies such as glasses (e.g. Google Glass) or a camera lens (e.g. smartphones) that combined optical inputs with electronic inputs.Google Glass was an early attempt to commercialize AR and it “exploded with the kind of fuss and pageantry usually reserved for an Apple iSomething” noted the New York Times. “From its unveiling in 2012 it was considered the Gadget yearned after by everyone from nerds and chief executives to chefs and fashionistas. It was the must-have toy that was going to set the gold standard for a new class of wearable computers.”Only it wasn’t. At the time what seemed like the perfect step toward AR was excoriated by tech reviewers for its abysmal battery life software bugs and invasion of privacy. Its $1500 price tag also meant that only a wealthy few could acquire the high-tech toy. “You can’t always predict these things” said Hanke. “Maybe that’s the trend lesson. The fundamental trend may be valid but you know there are going to be fits and starts along the way and maybe that was one of them.”Although a commercial failure Google Glass found new followers long after it was discontinued. Boeing aircraft technicians used it to help access critical data while their hands were occupied with assembly and medical doctors used Google Glass to connect specialists in remote locations to assist with operations or diagnostics. Dr. Peter Chai of the University of Massachusetts Medical School observed that “Consumers weren’t ready for Google Glass but the medical community has given it a second life.” As commercial interest continued to grow Google announced plans for an “Enterprise Edition” popularly referred to as Google Glass 2.0.In 2016 Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) launched a $3000 “mixed reality” headset known as HoloLens. Initially slated to be a consumer device similar to Google Glass it received most of its initial interest from commercial customers. “We totally underestimated the commercial interest in this thing” admitted Chris Capossela Microsoft’s chief marketing officer. Commercial customers included building supply retailer Lowe’s Companies Inc. Case Western Reserve University the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Saab Automobile AB and the Volvo Group (Volvo). Among the applications under development (see Exhibit 1) was HoloTour an “immersive combination of 360-degree video spatial sound and holographic scenery [that] lets you feel like you’re really there.” The technology allowed companies such as Skanska AB a real estate developer to create “the world’s first holographic real estate leasing center.” Microsoft also partnered with Volvo to improve the customer buying experience by encouraging customers to “explore the ins and outs of their potential purchase changing features colors and other options” without having to leave the showroom.Ingress: The Birth of Augmented-Reality GamingHanke’s idea for AR games was born of the frustration of seeing his children glued to television and game consoles instead of playing outside. Yet he knew that videogames were compelling “because games are the things that got me into programming and I didn’t want to take that away.” He elaborated: Why can’t you build a gaming experience that takes place outside—that uses mobile phones or mobile technology? So we put our heads together and we worked on prototypes. I hired some people from Sony from Disney from Electronic Arts and we started thinking about Can we build a game that takes place in the real world? We actually built paper prototypes tried various combinations of rules and explored ideas. That ultimately turned into this game called Ingress.Launched in 2013 when Niantic was still part of Google Ingress was an augmented-reality location-based game that overlaid a fictional world on the real world using a combination of mapping and mobile camera data. Ingress was never intended to reach a mass market but was designed as a platform for augmented-reality gaming upon which Niantic could build other games. Hanke explained:We wanted to create something that was more targeted at gamers because we felt like we could make something that as early adopters they would appreciate and use even if it wasn’t perfect even if the technology wasn’t perfect. . . .We build it around data some of which came from Field Trip. So historical markers and public art are the places that are the key points of interest that you interact with in Ingress and in Pokémon GO. These things are all kind of built on one another.Ingress players were members of one of two factions that sought to capture “portals” corresponding to real-life locations such as monuments stores and landmarks using data from the Field Trip app. Although Ingress could be played alone the social part of the game proved to be its greatest attraction. “Collaboration and strategy planning . . . ended up being the core of the game” explained Hanke.Ingress proved far more popular than anyone at Niantic expected eventually surpassing 13 million players. Many extolled the health benefits of outdoor gaming a key feature that the development team had not considered. Ingress could be played while walking mountain climbing cycling or running. One 82-year-old woman walked more than 1000 kilometres playing the game. In online forums players shared weight-loss testimonials and described how Ingress had renewed their interest in sports and outdoor activities.Although ensuring that company servers could handle the Internet traffic generated by the game proved more challenging than originally anticipated Niantic was able to scale up sufficiently to prevent major outages.AR gaming also created new revenue-generating opportunities. As Ingress grew in popularity advertisers began paying Niantic to have their stores turned into portals as a way to attract new customers. For instance in France the Paris-based commercial property developer Unibail-Rodamco’s shopping malls were used as portals. Soon Ingress spread across the globe winning over fans as far away as Japan where many employees of the Pokémon Company took up the game.Pokémon GOPokémon a contraction of the words “Pocket Monster” was launched in Japan in 1995 as a video game for the Nintendo Game Boy portable console. It featured the adventures of a boy who travelled the countryside collecting monsters and training them for battle against other Pokémon trainers. The game’s early success spawned a number of sequels manga (comic books) and anime (animated films).On April 1 2014 a Google Maps software engineer Tatsuo Nomura created a prank in which Pokémon would randomly appear on Google Maps. To catch Pokémon users simply clicked on them. Although the Pokémon prank was not a game in the true sense some Ingress users commented in online social forums that Google should create an AR Pokémon game similar to Ingress. These comments inspired Hanke and his team to pitch the idea of an AR game to the Pokémon Company which owned the Pokémon franchise.Hanke flew to Japan to meet with senior executives at the Pokémon Company conveniently located several floors below Google’s offices in downtown Tokyo. At the time Hanke was unaware that the CEO of the Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara was an avid Ingress fan as were numerous Pokémon Company employees and their families. When they heard that Niantic was interested in developing a Pokémon game they embraced the project even before Hanke could pitch it to them.Hanke believed that Pokémon was “uniquely well-suited” to Niantic’s AR gaming platform. “If you think about the lore or focus it’s about the trainer” he explained. “And this is depicted in the animation series and in the video game. The trainer goes out into the woods goes out into the world and searches for Pokémon.”Around the same time Niantic Labs was nearing the end of its three-year term as a semi-independent division within Google and the company needed to decide whether to spin it out or have it join another Google division such as the Android Mobile division. However because Hanke wanted Niantic’s gaming platform to be available for other mobile ecosystems such as the Apple Store he was able to convince Google that it made more sense for Niantic to be independent.Niantic Inc.In October 2015 Google spun off Niantic with $25 million in series-A funding (see Exhibit 2). Hanke brought with him 70 employees selected from a team that had once numbered more than 2000. Although Hanke had enjoyed his tenure at Google like many talented Google employees he had become disillusioned with the bureaucracy and oversight that limited his ability to innovate and create new products.A lot of it is administrative people management which is fun to some degree but when you get into HR [human resources] reviews a lot of it is just helping people with their career which I know is good but it doesn’t have a lot to do with the product innovation which was the thing that originally interested me.Although the newly independent Niantic continued to support Field Trip and Ingress its main focus was the summer 2016 launch of Pokémon GO. Nevertheless Hanke admitted that without Ingress Pokémon GO would not have been possible. “The whole infrastructure that the game runs on is the second-level technology stack that was built from Ingress.”Pokémon GO Launch DayOn an unseasonably cold July 6 morning John Hanke CEO of Niantic boarded the San Francisco Bay Ferry for his daily commute to Niantic’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Everyone on the Niantic team was excited about unveiling their newest mobile game Pokémon GO. Although they anticipated some minor glitches they felt ready for any fluctuations in demand as they dedicated their entire worldwide quota of machine time to the U.S. launch.Niantic had already launched Pokémon GO in Australia and New Zealand without problems. North America was next followed by Europe and finally Asia. “A staged country rollout [would] keep things under control” Hanke asserted. Then as the numbers for North America started rolling in the team panicked. A few hours into the launch Niantic had already used up its global machine quota. Servers became overloaded and began crashing as users complained of bugs and interruptions. If the team didn’t do something in a hurry the entire launch would be in jeopardy. Hanke frantically called Google CEO Sundar Pichai. When he couldn’t get through he sent an emergency email. “Please send reinforcements!” he wrote.Pichai directed the cloud team to dedicate more servers to Pokémon GO thereby averting disaster. “I don’t know how you plan for something as strange as the way that it took off socially” Hanke recalled. “So we just kind of played catch-up. I wish we had had everything provisioned in advance but I know that if we had it to do over again I’m not sure any one of us would have anticipated that.”Due to its long history and strong following the Niantic team knew that Pokémon GO would be more successful than Ingress. However because they “didn’t do any advertising or marketing” they expected to gradually “bring people on board to teach them about the game to market the game over the course of many months.” When Hanke was later asked why the company had not done a better job of anticipating the explosive growth of Pokémon GO he replied that “we would have sounded insane.” Back in Japan Ishihara was also caught off guard by the game’s popularity which was “100 times bigger than we expected.” Over the next few weeks Nintendo Co. Ltd. (Nintendo) which owned 32 per cent of the Pokémon Company saw its stock price more than double. Pokémon GO also bolstered sales of other Pokémon Company products such as its core video games movies and merchandise.Consumer Behaviour Fuelled by NostalgiaMillennials who grew up with the original Pokémon games were largely responsible for the massive surge in Pokémon GO players during the first few weeks after the launch accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the downloads from the Apple and Google Play stores. As a teenager New York Times reporter Mike Isaac was never swept up by the Pokémon craze of the late 1990s in the same way as many of his friends. “And yet as a 31-year-old reporter for the New York Times” he said he found himself “running wild—with thousands of others—through the streets of San Francisco.” Isaac continued:I can’t help admitting somewhat reluctantly the fun I had wandering around my city catching these goofy monsters and talking to other people about how to do it. Even though I didn’t play much as a kid Pokémon is a cultural touchstone of my youth something that stoked a sense of nostalgia—and something I suddenly became invested in.“To us millennials the early days of videogames and the internet are nostalgic” noted Spanish-American actress Nathalia Ramos. However she also placed importance on the sense of community with other players:For the first time in over decade and a half I found myself in a park running around like a child catching Pokémon and making new friends. For that hour my parent’s voices reminding me of the dangerous world we live in disappeared. I forgot I wasn’t supposed to talk to strangers or hang out in public places after dark. In that moment I could feel that I was a part of something special. It was the first time in my adult life that I felt a true sense of community. I felt connected to my neighbors and my neighborhood. Our generation has Facebook friends on every continent yet we have never met our next-door neighbors.Psychologist Clay Routledge believed that the social and nostalgic aspects of the game connected people through “shared memories” of an earlier period in their lives. However nostalgia and social interaction alone could not explain the explosive growth of Pokémon GO. In fact Pokémon GO was just one of many nostalgia-based product launches in 2016; others included superhero films cereal mascots and flip phones.According to Oxford Internet Institute psychologist Andrew Przybylski Pokémon GO was successful because it created new experiences that combined the elements of the original game series with a unique mobile-based social experience. It meant that players could not only reward themselves with more Pokémon but also share those experiences on their favourite social media sites. Snapchat Instagram Facebook and Flickr became inundated with screen-captures and photographs of players standing next to Pokémon Pokémon in unusual locations and tips on where to find rare Pokémon. “The modern era has trained people for playing Pokémon GO” observed Przybylski.On the other hand many advanced players preferred to disable augmented reality which made it more difficult to capture Pokémon. One gaming site had this suggestion: Do yourself a favor and tap the button at the top right of the screen the next time you enter a capture sequence.Doing so replaces the background with a generic woodland environment which not only makes everything clearer but it also forces the creature to remain focused in the center of the screen instead of flitting about.The Business ModelIn its first two weeks Pokémon GO generated more than $250 million in revenue primarily through in-app payments for items such as Pokéballs and lures. The game also set a record as the fastest to surpass $500 million in revenue reaching the milestone in only 60 days compared with Candy Crush Saga’s 200 days and more than 400 days for other popular mobile games such as Puzzle & Dragons and Clash of Clans. Clash of Clans by Finnish game developer Supercell had been one of the most successful mobile games to date earning nearly $1 billion on $2.3 billion in revenues in 2015. It was also one of the few games that experienced steady year-over-year growth posting revenues of $101 million in 2012 $892 million in 2013 and $1.5 billion in 2014. Other mobile games were more ephemeral often declining as fast as they had risen. “For games on average it takes just two months for the app’s monthly users to decline to 50 per cent of their lifetime peak” observed Craig Palli chief strategy officer of Fiksu a mobile app marketing company:One of the most popular games over the last two years Candy Crush reduced its 2014 forecast after reporting lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue.This caused some unwarranted hand-wringing in the press about the future of mobile games.While it may be newsworthy for a juggernaut like Candy Crush to see falling revenues it’s actually nothing new.Niantic hoped that continually improving the game and adding new features would make Pokémon GO as enduring as Ingress or Clash of Clans. To fund that growth Niantic created different types of revenue streams but relied primarily on in-game purchases.Players acquired virtual goods using the game’s own virtual currency known as Poké Coins. These could be earned by completing various in-game actions such as defending a gym from other players or they could be purchased. Defending a gym earned a player 10 Poké Coins. Alternatively players could purchase Poké Coins at a value of one coin per U.S. cent. Players who spent $5.00 or more received bonus coins with larger bonuses for larger purchases (see Exhibit 3). At Pokémon GO’s peak in mid to late July 2016 downloads of the game reached an estimated 27 million per day with revenue topping out at $16 million per day (see Exhibit 4). On average revenue for mobile games was approximately 10 cents per day per user while more popular games such as Candy Crush Saga generated as much as 23 cents per day per user. Niantic believed that Pokémon GO’s per-user revenue was low compared with that of other popular games but with the number of users expected to pass 1 billion by the end of the year the company focused more on volume. “We don’t turn the knobs up on the in-app purchase in the way that some products do” Hanke explained. “We’re trying to be more user friendly I guess in that sense. But it monetizes well.”In Japan Niantic partnered with McDonald’s to create important game sites as a way to supplement revenues and rely less on in-app purchases. Hanke noted: My belief is that the sponsored-location model is a better business model for games.The idea with real world games was to build an advertising model that is deeply tied to the way the game itself works . . . so it doesn’t break the flow of the game. It doesn’t feel like something is grafted on. That’s what we’re trying to do and it will provide a complement to in-app purchase. In-app purchase will be the majority of the revenue but it does take some of the pressure off of us to squeeze hard on the purchase side which would be detrimental to the game.Despite the clear benefits of sponsored locations Niantic was reluctant to enter into business partnerships particularly if it involved in-game advertisements or commercial logos overlaid on game maps. “We don’t want to have too many commercial locations in the game because the original spirit of it was get out and discover these interesting [things]. . . . If there is one thing we learned from Google it is to go light on [the advertising].”Estimating costs for mobile game hosting often proved difficult as it depended on factors that were hard to predict such as the amount of time users spent in the game resource utilization and so on. Andrew Boring a systems engineer with cloud-hosting company SwiftStack estimated that game hosting could cost between 5 cents and 25 cents per user per month. However he also noted that “many users won’t use all their allotment so you can under provision and oversubscribe as part of your model if you plan for rapid capacity changes. You’ll also receive discounts as your usage increases so you achieve per unit cost savings as your usage increases.” At the same time Pokémon GO’s heavy use of geolocation and mapping meant that its server utilization costs were likely to be more expensive than those of many mobile games.The explosive growth of Pokémon GO also proved problematic as distracted drivers caused crashes and landmarks were overrun with players. After crowds gathered in the Holocaust Museum in Washington the museum director pleaded to have it excluded from the game. Niantic was also criticized for having Pokémon in churches cemeteries and memorials. By using the geographic data from Field Trip and Ingress to create Pokéstops and Pokémon gyms the company had inadvertently drawn crowds to sacred and hallowed sites. Within the first few months after the game’s launch Niantic faced numerous lawsuits claiming damages for injuries and trespass although legal experts did not expect them to have a major impact on the company’s earnings.Building on the Ingress PlatformAt its launch Pokémon GO was at best a “minimum viable product.” Nevertheless Niantic had no desire to create an AR version of the original Nintendo console game. Instead it originally planned to emulate and replicate the key features and gameplay mechanics of Ingress. Hanke explained: It will change and evolve quite substantially over the next few years. If you want to predict the future you can look at the past. A lot of what we’re doing with Pokémon we learned through three years of hard work with Ingress: building up that community around the world maturing that technology. . . . The group gameplay and the events for Ingress are really the lifeblood of that game. You can expect to see things like that in Pokémon GO. This type of game lends itself well to people coming together for big events that are part competitive part social part just a big party. They’re a ton of fun. They solidify the user base.For instance one of the first Ingress features planned for Pokémon GO was linking distant teams together. “To be successful you have to be part of a team” explained Hanke. “You have to work with people locally and you have to know players in other cities and then that expands globally. So in Europe people in Germany and Russia and the U.K. and Italy are all cooperating together.”Ingress also had regional events where players gathered in the tens of thousands to compete in teams participate in activities purchase merchandise and interact with developers and other fans (see Exhibit 5). Niantic planned to replicate these types of events for Pokémon GO with Pokémon walks in major cities. “It’s a great way to retain your players over time and keep them interested in the game.”ChinaIshihara hoped to grow the user based by expanding into mainland China. However the game relied on Google Maps and Google Services to function and both were unavailable in China. Although some computer-savvy users found ways to bypass what was known as the “Great Firewall of China” Niantic still needed to supply essential geographic data.Meanwhile at least one Chinese clone of Pokémon GO had already appeared. City Spirits Go was launched in China in March 2016 while Pokémon GO was still undergoing beta-testing in Japan. City Spirits Go was not an AR game in the true sense; instead it displayed creatures on a three-dimensional-map image. However in other ways the game was nearly identical to Pokémon GO. And similar to Niantic the Quanzhou Fujian–based developer supported itself by offering in-game purchases that ranged in price from a few cents to nearly $100. Although its revenues were unknown City Spirits Go quickly rose to the top of the mobile gaming charts in China.New FeaturesOne of the first accessories for Pokémon GO was a $30 watch-like device that vibrated or lit up when players were near Pokémon. Players simply tapped the device known as Pokémon GO Plus to capture nearby Pokémon. Niantic also planned to introduce smartwatch integration so that players would not need to constantly stare at their phones. Over the longer term the company hoped to introduce glasses with a heads-up display. However unlike Google Glass Niantic’s AR glasses would be inexpensive and unobtrusive. Such a device could be paired with Pokémon GO Ingress or any other AR game supported by the company. Hanke hoped AR glasses would eventually supplant virtual reality (VR) glasses:It is the direction that I think is far more interesting and promising for technology and really for humanity than VR for example because you know in a VR situation you’re isolating yourself from everything around you and entering this completely virtual space. [AR glasses are] designed to enhance the things you do as a human being: being outside socializing with other people shopping playing having fun. AR can make all those things better and I think when we eventually get there the technology is significantly more challenging than VR because of the need to register reality. . . . And I think the opportunity there is a really big one not only for gaming but it will be the next big transformative step in technology.The success of Pokémon GO brought AR gaming to mainstream audiences including game developers. As more independent developers pitched ideas to Niantic Hanke envisioned an ecosystem of AR games built around Niantic’s gaming platform:We will be working closely with these people because the technology is something that we probably know better than anyone else on the server side in terms of how to make it work. But games are an interesting thing; you can’t corner the market on creativity. So there are a lot of great ideas out there and great teams out there; our goal is to enable them with our unique real-world technology and the data but to really let other people with great vision drive those projects forward and add to what we’ve done: not to just copy the mechanics of Ingress or Pokémon GO but to take that even further and add new elements to it. . . . I think that there’s a lot of room for this genre of games to continue to grow.Many Pokémon GO players complained that the game bore little resemblance to the original Nintendo console game. At the very least they wanted to be able to trade between players and engage in battles with other players and “wild” Pokémon. “Battling is a category that we do best at Pokémon” Ishihara observed. However “it’s important to really carefully consider any feature that may increase the difficulty and raise the barrier to entry for more casual users.”Combatting the CheatsShortly after the gamed launched online social forums began to discuss ways to circumvent its rules. A Reddit group called Silph Road discussed hidden attributes of various Pokémon so that players could determine which creatures were the strongest and most valuable. It also detailed requirements for advancing as a trainer and provided other details about the inner workings of the game many of which players could use to advance more quickly.Members of another Reddit group were able to access raw game data that allowed them to publish detailed maps of the locations of various Pokémon. This initially required some familiarity with computer code but more user-friendly instructions gradually began to appear. Players who were frustrated by the lack of rare Pokémon in their locations could use the map cheats to locate desired Pokémon. However using the software was a violation of the game’s terms of service so players who did so risked being banned from the game.By August 2016 sites like pokévision.com began publishing easy-to-use maps of Pokémon. Later that month PC World magazine published a guide to the best map cheats. Mark Hachman PC World senior editor wrote:Numerous maps are available but here are the best Pokémon GO maps. The first at pokecrew.com zeroes in on your location and begins showing what Pokémon might be nearby. And if you happen to live in the Boston area you’re in real luck: a sweet Google Map known as Gotta Catch ’Em All happens to list all the locations local players have found complete with a list of rare and ultra-rare Pokémon. A separate Google Map pegs Pokémon locations in Seattle and Tennessee. Pokemapper also provides a worldwide look at Pokémon locations but without the sophistication of other sites.The Pokémon maps encouraged taxi drivers to offer Pokémon collection rides. Pokémon GO Streetcars in Manchester England had 12 Pokémon cars that could be hired for £20 per hour. “Quite a few of our staff play Pokémon” explained Naveed Arshad director of Pokémon GO Streetcars:We had the idea that we could use it as a marketing gimmick and it’s just exploded. . . .I’ve only just started I’m on level four. . . .We’ve got specific Pokémon drivers. They’re on level 18 or 20 they know everything.[We also use] live Pokémon maps on Google that tell you where the Pokémon are.Similar services often operated by freelance drivers who were also Pokémon players appeared in other cities around the world. Molly Fitzpatrick senior editor of New York–based Fusion explained why she hired a driver to help her catch Pokémon:I hatched three eggs caught about a dozen Pokémon—a total that would be much higher if my app had worked properly or if I had been more focused on hunting than talking—and visited more Pokéstops than I could count. But the company alone was well worth the cost.This is the truth about Pokémon GO: It’s not about finding Pokémon. It’s about finding other people. The game is better played in a group than as an individual—in part because you can share the attractive powers of lures and pool information about recent Pokémon sightings but primarily because it’s simply more fun that way.In August 2016 Niantic announced that it was banning all third-party access to its mapping data. Niantic’s chief marketing officer Mike Quigley believed that there was no other option. “They were just crushing us on the server side” he said.I won’t say it’s a no-win situation but it’s a tough balance. You’ve got to keep fans happy but you also have to keep the core product accessible.Some of the server outages back in July were a punch in stomach. For us for fans for The Pokémon Company too—it’s not a good signal for their brand. We’re very close to them and we have to do right by the brand by our players and Niantic. That’s why we had to make some of those hard decisions like blocking third-party sites. It’s difficult but ultimately it’s the right thing to do for the life of the product.Many players quit the game because they eventually became bored with the repetitive nature of collecting Pokémon in the wild. Moreover without maps showing nearby Pokémon users became frustrated with the randomness of the game. “This is likely to alienate players especially if done with little explanation” observed Mark Humphery-Jenner of the University of New South Wales:Some commentators have branded the game “broken.”In Pokémon GO’s case the feature in question was “Pokémon tracking.” A core aspect of the game is that it creates a virtual representation of the player’s real-world location which is then populated with Pokémon characters for players to collect by walking around. But to catch Pokémon players need to know where they are—and without Pokémon tracking players are left wandering aimlessly and relying on luck to find them.Despite the growing chorus of discontent Niantic was intractable. No matter how many times Hanke was asked the question “When are you going to include battles?” the answer was always the same. “It’s something that will probably make its way onto our road map.”Shortly after blocking third-party mapping sites Niantic announced that it was also banning rooted or jailbroken phones in order to prevent GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing a technique that allowed players to virtually teleport themselves anywhere in the world to catch rare Pokémon and gain other advantages. Many players complained that Niantic was punishing players who had legitimate reasons for rooting their phones. One study estimated that more than a quarter of Android users rooted their phones mostly for legitimate purposes such as installing backup software; improving battery life by removing unneeded preinstalled apps; and gaining early access to software and security updates.Despite Niantic’s efforts new cheating software appeared on an almost daily basis (see Exhibit 6). PokeGOD for instance could play the game virtually allowing players to catch Pokémon without leaving their homes. Some players complained that Niantic was not doing enough to crack down on cheaters. Fad or Phenomenon?Prior to the launch of Pokémon GO the term “Pokémon” was already a more popular search term in Google than any mobile games had been at the height of their popularity. When the game was launched that popularity surged to unprecedented levels only to decline at an almost equally steep rate (see Exhibit 7). In response some observers proclaimed the rapid demise of the game. One was New Zealand sociologist Robert Bartholomew who exclaimed “Mark my words; if the history of fads and crazes is anything to go by Pokémon GO will not last long. While 2016 may turn out to be the American Summer of Pokémon GO it will likely be gone by the year’s end.” He predict that the game was not only “fading fast” but would soon “go the way of Flappy Bird Fruit Ninja and Candy Crush.”Technology columnist Phil Owen was even blunter in his assessment of the game. “There was never any question that the popularity of ‘Pokémon GO’ would fade pretty quickly” he asserted “because it requires too much of a time investment for casual players to keep at it for long. The real question instead was whether it would be able to sustain a substantial core base of users over a long period.”However even if the direst predictions were to prove accurate Bartholomew believed the new genre that Niantic had created would have staying power long beyond Pokémon: “Pokémon GO will likely go down in history as the game that started the new augmented-reality movement on a global scale in the same way that Pong and Pac-Man ushered in new eras in video games.”Meanwhile even as downloads continued to decline revenues stabilized at a respectable $2 million per day in September. At the same time the Niantic team breathed a collective sigh of relief. After an exhausting summer they welcomed the respite and the opportunity to be “a little more thoughtful about the next set of features.”For Hanke Pokémon GO and Ingress were part of a greater mission to enlighten the world about the benefits of AR and AR games. The Niantic team believed that unlike traditional games such as Angry Birds FarmVille and Candy Crush which enjoyed massive surges in popularity only to die out months or years later Ingress and Pokémon GO would be around for many years. As Ingress reached its four-year anniversary for instance it was more popular than ever. Hanke believed this difference came down to one factor: the human need to socialize. In his view playing AR games was less like playing traditional video games and more like playing league sports. Baseball or bowling for example drew people together not only to compete with each other but also to socialize.CONCLUSIONAs the wish list for new features continued to grow Niantic’s complement of 70 programmers staff and engineers found themselves barely able to support the existing game features. Much of their time was spent blocking cheat sites fixing bugs and planning events. Until they could hire additional staff they needed to prioritize new features. They also wondered what to do about the cheat sites that took a heavy toll on the company’s servers when they accessed maps and data but were popular with players who found the game’s rules and limitations to be repetitive and boring. “These superfans are tired of doing battle with Niantic itself when they argue that they’re just trying to help make the game experience better” explained author and tech journalist Paul Tassi:But the fact remains . . . that the game still does not have an effective tracking system now three months after launch. . . . Many regions [of the world] have never experienced Pokémon GO with a fully working tracker which is a shame because there was no better experience in the game than being able to hunt for a specific rare Pokémon in the wild that showed up on your radar. But with the old broken system and the new one which only works half the time that experience is hard to replicate.Others were frustrated that Pokémon GO lacked many of the most popular features in the original Nintendo console games. United Kingdom–based technology journalist Rob Price admitted that he was initially obsessed by the game. But as a millennial who grew up with Pokémon he lamented the lack of features from the original games. “Aside from outward appearances the app has few of the elements that made the original ‘Pokémon’ games such smash hits” he complained:You can’t trade Pokémon with other players. You can’t battle other players (you’re forced to leave your Pokémon in “gyms” where they are controlled by the computer in battles). You can’t even battle wild Pokémon before you catch them; you’re forced to just throw Pokéball after Pokéball and pray.As Niantic faced a growing chorus of discontent it considered its options. Pokémon GO could continue to evolve in the pattern of Ingress with teams and live events or Niantic could abandon its plan and create an entirely new gaming experience that focused on features such as battles and trading found in the original Pokémon games.Should Niantic expand to meet the anticipated demand of AR gaming or should it partner with third-party developers including “cheat” developers who were popular with players but had violated the company’s terms of service? Some of those developers had earned significant revenue from their “services” while Niantic incurred most of the costs.Finally what options should Niantic explore in its efforts to find ways to fund its unanticipated growth: additional funding rounds more in-app purchases and advertising and/or additional commercial location partnerships with companies such as McDonald’s Japan?Exhibit 1: Microsoft HoloLens “Mixed Reality” ApplicationsActiongram BetaActiongram delivers an eclectic mix of holograms that enables new forms of storytelling.

As the chief executive officer (CEO) of Fancam Pty Ltd. (Fancam) Le Roux had spent the past month in the United States establishing and strengthening client relationships for his four-year-old business. He had also been having difficult conversations with some of his resellers in the market. Since early 2011 Fancam had sold its innovative high-definition 360-degree crowd images to a number of major sports leagues and events: the National Football League (NFL) the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States; the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) championship; the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby Sevens tournament; the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour Finals in the United Kingdom; and the Indian Premier League cricket league.Fancam’s growth had been driven in part by its network of resellers around the world. Although these sales agent companies had provided access to exciting sports team brands in markets that Le Roux and his South African colleagues were less familiar with the existing channel sales structure had reached a breaking point. Le Roux acknowledged that “it was just too difficult to manage all these people and everyone was always unhappy and they were not making enough money and we were not making enough money.”Fancam’s sales in 2013 had declined by 60 per cent over the previous year and 2014 numbers were still down more than 40 per cent from the 2012 results. Le Roux had a 26-hour trip ahead of him and he needed to make some urgent decisions about Fancam’s strategic channel management and sales strategy including his approach to reseller exclusivity agreements incentives and in-house sales capabilities. The perceived entitlement of some resellers had strained relationships: Le Roux suspected that the resellers felt they had built the business. At the same time some clients were frustrated by apparent inconsistencies between Fancam and its resellers. A major American reseller was expecting an answer this month about exclusive rights to this lucrative market and Le Roux knew how important the United States would be to his 2015 and 2016 targets. The NBA Finals were less than four months away and the new NFL season kicked off in six months’ time. Fancam had experimented with a number of incentives and exclusivity approaches which Le Roux believed had thus far kept the company ahead of its major competitors. As he took his seat for the flight he knew changes were required if Fancam was to continue to lead this emerging industry. Establishing FancamFancam was established in mid-2010 in Cape Town South Africa by three college friends: Tinus Le Roux Schalk van der Merwe and James Taylor. Le Roux had studied civil engineering and then theology and had been ordained as a minister. His interest was in supporting education in disadvantaged communities but he struggled to raise the necessary funds. His entrepreneurial spirit led him out of the church to work first in property retail and then in 360-degree photography. Although he knew very little about photography Le Roux was fascinated by the opportunity afforded by 360-degree pictures for effectively and intuitively communicating spatial information.In 2005 the partners founded Virtual Africa a 360-degree imaging company focused on the South African tourism market. Virtual Africa created 360-degree spherical images of safari lodges and other tourism properties to assist these businesses with their online marketing efforts. In late January 2009 Le Roux saw David Bergman’s panoramic GigaPan gigapixel high-definition image of 2 million people at President Obama’s inauguration at the United States Capitol. Le Roux recalled being able to zoom in deeper and deeper through multiple levels of this image as “awesome” and he immediately ordered a GigaPan Epic Pro robotic camera mount. On July 1 2009 he used the camera mount and his existing camera to create a gigapixel image of Cape Town and Table Mountain which went viral. Le Roux did not like the manufacturer’s user interface so he created the image in a different viewer. Although the image received over 200000 views in the first month the partners did not see a repeat business model from images of tourist attractions and they wondered whether people would be more interested in looking at themselves in high resolution. Le Roux and Taylor considered taking a gigapixel 360-degree image of a crowd at a packed sports stadium: a fancam. The partners recognized that the situation of live professional sports games would not allow the two- to three-hour capturing process required by the GigaPan mount so Le Roux and Taylor re-engineered the mechanical set-up and process to allow an image to be captured in a few minutes. Taylor recalled the process:So at that point we were like okay cool we should be able to shoot this whole crowd in high enough resolution using the mechanical set-up in a short enough amount of time. . . . Then I started thinking this would be really cool if we put it in a sphere because then it would feel like you were standing in the field and were looking around and you could see and just zoom in to everybody. . . . At that stage that had never been done; no one had put those two together to create a full spherical high-resolution image.Through his background as a big wave surfer Taylor had built a relationship with Bob Skinstad a former captain of the South African national Springbok rugby team and later a commentator for the SuperSport broadcasting company. Taylor and Le Roux mentioned the idea to Skinstad at a Cape Town networking event and Skinstad offered to help them with access. A couple of months later Skinstad walked Le Roux and Taylor onto the Newlands Stadium rugby field in Cape Town minutes before the kickoff of the May 22 2010 Super Rugby playoff game between the local Stormers and the New South Wales Waratahs. Taylor described the process that followed:We shot a normal fully spherical image of everything around us—the sky and grass etc.—and then when the stands were full we used a 100-millimetre lens at that stage to shoot a bunch of images went home and started to basically manually put everything together: took a picture and the one to the right of it found a few points that correlated then stitched them then the next and the next level by level.After a week of trial and error limited sleep and some software crashes the pair successfully combined the low-resolution spherical image with the high-resolution fan images to create “this beautiful spherical image that we could zoom in and in and see everybody!” The fancam was uploaded and promoted via email and Facebook so that individuals captured in the image could tag themselves: “say they were there and share their position with their buddies.” The following weekend the pair captured a second fancam image of the Super Rugby championship game at Orlando Stadium in Soweto South Africa. Fancam had created an immersive experience that was beginning to generate high levels of social engagement.While monitoring the people tagging themselves in the fancam on social media Le Roux noticed a tag by Pieter Uys then CEO of Vodacom Group Limited (Vodacom) an African mobile and communications company. Le Roux reached out to Uys via Twitter suggesting that Vodacom could create fancams for the upcoming Tri-Nations rugby tournament between the national men’s teams of South Africa New Zealand and Australia. Uys agreed and a plan was developed for Vodacom to sponsor 10 fancams. The Vodacom fancam deal kicked off on August 21 2010 in front of 94713 spectators at the game between South Africa and New Zealand at the iconic First National Bank (FNB) Stadium. Vodacom subsequently decided to withdraw from a number of its rugby sponsorships due to changing business priorities with the result that the rest of the planned fancams did not happen.Breaking into the United States Market Because the South African sponsorship and social media marketplace was relatively small at the time the partners wondered whether their fancam product would be more successful in the United States. Le Roux and Van der Merwe attended the Sports Marketing 2.0 VIP Summit in Atlanta in October 2010 hosted by Pat Coyle the previous executive director of digital business for the Indianapolis Colts. “Pat was instrumental in getting us connected in the United States” said Le Roux. “Not only did he immediately see the potential but he was kind enough to open his Rolodex to help us get going.” As a result of the contacts they developed at the conference the pair presented the product to the Coca-Cola Company and Comcast Corporation immediately after the conference. By January 8 2011 the Colts had contracted Fancam to create an image for their wild-card playoff game against the New York Jets after a concept shoot at their American Football Conference (AFC) South conference game against the Tennessee Titans the week before. Three weeks later the Pittsburgh Steelers invited Fancam to shoot an image of their AFC championship game against the New York Jets which McDonald’s Corporation had agreed to sponsor. The Steelers also provided fans with the opportunity to purchase “one-of-a-kind panoramic” images from their official photo store; individual fans could have their faces placed on the Heinz Field scoreboard in the images (see Exhibit 1 for a selection of this and other Fancam images). Within another four weeks Fancam had shot its first U2 concert on February 13 and its first Daytona 500 race on February 20. Le Roux was a massive U2 fan. He had shared lead singer Bono’s approach to social gospel and had followed the Irish band’s 360-degree tour plans with interest. He had also reached out unsuccessfully to the band’s South African promoters Big Concerts in late 2010. However a week before U2’s concert in Johannesburg on February 13 2011 Craig Evans head of global operations for the band’s international promoters Live Nation requested a meeting and a proof of concept. Taylor who was capturing the NCAA men’s basketball game between Duke and North Carolina flew back to South Africa on February 9 because no other photographers had yet been trained in the capture process. U2 wanted Fancam to shoot the Johannesburg concert that weekend and the Cape Town concert the following weekend but Taylor needed to be back in the United States to shoot the Daytona 500 the following weekend. Taylor captured the Johannesburg concert photograph and Taylor and Le Roux worked non-stop for four days to deliver the image. Taylor was on a plane to the United States when Le Roux received a call from Evans as U2 was expecting them to shoot the Cape Town concert. Le Roux recalled:I ended up doing that one with a fever of 105° Fahrenheit reverse-engineering what James had done having never before even held a DSLR camera in my life—no less using one to capture 70000 fans. It wasn’t the best picture but we got it done! And I think they saw we could operate and that our hearts were in the right place. Soon after we got a call for 26 shows in the United States—and the rest is history.The partners recognized that to take advantage of these opportunities they needed to recruit and train photographers. Taylor searched the Internet for sports photographers and invited an initial group for three days of Fancam-specific training. By June 2011 the company had contracted 10 photographers as part of the business; they each brought their own minimal set of camera equipment to each shoot along with a Fancam-supplied panoramic head. Back in Cape Town Le Roux focused on building the rest of the organization including a chief financial officer chief operations officer and web interface design and fancam image production teams. By the end of 2011 Fancam employed 20 people in South Africa and had contracted a number of students to check image stitching. The production team worked odd hours to process images that photographers uploaded within hours of shoots in Europe Asia Australia or the United States. Le Roux also facilitated a US$75000 investment from an angel investor which Fancam would use to acquire the computing power required to produce high-quality images. An international live entertainment production company offered to acquire Fancam and although the founders declined the offer the company became both a client and a minority shareholder.The industry and competitorsThe sports ecosystem consisted of at least five components including clubs or teams leagues media brands and fans. The clubs including the players generated the excitement for most fans and received direct revenues from fans and sponsoring brands. The clubs also benefited from indirect revenues distributed by organized leagues which they earned mainly through media and sponsorship deals. Many of these deals were initiated negotiated and managed by advertising marketing and sponsorship agencies which facilitated the commercialization of the industry. By 2014 the global sports events market—defined by A. T. Kearney as all ticketing media rights and sponsorships for major sports—delivered total revenues of $76 billion; it had grown from $46 billion in 2005 and was expected to reach $91 billion by 2017. In 2013 the Europe Middle East and Africa region contributed $33 billion and was closely followed by North America which contributed $29 billion. A recent IEG sponsorship report suggested that sponsorship spending made up most of this market with North America dominating (see Exhibit 2). South Africa’s total sports market reached $1.5 billion in 2013 with sponsorship spending contributing over $600 million.Sport sponsors typically spent as much on activating their sponsorships as they did on the initial rights fees. Activation referred to marketing activities directly linked to individual sponsorships and aimed at increasing the awareness engagement trial purchase and advocacy a sponsor set out to achieve through the sponsorships. In 2013 sponsors spent an average of $1.50 for every $1.00 they invested in rights and 14 per cent of the respondents in one study spent at least three times as much. Public relations (used by 89 per cent of respondents) and social media (used by 88 per cent) were the most common activation channels followed by internal communication (86 per cent) hospitality (81 per cent) and traditional advertising (77 per cent). The same study found that the most important metrics for sponsors were awareness of the sponsorship (indicated by 94 per cent of those surveyed) and awareness of the products service or brand (indicated by 90 per cent)—ahead of attitudes toward the brand (indicated by 84 per cent). Lucien Boyer president and CEO of Havas Sports & Entertainment explained:Sponsorship continues to change. Today it is all about taking a fan-centric approach to creating engagement and that means understanding that all fans are different and that engagement needs to be personalised. Of course the real breakthrough is understanding how to use technology to achieve those goals on behalf of clients. Activation today needs to empower people to interact and enable them to fulfill the experiences they crave. The key is to produce content that is accessible anywhere and at any time not just during an event itself. Through social media that content can engage a whole community because after all social media is now mass media and as powerful as broadcast has been before. Sport has become a social currency and if a sponsor’s activation is engaging enough it will lead to an audience that really becomes involved and doesn’t just read the story. That requires content that is relevant not random and creative enough to hook people into participation.Fancam found that a number of competitors in the marketplace were providing similar gigapixel images. Most of these were photographers operating as individuals who consequently struggled with production time and scale. Following Fancam’s success in 2011 a number of similar companies such as Huggity Ltd. (Huggity) and Blakeway Gigapixel emerged as potential competitors.Since October 2011 Ireland-based Huggity had worked across five continents with over 100 brands including the New Zealand All Blacks Manchester United and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). One of Fancam’s first interactions with Huggity occurred in November 2011 in Dublin where Fancam was shooting a Westlife concert. As Taylor was leaving the arena after the high-definition crowd shot the team from Huggity intercepted him. According to Taylor the Huggity team expressed surprise at “how simple the process was” and noted that they couldn’t come up with that themselves. In May 2013 Huggity received an equity investment from Ireland-based Enterprise Equity Venture Capital of over $800000 part of which would be used to fund 16 additional sales support and relationship management positions in Dublin. By then Huggity was selling through partners in the United States Brazil Australia Norway Poland Turkey and Belgium. Recently Taylor had noticed that Huggity was producing partial spherical images rather than full spherical images—perhaps because the partial images were “a lot easier quicker and a bit cheaper to kick out.” Le Roux noted that Huggity seemed less active in the market and might have scaled back its sales approach. Blakeway Gigapixel was an offering of Blakeway Worldwide Panoramas a panoramic art print business founded by American James Blakeway in 1991. Blakeway positioned its gigapixel images as add-ons to existing panoramic products offering the gigapixel images for free as long as the sport team or business agreed to promote the gigapixel and panorama noting on its website that “Our business is selling panoramas. The gigapixel is a marketing tool.” Blakeway was officially licensed with the NFL the National Hockey League (NHL) the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and the NCAA and it had recently taken gigapixel images of the NHL Winter Classic in Michigan the Coupe de la Ligue Final in Paris and the Cy-Hawk Series football game between Iowa State University and the University of Iowa.Average commissions to industry sales agents or resellers varied widely. Technology firms typically paid 10 per cent of a contract’s value to their field sales teams while broader service-based firms reported paying between 20 and 50 per cent of revenues.Fancam’s clients were mostly team or event sponsors such as Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV GEICO and JP Morgan Chase & Co. which used branded fancams to strengthen their brands’ associations with teams or events. IEG reported that Anheuser-Busch InBev was the most active sponsor of the Major League Baseball (MLB) league and teams followed by insurance and food brands. Within the NFL PepsiCo Inc. was the most active sponsor and insurance and quick-service restaurants dominated the active categories. GEICO and Spalding were the most active NBA sponsors followed by telecommunications and quick-service restaurant brands.By 2015 while the average fancam was delivering 40000 page views (130 per cent of attendance) and each person spent an average of five minutes on the page Le Roux noted that many of the company’s clients struggled to interpret the value of such high levels of engagement. Many clients bought Fancam’s product “because it was cool and digital and social.” Clients signed off on custom fancam website designs which were typically completed a week before each actual shoot. Most clients trusted Fancam with the final images and did not review them before they were made live. By 2015 Fancam generally delivered live images within 24 hours of shooting events although some clients requested the images within 12 hours or sooner. Le Roux argued that these clients who “asked for a real-time version” came to understand that “in the memory business real time doesn’t give them more exposure or engagement than next day.” Taylor explained:From the beginning my priority has been that there needs to be a very very good user experience. If you look at our competitors’ pictures you will see a lot of them have got what we call stitching errors. . . . If you have people cut in half it is not always a good user experience so our images have to be perfect.Spectators buying tickets for public events in the United States agreed to a set of terms and conditions which included granting permission to the event owners to utilize theirname image likeness acts poses plays appearance movements and statements in any live or recorded audio video or photographic display or other transmission exhibition publication or reproduction made of or at the event (regardless of whether before during or after play or performance) for any purpose in any manner in any medium or context now known or hereafter developed without further authorization from or compensation to you or anyone acting on your behalf.International channel managementFancam’s participation in the 2010 Atlanta conference had caught the attention of not only prospective clients but also sales agent companies from Europe and the United States. Le Roux acknowledged that the company initially worked with everyone who enquired to see who could deliver: “We used gut feel knowledge of people to make decisions on these things and for the most part we made good decisions but it was a hell of a lot of hard work.”After a year of operations Fancam had resellers in 11 countries. Over the years Fancam’s resellers sold a varying number of fancy images (see Exhibit 3). Many of these resellers contacted Fancam promising access to appealing sporting venues and teams with which Le Roux and his team did not have existing relationships. Le Roux recalled an early example:We had an agency from Spain contact us saying that they knew some people at Real Madrid who would like to buy it. We said “Fine.” We were not in contact with anyone at Real Madrid and were just trying to stitch these images together get them out learn about service or things like that so “Go for it.”Le Roux was also aware that the team initially lacked confidence: “If someone phoned and said ‘I know the guys at the Packers’ I had to go and look on a map where the Packers were! So how am I going to get to the Packers with this accent?” With most of the company’s potential U.S. clients operating at least six hours behind Cape Town time sales calls often occurred late at night in South Africa.Fancam attracted two main types of resellers: The first type typically had strong relationships with sport teams perhaps due to existing contracts managing their digital print stores or social media accounts. These resellers often sold fancams for special marquee events such as championship or annual rivalry games. The second type of reseller viewed exclusive Fancam rights as a competitive advantage to becoming the agency of record for a corporate brand. The focus of this kind of reseller was therefore on helping brands develop new ways of engaging with customers—with a fancam being one of a range of tools that could be used.Fancam developed training documents and workshops for resellers after those in different markets began to have similar queries and some resellers struggled to follow the agreed procedures. The training included a focus on Fancam’s customer relationship management system which defined a sales cycle workflow to capture and manage prospects needs analysis quotations and sales. The Fancam team in Cape Town hosted weekly status calls and regular strategy discussions with resellers while Le Roux travelled to attend some client sales meetings in person. The head office also collaborated on quotations sales collateral and tailored proposals and pitches for the resellers to use; these included fancam mock-ups and live demonstrations. The training documents also highlighted additional value proposition dimensions that resellers could integrate into their prospecting and needs analysis conversations in the market.Given the uncertainty of market demand Fancam initially allowed resellers to set prices and developed a payment and commission structure to support this. A base rate of $6500 per fancam would go to Fancam and the reseller was able to earn an 80 per cent sales commission on any price above the base rate. No limits were placed on reseller commissions and the reseller was paid after the final client invoice was issued and the project was successfully completed. After a few months the average actual price paid became the new benchmark for other agents. After Fancam missed out on a Super Bowl shoot because a reseller had quoted a price almost 10 times the market rate Le Roux replaced the 20/80 split with 25 per cent straight sales commissions on new deals. Later when some resellers “starting selling stuff below rate card” Le Roux introduced a discounted sliding scale sales commission for exceptional cases which was based on the market conditions and good faith negotiations. Le Roux was seen by his team as a very logical problem solver who considered all sides and was a strong believer in good ethics. A reseller who sold a fancam at a discount greater than the maximum 20 per cent discount available for a package of 10 events would earn a proportionally lower sales commission. For example a 25 per cent discount to the client would result in a 20 per cent commission to the reseller which would reduce to a 10 per cent commission for a 50 per cent discount. An additional volume commission structure was also put in place: resellers who achieved more than $120000 cumulative sales value per quarter received 5 per cent of that value 30 days after the end of the relevant quarter. At the time Fancam formalized a two-tier rate card: first it offered a fancam—which the rights holder could onsell to a sponsor—to a team event or federation at $10000; second it offered a fancam to a sponsor directly at $20000. A 40 per cent discount on these rates was available for events with fewer than 20000 spectators while bulk discounts for multiple events ranged between 10 and 20 per cent. During the initial contracting period with resellers quarterly minimums were negotiated. Le Roux recalled:I would say “Look guys what do you think you can sell?” They would say they think they can sell 10 fancams per quarter so I would say “Okay let’s make your minimum four. Do you agree that something must have gone completely wrong if you can’t deliver four fancams?” And they’d agreed to that as a minimum.The quotas provided the resellers with exclusivity in their country markets. Resellers who failed to achieve their agreed minimums were allowed to continue selling fancams but lost their exclusivity. Any resellers who continued to miss quotas had their representation contract cancelled. For projects or clients that were referred to Fancam outside of a formal authorized reseller agreement Fancam offered a referral commission equal to 5 per cent of the price charged for the fancam.As a global business Fancam included a provision in its reseller contract to manage situations where a client of a reseller in one market expanded its use of fancams to sponsored events in other markets perhaps through a larger deal in its international head office. In spite of the provision and requirement to communicate possible conflicts a recent deal with an international airline client had significantly damaged relationships. The client which was being managed by Fancam’s Australian reseller had purchased a number of fancams in that market and was also considering purchasing a fancam through its Australian reseller for a major United States event it was sponsoring. At the same time Fancam’s American reseller proposed that the event could offer a fancam to the airline sponsor at an inflated rate allowing the event to generate additional sponsorship revenues. When the client responded that it was already planning an event fancam and would be buying it for almost five times less than was being offered in the United States the event executives “had egg on their face were obviously not happy with the Fancam reseller in the United States which in turn reflected badly on us” recalled Le Roux.Strategic alternativesBy early 2015 Le Roux needed to decide on Fancam’s channel management approach. Although the resellers had delivered strong revenue growth and a solid “land grab” market position contributing to the sale of over 350 fancams since 2011 Le Roux was concerned that the growing difficulty of managing resellers was negatively affecting the business. Various strategic alternatives were being considered.Fancam had ended the agreement with its primary reseller in the United States and discovered that the reseller had been subcontracting a second agency to sell fancams at a higher rate. Le Roux had come away from meeting the second agency feeling confident about the senior executive’s ability to deliver and he wondered whether he should offer that agency exclusive rights to the American market. Le Roux was aware of a few other agencies in the United States and wondered whether Fancam should try non-exclusive resellers for this substantial market. Fancam’s reseller commission experiments had delivered mixed results. Although the appealing incentives had grown overall revenues beyond expectations the resellers often earned almost as much as Fancam. Le Roux was “fine not making as much money as I could for a while” but was growing uncomfortable with the sense that resellers were “chasing commission” resulting in an inconsistent value proposition in the market. He also wondered how sustainable this approach would be as some resellers focused on the biggest individual deals possible to the detriment of regular fancams and relationships with clients. Le Roux needed to decide on the most appropriate incentive structure for the single or multiple resellers in each country.During the past four years Le Roux had learned how clients differed across the world. In Europe sports teams typically bought fancams as spectator engagement activations and sponsors in Europe expected the teams to pay for the activations. In the United States teams were able to sell fancam activation on to new or existing sponsors which meant that Fancam and its reseller needed to deal with both the teams and the sponsors. One MLB team had recently suggested that spectator engagement was less of a priority for the team than being able to generate additional sponsorship revenue by including a fancam for a big game in an annual sponsorship deal. Le Roux wondered about the implications of his channel management decision on the brand positioning of Fancam in the market—especially given the hype about data analytics content marketing and the possibility of using Fancam’s technology to more deeply understand spectator behaviour through regular fancams rather than one-off event shoots. Mobile technology innovations including augmented and virtual reality were also attracting attention adding to a more challenging sales environment.After operating through resellers internationally for more than three years Le Roux sometimes felt that he “could sell it better than anyone else.” He wondered whether the time had come to build a stronger internal capacity to take on the sales role directly:We felt that many of these international partners specifically in the Western markets underestimated us because we were from South Africa and felt we couldn’t do business development without them. There was arrogance. . . . We felt disrespected in some of the relationships.As he had a young family in Cape Town Le Roux did not see himself spending most of the year travelling internationally but he did not have anyone else in his team who could play that role. He was also nervous about whether people who did not live every day in the American sports context might miss the social nuances and shifts in fan behaviour and client strategies. He had no doubt however that the current approach to channel management needed to change and that he needed to respond to the potential exclusive reseller in the coming week.Exhibit 1: Selection of

The previous leader and prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper had stepped down as party leader in October 2015 after losing the federal election to the Liberal Party of Canada. The 2017 Conservative Party leadership race attracted an unprecedented total of 17 candidates who campaigned over seven months or more. Thirteen candidates were on the ballot for election. The race was not one of Canada’s finest political events for many reasons not least of which was the divisiveness of the candidates’ campaign rhetoric. Amid the cacophony one candidate stood out: Kellie Leitch the member of Parliament for Simcoe-Grey in Ontario.Leitch’s platform addressed several issues such as supply management natural resource planning and women’s safety but two issues in particular galvanized the media and came to define Leitch’s campaign: a commitment to institute the screening of newcomers to the country for their adherence to Canadian values and a platform of “anti-elite” initiatives. Leitch emphasized that her platform was based on the values of hard work generosity freedom and tolerance but many interpreted her commitment to screening newcomers as conflicting with a growing characterization of Canada as a place of multiculturalism and inclusivity. Her position riled several people including Leitch’s fellow leadership candidates and many party members. Her message found traction however among segments of the Canadian population particularly those frustrated with politically correct attitudes concerned about preservation of language and culture or advocating anti-immigration values. The media were critical of Leitch’s campaign lambasting her at almost every turn—for her campaign platform to be certain but more aggressively for a campaign platform that seemed to depart from Leitch’s background experience and values. Was Leitch for real or had she deliberately pushed a divisive issue to garner attention and raise her profile?Kellie LeitchKhristinn Kellie Leitch was born in 1970 the eldest of three siblings. She was a fourth-generation Canadian her father’s family having emigrated from Scotland and her mother’s family from Iceland. In the early 1970s Leitch’s father an engineer started and ran a construction company that built a substantial portion of Fort McMurray which became the urban centre for Alberta’s booming oils sands project. Leitch’s mother was a stay-at-home mother—a role she cherished—who inculcated her children with the value of community service. Leitch credited her mother for encouraging her to pursue an education and professional success participate in team sports and be active in local community groups. The family were practising Roman Catholics a faith that Leitch had sustained through her life.Leitch was academically talented. She advanced quickly through elementary school and high school graduating high school at age 16. She started university at age 17 pursuing a general arts degree without a clear career focus at the time. A little more than a year later Leitch’s mother died of breast cancer at age 46—an event that prompted Leitch to consider a career in medicine. She graduated medical school completed a residency in paediatric orthopaedic surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto pursued a clinical fellowship at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and by age 39 had become the chief of surgery for a large hospital in a rapidly growing community east of Toronto.Along the way Leitch also completed her master’s degree in business administration focusing on health care management. When Leitch accepted a position as a professor of surgery at the Schulich School of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario she was cross-appointed to the Ivey Business School where she taught in the health sector stream and was the founding chair of what became the Ivey International Centre for Health Innovation. Leitch combined her medical and business talents in multiple volunteer and community roles such as council member on the National Research Council of Canada board director of the YMCA of Greater Toronto board member of Genome Canada and vice-president of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research.Having been tagged as one of “Canada’s Top 40 Under 40” at the age of 34 then awarded the Order of Ontario at age 40 for her work in child health advocacy Leitch had been profiled several times in the media. She was variably described as focused and hard-working academically inclined smart driven and strategic loyal and “amazingly great at time management.” When Leitch ran for political office in 2010 The Globe and Mail described her as a “star candidate.”The Naissance of a Political CareerLeitch became politically active at the age of nine when her father a Conservative Party riding president became the campaign manager for a friend seeking office. Leitch joined the Conservative Party as soon as she was eligible at age 14 and was politically active as a volunteer throughout high school and university. She was well known in the party; Leitch and her friends referred to the party as Leitch’s second family. In 1993 Leitch threw her energy behind Jean Charest a liberal-minded Francophone in his bid to become party leader. At university Leitch helped pay her way through school by working for David Turnbull a member of Ontario’s provincial parliament and later by working for Barbara McDougall then federal minister of external affairs. In 2006 Jim Flaherty a well-known Conservative and then finance minister invited Leitch to chair an expert panel on developing tax incentives to improve children’s fitness. The work was the start to what would become Leitch’s niche for policy initiatives to advance children’s health and wellness. In 2008 Leitch released a government-backed study that concluded Canada was slipping behind its peer countries in indicators of child health. The report called for a national strategy which Leitch undertook. In 2009 she founded what became the Sandbox Project a Canadian non-governmental organization that worked across disciplines to advance the health and well-being of Canadian children and youth.Flaherty continued to mentor Leitch. He was highly regarded for his fiscal management skills balanced with social financial initiatives and he was liked and respected by politicians and business people regardless of party affiliation. That Flaherty took Leitch under his wing to groom her for a successful political career was a credit to Leitch and his influence on her was not lost on Leitch. In 2014 she was with Flaherty the morning he suffered a heart attack and despite Leitch’s best medical efforts died. Leitch was devastated but she spoke through her grief the next morning in the House of Commons to give a moving tribute to Flaherty “a colleague a mentor my champion and a very close friend.”Elected PoliticianIn 2010 Flaherty encouraged Leitch to run as the Conservative candidate in the upcoming 2011 federal election. Leitch was being parachuted by the party into the Simcoe-Grey riding to replace the incumbent member of Parliament who had been expelled from caucus. The campaign was bitter. The incumbent was liked in the riding and still identified herself as a Conservative even if she was unwillingly no longer a member of the Conservative Party. The party put a great deal of effort behind Leitch’s campaign sending no fewer than three Conservative cabinet ministers a well-known Conservative senator a well-known and highly regarded party strategist and previous senator a previous provincial premier and the prime minister himself to stump for Leitch. She won the riding the Conservatives won the election and Leitch was rewarded with government appointments.Leitch was first appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of human resources and skills development. Two years later she was promoted to minister of labour and minister of status of women. Her accomplishments as a parliamentarian however did not follow the thread of initiatives she had established in health care or regarding children. Rather when asked Leitch identified a women’s entrepreneur mentorship program and changes to the Federal Accountability Act as key accomplishments. The changes to the accountability act amended conflict of interest guidelines to allow parliamentarians to practise their profession as volunteers. This amendment aligned with both Leitch’s belief in service and her own professional activities in medicine: to sustain her medical skills and credentials she had continued to practise on a volunteer basis at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. In 2014 as minister of labour and minister of status of women Leitch introduced the government’s CA$25-million plan to address violence against Aboriginal women and children. The Conservative government had been resisting ongoing calls to investigate and launch a public inquiry into an ongoing problem with missing and murdered Indigenous women. The media and the government opposition criticized Leitch’s plan as a weak response to such a significant problem. The next year in the same role Leitch introduced a women’s mentorship program. It Starts with One encouraged leaders in the public and private sectors to become mentors and champions for young women to “increase women’s economic prosperity in Canada.” Leitch may not have yet had a high political profile in the general public but her status within the party was secure. She was regarded as “smart focused strategic driven and most of all loyal.” Her devotion to the party had been particularly noted; a party insider described Leitch as “a loyal soldier of the party. . . . For good and bad she [was] there.” Her allegiance to the party had been tested early in her parliamentary career. Once Leitch was elected physicians and public health professionals lobbied her as a health professional to push the government to end its export of asbestos. The issue was not on the government’s agenda and the Harper government was renowned for requiring the cabinet and caucus to speak with one voice. Leitch sided with the party and abandoned the request later justifying her actions: “I had a choice. I could speak my mind publicly and be removed from having a voice within caucus. Or I could achieve a longer-term goal in the best interests of Canadians. I chose the latter. . . . Sometimes you have to take it on the chin for the team” she said.Federal Election 2015Canadians went back to the polls in 2015 to elect a new federal government. The Conservatives had formed the government for nine years and the national desire was for change. Change was what they got: the Liberals swept the election exceeding expectations. Although not far behind the Liberals in terms of the popular vote the Conservatives lost 89 seats dropping from 188 to 99. The Conservative platform—“Proven leadership for a strong Canada”—had offered Canadians more of the same which seemed to be not what Canadians wanted. The party had also lost some campaign steam when an extended media cycle was taken up with the trial of a Conservative senator for fraud a charge linked to questionable dealings in the prime minister’s office. However it was widely believed that it was not the trial that lost the race but the party’s inability to respond to the needs of young middle-class and immigrant Canadians and its insistence on maintaining and strengthening what many saw as anti-immigration policies.Canada prided itself on its multicultural reputation so Canadians cried in protest to both the prime minister’s use of the appellation “Old Stock Canadians” during a nationally televised debate and the party’s fuss over whether women could wear a niqab during a citizenship ceremony. The campaign tension over immigration escalated in the face of the Syrian refugee crisis. The Conservative government had been criticized for having failed to do enough for the refugees and for having passed over certain religious groups in the selection process. The Conservative Party denied the claim and renewed its commitment to Syrian refugees promising to increase the number of refugees who would be accepted. However citing security concerns the government suspended the review process for an audit. Then just a few months later at the height of the election campaign the body of a toddler washed up on a beach in Turkey. With the world watching the child who came to symbolize all those who had lost their lives in their flee to safety was identified as Alan Kurdi the nephew of a Canadian woman who had been attempting to bring her brother and his family to Canada. Canadian bureaucracy had prevented the child’s family from seeking asylum in Canada.The death knell for the Conservative Party according to many was a “snitch line” introduced by Chris Alexander the immigration minister and Leitch. The Conservatives had earlier passed legislation that reinforced strict penalties on acts that were already crimes in Canada but might have been considered acceptable by some cultures such as polygamy and honour killings. During the election campaign Alexander and Leitch promised additional resources to back the legislation including a proposed tip line to be managed by Canada’s federal police specifically for reporting suspected violations of the new law.The Conservative Party was no longer focused on fiscal management and instead had self-identified as the defender of Canadian values. Alexander declared “We need to stand up for our values. . . . We need to do that in citizenship ceremonies. We need to do that to protect women and girls from forced marriage and other barbaric practices.” Leitch indicated the values involved “difficult issues that impact women.” Accusing the opposing parties of being preoccupied with political correctness Leitch announced “The Conservative government is not afraid to defend Canadian values.”The Conservative Party lost the election but it earned 32 per cent of the popular vote and increased the number of Conservative seats in Quebec where language and culture were two key issues. Clearly some Canadians had picked up and backed the party’s shifting position to protecting Canadian values.Leadership CampaignHarper announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on the night of the party’s election loss. Leitch known inside the party but still a political newcomer to the Canadian public was the first to announce her intent to run to replace Harper as leader of the party. Her announcement on April 6 2016 triggered the beginning of a long year of campaigning. Defending Canadian ValuesLeitch’s association with the snitch line seen by many to have been largely anti-Muslim dogged her every step of her leadership campaign. During a televised interview early in her campaign Leitch apologized for her role in introducing the proposal:I’ve had a lot of time to think about this since the [federal election] campaign took place and if I could go back in time which I can’t I would change things. . . . As minister of status of women I was focused on making sure that we eliminated violence against women and girls especially making sure we advocated for women’s rights. . . . We weren’t talking about race; we were talking about kids . . . but that message was completely overtaken and I regret that and I regret that it occurred and it shouldn’t have been done.Nonetheless and despite the controversy generated during the federal election Leitch’s platform picked up where the snitch line left off: proposing to screen newcomers to the country for “anti-Canadian values.” Leitch identified Canadian values as equality of opportunity hard work generosity freedom and tolerance—especially freedom and tolerance which according to Leitch were “at the core of what makes us uniquely Canadian. I’m proud of that value set” she said. “That value set built our country. [It’s] worth protecting [so we can] continue to be the beacon of hope around the globe the reason why individuals want to immigrate to our country.” Leitch canvassed Canadians with a questionnaire asking for their feedback on screening potential immigrants and rescinding citizenship of dual citizens who violated Canadian values. Her eager engagement of a proposal that was widely seen as just a variation of that for which she had apologized invited public scorn and furious criticism. High-profile Conservatives denounced the plan. Several of Leitch’s party colleagues including the party’s interim leader (who would normally remain neutral during a leadership campaign) distanced themselves from the proposal. The media had a heyday calling out every reference Leitch made to a practice from a Muslim nation—and there were many. Opinion columnists recalled previous failed attempts to guard Canadian values such as the residential school system that stripped Indigenous communities of their language and culture in favour of instilling Canadian values. Leitch emphasized that her intent was to protect Canadian women from those who “believe that women are property that they can be beaten and bought or sold.” She made it clear that she wanted to protect gay men and lesbians from those who believe they “should be stoned.” Opinion columnists responded by pointing to the inconsistencies with that philosophy within Canada: In our country a woman is murdered by her intimate partner every six days. Indigenous women are killed at a rate six times greater than non-indigenous women. About every two days a gay person becomes the victim of a hate crime. Until this year it was the official stance of Leitch’s own political party that gays and lesbians be denied the right to marry.A Conservative senator questioned why a former minister responsible for the status of women was not advocating for those living in poverty for greater access to daycare and for other policies that would address the already existing and pressing needs of women.Denying RacismOn January 29 2017 a gunman entered a mosque in Quebec City during evening prayers and opened fire killing six people and injuring 19. Quebec had a higher proportion of Muslim immigrants than any other province and the university near the targeted mosque attracted a high proportion of French-speaking students primarily from Muslim-dominant countries. The gunman was later identified to be a far-right white nationalist with anti-Muslim views.Politicians and columnists quickly identified the attack as racist making it clear they believed the attack was a result of fear-mongering and discriminatory politicking. Without naming her many blamed Leitch and her exclusivist policy of immigrant screening. One Conservative leadership candidate tweeted:This mosque attack is no accident: It’s a direct result of demagogues and wannabe demagogues playing to fears and prejudices . . . . This is Canada. This was an attack on real Canadian values enshrined in the Charter: religious freedom.Protestors hung a banner on Leitch’s campaign office that said “Hate puts us all at risk.” The banner also named the six murdered men and called for Leitch to resign. Leitch responded in an interview asserting as she had at every turn during her campaign that her belief that screening immigrants for anti-Canadian values was not intolerant racist or isolationist and that supporters of her campaign and the screening policy were not racists. She contended that Canada was “built on immigration” and her proposal was “about acceptance of a framework by which we agree to live as Canadians and the tolerance that goes with that because here in this country we are tolerant.” When challenged with the suggestion that Canadians celebrated tolerance as difference not conformity Leitch disagreed. She claimed that “without a common set of values a common identity we can’t have integration of newcomers.”Leitch continued her campaign accusing opponents of trivializing the issues or being “elites” out of touch with what the “average guy or gal on the street” wanted.Opposing ElitesCampaigning against the elite had become popular politics made infamous by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign of 2015/2016. Who the elite were was open for debate but in political rhetoric it was “the other.” Elite according to the dictionary referred to quality class and culture. It could also refer to a group of individuals with power and influence in a society usually as a result of wealth or privilege. According to analysts political anti-elite rhetoric engaged an even broader group by referring to those known for liberal ideas and “highbrow consumer preferences.”Leitch defined an elite as “an individual who is out of touch and seems to think they know better what how someone should think.” She described her anti-elite platform as an effort to address the disconnect between “hard-working” Canadians “the average guy or gal on the street” and their government. Reducing both taxation and regulations represented the traditional Conservative policy position which Leitch endorsed but added “I think our party can be bigger than that.” Referencing her listening skills and collaborative approach in her medical practice Leitch added “I think if [we] work together . . . we actually are doing better public service. It’s about listening first developing a plan together and then going out and implementing it in the best interests of Canadians.”Leitch defended her immigration screening program as a response to the interests of average Canadians. A Forum Research poll in September 2016 concluded that 67 per cent of Canadians were in favour of a program that screened immigrants for anti-Canadian values. The idea met with even higher approval among those supporting Leitch’s party. Leitch argued that her screening program also protected the needs of “Canadians [who] work hard”—the non-elites. The program was “different than having an elitist attitude of thinking you know best and you can tell people what to do” she said. When Trump won the U.S. presidential election Leitch again aligned herself with hard-working Canadians in an email message to supporters: “Tonight our American cousins threw out the elites and elected Donald Trump as their next president. It’s an exciting message and one that we need delivered in Canada as well. It’s the message I’m bringing with my campaign to be the next prime minister of Canada.”The media pressed Leitch questioning whether she wasn’t an elite herself. She had two advanced university degrees had been a professor and chair in the university system was a member of Parliament and had been a member of cabinet and was a specialist surgeon who had been chief of surgery. Leitch had especially insisted on her distinction as a physician being noted: despite tradition that eschewed professional titles on Parliament business cards Leitch insisted on the inclusion of “Dr.” on her cards and in her ministerial correspondence noting that she was maintaining a medical practice while serving as a member of Parliament. Nonetheless Leitch denied that she was an elite noting that she grew up in “small town” Fort McMurray Alberta and that her first home there had been a trailer. She worked hard she said and while she had an “elite education and great jobs” she was “not out of touch. I don’t think I know better than everyone” she added. On another occasion Leitch suggested that if she were an elite that status was countered by oppression: “You may call me an elite but look I dealt with the most challenging old boys’ club there is in the country. They’re called surgeons.”However at a campaign event organized for young Conservative Party members Leitch again brought into question whether she was an elite herself. When asked what her policy was on Aboriginal affairs Leitch informed her questioner that she would “abolish the Indian Act” noting that “every Canadian should be treated the same.” Leitch’s proposal was in effect to remove Aboriginal identities their legal status and their reserved land. When the questioner pointed this out Leitch retorted “Please understand that I do have 22 letters at the end of my name; I’m not an idiot.” When the questioner further challenged Leitch by asking whether she felt she had consulted widely enough to reach her conclusion Leitch broke from her commitment to work together and listen first replying: I think that the people of Canada and the Parliament of Canada is supreme. And when people decide that’s what we should do. And every Canadian should be equal. And if you think I need to go out and speak to Aboriginal Canadians across the country to ask them for their consent to change the law it won’t happen.Her retort garnered the day’s media attention with the criticism that an anti-elitist closed down conversation by referencing her own elite status. Leitch later tweeted an apology for miscounting the number of letters after her name noting that she had 18 letters not 22. “Each is an achievement I worked hard for” she added. Opposing the MediaLeitch had hired Nick Kouvalis to run her leadership campaign. Kouvalis was a controversial figure with a track record for getting unlikely candidates elected on populist campaigns. His prior notable victory was the election of Rob Ford as mayor of Toronto. Ford was an atypical bumbling politician from the suburbs whose term in office was characterized by his drug and alcohol abuse criminal acquaintances and disdain for the media. Leitch was a different candidate—highly educated respected in policy circles and free of criminal suspicions although awkward speaking in public and developing a reputation for being high-handed as a cabinet minister. What was similar to both was Kouvalis’s pitch: both campaigns advanced divisive populist positions and both dismissed the elite and cast the media as bullies. As Ford and more recently Trump had done Leitch cast herself in an adversarial relationship with the media. Leitch expressed her condemnation of the media in interviews regularly accusing the “media elite” of attacking her or misunderstanding her. She had also embedded her position on the media in her campaign platform: while many Conservatives proposed some form of funding cut for Canada’s national broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Leitch promised to completely dismantle the “left-wing media elite” broadcaster.Social MediaOn February 25 2017 Leitch advanced her campaign using social media posting a video to YouTube. Leitch spoke to the camera about her Canadian values policy for the full eight-and-a-half-minute clip. There were no visual aids or props beyond a desk and the Canadian flag. The video was marked by awkward prolonged pauses; wooden verbal pacing; and multiple sometimes extended glances off-screen. Leitch was known as an inelegant public speaker and it was thought she had received coaching so she could have been attempting to implement for the camera what she had learned. Regardless the result was posted and subject to extensive ridicule on social media. People edited the video in multiple ways for comic effect. The Canadian satire team from CBC Television’s comedy show 22 Minutes prepared two new sketches to add to their growing collection of Leitch sketches for television and YouTube fuelling the social media traffic. Within days the link to Leitch’s video had been displayed approximately a million times on Facebook; the video itself had been viewed by more than 500000 people. When speaking in Calgary several days later Leitch pointed to the viral interest in her video as evidence that her proposal on immigration was resonating with Canadians. Leitch applauded the ridicule identifying it as an opportunity to share her message “unfiltered” with the Canadian public. She dismissed concerns about the video’s production quality. When asked what she thought of the response to the video Leitch replied “That I should take acting lessons.”Ridicule on social media aside it was the staging of the video that generated attention. What was Leitch saying amid the prolonged pauses and glances off-screen? One columnist summed it up as “little more than saying she loves her country and its ‘shared values’ of generosity hard work freedom tolerance and equal opportunity.” Another columnist criticized the video as “clickbait . . . Trumpian politics of distraction: bizarre optics become the topic of discussion while content and substance are left unexamined or unchallenged.” A political commentator who had seen and made note of Leitch early in her political career was more charitable and remarked “She is or was in her earlier life a compassionate charitable charismatic personality who saved or repaired hundreds of young lives while educating other doctors on advanced surgical skills. That does not compute with the person in this week’s bizarre Facebook production.” Whatever Leitch intended in one day the video “set the Internet afire with chatter larks and memes.” A communication specialist pointed out that the video should be considered a success because media organizations were talking about it even if the talk was about the video’s failures. “It’s a hijacking of the news cycle” the specialist noted. “If I were still in journalism I’d be covering it too just like Trump.” Public ResponseLeitch may not have had much support within her own party or with the mainstream media but she did have public backing. Despite being comparatively new in her political career Leitch was the front-runner early in the leadership campaign. A poll of Conservative supporters had identified Leitch as the top choice for leader. At that point Leitch was also the top fundraiser in the leadership campaign. She was later surpassed by two other candidates in total funds raised but Leitch relied on fewer larger donors than the others; halfway through the race the average donation to the leading candidate was $137 and to Leitch $310. The bar for contributions was also high at a fundraising dinner held for Leitch by Bay Street lawyers: the tickets were $500 each. Ironically for an anti-elite platform Leitch’s campaign was attracting elite donors.The Forum Research poll from September 2016 found that Leitch’s proposal to screen immigrants appealed to two-thirds of the Canadians surveyed. A different company conducted another poll in January 2017 the same month that the gunman entered the mosque in Quebec City killing six people. The January 2017 poll indicated that again about two-thirds of Canadians polled would support screening immigrants for adherence to Canadian values. Some commentators also saw merit in Leitch’s idea of promulgating Canadian values and improving the immigration system but challenged the details of Leitch’s plan suggesting it was unworkable and that by focusing on immigrants alone the plan failed to address value clashes within the country.However by May 2017 as the Conservative Party prepared for the leadership election Leitch’s campaign had become nothing but polarizing. Her criticism of Torontonians for lack of community—she claimed that when she lived in Toronto she felt she could never reach out to a neighbour—elicited a social media response of good neighbour stories in Toronto posted under the hashtag #OurTO. Constituents in Leitch’s own riding of Simcoe-Grey had begun a campaign against Leitch. They posted signs and launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #NotMyMP. A poll in January 2017 indicated only 2 per cent of Canadians of all political affiliations wanted Leitch to be leader of the Conservative Party.Still Leitch entered the convention (and the election for leader) with more than 30000 members supporting her campaign—representing more than 20 per cent of the votes to be cast. The last poll to assess the ranking of candidates ranked her fifth in a list of 13 candidates. There was no question that Leitch was mentioned most often in the headlines even if most of the content below the headlines was critical. Canadians seemed to be repulsed by Trump’s leadership politics but Leitch claimed she would not have changed anything: “I don’t have any regrets because I think this has been a really—and is now becoming even more so—a thoughtful dialogue that Canadians are having.”ConclusionElection of the new leader of the Conservative Party took an extraordinary 13 rounds of balloting. The result was an upset: the front-runner on the previous 12 ballots was overtaken by Andrew Scheer a 38-year-old social-conservative whose political experience was as speaker of the House of Commons. He had not held any ministerial post. He was known as “the nice guy” who ran a race with a positive tone.Leitch’s 20 per cent showing before the election evaporated into a 7 per cent result on the first ballot and increased to only 7.95 per cent by the ninth ballot. The once well-regarded member of the political world initially considered to be a front-runner in the leadership race was eliminated with “an embarrassing seventh place showing after the first ballot.” She held a position in the election until the ninth round of voting at which point she was eliminated.How had Leitch’s reputation shifted from well-regarded physician and community leader to criticized political candidate? With the bid for leadership ended how could she rebuild her position and what strengths and experience would she need?Endnotes,25,"[{""start"":1223,""end"":1229,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1094,""end"":1100,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1352,""end"":1358,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1573,""end"":1581,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2379,""end"":2385,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5205,""end"":5211,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5281,""end"":5287,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5382,""end"":5390,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6965,""end"":6971,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":10481,""end"":10487,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12037,""end"":12043,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12607,""end"":12613,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13760,""end"":13766,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13845,""end"":13851,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14118,""end"":14124,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14373,""end"":14381,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18450,""end"":18456,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":19978,""end"":19984,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":20535,""end"":20541,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23391,""end"":23397,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":23487,""end"":23493,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25493,""end"":25499,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25522,""end"":25528,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":27318,""end"":27326,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1745,""end"":1758,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1811,""end"":1819,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2164,""end"":2170,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1994,""end"":2002,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2478,""end"":2486,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2801,""end"":2809,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2968,""end"":2976,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3015,""end"":3021,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3121,""end"":3134,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3144,""end"":3157,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3350,""end"":3358,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3539,""end"":3547,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3667,""end"":3673,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3924,""end"":3930,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3886,""end"":3892,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4264,""end"":4270,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4193,""end"":4201,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4628,""end"":4634,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4738,""end"":4744,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5055,""end"":5061,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5507,""end"":5513,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5717,""end"":5723,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7090,""end"":7096,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7329,""end"":7335,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5847,""end"":5853,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6010,""end"":6016,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6247,""end"":6255,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6819,""end"":6827,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6279,""end"":6285,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6199,""end"":6205,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6401,""end"":6407,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6908,""end"":6914,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7639,""end"":7645,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7812,""end"":7818,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7554,""end"":7560,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7776,""end"":7784,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7687,""end"":7693,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3205,""end"":3208,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3958,""end"":3961,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4055,""end"":4058,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3588,""end"":3591,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4863,""end"":4866,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4305,""end"":4308,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2187,""end"":2190,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2434,""end"":2437,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2540,""end"":2543,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2830,""end"":2833,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3915,""end"":3918,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":3710,""end"":3713,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

He had started his career in 1995 at the Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) which was widely credited with bringing marketing research into China. In 2002 Jianming had left P&G and founded his own consulting business in brand management. A successful 17-year veteran in marketing Jianming had found that marketing research as he knew it back then was not necessarily going to sustain the radical changes happening in the Chinese market and this prompted him to found Shanghai MarcPoint Information Technology Co. Ltd. (MarcPoint) a marketing research company that focused on analyzing user-generated content (UGC) with big-data technologies. By 2018 MarcPoint had become a leader in big-data marketing research in China. Yet Jianming found himself once again facing a changing market—except this time the changes appeared even broader and more dramatic. As he reflected on the success MarcPoint had achieved in the five short years since its inception he asked himself what he thought the next five years should be.The Chinese Market in 2012The Chinese market in 2012 was surely different than in 1995: it was highlighted by the growth of e-commerce the decline of traditional marketing channels and the burst of social media usage. While the overall economy of that year measured by the gross domestic product grew by only 7.8 per cent over the previous year—a moderate number at that time by Chinese standards—the growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods was much stronger at 14.3 per cent or 12.1 per cent after adjusting for inflation. The e-commerce market however exploded with an increase of 66.5 per cent over 2011 growing to ¥1.3 trillion (about US$205 billion) and accounting for 6.1 per cent of the total retail sales of consumer goods. By the end of 2012 242 million Internet users in China had shopped online. Looking back Jianming believed that 2012 was the year that confirmed the decline of traditional media marketing and marked the final arrival of online marketing in China. According to the CTR research in 2012 the traditional media advertising market in China had grown by only 4.5 per cent over 2011—a fall-off from the previous year’s growth rate of 13 per cent. In comparison the new media market had increased by more than 50 per cent over the previous year and grown to ¥77 billion. Fast growth of social media marketing and its effectiveness was witnessed in 2012. The 2012 research report on the Chinese online shopping market from the influential China Internet Network Information Center examined for the first time how social networking services (SNS) affected online shopping. According to the report 28.4 per cent of online shoppers had used a social networking service in the past six months. Among these shoppers 52.8 per cent browsed or followed shopping-related information through SNS and 41.8 per cent eventually bought a product after seeing the product information shared through SNS. These numbers were not surprising considering that SNS had become popular among Chinese Internet users by 2012. It was reported that 275 million Internet users or nearly half of all Internet users in China (48.8 per cent) used SNS by the end of 2012. The huge number of Internet users the growing e-commerce market and the expanding usage of SNS in China collectively made the Chinese market decidedly different from what it was before.Challenges to Traditional Marketing ResearchTo Jianming one of the biggest differences was the sudden availability of huge amounts of data that fundamentally challenged the traditional way in which marketing research was done. He sensed that at least theoretically the large amount of transaction data available through the e-commerce market and the UGC on social media magnified by the huge number of social media users presented an opportunity to do marketing research in a radically different way. Traditionally marketing research had primarily used data collected from surveys and focus groups. Comparatively UGC enjoyed quite a few advantages. First UGC tended to be more candid truthful and reliable. In 2009 Jianming started using Sina Weibo (Weibo) a Chinese microblogging service that was similar to Twitter in the United States in both popularity and functionality and found that consumers were surprisingly candid on Weibo. He quickly realized that he might not need to use surveys to ask consumer questions for marketing research any more. He explained:Often we need to do consumer profiling for our marketing research. So what are white-collar workers like? Confident right? Loving. Proactive. They must love reading books watching movies and traveling right? But Weibo greatly changed my thoughts. In fact I found that many white-collar workers are lazy no dreams no ideas just like to stay at home. They claim they like reading but they never mentioned anything related to books in their Weibo messages. I suddenly realized how wrong the survey-based research we did before could be simply because if I ask people about their hobbies few people would reply “I like sleeping late.” Nobody would answer that way. Second with UGC a large number of consumers were telling stories from their own perspectives without any preset limitations. Thus UGC presented not only detailed but also diversified information on how consumers use a product and what they think of it—which was a stark contrast to data collected by traditional means. Traditional marketing research employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods like focus groups often involved a few dozen participants across five or six markets. Survey questionnaires were then built—often informed by the results of qualitative studies—and distributed to a few hundred or thousand consumers to be filled. The representativeness of data collected from such studies was simply no match for UGC contributed by hundreds of thousands of Internet users. As Jie Li Jianming’s former mentor at P&G and current MarcPoint colleague explainedTraditionally if you want to understand the market and what the consumers think you do it with a survey. A survey can take at most one and a half hours. Otherwise the consumer will lose patience and mess with the answers. A one-and-a-half-hour survey can involve not much more than the products how they are used and the consumers’ attitudes toward them. It is impossible to include questions on the context in which the products are used the mental status with which the products are used and the many other life details with which the products are used. You just can’t fit all these in a survey.Moreover traditional marketing research was limited by the experience of the researchers who conducted the research. For example surveys were built by marketing researchers who hopefully had experience with the product or the industry. However no matter how experienced the researchers were they simply could not accommodate the viewpoints of tens of thousands of consumers. As a result the questions included in a survey or focus group might miss some product features that were important to consumers but not known to the researchers thus limiting the effectiveness of such research. Jianming relayed an example from his early experience with UGC:One of our earliest examples is a project related to Yixing Zhang in 2013. Yixing Zhang was a K-pop star from China. When we were working for Lay’s potato chips we found from data that consumers always related Lay’s chips to Yixing Zhang and we wonder[] why? We asked our contacts from Lay’s “Do you know Yixing Zhang?” Few people did. “Do you know if Yixing Zhang had anything to do with Lay’s potato chips?” Everybody was at a loss “Why? Yixing Zhang had nothing to do with our potato chips!” But data told us there indeed was. It turned out that Yixing’s English name was Lay. He had said in public that he liked eating Lay’s chips and Yixing’s fans even called him “chip bro.” . . . Nobody from Lay’s knew it and they just signed another star (who was totally different from Yixing) to speak for Lay’s chips . . . So here you see the power of data: When you do a survey research you always bring with you some assumptions. Yixing Zhang won’t appear in your questionnaire because you just don’t know him and you have no idea he has an English name called Lay. Finally the focus of traditional marketing research tended to be narrow. When a company commissioned a study it usually focused on its own product and consumers’ knowledge of and attitude toward it. In comparison UGC from multiple SNS websites could collectively paint a much more holistic picture of the consumers which could lead to a much better idea of who the consumers were and what they were truly interested in. Jianming argued:Suppose we are doing a marketing research on diapers. We use a questionnaire. Of course all questions are about diapers which makes this survey one-sided. A real mom cares about diapers. She also cares about formula. She cares about many other things. Therefore what we learned from the survey is incomplete. Testing with WeiboConvinced of the opportunities offered by UGC Jianming started to look for technologies to deal with them. To him there were two obstacles he needed to overcome to make use of UGC:[We knew then that we could do marketing research with Weibo.] But we had two problems. First there are so many Weibo messages. How can we deal with the volume? Second Weibo messages are texts. They don’t have a structure. They are all so-called unstructured content. How do we deal with them?Fortunately Weibo was a great place for learning too. Jianming looked for people on Weibo who seemed to know the technologies and he interacted with them non-stop. He began to know more and more people in this field and learned that the technology was called natural language processing. Eventually he got in touch with Jun Yang. At that time Jun was still a student pursuing a master’s degree in computer science at Nanjing University; he later became one of MarcPoint’s first employees. In late 2012 Jun began to help Jianming run a few explorations with Weibo messages. When Jianming presented the results to his clients—Lay’s chips was one of the examples—they were all amazed.Jun’s analyses easily synthesized hundreds of thousands of Weibo messages which was an unprecedented approach to marketing research in China. Back then the idea of big data was still in its nascence. Inspired by the famous 2011 McKinsey report on big data and encouraged by the early successes with Weibo messages Jianming started his own journey of using big data such as UGC to transform marketing research founding MarcPoint in 2013. Jie who had been a marketing executive in several multinational companies in both China and Europe became involved in MarcPoint as a consultant at the end of 2014. In 2015 the company acquired an angel fund and Jie officially joined the company as a co-founder.Collaboration with AlibabaMarcPoint started by working with Taobao the consumer arm of Alibaba the Chinese e-commerce giant. In September 2012 Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba made data the ultimate foothold of Alibaba’s growth strategy. With its dominance in both big-data technologies and the e-commerce market Alibaba was a trendsetter in the emergence of big data in China and the partner that all data companies dreamed of working with.In early 2014 Jianming attended a big-data summit hosted by Alibaba. He was excited by the speeches and motivated by Alibaba’s apparent commitment to becoming an open platform for big data. However only one talk which discussed how Alibaba used big data for microfinancing truly resonated with him. Jianming felt that most of the other talks were more conceptual than practical consisting more of ideas than of actual applications. He was disappointed that he could not see much business value in what was being advocated in the presentations. In 2013 Alibaba started a product called Yushanfang which Alibaba intended as its big-data platform. Through Yushanfang independent software vendors Taobao storekeepers and other users not necessarily tied to e-commerce could have access to the data accumulated through Taobao. More importantly Yushanfang also provided its clients with big-data processing tools algorithms services and products. In this sense Yushanfang was a cloud-based platform-as-a-service provider that offered a data platform data warehousing and a data centre as services. MarcPoint became involved with Yushanfang early during its pilot stage. As Jianming recalledWhen we first met the Yushanfang people I felt everyone was positively strongly and enthusiastically enamored [by big data]. The future of big data had arrived! But what exactly could Yushanfang do? The Yushanfang people didn’t know. We didn’t either . . . We started playing with Yushanfang in March [2014] and by July we . . . [began] working with it regularly. We participated in an algorithm competition and made a breakthrough at the end of 2014. It was then that we realized that we finally knew how to use data from Alibaba! We implemented our ideas: Finding data from Alibaba gaining insights identifying [our] target audience and pitching promotions!In 2015 Yushanfang was officially announced. MarcPoint received one of the first licences and immediately started acquiring clients. In a few short months MarcPoint became Yushanfang’s leading marketing service provider and MarcPoint’s business grew steadily on the Yushanfang platform. After that time however Yushanfang went through quite a few changes and the collaboration with Alibaba did not stay a perfect partnership for long. In mid-2016 MarcPoint started to shift away from Yushanfang and Alibaba. In spring 2018 Alibaba stopped updating Yushanfang products. Although MarcPoint still collaborated with Alibaba it did not rely on it as much as it used to. The Core Competency Nevertheless working with Yushanfang turned out to be a critical stage in the growth of MarcPoint as it was during that time that MarcPoint verified and polished its core competencies and business model. Noted for its work with Yushanfang MarcPoint was invited to give a talk at an August 2015 ESOMAR event. The talk was titled “From Consumer Insight to Actions” and Jianming believed that this title best summarized MarcPoint’s business.Jianming started MarcPoint by first recruiting the technical team. Over time the technical team grew to include three groups: data programming and algorithm. The data group was in charge of data acquisition cleansing and management. The algorithm group was research-oriented and mostly concerned with how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the big-data algorithms MarcPoint used. The programming group did the actual coding. MarcPoint invested heavily in its technical team which made up about half of its employees. The company supported an employee’s pursuit of a doctoral degree in data science after financing her master’s degree in the United States. Jun even had a paper published that was based on one of his projects and that he presented at a leading conference. These were rare occurrences for a company of MarcPoint’s size and resources. Yet neither Jianming nor Jie thought MarcPoint’s strength in technology alone was responsible for its success. They both believed that it took much more for MarcPoint to be able to generate value for clients through big data. According to Jie MarcPoint’s core competency was its ability to integrate data technology and industry experience:We [and our competitors] all compete on one competency that is how to get more data with more dimensions and how to connect the isolated data silos . . . But I believe many of our competitors started on the wrong foot because they care too much about the big-ness and all-inclusiveness [of the data]. An over-emphasis on the big-ness and all-inclusiveness leads to the over-emphasis on data and technology. However the nature of all businesses requires some subject domain knowledge in the particular industry. You need such knowledge to put everything in perspective. So we took a different approach. We started with deep subject domain knowledge. We tried to understand what’s going on by integrating subject domain knowledge with data and technology. MarcPoint’s emphasis on subject-domain knowledge while different from many other technology-oriented big-data companies was not surprising given that both co-founders were marketing veterans and had between them nearly 50 years’ worth of experience in marketing research. To Jianming big data was like a great hammer; but when everybody has a hammer the question becomes how to find the right nails:Many technology-oriented startups have disappeared. They attracted a lot of VC [venture capital] money but they had no idea what to do with it . . . One company was trying to collaborate with us. They coded a lot of tools and acquired a lot of data. After some time I asked them to just give us the data and let us deal with them with Excel . . . Their tools were useless because they created a system along the analytic dimensions they imagined. But that’s not how we marketing people do it. We would like to solve problem A but they were trying to convince us to use this tool to solve a problem which is totally different . . . We may not have those fancy technologies but we can solve our clients’ problems! . . . I finally realized big data is like a hammer. Now everybody says [“]I have a great hammer[”] but the question is “where are the nails”? We are the ones who find the nails!Yet finding the nails was not always easy. It took a great deal of orchestration to integrate data technology and subject-domain knowledge. First of all the subject-domain knowledge had to be encoded into their big-data processing system for it to work which required expertise patience and effort. In order to accurately process the textual data collected from various online sources MarcPoint started with building a lexicon and then used the lexicon to build knowledge graphs that could be used in turn to break the isolations between various data sources. To do so effectively often entailed hiring external experts or acquiring external knowledge. One industry that MarcPoint particularly focused on was baby care. To build the lexicon MarcPoint had to hire gynecologists and rely on their expertise. As Jianming explained For expecting mothers the phrase “create a card” carries a special meaning. But to us we had no idea what it is. The gynecologists would tell us that this phrase means the mother has made a decision on the hospital where she is going to give birth which is a very big deal.Jianming also emphasized the importance of learning from clients:We spend most of our time with our clients which is how we differ from most technology-focused companies. For example at the end of a year many technology-focused companies were busy attending award ceremonies. We don’t get any awards anyway. We run from one client to another. We spend most of our time with our clients . . . Very often the clients are extremely knowledgeable. Like yesterday I was with [a client] and spent time with two of their marketing people. They explained what they did in the baby care industry. They were deeply deeply knowledgeable in this industry.Additionally Jie explained three keys to achieving such integration:First you must be guided by the results pursued by the client’s industry and then figure out how your data and technologies can support [the results]. This is the first integration. The second integration is that of talents. That is you start with talents specializing in marketing in technologies in data. Now you have to make sure they understand other areas [than their own specialization] . . . The third integration is that of cultures. The three kinds of people have different cultures. The marketing people think divergently. The technology people are more likely to be focused. The data people probably are something still different. In [a] certain sense we need the marketing people to get down to earth more and the technology people to become a little bit more romantic. So it is very important for us to build a culture and environment in the middle ground. The Current BusinessIn 2018 MarcPoint was already in its fifth year and its business model had evolved into providing total marketing solutions supported by big data (see Exhibit 1). Consumer Big DataAfter five years of hard work MarcPoint became keenly aware of the importance not only of data but also of having access to and control of data. MarcPoint carefully chose which industries to enter and the availability and quality of data were important considerations that factored into their decision. For the baby care industry where MarcPoint excelled it captured publicly available data from dozens of online baby care communities and health care platforms that were highly active and thus offered rich and valuable data. Jianming explained:The baby care industry is big (the market scale is hundreds of billions of RMB yuan). The consumers care about the industry very much. Moms are engaged in online discussions and the discussions are in depth and of high quality. Moreover giving birth to and caring for babies are uniquely important stage[s] of Moms’ lives. They prefer to discuss on specialized baby care platforms [rather than generic online communities]. Finally [the] baby care industry has some legal and professional barriers. It is not an industry that anybody can get involved [in].The online baby care communities MarcPoint worked with had a total of more than 70 million mothers and 3.4 billion messages. The online health care platforms involved more than half a million doctors and 1.3 billion interactions between doctors and patients. These data were further enhanced with those from other public sources such as e-commerce websites Weibo messages and WeChat subscription accounts. In total MarcPoint stored nine billion messages from more than 300 million users across sources. More than three million messages were added to storage every day. Additionally MarcPoint acquired access to proprietary data owned by private sources partner platforms and other companies. From Data to InsightsThe fast-growing genuine and valuable data MarcPoint acquired from various sources in huge volume provided it with a solid foundation upon which to build its business model. To turn data into insights MarcPoint greatly relied on its deep understanding of the industry its clients competed in its own marketing expertise the integration between data and subject-domain knowledge and its superior algorithms. For the past five years MarcPoint had focused on and invested in the baby care industry. The investment had led to not only the best big-data set in the industry but also a lexicon tagged along the most dimensions and the most comprehensive knowledge graph. The machine learning algorithm used for processing the messages were developed in-house adjusted for the baby care industry and repeatedly used and verified. Jun believed that MarcPoint enjoyed a few advantages over its competitors:Computing-wise we already built a local hadoop cluster of 10 servers and deployed a cluster of 200 servers on the cloud. We built this hybrid-cloud-based architecture for big data storage processing mining and maintenance. It can support multi-users multi-tasks [and] offline and real-time computing. It also offers a deep-learning framework that coordinates computing resources among CPUs and GPUs. All these efforts provide MarcPoint with the technical foundation on which its products and services are built. Specifically in the artificial intelligence [AI] area we built an AI computing suite focusing on natural language processing [NLP] knowledge graph and deep learning. My paper on NLP was accepted by [the] AAAI [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence] the top AI conference in 2018. The paper highlighted MarcPoint’s accumulated efforts in NLP data in the baby care industry and algorithms.Guided by its deep understanding of the client industry and the problems its clients were facing and supported by its big-data set comprehensive knowledge graph and superior algorithms MarcPoint was able to generate consumer insights that catered to its clients’ needs. These insights had typically allowed MarcPoint to help clients with a) identifying category users and potential users; b) identifying brand users and potential users; c) discovering consumer demands consumer context and topics for paid review; and d) discovering consumer journey and customer touchpoints.From Insights to Actions Armed with consumer insights generated from the big data MarcPoint further offered its clients comprehensive solutions that included promotion actions targeting their customers. Jianming explainedOn the Alibaba’s platform things are easier because Alibaba offers a great advertising platform. We can help with both strategic advertising and tactic advertising . . . On some other platforms we need to collaborate with the platforms . . . We collaborate with them on advertising content and key opinion leaders . . . In other words we tell our clients who your consumers are where you can interact with them and with what messages you can interact with them . . . Not only do we tell them we can also actually do it for them . . . This is what we mean by “. . . from insights to actions.”Results AnalysisThere was a famous saying among marketing professionals: “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” As Jie explained the emergence of big data offered an opportunity to better understand:Why don’t you know which half? The answer is simple: because you don’t know what happened in between. You don’t have the data to understand what led to the results . . . But when you have data once you have the promotion strategy and have it implemented you can monitor the results . . . [It is not necessarily 50 per cent versus 50 per cent.] You can actually tell whether it is 20 per cent or 80 per cent that works right? When we plan our promotion goals and strategies we create a few key performance indexes[] such as how many new users we need to generate or how much more usage my existing customers need to make . . .  [With big data] we know which consumers we try to target. We also know how many of them changed behavior. All those are in your plan. Once it is implemented you can certainly see the before-after changes [from the big data] . . . In this sense big data let[s] you know exactly which creative idea can activate the consumers. The FutureBy early 2018 MarcPoint had firmly established itself as a leading big-data marketing service provider in China. In the immediate future MarcPoint planned to expand its businesses both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally Jianming and Jie wanted to expand MarcPoint’s success in the baby care industry to the health care industry. Jie noted the similarity and connectivity between the two industries:Both markets are sufficiently big worth more than a trillion yuan. Additionally both markets are data rich. Compared with larger industries[] such as fast-moving consumer goods and automobile the dimensionalities and volume of the data in both markets are big enough. The two markets are connected too. You have data of the whole chain from online baby care communities such as babytree.com and mamacn.com to online diagnosis platforms to e-commerce websites. From the perspective of marketing you have data of all categories and the complete chain [in both markets].Vertically MarcPoint insisted on being the full-service provider that focused on creating value for customers. Jianming explained:There will certainly be distractions. For example while the consumer insights we generate for our customers is arguably the most valuable the action stage is the easiest stage for us to make a profit because usually the customers spend the most in actual advertising . . . If you spend 100 million in advertising and my agent fee is 2 per cent I will earn 2 million which is good enough and easy enough. However it is much more difficult to provide full service (from data to insight to action to results). Many companies simply won’t do this . . . Yet you can only maximize the value for your customers with the full service. Additionally MarcPoint was exploring offering their data algorithms and knowledge graphs as products to customers. Jianming referred to the synergy of the three as the “intelligent engine” and he considered this engine the “propeller” that drove marketing:What is an intelligent engine? It is the source of the propulsion that drives marketing . . . The engine integrates data knowledge graphs and algorithms. You can only discover the value of the data with the three . . . We turn the engine into a technical product . . . that can be used by not only us but also platforms other service providers and possibly companies. This idea is a natural evolution of our business. We already know how to provide our customers with full services. We’ve figured it out. Now we consolidate the services into quite a few concrete products and connect them into a system and make it accessible to others. Having embraced the changes brought by the Internet and big data he believed that more changes—and more dramatic changes—were still on the way:This is an era for reconstruction. The Internet big data and machine learning changed consumers and brought changes to many industries. In the marketing industry that we were familiar with the business models the value chain and those who are involved have all changed. More importantly the real changes might just get started . . . From the legal and policy perspective a series of problems caused by the Internet and big data—for example privacy protection data ownership and data asset pricing—have emerged and are waiting to be solved. From a more macro perspective China the United States and Europe are all undergoing changes that we don’t fully understand yet. All these changes are more likely to occur in the next 3 to 5 years than in 8 or 10 years.As MarcPoint celebrated its fifth anniversary Jianming was quite pleased by what MarcPoint had achieved. However with his ambition and vision he wondered what MarcPoint’s next steps should be. What technologies should it pursue? Which markets could it target for growth in the next five years? Should he try to transport MarcPoint’s success to overseas markets? All in all what did Jianming need to do to sustain MarcPoint’s growth and maintain its leading position in the turbulent technical and business environment? He could not help but begin to wonder about the next phase of MarcPoint and the future of big-data-driven marketing—not only in China but also in the rest of the world.exhibit 1: MarcPoint’s competitive advantageSource: Company documents.,26,"[{""start"":1220,""end"":1225,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1794,""end"":1799,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2888,""end"":2893,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3078,""end"":3083,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3167,""end"":3172,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3568,""end"":3573,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4218,""end"":4223,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":4367,""end"":4372,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":8430,""end"":8435,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11435,""end"":11440,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":11819,""end"":11824,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12367,""end"":12372,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":27864,""end"":27869,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":31093,""end"":31098,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":31928,""end"":31933,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1033,""end"":1045,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1235,""end"":1243,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1360,""end"":1368,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1805,""end"":1813,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2927,""end"":2935,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":4501,""end"":4509,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":5169,""end"":5177,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":7001,""end"":7011,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":8257,""end"":8265,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":9803,""end"":9811,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10192,""end"":10200,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10673,""end"":10681,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11139,""end"":11147,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11197,""end"":11205,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11614,""end"":11622,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12451,""end"":12459,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12736,""end"":12744,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":13604,""end"":13612,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15403,""end"":15411,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15332,""end"":15340,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16276,""end"":16284,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19455,""end"":19463,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19747,""end"":19755,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":22054,""end"":22062,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":25936,""end"":25944,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27985,""end"":27993,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":28841,""end"":28849,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29602,""end"":29610,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":31327,""end"":31335,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":31663,""end"":31671,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1937,""end"":1939,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2032,""end"":2034,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":4681,""end"":4683,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5389,""end"":5391,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5506,""end"":5508,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":5414,""end"":5416,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8985,""end"":8988,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":9323,""end"":9326,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":10256,""end"":10259,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

This note provides a guide to options trading for entry-level traders and represents a logical next stage to the note An Introduction to the Pricing of Options. The note reviews characteristics of options and the factors affecting their valuation and outlines several trading mechanisms that new options traders might use as they seek their most effective strategies. These mechanisms include long call short put bull call spread short call long put bear put spread short straddle short strangle long butterfly long straddle and long strangle. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION Options are financial products that derive their value from an underlying asset. They are leveraged financial instruments that allow traders to make a higher return on a smaller outlay than they might make by investing directly in the underlying asset. Options give traders increased exposure to changes in the value of the underlying asset; that is traders can profit and lose more with an option than with the underlying asset itself.Options are bought and sold. A buyer is said to take an option and is thus referred to as a taker. A seller is said to write the option and is thus referred to as the writer.There are two types of options: call options (calls) and put options (puts). Calls give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) before or at the expiration date of the option. Puts on the other hand give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date. Both calls and puts share the same uniform characteristics: premiums maturity strike price an underlying asset and option style.OPTION CHARACTERISTICSPremiumA premium is the amount a buyer pays to receive the option; that amount changes on a daily basis. When a trader buys an option (takes a long position) the trader pays the premium. When a seller writes an option (takes a short position) the seller receives the premium. The premium compensates the option seller for taking on the risks associated with writing the option.The premium for an option is the sum of the option’s intrinsic and time values. The intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. The time value represents the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the possibility that the market will move before the option expires. As the amount of time available decreases the opportunity to become profitable declines; this decline in value is referred to as time decay. Time value is influenced by several factors: market volatility time to expiry future dividends and interest rates.Maturity Maturity is the time remaining between the date the option is purchased and the date the option expires. The majority of options bought and sold have a maturity of a month. However the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) list both options that expire in a month and those that expire in a week providing traders with a choice of maturity. When deciding on a trading strategy traders need to consider when and over how much time (the time period) their predicted event or movement will occur. As the needed amount of time increases (the maturity gets longer) the associated premium increases because the option writer takes on a greater risk. Strike PriceStrike price is the predetermined price a buyer will pay if exercising the option to purchase the underlying asset. The strike price is locked in with the options contract. For instance on August 19 2016 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) stock was trading at A$73.12. Assume a trader believed the share price was going to rise so took a long position in a call option—that is took an option to purchase the underlying asset—with a strike price of $73.00. The trader would have the right to buy CBA shares at $73.00 regardless of the market price up to the option’s expiry date.Underlying AssetEach option derives its value from an underlying asset. Options on both the ASX and the CBOE derive their value from either equities or indexes. The CBA example discussed above under “Strike Price” would be classified as an equity option because the option value is derived from an individual company’s stock. In contrast the value of an index option is derived from the underlying index (e.g. S&P500). Options less frequently use commodities as the underlying asset; commodities traders prefer trading with other derivative instruments such as futures and forwards. Option StyleThere are two option styles available on the ASX: American and European. An American style option allows the option holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiry date; European style options in contrast can only be exercised at maturity. Index options are all European style while equity options can be either style based on trader preferences. CBOE equity options are all American style. American and European style options are the most frequently used styles; however there are numerous other styles. The styles vary mainly in terms of the rights to exercise the options; for example a Canary option allows the option holder to exercise the option at quarterly dates but not before a set period of time has elapsed. Another a Bermudan option gives the holder the right to exercise the option a set number of times prior to maturity. Contract SizeAll single stock options traded on the ASX have an initial standardized contract size of 100 underlying shares. On rare occasions the contract size may be adjusted to compensate for corporate actions on the underlying asset such as issuing new shares. In general a standardized contract size means a trader who has purchased a call option on CBA stock would have the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 CBA shares at the predetermined price any time up to the option’s maturity. Index options (e.g. XJO) are usually standardized at an index multiplier of $10 per index point movement.Equity options traded on CBOE also have a standard contract size of 100 shares; however their index options have varying amounts for the index multiplier dependent on the underlying index. Factors Influencing Option Price and ValueThere are several factors that affect the value and price of an option. When investing directly in an equity the trader’s only concern is price movement: did the share increase or decrease in price? The value of an option however depends on several factors: volatility intrinsic value movement of the underlying asset price expiry date interest rate changes and dividends.Volatility Volatility captures the variation in price expected in the underlying equity or in the case of index options the variation in the underlying index. The variation is measured by the standard deviation of returns; that is how much the price or index deviates from the mean. When an underlying equity asset is highly volatile the share price fluctuates widely increasing the chances that the anticipated price of the shares will be reached. The premium paid for the option is thus greater. When the implied volatility is low the price for the underlying equity is predicted to be reasonably constant and the premium paid for the option will be less. As implied volatility increases the value of both calls and puts increases and as implied volatility decreases option values decrease accordingly. The ASX and CBOE each have real-time volatility indices (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The ASX has the A-VIX which reflects expectations about volatility in Australia’s equity index the S&P/ASX 200 VIX. The CBOE tracks the Volatility Index (VIX) which is based on the S&P 500 Index. Both the A-VIX and the VIX provide insight to expectations of market volatility and the sentiment of futures traders. The A-VIX has a strong negative correlation (inverse relationship) with the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index (see Exhibit 3) and is therefore a useful tool for assessing the market trend and anticipated changes in volatility.Intrinsic Value The intrinsic value of an option is largely dependent on the strike price set in the option.If on August 19 2016 when the market price of CBA was $73.50 a trader took a long call position on CBA stock with a strike price of $65.00 the intrinsic value of the option would have been $8.50 (the difference between the market and strike prices). When a share price on the market is greater than the strike price in a call option (as in this example) the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). Option buyers pay a high premium for this valuable option.If on the same day another trader took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $73.50 the current market price and the strike price would be the same. This call option would be considered to be “at the money” (ATM). ATM options have no intrinsic value but because the market price is almost certainly going to change over time ATM options have the greatest time value. A premium for an ATM option is usually less than the premium for an ITM option. In the final scenario if yet another a trader on the same day took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $75.00 the current market price would be less than the strike price. When the strike price is higher than the market price the call option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). OTM options have no intrinsic value and have a smaller chance of success than ITM or ATM options. OTM options require the most price movement in the underlying asset to be ITM. The premium on an OTM option is significantly less than the premiums for ITM and ATM options. Therefore the advantage to buying an OTM option is the potential even if small for a significant return on a very low premium. Movement of the Underlying Asset PriceThe price movements of the underlying asset play a key role in determining the value of an option. If the price of the underlying asset is increasing the value of a call option (the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a fixed lower price) increases and the value of a put option (the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a below market price) decreases. When the price of an underlying asset is decreasing the opposite is true: the value of call options decreases and the value of put options increases.Expiry DateThe more time there is before an option expires the greater the chance the option will end ITM. Time decay (decline in the opportunity to become profitable) has the greatest negative impact on the value of an option. Typically an option loses one-third of its time value in the first half of its life and the remaining two-thirds of time value in its second half. An OTM option approaching expiry will suffer the greatest drop in value. Interest Rate Changes Interest rate changes have a small but measurable impact on option prices. When interest rates increase call premiums increase and put premiums decrease. This occurs because call buyers have the right to purchase the underlying asset at any time up to expiry; until they decide to exercise their option (or not) call buyers can invest their funds at higher yielding risk-free rates. Call buyers in this case are earning income while holding the option. Put prices decrease because put buyers have the right to sell the underlying asset any time up to maturity. They are holding the underlying asset so do not have the ability to invest their funds at higher risk-free rates. Traders in this case have the benefit of purchasing put options at a lower premium.DividendsOption prices are affected by anticipated dividends to be paid on the underlying asset within the option’s term (i.e. before expiry). The general consensus is that when a dividend is paid out on a stock the share price will drop in proportion to the dividend paid. Therefore if a dividend of an underlying asset increases during the term of the option the value of the underlying asset will likely decrease before the option expires. This affects the option’s premium: call premiums decrease and put premiums increase. (When assessing the impact of dividends it is important to remember that a share’s ex-dividend date—the date when a declared dividend belongs to the holder of the stock—is usually earlier than the date the dividend payment will be made.)Option Value Sensitivity MeasuresDelta is a sensitivity measure comparing the change in an option’s price to the change in the price of the underlying asset. We can estimate the likely change in an option’s price by multiplying the underlying asset price change by the option’s delta. Delta also infers the intrinsic value of an option and constantly changes with price movements in the underlying asset.All call options have a delta range of zero to one. A delta below 0.5 implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly 0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta above 0.5 implies the option is ITM.All put options have a delta range of zero to negative one. A delta above −0.5 (approaching zero) implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly −0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta below −0.5 (approaching negative one) implies the option is ITM.Vega is also a sensitivity measure. It measures the impact of changes in the underlying asset’s volatility on the option’s price. The vega of an option represents the amount that an option’s contract changes in relation to a 1 per cent change in the underlying asset’s volatility.Besides delta and vega there are other “Greeks” measuring option sensitivities. For example theta measures the change in an option’s price as the number of days until expiration decreases; theta is usually measured by one day. Rho measures an option’s change in premium if interest rates move by a specified percentage. Gamma measures the option’s delta change if the underlying asset moves by a specified percentage. (Further information on options Greeks is available on ASX’s website.)Options at ExpirationWhen an option expires—which for monthly single stock contracts listed on the ASX is every Thursday before the last Friday of the month and on the CBOE is the third Friday of the month—the option holder faces three alternatives: exercise the option sell the option or roll the option into another option if the held option is ATM or ITM. If the held option is OTM at expiration the option expires worthless. Tree diagrams demonstrate the call and put option holder’s choices at expiration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Market Participants Options market participants include hedgers speculators arbitrageurs and market makers. Hedgers use options to reduce the risks associated with market uncertainty. Speculators use options to leverage into a position to capture gains based on the direction they believe a market is going. Arbitrageurs exploit imperfections and inefficiencies in the market often at very high speeds to make money. Market makers trade volatility (vega) as opposed to market movements (delta). Traders normally fall into the categories of hedgers or speculators. Brokers and dealers represent investors and place orders on their behalf for execution on the exchange (central market).There are four types of trades that an options market participant can make:Buy a call.Sell a call.Buy a put.Sell a put.Option holders called buyers or takers can choose whether or not to exercise the option. These participants could be hedging their current shareholdings from price risk or they could be investing in these leveraged derivatives to get greater exposure to the predicted price movement in their underlying asset. Losses for option holders are limited to the premium paid for the option (if the option expires OTM); however option holders have the potential to earn unlimited profits if the option expires ITM.Option providers called sellers or writers provide option holders with the right to exercise the option. That means that option providers are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder decides to exercise the option. Thus option providers limit their profit to the premium received for providing the option; however they have potentially unlimited losses if the option expires ITM (with the market price higher than the strike price). For this reason option sellers are required to lodge a margin to ensure they can meet their obligations if an undesirable outcome occurs. Exhibits 6 7 8 and 9 provide profit and payoff diagrams of the four options trades. The four trade types when combined in different ways create different strategies for trading options.ANALYSESAn options trader needs to be able to make a market prediction and set an investment goal before selecting a trading strategy.Market Prediction: What do you think will occur in the future?An options trader must first predict what will happen to an underlying asset over a given period. Most traders will use some type of analysis whether it be fundamental or technical to determine what they believe will happen to an underlying asset whether a stock or an index. The analysis should consider when and over what period of time the underlying asset is expected to move. For example a trader’s prediction may be linked to a type of planned market announcement such as company results or to a piece of economic news such as a change to the reserve bank cash rate.Once the investment period and expected price movement are calculated traders need to add their own (or their investors’) risk profiles to the decision to decide what strike price and maturity to use within an options strategy. It is fair to say that the more a trader risks the more a strategy will return.Investment Goal: What are you trying to accomplish using options?Knowing what is wanted from an investment will reduce the number of option strategies to those appropriate for reaching the desired goal. An investor may want to protect the value of held shares in the event the market goes down or an investor may want to earn extra income from held stocks while markets are flat. To illustrate these goals assume the market analysis indicates stock XYZ will rise 2 per cent in the next four months (the prediction) and the investor wants to earn extra income (the goal). A trader could sell a 102 per cent strike call option with a maturity of four months meaning the option holder can purchase the investor’s shares at 102 per cent of their value at any point during or at the end of the four months. The prediction is that the investor will not have to sell the shares (because the market and strike price are the same) and the investor earns the premium paid by the option buyer. However if the analysis is slightly out—say for example the investor’s stock goes up 2.5 per cent—the option holder will exercise the option to purchase the shares and the investor will need to deliver them meaning the investor will have sold the stock at a loss. If the trader was writing a call option to gain income on a stock position this would not be the desired result. To reduce the risk of the option being exercised (also called “assigned”) and keep the underlying stock the trader may want to consider writing a call option with a shorter maturity date (three months) or a higher strike price (103 per cent) or possibly both. In either case the option premium would be less.Tools for AnalysisTraders now have multiple tools they can use to analyze option strategies and choose which are the best to use under certain conditions. An example of one of these tools is the ASX/TradeFloor options trading simulator which was developed to help first-time options traders understand how options work. Within this application traders can review stocks they are interested in build different option strategies based on their views of where an underlying asset may trade in the future and manage their portfolios. The application allows traders to investigate the payoffs and risk profiles of using different strategies while also allowing the trader to see how a particular risk profile of a given strategy changes when using different strike prices and maturities.Fundamental AnalysisFundamental analysis involves evaluating the intrinsic value of a company. It involves the use of balance sheets financial reports cash flow statements public announcements earnings reports and all publicly available information to establish an opinion about the direction and outlook of the company. There are numerous methods for determining a fair share value; that value can then be compared to the current market price which in turn signals the direction of price movement. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) provides information about the earnings attributable to each outstanding share. This ratio is easily calculated by dividing a company’s net profit after tax by its total number of shares outstanding. Traders prefer an EPS to be growing at a consistent rate which suggests a bullish outlook while a decreasing ratio implies a bearish outlook. Price to Earnings RatioThe price to earnings (P/E) ratio provides information about a company’s growth prospects and indicates whether the company’s shares are currently over under or fairly priced. The ratio is calculated by dividing the share’s current market price by its EPS. In isolation the P/E ratio is meaningless; for meaningful information a company’s P/E ratio needs to be compared to that of a similar company. The P/E growth (PEG) ratio further aids in determining whether an equity is under- or overpriced. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected rate of growth in EPS. A PEG ratio close to 2 suggests that the stock is overpriced and a PEG ratio of 1 suggests the stock may be fair value. DividendsWhen analyzing a company the trader must determine whether the company pays a regular dividend on the equity. A dividend that is maintained or increased from the previous year signals to the market that the company is in good financial health. A dividend that is reduced signals that the company does not have sufficient profits each year to pay its shareholders. To calculate a dividend per share ratio divide the sum set aside for dividends by the number of shares outstanding.Dividend yield is a good method for comparing dividends paid out from companies in similar industries. To calculate dividend yield divide the dividend payout per share by the current share price. Companies with growing dividend yields suggest a bullish outlook and companies with decreasing yields suggest a bearish outlook. Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) provides information about how well a company is using shareholders’ funds. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s after-tax profit by the shareholders’ equity. A high ROE suggests that management is making good use of shareholders’ funds while a low ROE suggests the contrary.Earnings ReportsIt is essential to know when companies are due to release any earnings reports or announcements. These releases can have a profound effect on share price. If a company were to report mass losses for a quarter the information could initiate a massive sell-off in the market which would cause a large drop in share price. Alternatively the company could publish profits higher than expected which would cause an increased demand for the company’s shares and hence a rise in share price. Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis consists of studying past market data specifically the price and volume to predict future price direction. There are a vast number of technical indicators that traders use to forecast price movements. In this note we will focus on the use of trend lines Bollinger bands moving average convergence divergence and relative strength indicators to evaluate a company.Trend Lines Trend lines are highly suggestive of the direction a stock price will move. Support and resistance lines are established for the desired period of time: the support line illustrates the lowest price traders believe the share will fall to and the resistance line indicates the highest share price traders believe the share will earn. Technical analysts believe that a share will trade between the two lines and that the price is unlikely to fall below a support line or rise above the resistance line. Analysts believe that if a resistance or support line is broken once it is broken the share price will continue in the direction of the breakout requiring a new resistance or support line to be established (see Exhibit 10).There are numerous patterns that technical analysts seek with trend lines (see Exhibits 11 and 12 for uptrend and downtrend respectively). An ascending triangle occurs when an up-trending support line approaches a flat resistance line. This suggests the share may well make a sharp move upward for an explosive breakout. A descending triangle where the down-trending resistance line approaches a flat support line signals the opposite—a large price drop (see Exhibit 13 for a descending trend line). Bollinger Bands Bollinger bands are used to establish a share’s short-term prices. The indicator is created by plotting the average predetermined number of prices. Two trading bands are then added representing the standard deviation of the share price one band above (the highest price) and the other below (the lowest price) the centre line. Simply adding and subtracting one standard deviation from the moving average creates the outer bands. Under normal market conditions the price of a security will trade within the bands. The bands will expand as the share price becomes more volatile and contract as volatility decreases.Bollinger bands help establish common trends. Periods of high volatility (expansion) tend to follow periods of low volatility (contraction). When the price of a share crosses the upper Bollinger band analysts believe the share is overbought and the price is due for a correction with a drop (a pullback). When the price crosses the lower band analysts believe the security is oversold and a price correction back up to its true value (rally back) is imminent (see Exhibit 14).Moving Average Convergence DivergenceMoving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that analysts use to establish a buy or sell signal. MACD illustrates the relationship between two moving price averages. The MACD is the result of subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD termed a signal line is then plotted on top of the MACD. When the MACD falls below the signal line it is a bearish signal. When the MACD rises above the signal line it is a bullish signal (see Exhibit 15). Relative Strength IndicatorA relative strength indicator (RSI) is also a momentum indicator; it compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to gauge the speed and change of a share’s price movements. RSI is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. If RSI values cross above 70 it is believed that the security is overbought and due for a pullback in price. If the RSI values cross below 30 the share is believed to be oversold and a price increase is due (see Exhibit 16).Option StrategiesThere are many option strategies available for varying market conditions. We will analyze a select few strategies for bullish bearish neutral and event-driven situations. It is important to understand the risks involved with trading options. Buying an option with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset will increase limits the buyer’s potential loss to the premium paid for the option. Providing or writing an option however exposes the trader to the potential of unlimited losses; for that reason the provider must have a margin account containing collateral. To analyze the selected strategies we will focus on the construction margin requirement market outlook and profit and loss of the strategies. For the purpose of explanation a hypothetical strike prices has been added for the following strategies. Bullish ViewBullish strategies do better in a rising market. They usually involve buying call options and selling put options to benefit from increasing asset prices.Long Call (see Exhibit 6)When a trader expects the price of the underlying stock to rise the bought call can provide leveraged exposure to the price increase. Buying a call also locks in a maximum purchase price for the life of the option.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will rise above A; volatility increasing.Profit: Unlimited profit potential if share price continues to rise (see Exhibit 6). Loss: Limited to premium paid.Break-even: Share price = strike price + premium paid.Intuition: Share price will rise above A; the call option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Effect of time decay works against the buyer of the call. If the expected rise in share price does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will erode the value of the option. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the cost of the option against the rise in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest rise in share price. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the best balance of risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for the share price to rise and will be more expensive than a shorter-term option. The trader needs to decide when and over what period of time the share price is expected to move. If the rise in share price takes place as expected the option buyer must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not rise as expected it is often advisable to exercise the option (“close out the position”) and recover some time value on the investment. If the option is ITM when it expires the trader must choose whether to sell the option or exercise it. The choice will be determined by whether the trader wants to own the underlying shares.Bull Call SpreadIf the trader is not bullish enough to buy a call outright but expects the share price to rise moderately the bull spread is a lower-cost way to gain exposure to such a market movement. The strategy consists of the simultaneous purchase of a call option (“long leg of the spread”) and sale of a call option with a higher strike price (“short leg of the spread”) but with the same expiration date.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A and sell a call at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish; market price to rise; volatility steady to rising.Profit: Limited to the difference between A and B (spread) less the premium paid for the spread.Loss: Limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = lower strike price + cost of spread.Intuition: Bought call A will be ATM (hence costly); therefore sell an OTM call with higher strike price B to receive a premium that reduces the overall cost of the strategy.Other points of consideration:The bull spread has limited risk and limited reward. It is a cheaper strategy than simply buying a call option. As a result the profit potential is reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is worth the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting will be greater for this strategy than when buying a call outright.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the option will cost money; however if the stock is trading around the higher strike price the option will make money.If the stock unexpectedly rises sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the upper strike price is reached. Although time value is helpful around the strike price of the short call unwinding the strategy early removes the risk that the short call will be exercised. If the stock price falls suddenly the spread may be unwound before the long call loses too much time value.Consider the bull spread when expecting a limited rise in the price of the stock. Do not enter the call options separately (“leg in” to the strategy). Enter the trade as a spread and unwind it as a spread. Bearish ViewBearish strategies work best in falling markets. Bearish strategies generally rely on buying put options to lock in selling prices as asset prices decrease.Long Put (see Exhibit 8)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to fall the bought put provides leveraged exposure to the price fall. Buying a put option is one of the few ways traders can speculate on a falling share price. Put options may also be used to protect an investor’s holding in the underlying stock.Construction: Buy one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to fall below A; volatility rising.Profit: Limited to strike price less premium paid for the option (see Exhibit 8).Loss: Limited to premium paid for the option.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium paid.Intuition: Share price will drop below strike price A; the put option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Time decay works against the buyer of the put. If the expected share price fall does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option. When setting the strike price the trader must balance the cost of the option against the fall in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest fall in share price. If the trader is buying a put to protect a shareholding the cost of the option must be weighed against the required protection. The ITM option locks in the highest sale price for the underlying shares but is also the most expensive option.If the fall in share price takes place as expected the put option taker must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not fall as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to recover some time value.At expiry the holder of an ITM put option will usually close out rather than exercise the position (unless the holder owns the underlying shares). If the put has been bought to protect a shareholding the trader must decide whether to continue holding the stock in which case the put would be sold or sell the shares in which case the option would be exercised.Short Call (see Exhibit 9)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to go down the sold call can provide leveraged exposure to the price reduction. Selling a call does not limit the trader’s potential loss so it carries a greater risk profile than purchasing a put.Construction: Sell one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bearish; share price will go below strike price A; volatility neutral to reducing.Profit: Maximum profit is premium received for providing the option (see Exhibit 9).Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received. Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed.Other points of consideration:Time decay works for the seller of the call. If the expected share price reduction does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option to the seller’s advantage. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the premium received on the option against the reduction in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will obtain the lowest premium but also carries the lowest chance of loss. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the highest risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for a reduction in the share price to take place. It will generate a higher premium but it carries a greater risk of the market moving against the trader. The trader needs to identify the time period over which the share price movement is expected to take place. If the share price reduction takes place as expected the call option taker will normally not exercise the option. However if the stock price is ATM or ITM and the taker exercises the option the writer must deliver the stock.If the share price does not reduce as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to remove the risk of assignment if not already holding the underlying shares. This is called a “naked” position since you hold an option on shares you do not own and would have to acquire these shares if the option were exercised. Assignment risk brings the uncertainty associated with the pricing and timing of acquiring the shares before you can sell them.  Bear Put SpreadThe bear spread can be considered when the trader expects a moderate fall in the market but is not prepared to take a put position outright. The strategy consists of the purchase of a put option (“long leg”) and the sale of a put option with a lower strike price (“short leg”).Construction: Sell one put at strike price A and buy one put at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to expire below strike price A; volatility steady to increasing.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the difference between A and B (the spread) less the premium paid.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = upper strike − cost of spread.Intuition: Purchased put B will be ATM—hence fairly costly. Therefore sell an OTM put with a lower strike price A to receive a premium which decreases the total net cash outlay. Once the share price drops below strike price A the profit is capped. (A short position creates a loss; however this is counterbalanced by the purchased put being deep ITM.)Other points of consideration:The bear spread has limited risk and limited reward. It costs less to place than an outright purchase of a put option. As a result the potential for profit is also reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is justified by the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting can significantly reduce profitability.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the impact of time decay will be positive and you will make money due to the strategy; if the stock is trading around the higher strike it will cost money to hold the strategy.If the stock unexpectedly falls sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the lower strike price is reached. Time decay will benefit the spread around the lower strike price; however the trader will usually be more concerned with avoiding exercise on the short leg.If the stock price rises suddenly the spread may be unwound before the taken put loses too much time value.Use the bear spread when you are expecting a limited fall in the underlying stock. Do not leg in to this strategy; rather trade both options at the same time. Neutral ViewNeutral strategies work best in stagnant markets. They often involve balancing the purchase and sale of both call and put options to take advantage of any changes in underlying asset prices.Short Put (see Exhibit 7)The written put can provide the trader with extra income in flat to rising markets. It can also be used as a way to buy stock cheaply. This strategy is generally used when the trader expects the share price to remain steady or increase slightly over the life of the option.Construction: Sell one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will expire above A; volatility falling.Profit: Limited to premium received (see Exhibit 7).Loss: Maximum loss equals strike price A less premium received.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received.Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed. Other points of consideration:Many traders write put options as a way of buying stock cheaply. If the share price falls and the option is exercised the purchase price is effectively the strike price of the option less the premium received which is less than the price of the stock at the time of writing the option. If the share price at expiry is above the strike price the option will expire worthless. The trader does not get to buy the stock but has benefited from the receipt of the premium. Time decay works in favour of the put writer. If the stock price stays steady the ATM option will deliver the most profit to the put writer because this is the option with the most time value. The put writer must be wary of exercising the option too early. Generally a put option is more likely than a call option to be exercised early. This strategy can result in heavy losses if the share price falls significantly. Puts should only be written if the seller has the financial capacity to buy the underlying shares should the option be exercised. Monitor the position closely. An ITM option will need to be closed to avoid exercise. Short StraddleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short straddle may be considered. This strategy has a higher potential profit than the short strangle; however it offers less protection since the share price remains within a tighter price range in order to profit. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Sell one call at A and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Neutral; share price will expire around A; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit limited to combined premium received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium received.Intuition: The break-even point for the sold call A is the strike price plus the premium received. For the sold put A the break-even point is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader expects the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option to expire worthless and the premiums received to be pocketed. Other points of consideration:The straddle yields higher potential profit than the strangle because of the higher premiums received for writing ATM options. However the strategy provides less protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price does not have to move as much before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. The short straddle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. There is high risk of early exercise on one of the written options making up the straddle because both the call and the put have the same exercise price. Unless the stock price closes at the strike level set in the options one of the options will be ITM and more than likely be exercised.The options trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down (by increasing or decreasing the strike prices in one of the options) thereby creating a strangle.Because the potential is for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. Do not choose distant expiry months. Short StrangleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short strangle may be considered. This strategy has a lower potential profit than the short straddle; however it offers greater protection because the share price must move further to cause a loss. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Sell one call at B and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: The option will expire between strike prices A and B; volatility falling.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the combined premiums received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium received; Share price = lower strike − premium received.Intuition: The intuition for the short straddle also applies here. The difference is that with the short strangle both options have distinctive strike prices. This extends the spread (bounds) within which the trader expects the share price to remain. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while the short straddle is better in a less volatile environment. Other points of consideration:The strangle yields lower potential profit than the straddle because the premiums are lower for writing OTM options. However the strategy provides better protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price has to move further before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. As with the short straddle the short strangle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options there is a lower risk of early exercise than for the straddle. However a dramatic change in the share price can bring one of the options ITM thereby introducing the risk of exercise. The option trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. By taking protection the short strangle is transformed into another strategy known as a “long condor.” If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down thereby maintaining the strangle. The trader should always be aware that although the short strangle is a more defensive strategy than the short straddle a sudden and extreme change in volatility can be very damaging.Because of the potential for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. A trader should use the short strangle over the short straddle if there are any doubts about the market’s neutrality. Do not choose expiry months that are too distant. Long ButterflyThe long butterfly can be used to generate extra income when the trader believes the market is stagnating but does not want to be exposed to an unexpected rise or fall. The strategy consists of buying one ITM and one OTM call and writing two ATM calls.Construction: Buy one call at A sell one call and one put at B and buy one put at C.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Neutral; market price will expire around B; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit will occur at strike price B.Break-even: Share price = lowest strike price (A) + the cost of strategy; Share price = central strike price (B) − the cost of strategy.Loss: The maximum loss is limited to the premiums paid for the strategy.Other points of consideration:The maximum profit from the long butterfly will be earned if the market finishes at the middle strike price when the options expire. In this case only the lower strike price call will finish ITM. Accordingly the trader will profit on the difference between the middle and lower strike prices less the cost of the spread. Most of this profit will develop in the last month as time decay accelerates. The most the trader can lose is the cost of the spread which will occur if the market finishes out past either “wing” of the long butterfly.The presence of short options in the strategy means that an increase in the market price above the central strike price introduces the risk of exercise. The long butterfly can be difficult to place in all but the most liquid stocks. The ATM options that are required on both sides are often thinly traded (exchanged in low volumes with limited interested traders) making the strategy difficult and sometimes costly to set up and trade out. In these circumstances the reward may not justify the effort of entering the position. If the share price remains steady the position may be left until close to expiry since the profit develops almost entirely in the last month.If the share price moves sharply up the trader may consider liquidating the position in order to avoid exercise. If the share price moves sharply down the trader may close out in order to salvage some time value from the taken options in the strategy.Be sure the rewards are sufficient to justify establishing the strategy in the first place. Do not use this strategy on thinly traded stocks. Enter the position with at least a month until expiry.Event Driven (Price Break Out)Long StraddleWhen the trader expects a sharp movement in the share price but is unsure of the direction the movement will take the long straddle may be appropriate. The strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Buy one call at A and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside; on the downside the maximum profit is limited to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium paid.Intuition: The break-even point for the bought call A is the strike price plus the premium received. The break-even for the bought put A is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader does not expect the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option value to increase. Other points of consideration:The bought straddle consists of two long positions. As a result time decay works strongly against the strategy. The longer the straddle is left in place the greater the loss due to time decay. The position must therefore be closely monitored and may need to be closed out well before expiry. The trader must balance the cost of the strategy against the time needed to give it the best chance of success. Distant expiry months will provide the strategy with more time; however longer-dated options will be more expensive than those with shorter dates. The taker of a straddle expects volatility in the market to increase. Only rarely will this strategy be held to expiry. If the trader’s market view proves correct the straddle should be unwound to crystallize the profits. The position can be liquidated on both sides simultaneously or if the OTM option has little value it could be left open in the event the market were to reverse.If volatility does not increase as expected the strategy should be unwound well ahead of expiry before time decay damages the position.Choose options over shares if the market is expected to remain or become volatile. Select an expiry month that gives the strategy time to work. Monitor the position closely and be prepared to unwind it well before expiry. Long StrangleWhen implied volatility is relatively low but the trader expects the stock price to make an explosive move buying a strangle may be appropriate. The strangle is cheaper than the straddle; however a larger move in the share price is required for the strangle to be profitable. The strategy consists of buying a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Buy one call at B and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium; Share price = lower strike − premium.Intuition: The intuition for the long straddle also applies to the long strangle. The difference is that both options have distinctive strike prices which broadens the spread (bounds) that the trader expects the share price to exceed. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while long straddle is more beneficial in a less volatile environment.Other points of consideration:As with the long straddle the long strangle is exposed to time decay. Since both options are OTM they consist entirely of time value. As expiry approaches time decay accelerates. For this reason the strangle is generally unwound well before expiry. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options it costs less than the straddle. The disadvantage is that the share price must move further for the strategy to be profitable. The trader must be expecting a significant move for the long strangle to be considered. If the expected increase in volatility or change in share price is not achieved both options will expire worthless.The strangle should not be held too close to expiry. If the expected move in the share price has taken place the position can usually be unwound at a profit well before expiry. If the stock’s direction becomes clear it may be appropriate to close out the option that is losing its value and continue to hold the profitable option.If the expected increase in volatility does not take place it may be advisable to close the position out before time decay starts to damage the strategy.Choose options over shares when the share price is expected to move strongly in either direction. Always be aware of the effects of time decay and do not hold the position too close to expiry. Choose expiry months that allow enough time for the underlying shares to move. ALTERNATIVES TO TRADING OPTIONSThere are a number of alternative products that can be used by traders to obtain a leveraged investment profile similar to that of options. These products include warrants futures and contracts for difference (CFDs).In order to compare the appropriateness of using an option instead of an alternative product the trader needs to consider the following questions:What is the delta exposure of the product and does this change?Can I write (short) the product?Is margin charged and if so to whom?Is the product traded on exchange or over the counter (OTC)?Who issues the product?How is the market price determined?WarrantsWarrants are very similar to options in that they have rights but not obligations to purchase or sell an underlying product at a given date. Warrants can also have varying degrees of delta just like options. However warrants are issued by companies either on exchange or OTC as opposed to exchange-traded options (ETOs) which are listed by the exchange. Traders cannot write warrants like they can options. Warrants normally have longer expiries than options. The issuer (or appointed market maker) of the warrant product is the only one allowed to write meaning the issuer dictates the price. Options allow all participants to buy and sell creating a more efficient market. Because warrants can only be purchased they do not require a margin to be lodged. ETOs also do not require a margin to be lodged if purchasing but they do require a margin if selling. FuturesFutures are highly leveraged products that give users the ability to hedge or speculate on price movements of an underlying product. The primary difference between options and futures is that an options contract contains the right to buy or sell the underlying asset; equity futures on the other hand are traditionally cash settled at expiry. Futures are a delta one product whereas options have a delta range of between minus one and one. Margins are required to be lodged against futures positions for both the long and short holder of the contract and this can change daily. For options only the seller is required to post a margin. Both futures and options are listed on exchanges and the market users set the prices. However in Australia retail access to trade futures is limited to available brokers as compared to traders’ access to options.CFDsA CFD is a varied futures style product that gives the holder delta one exposure to the underlying asset. The contract normally settles a cash amount between the buyer and seller daily based on the change to the value of the underlying asset over the day. This is separate from a daily change in margin. CFDs are traditionally highly leveraged and require margins to be posted. CFDs are traditionally traded on an OTC market where the market price is ultimately determined by the CFD provider. This can on occasion lead to variations in price from the true underlying market price. The cost for trading CFDs is normally less than for options and futures listed on a traditional exchange. A trader should be mindful though that CFDs are not suitable for a buy-and-hold strategy due to the daily interest changes being applied to the trader’s account based on the notional exposure. It is also important to note that the risks associated with CFDs are higher due to the less stringent regulatory framework in which CFD product providers operate.Considering the above options provide traders with greater flexibility than competing products. Options not only allow traders the ability to trade underlying movement (delta) but also volatility (vega). What this equates to is a marketplace where the buyer and seller can both benefit from a trade. In addition the strategies discussed earlier in the note can only be achieved using different combinations of options and this ultimately enables traders to achieve a better risk–return profile and a closer match to their goals for investment. EVALUATIONBefore implementing any strategy traders must determine what they think the market is going to do over a given period of time. Once the prediction is established traders can implement a corresponding strategy based on the market outlook for the respective equity (or index) to exploit the expected condition. Understanding how the respective market index is calculated and making use of the tools outlined above greatly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. In Australia the companies listed on S&P/ASX 200 are ranked based on market capitalization. The top 20 listed companies will affect the movement of the S&P/ASX 200 index more than the other companies. As previously noted the A-VIX is inversely correlated to the S&P/ASX 200. The A-VIX exhibits mean reversion (i.e. oscillates around a long-term average); hence a trader can try to predict where the market is heading and further anticipate the general direction of the top 20 equities that will cause the most likely trend. When implementing investment strategies traders must choose the strike price spread size and maturity month for the options. Strike prices are set according to the desired outcome; their intrinsic value is a key determinant in the premium paid. On a spread trade (where several calls and puts are employed) the respective option strike price creates the boundaries in which a trader expects the underlying asset to remain (or exceed). The majority of options are traded in the short term with outlooks of a month or two primarily because there is more certainty over the short term about an anticipated underlying trend. There are numerous online calculators that check the risk and potential profitability of an option’s position. The calculators make use of a simple Monte Carlo simulator that allows the trader to enter the current underlying asset market price the target price days remaining to expiry and the annual volatility percentage (from the respective volatility index). The results provide traders with information about the probability of the underlying asset being above or below the target price.Prior to implementing any strategy traders need to outline and understand the associated costs risks potential profit potential losses and potential impact of time decay on the strategy. The long call long put bull call spread bear put spread long straddle and long strangle are low-cost strategies that require no margin are easy to implement and provide the desired leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. The short call short put short strangle long butterfly and short straddle all require margin accounts because the risk involved with these strategies is higher. CONCLUSIONOptions trading strategies can result in great returns and can achieve a much better tailored risk profile than alternative products. An entry-level trader can use strategies that do not include margins are low cost and are relatively easy to implement. In order to be successful and achieve the best outcome traders must do the required pre-investment analysis and understand the factors that affect the value of the options.EXHIBIT 1: INDEX PRICES FOR S&P/ASX 200 VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 2: INDEX PRICES FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: INDEX PRICES FOR THE S&P/ASX 200 INDEX VERSUS A-VIXSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 4: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING CALL OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 5: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING PUT OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.

The trading halt had been called the day before so that CapitaLand could announce its voluntary conditional cash offer of SG$2.22 for each share of CMA through its wholly owned subsidiary Sound Investment Holdings Pte Ltd. The intention was to delist CMA and integrate it into the CapitaLand Group. The offer was conditional on CapitaLand garnering more than 90 per cent of CMA.At the time of the offer CapitaLand already owned 65.3 per cent of CMA. The cash offer of $3.06 billion for the remaining shares was 27 per cent above CMA’s one-month volume-weighted average price. The per-share price in the offer was also 20.7 per cent higher than CMA’s net asset value per share as at December 31 2013 and represented a premium of 22.3 per cent over the closing price of $1.815 on April 11 2014. The offer price would be reduced for any CMA dividends distributed on or after the announcement date including a proposed final CMA dividend of $0.0175 per share for the financial year ending in 2013. If acceptance levels crossed the 96.5 per cent threshold CapitaLand would be able to compel acquisition of all of CMA’s shares. As an investor in CMA you were congratulating yourself on the unexpected windfall. However the news also made you wonder about the intrinsic value of CMA. When trading resumed on April 15 you noted that CapitaLand’s share price had also risen. Thus not only was there a premium for the target shareholders there was also value created for the acquiring shareholders. In fact you could calculate the estimated synergy arising from the acquisition from the premium and the net present value of the acquisition. CapitalandCapitaLand had its headquarters in Singapore and was listed on the Singapore Exchange Limited. Its businesses in real estate and real estate fund management were focused in Singapore and China. As of December 31 2013 the company had assets of $14.91 billion (45 per cent of the group’s assets) in China the company’s largest market and assets worth $12.52 billion (38 per cent of the group’s assets) in Singapore which was the company’s second-largest market. Following a strategic review in 2013 CapitaLand had been reorganized into four business units: CapitaLand Singapore CapitaLand China CMA and the Ascott Limited (Ascott). CapitaLand Singapore and CapitaLand China developed residential office and integrated or mixed-use properties. Despite challenging market conditions CapitaLand Singapore had almost doubled the number of private residential units it sold in 2012 by “right-sizing” the units. CapitaLand China had refined its strategy to focus on mass market and first-time buyers and upgraders and had become the largest foreign real estate developer in China.CMA was in the business of shopping malls and Ascott in serviced residences. CMA had achieved high shopper traffic and net property income and in 2013 it announced a partnership to jointly develop the Jewel project at Changi Airport. Ascott which operated more than 33000 apartment units across 82 cities in more than 20 countries had achieved modest revenue growth in 2013. CapitaMalls Asia Limited (CMA)CMA founded in 2004 went public in November 2009 at an initial offering price of $2.12 per share and raised $2.8 billion. After this initial public offering CapitaLand’s shareholding interest in CMA was reduced from 100 per cent to 65.5 per cent. When it was listed CMA was one of the largest pure-play shopping mall owners developers and managers in Asia. Its shares closed at $2.30 on the first day of trading.CMA used an integrated shopping mall business model with interconnected buildings where shoppers could live work and play. Its primary business objective was to be a leading owner developer and manager of shopping malls in Asia. As of December 2013 CMA had a pan-Asian portfolio of 105 shopping malls valued at $34.3 billion. It had $1 billion in cash and a debt-to-asset ratio of 25 per cent (see Exhibit 1). motivation to delist cmaCapitaLand had several reasons for delisting CMA. First because CMA’s integrated developments tended to enjoy high foot traffic from a captive base of offices and residences the developments were expected to enhance CapitaLand’s competitive strengths. Second delisting CMA would simplify CapitaLand’s organizational structure. Third the delisting would give CapitaLand more flexibility in allocating its capital and expanding its scale. Fourth it would unlock shareholder value and achieve synergies. CapitaLand claimed that the acquisition of CMA would immediately raise earnings per share by approximately 21.5 per cent and improve return on equity from 5.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent. However it was not clear whether increasing earnings per share was a good reason for the acquisition. President of CapitaLand Lim Ming Yan said “The market has changed. Earlier companies were pure-play residential; now companies are emerging that are doing mixed developments which include homes offices and malls. This move will help us compete better.”According to an analyst at Barclays Plc “CapitaLand’s offer to take CapitaMalls private is a win-win for both CapitaMalls and CapitaLand. Regaining full control of CapitaMalls should allow CapitaLand more flexibility including the ability to streamline its organizational structure.”However according to Samsung Asset Management Co. Ltd. (Samsung Assets) the transaction showed that CapitaLand could not put the money to better use at a time when the property markets in Singapore and China were starting to weaken. In a similar vein an investment manager at Samsung Assets in Hong Kong commented The company is effectively undertaking financial engineering to enhance returns. The problem is these returns are still unsatisfactory relative to the cost of equity and suggests a lack of investment opportunities in an adverse environment of declining property prices in Singapore and slowing growth opportunities in China.financial performance and valuation To calculate the value of your investment in CMA you could conduct valuations of CMA’s shares using the discounted cash flow (DCF) discounted dividend model (DDM) relative valuation (RV) and precedent transaction methods. DCF valuation is based on the principle that the value of a business is determined by its ability to generate cash flows. The relationship between the business’s revenue and cost drivers can be gleaned from the company’s historical financial statements (see Exhibits 1–4 or refer to the student Excel worksheets “CMA Financial Statements” and “CapitaLand Financial Statements” [Ivey Publishing product number 7B19N012]). These can be used to project a company’s cash flows for the initial few years after which a terminal growth rate can be applied in perpetuity (see Exhibit 5 or refer to the Excel worksheet “Information about CapitaLand”). All projected cash flows will be discounted by the weighted average cost of capital. DCF models provide insights into the drivers of share value but small changes in inputs can result in large changes in intrinsic value. The DDM method assumes that a stock is worth the sum of its discounted future dividend payments. The discount rate used is the cost of equity capital. For stocks with a solid history of dividend growth it is reasonable to assume that the historical growth rate will continue for some years after which a terminal growth rate will be applied (see Exhibits 5 and 6). The DDM is a simple and convenient way of valuing stocks but it can be sensitive to the assumed growth rates.The RV method compares the value of a business to those of its competitors using common multiples or benchmarks such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-book (P/B) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. It is a widely used peer multiple but because the denominator is earnings investors have to be careful when comparing peers from countries that are subject to different accounting regulations. In addition P/E cannot be applied if earnings are negative. The P/B ratio compares a stock’s market value to its book value. The ratio is calculated by dividing the price of the stock by the book equity per share. It gives some idea of whether investors are paying a reasonable price for the equity that will be left if the company were to go bankrupt immediately. For example a P/B ratio of less than one indicates that investors can theoretically buy up all the shares of the company liquidate the assets pay off the company’s liabilities and still have money left. The P/S ratio compares how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales. Because sales is a top-line figure and is therefore less affected by accounting policies this is a useful multiple for businesses that have yet to generate positive earnings and it is useful for comparing businesses that are subject to different accounting regimes.Regardless of which multiple is used it is important to develop accurate benchmarks and it is crucial to compare only businesses from the same industry and with similar market capitalization. Thus although information had been gathered on a number of CMA’s potential peers (see Exhibits 7 and 8 or student Excel worksheets “Peer Financial Ratio” and “Other Key Peer Financial Data”) further deliberation would be required to identify a suitable comparison group. In addition to relative valuation precedent transactions could also provide some useful information. Precedent transaction analysis uses the prices paid for similar companies to estimate the worth of a target company. Under normal market conditions transaction comparables provide higher multiple ranges than peer comparables because acquirers normally pay control premiums and strategic buyers often have the opportunity to realize synergies. To assess the value of CMA information on 12 precedent transactions had been retrieved for consideration (see Exhibit 9 or student Excel worksheet “Precedent Transactions”). PREMIUM NET PRESENT VALUE and SYNERGY By the close of trading on April 15 2014 CapitaLand’s shares had increased 6.5 per cent to $3.11. CMA’s shares had surged 21 per cent from the closing price of $1.815 on April 11 2014 to $2.19 (see Exhibit 10)—the company’s biggest gain since going public in 2009. Based on the market response it appeared that the shareholders of CMA and CapitaLand clearly approved of the transaction. In fact the net present value of the acquirer could be estimated directly from the response of CapitaLand’s share price on April 15th. This together with the premium for the target would provide an estimation of the synergy created.Exhibit 1: capitamall asia’s BALANCE SHEETS (IN SG$ THOUSANDs)Source: Created by the case authors based on information obtained from CapitaMalls Asia Limited Clarity Sustainable Growth: Annual Report 2013 accessed January 27 2017 http://infopub.sgx.com/FileOpen/CMA%20AR(Final)_2013.ashx?App=Prospectus&FileID=20423;

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-03-02It was the first Monday of April 2020. Steve Loftus was driving the 11-kilometre commute from his home in Springwater to his office in Barrie Ontario. Traffic was light and Loftus was reflecting on the way he had been coping with COVID-19 during the previous two weeks. He was also examining his options going forward for dealing with a situation that was unprecedented in terms of its fluidity and uncertainty.As founder and president of Innovative Automation Inc. (Innovative) a custom machine builder Loftus was facing a singular dilemma: How should he ensure that the internal channels of communication at Innovative remained open as its employeeslike everyone else in the rest of the province and indeed the rest of the worlddealt with an unknown virus? He was also facing a related predicament: How should Innovative enforce social distancing which had been mandated by the provincial government in its bid to contain the spread of the virus at its manufacturing facility in Barrie?COVID-19In December 2019 a cluster of cases of an acute respiratory illness known at the time as Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) had surfaced among residents of Wuhan in the province of Hubei in central China. Evidence suggested that the virus had spread to humans via transmission from wild animals being illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the City of Wuhan. In mid-February 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) named the illness “coronavirus disease” (COVID-19). On March 11 WHO declared COVID-19which had by then spread to more than 200 countries and whose cases numbered more than 5.9 million worldwidea pandemic due to its global nature. A survey of the first 425 cases in Wuhan found that the median age of the patients was 59 years 56 per cent of the patients were male the elderly and those with coexisting conditions showed higher rates of mortality and there were no cases in children less than 15 years of age. On March 17 the Government of Ontario announced that it was declaring a state of emergency in the province under section 7.0.1 (1) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and was using “every power possible to continue to protect the health and safety of all individuals and families.” The order banned public events of more than 50 people. In a related order on April 3 the provincial government designated 44 businesses as “essential businesses” that would be allowed to stay open. Manufacturing was one of these. Innovative could thus keep its facilities open.INNOVATIVE AUTOMATION BACKGROUND Innovative was founded in 1989 by Loftus and two others. The company manufactured machinery that was tailored to the specific needs of firms in the automotive sector. Having built up skills over the years in designing building and installing customized machineryranging from a CA$50000 retrofit to a $5-million high-tech automation systemthe company had expanded its services to move from the development of vehicle sensing systems to the application of energy efficient systems. It had also moved beyond the auto industry toward other end markets such as medical device manufacturing.The company had grown by building lasting relationships with customers and being flexible in responding to customers’ needs as well as on its singular value proposition of focusing on the total cost of ownership for each customer as opposed to the purchase price. A lower cost over the lifetime of the machine improved uptime and reduced repair expenses together compensated for the slightly larger initial investment for a customer. The custom machinery that Innovative built was hand-made and artisanal.Innovative’s customers were primarily within the North American Free Trade Agreement regionCanada the United States and Mexico. The company’s principal geographic market was Mexico which on the strength of the high standards and competitiveness of its labour force had become the world’s fourth-largest producer of luxury vehicles. In 2017 Innovative worked with the Business Development Bank of Canada to create an international business development plan centred on expansion to Europe and consolidation in Mexico.In February 2018 Innovative relocated to a new 63000-square-foot (6000-square-metre) state-of-the-art facility in Barrie. By then Barrie had become one of the fastest-growing business and manufacturing hubs in Ontario. With its residents’ median age at 37 the city was a hot spot for young educated entrepreneurs who enjoyed its big-city convenience picturesque landscape recreational activities focus on family and above all short commute times. With provisions nearby for hiking and camping during weekends the lifestyle offered by Barrie was a mix of city and country which many of its residents preferred.Innovative had a total of 129 full-time employees in 2019 up from 106 in 2017. The core operations team comprised three categoriesmechanical teams which were developing and assembling automation systems from the first bolt forward; electrical teams which were building wire systems; and programmer teams which were building control systems. In addition to full-time employees the company had between 1025 engineering or business students on a regular basis as apprentices. Over 40 per cent of the company’s staff was under the age of 30.Innovative had established an ongoing a partnership with a local college in BarrieGeorgian Collegefor hiring and training its students. The partnership gave the company first pick of talented graduates from the school’s engineering program and in turn provided students with valuable industry experience through co-operative (co-op) work placements. Rather than hire experienced people from competitor firms or make lateral recruitments Innovative believed in home-grown employees: choosing them directly from college supporting them through co-op programs and giving them hands-on training. Of late the company had also started hiring at the high-school level and financing these students’ education through the college. This was Innovative’s way of building an educated and motivated cadre of employees. In February 2016 Innovative undertook an employee satisfaction survey to get a sense of what working at Innovative meant for each of its employees. The survey results were used by the company’s senior management to develop a vision statement: “Be the first choice provider of automation solutions to global leaders in manufacturing.” It was followed by a mission statement declaring that Innovators “Lead globally: providing our customers with quality automation solutions”; “Lead the industry: providing our employees with a safe challenging and rewarding work experience”; and “Lead locally: enabling our team to enrich our community.” A similar employee satisfaction survey conducted a year later reinforced employees’ commitment to both the vision and mission statements.The management group at Innovative tracked various performance metrics in a bid to get a sense of the organization. These included sales forecasting shop loading project profitability cost overruns process changes in a project and employee scheduling. Floor space scheduling was an important metric as it was unique to the company’s business of custom manufacturing. Once a machine built on the company’s premises was shipped out after 1215 weeks the large floor space would be idle and it was important to ensure that it was quickly filled with a new custom sales order. This was unlike the typical assembly line operations of most standard manufacturing facilities.As part of an effort to diversify beyond custom manufacturing in 2019 the company developed a product called RoboTape. It was the company’s first attempt at making products for off-the-shelf sale. Standard products would have lower margins but they also involved far less engineering. RoboTape was scheduled for launch in March 2020 at a tradeshow in Detroit but this was delayed due to COVID-19. RoboTape automated tape application which was a predominantly manual process and could be strenuous and inconsistent. The product also made tape application speedier by enabling the tapewhether foam double-sided or feltto be fed robotically. The product consisted of two main components: a bulk spool feeding system known as a “payout” and a tape apply head. Innovative’s long-term plan post-launch was to set up an assembly line for the manufacture of RoboTape for which Innovative owned the intellectual property and had applied for a patent. The plan was also to set up RoboTape’s manufacture as an independent business and monetize it through spin-off or outright sale. Innovative was also developing a new platform to launch a slew of standard products from its premises.The company had sales revenue of $53 million in 2019 (see Exhibit 1) when its export sales exceeded domestic revenues for the first time in a number of years. The company was aiming for revenue of $80 million with about 200 employees at its current location before setting up a new set of operations focused likely on standard products at new premises. The transformation would require financial engineering and marketing resources. While the company could mobilize the first two easily it would have to sharpen its marketing skills as marketing had been limited for a long time to high-value custom sales. SARS PROTOCOLS Innovative had put protocols in place in early 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was affecting Canada. Like COVID-19 SARS involved an unknown virusthere was no prior knowledge of how it was being transmitted how long patients would be infected or how best to treat it. But SARS was only moderately contagious and did not turn into a full-blown pandemic. Surfacing in China in November 2002 SARS had spread across the globe within weeks. About 8500 persons worldwide were diagnosed with probable SARS leading to over 900 deaths. The Canadian outbreak in February 2003 was largely centred in Toronto; all three deaths in Canada due to SARS had also occurred in Toronto. There were two types of protocols Innovative developed at the time: (1) communication protocols (which set in motion bulletin boards and emails as the principal sources of employee communications) and (2) cleaning protocols (which prioritized several processes pertaining to workplace hygiene). As part of the latter the company had not only identified “common touch surfaces” requiring cleaning but had also made it mandatory for these surfaces to be cleaned three times every day. The surfaces included all tables and chairs; all countertops; all hand railings; all door handles; all phones; and all company vehicles including the steering wheel gear shifter radio dashboard doors and door handles.The protocols were updated in 2009 during H1N1 a novel influenza A virus that had been first detected in Mexico in mid-April that year spread quickly to the United States and was first identified in Canada in late April. There were several thousand cases of H1N1 in Ontario with 120 fatalities. H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on June 11 2009.FIRST RESPONSES TO COVID-19During the last week of February 2020—three weeks before the provincial and federal governments in Canada issued emergency orders—Innovative took a fresh look at its long-standing SARS playbook. The company had been executing its protocols rigorously on a daily basis. The cleaning of all common touch surfaces three times a day had also continued. A quick decision was made to keep all common doors open to ensure walk throughs and to pre-empt people from touching doorknobs or handling doors. Innovative also decided to launch a special COVID bulletin board to be managed by a senior executive. The company’s manufacturing manager took personal responsibility for the daily bulletin which was to relay facts and updates on COVID-19 as sourced from credible authorities including Health Canada; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a US federal agency; and WHO.The company also proposed to employees early on that anyone who did not want to work could take voluntary layoff. Four people took advantage of the offer based on age and pre-existing conditions as well as on anxiety over the situation in general. The last reason seemed common; several employees were frightened by the situation as it was unfolding and wanted to shelter at home. But they also wanted their paycheques.The management team decided to meet regularly at 3:30 every afternoon to deal with issues of common concern regarding COVID-19. The team set up a group of five employees to brainstorm about the health risks the company would need to plan for and to recommend proactive measures that management could take. These employees were to serve as the resource base on COVID-19 and were the designated “go-to” group for validation of a point of view. The company had invoked travel restrictions by early March. No employee would travel outside Canada without permission and those already out of the country either for work or for vacation would be allowed re-entry onto the company premises only if certified by their family doctor. The company created a sign-in sheet for all outstation employees; they had to review and confirm that they understood their share of the responsibility in ensuring the health and safety of company employees already in the building. Innovative also restricted the number of visitors to its premises. No salespeople would be allowed into the building unless the visit involved something critical. The result of these restrictions was that Innovative had only four visitors in the first two weeks of March. The exceptions were drivers from courier and transportation firms who were required to interact with employees in the company’s shipping and receiving department. Wearing personal protection equipment such as gloves and face masks during all working hours became compulsory for those employees. The company began preparing a list of employees who were not required to be physically present at their workstations and in late March it notified each of them that they could work from home. The notification had been preceded by groundwork undertaken by the company’s information technology (IT) department which had to ensure that the transition would be seamless. By early April Innovative had over 50 per cent of its employees working from their homes.The arrangement still left the other half of the workforce numbering a little over 60 stationed in the building every day. Many of these employees were in manufacturing and were required to work with their hands. One of the early decisions that Innovative had made was to stagger lunch breaks into three separate streams so that no more than 20 people at a time came into the lunchroom which normally held 160 people. People found the sight amusingthe lunchroom spread out tables rearranged 10 or 12 feet apart and only one person at a tableuntil it was no longer funny.The half-hour management meeting soon moved online. This meeting was meant to give every manager and team leader a sense of what was happening the progress being made that day and any issues that needed to be addressed. In the early days the meetings sometimes stretched for an hour. But within weeks of half the workforce working from home they were finishing 510 minutes ahead of schedule. There were fewer actionable items on the agenda. The meetings came to be more about communicating and staying in touch rather than making decisions.STABILIZING RESPONSESOne of the early problems that surfaced as employees started working from home was that Internet connectivity and Internet speed in the area around Barrie were not as fast as in a metropolitan area such as Toronto and its suburbs or even in Barrie itself. Many employees lived in the surrounding rural areas which had poor Internet service. While Innovative as a company could not do much about the situation it had to come up with options other than email as a reliable form of communication with employees. Alerts Delays in email communications were also caused by the fact that not everybody was on the company’s email roll call all the time and less so when they were outside of their workspaces. Innovative created a mobile application (app) that would generate an alert system akin to the amber alert system. The app was based on satellite communications and was linked to each employee’s smart phone. The company sought permission from all employees to have their cell phone numbers. An alert provided the most up-to-date information in near real-time. BiasesThe COVID-19 crisis had hit home at Innovative when the best friend of an employee’s uncle died due to the virus in its early days in Canada. The employee was shaken. A colleague working in the same room with this employee believed that COVID-19 was stage-managed and part of a conspiracy. She was becoming vocal in sharing her belief with others in the office. It was necessary for management to intervene and clarify that while individuals had a right to their personal beliefs they would have to be careful in articulating these with others however close the individual may have been with other employees. The task was delicate because management had also been noticing some biases suddenly arising at Innovative. People were taking positions both implicit and explicit. An employee biased against China for example was uncomfortable with media narratives that highlighted the Chinese origins of the virus. An employee biased against the United States for whatever reason would well believe social media accounts suggesting that the virus was developed by the United States and planted in Wuhan China. Misinformation What was being referred to as an “Infodemic” in medical journals by then had also hit home at Innovative. It was a term used as early as February 15 by Dr. Tedros Adhanom director general at WHO when he said “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.”Clearly there was a great deal of COVID-19-related misinformation in social media content. It was also clear to the management at Innovative that if employees were not receiving regular updates they would fill the information vacuum with whatever they had picked up elsewhere whether it was accurate or not. The company’s bulletin board which displayed authoritative information from credible sources was part of the arsenal to fight misinformation. But Innovative had to step up. A study entitled “Trust and the Coronavirus” conducted in 2020 between March 6 and March 10 by Edelman a US public relations and marketing consultancy firm headquartered in New York had shown that businesses had to be sources of reliable and timely information on the coronavirus for their employees. Based on responses from 10000 participants across 10 countries (Brazil Canada France Germany Italy Japan South Africa South Korea the United Kingdom and the United States) the survey found that 63 per cent of employees trusted their employer more than they trusted the government or news sources for information about COVID-19; 74 per cent worried that there was a great deal of fake news and false information being spread about the virus; 45 per cent said it was difficult for them to find reliable and trustworthy information about the virus and its effects; and 85 per cent said they needed to hear more from scientists and less from politicians.  However steering employees away from misinformation coming at them from several sources—including some mainstream media outlets that largely delivered what Loftus believed to be “opinion-based information”—was not easy.OPPORTUNITIES IN A CRISISOne of the ways of blunting the edge of misinformation was to promote positive feelings amid the vast negative imagery prevalent around COVID-19. An engineer at Innovative’s plant knew someone who was involved with delivering materials to first responders and paramedics. This person told the engineer there was a shortage of face shields at the local hospital and suggested it would be great if Innovative could dedicate a line at its plant to making face shields for the hospital. This was on a Thursday afternoon. The engineer got approval from the company and by Friday had put together a supply chain. He and two colleagues stayed overnight to design the workflow. They ordered the raw materials on Saturday received the raw materials the following Tuesday afternoon and had the prototype ready that night for quality inspection at the local Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre. The hospital released a purchase order on Thursday. Innovative produced 100000 shields over the next two weeks. The goal from then on was to produce 80000 shields per week. A team of 12 was formed to work full-time on the dedicated line. Manufacturing face shields presented an opportunity for the family members of company employees to get involved and many family members volunteered to join the team of 12 and work on the assembly line full-time. It was important from a safety standpoint that these volunteers were either adult children siblings or spouses of people already coming into the production facility and staying together as a family so that they would not pose a risk to other people in the plant.Children of employees were invited to create works of art displaying their appreciation for the commitment and dedication of frontline workers who were already being seen as heroes. Each face shield was accompanied by a unique piece of art done by a child of an Innovative employee (see Exhibit 2).Ecosystem COVID-19 was also an occasion to look outward at the ecosystem of which Innovative was part. Although the current contracts were stretched in terms of deadlines the plant was running at capacity. The machine shop was in fact running at 110 per cent capacity with 44.2 hours per employee per week leading to an overtime situation. A suggestion was put forward at the management meeting for Innovative to subcontract those overtime hours to one of the company’s small vendors struggling with a lack of orders. The suggestion was readily accepted. It would not only help the vendor stay in business during COVID-19 but also ensure that Innovative’s supply chain would emerge intact once normalcy was restored. It also allowed employees to look beyond themselves for opportunities to help others in need. Further it offered a new sense of the workspace one that everyone would take responsibility for guarding conveying the idea that a person’s workspace was more than their own; it encompassed the idea of everyone working together.  The approach gained ground when Innovative supported a sandwich shop across the street by placing about 60 lunch orders on two different days each month. The owner of the sandwich shop had been forced to close because of official mandates but could at least pay her rent with the earnings from Innovative’s lunch orders and thus stay afloat. It was possible that the shop would be able to reopen when Innovative resumed its normal operations sooner or later and when the ecosystem it was part of returned to its original form. The success with the face shields production fuelled the company’s initiatives in manufacturing standard products which had been put on hold. There were fresh orders for face shields from four hospitals in the province. It seemed easy for Innovative as a machine builder to set up a line to build one-off products. There had already been calls from both the federal and provincial government for businesses in the private sector to become involved in fighting COVID-19. For example on March 31 the federal government committed $2 billion to finance businesses that were retooling their factories to produce urgently needed diagnostic testing kits ventilators and personal protective gear. On April 2 the Government of Ontario pledged $50 million for businesses to retool their manufacturing operations for COVID-19 equipment as part of the Ontario Together Fund. Businesses were asked to submit their proposals for review by the provincial government. Simultaneously Next Generation Manufacturing Canada an industry-focused not-for-profit organization dedicated to positioning Canada as a world leader in advanced manufacturing capabilities pledged an investment of $50 million in what it called Supercluster funding to support companies in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic by building a Canadian supply of essential equipment products and therapeutics.Ventilators were in short supply worldwide. A ventilator pumped oxygen into the lungs of a patient who was having trouble breathing. It did not cure COVID-19 but it helped the patient survive until the lungs resumed functioning on their own. Innovative started working on a prototype for a ventilator. In contrast to a face shield a ventilator was a Class II medical device under the regulations of Health Canada meaning that Health Canada’s approval of the device’s manufacture and marketing was more stringent. Innovative was planning a basic ventilator that could work in emergency rooms where demand was high.CHALLENGESLoftus had to ensure that the essential work of tracking ongoing projects and running the organization was combined with the equally essential task of preventing the spread of COVID-19. But he had to balance those two priorities. Managing Employee Communications Loftus had recognized the importance of communication as new protocols were being stabilized. There had been a gap in communication for a day or two early on due to issues with email connectivity. As it turned out the gap was serious. Loftus sensed that this gap in communication had elevated stress levels for employees who were feeling isolated and looking for signals of stability and leadership. A corrective tool had been quickly installed in the form of an alert as described earlier. This had addressed the situation.A more important area of concern was the polarization being created by misinformation. This was elevating stress levels in the organization in its own way. Establishing a single source of truth at Innovative would serve as a bulwark against misinformation. The bulletin board and the alert were both helpful and effective but were they adequate? There was no way that Innovative could ask employees to switch off news channels at home and rely only on Health Canada’s online bulletins for information.Loftus faced three specific dilemmas around managing internal communications:Over-communicate or over-edit? This dilemma was typical of all leaders even in ordinary times; it took on a unique dimension in the extraordinary times that COVID-19 represented. Leaders had to determine the extent to which they could be open and honest versus the extent they needed to be guarded and follow a script.  Is the chain of command working? It helped in this dilemma that Loftus’ personal operating style—informal friendly and laid back—was in alignment with the demands of the time. However the same could not be said of team managers at the lower rungs of leadership with whom shop-floor employees were in regular contact and it was well known that employees relied on their immediate supervisors in making sense of the personal implications of any major change.Stay calm or display confidence? There was no rule book for this situation. In the face of a difficult situation if a leader displayed excessive confidence or appeared overly calm amidst difficult conditions he or she could lose credibility.Manage social distancing in manufacturing operations. Custom building a machine was a simultaneous rather than sequential process. Tradespeople from multiple disciplines worked at the same time on a machine: machinists did the fabrication welders joined metal parts electricians did the wiring and lighting plumbers fixed the pipes and so on. Those operations at Innovative now had to be turned sequential. A linear progression would lead to staggered hours and slow down the goal. The contracts would have to be stretched carrying the potential risk of loss of orders.  An important task from a health and safety point of view was to ensure that whoever was working on the machine wore personal protective equipment and maintained the stipulated physical distance of two metres from another person. (Typically employees often stood between one and two metres apart.) Loftus thought of a lighter way of enforcing the discipline: One of the founding partners of the company was short but had long hair. He was asked to stand with his hair straight up which extended the length of him to two metres and was photographed in that posture. The photograph was displayed on the shop floor as a gentle reminder of the two-metre distance that everyone had to maintain. Loftus himself walked around the plant with a fibreglass light-reflector sticknormally placed at his driveway in winter to show snowplough drivers the edge of the drivewaythat was two metres long. Everybody chuckled on seeing Loftus wave at them with the stick but were also reminded of the distance they had to maintain for safety. In addition workplace entrances and exits were limited to unidirectional flow. Common walking paths if less than two metres in width were signed as one-way passages. Washrooms had “occupied” and “vacant” signs. However even with these measures committing people in a manufacturing environment to social distancing would remain an area of concern until self-regulation became the new normal.EXHIBIT 1: INNOVATIVE AUTOMATIONREVENUE STATEMENTSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: ARTWORK BY AN INNOVATIVE AUTOMATION EMPLOYEE’S CHILDNote: Each face shield given to health workers was accompanied by a work of art created by employees’ children.Source: Company documents.,29,"[{""start"":1081,""end"":1093,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1177,""end"":1191,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1215,""end"":1221,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1546,""end"":1552,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":3633,""end"":3639,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":20636,""end"":20642,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26171,""end"":26178,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26434,""end"":26440,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":26669,""end"":26675,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27459,""end"":27465,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":27920,""end"":27926,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29421,""end"":29427,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":29813,""end"":29819,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":30039,""end"":30045,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2023,""end"":2029,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5318,""end"":5324,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5334,""end"":5340,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5738,""end"":5744,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6426,""end"":6432,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16733,""end"":16739,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16826,""end"":16832,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3020,""end"":3027,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5414,""end"":5421,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12048,""end"":12055,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":24906,""end"":24913,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":25028,""end"":25035,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1312,""end"":1314,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1595,""end"":1597,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1801,""end"":1803,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":29632,""end"":29635,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1136,""end"":1139,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1163,""end"":1166,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1334,""end"":1337,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Goldbeck was a bicycle program specialist working in the Planning and Sustainability Division at the Washington DC District Department of Transportation (DDOT). Goldbeck had noticed that bike-sharing programs were frequently in the news. On April 9 2018 Uber Technologies Inc. announced its acquisition of Jump a dockless and electric bike-sharing operator that began offering services in 10 cities across the United States after piloting a scheme of dockless electric bicycles in hilly San Francisco. Three months later Lyft Inc. acquired bike-sharing company Motivate which was responsible for operating a number of popular bike-sharing systems such as Citi Bike in New York City and Ford GoBike in San Francisco.In the current era every city strove for an eco-friendly and sustainable system for sharing vehicles. The ever-growing industry of ride-sharing companies saw bike sharing as a natural extension of their easy urban mobility approach toward developing a smart city.Capital Bikeshare a regional bike-sharing program in Washington that was owned by the DDOT and operated by Motivate was also capitalizing on the trend of bike sharing and its avid riders were enjoying the benefits of renting and returning a bike at any of the program’s 8635 docks. Every minute the system generated a large volume of trip data that was available for analysis. Goldbeck and his team had heard the following questions since launching in 2010: Who were the riders that used Capital Bikeshare? When did they ride? What days of the week were most rides taken on? What factors affected riding behaviours? With the emergence of smart analytics what useful ridership insights could Goldbeck extract from Capital Bikeshare’s datasets? How could this information best help Goldbeck to prepare a future expansion plan?CAPITAL BIKESHARE PROGRAMCapital Bikeshare was a station-based bike-sharing operator that provided an expansive multi-jurisdictional transportation system to (a) Washington DC; (b) the neighbouring counties of Arlington Virginia; Prince George Maryland; Fairfax Virginia; and Montgomery Maryland; and (c) the city of Alexandria Virginia. It was the first public–private partnership bike-sharing system in the United States and had been the largest until May 2013 when New York’s Citi Bike launched. The Capital Bikeshare system was owned by the participating jurisdictions and was currently operated by Motivate a New York-based company that operated several other bike-sharing systems in different cities.To achieve its mission “to transform our community by providing a high quality convenient and affordable bicycle transit system that will connect people to more places where they live work and play in the region” Capital Bikeshare offered five distinct membership options tailoring to both registered and casual riders. People could join for a single trip a day three days a month or a year. All memberships had an initial fixed rate plus the extra amount that was paid depending on the time of use—though the first 30 minutes of each trip was free. Single-trip 24-hour and three-day membership customers received a five-digit key that they could insert into any bike dock with an available bike at any station. Monthly or annual membership customers received a card that they could use to rent bikes. By 2018 Capital Bikeshare had more than 4300 bicycles at a total of 500 stations and had provided more than 20 million fun and affordable rides to metropolitan DC dwellers.Bike-Sharing BOOMSOverviewA bike-sharing system was “a self-service short-term one-way-capable bike rental” offered “in public spaces for several target groups with network characteristics.” By integrating information and communication technology into everyday life bike-sharing programs had received increasing attention in recent years as a popular and strong green-minded alternative to automotive-centric transport services. The benefits of a bike-sharing program often centred on the goals of promoting cycling reducing congestion improving air quality and offering residents an active mobility option. The bike-sharing system following an asset-light approach and allowing users to share mobility offerings was available in more than 70 countries. By 2017 with nearly 1600 bike-sharing systems in operation worldwide the number of shared bicycles hit an estimated 18.2 million. The overall market reached €6 billion in 2018 and was expected to grow continuously by 20 per cent making the bike-sharing model a fast-growing permanent feature of the urban landscape.Evolution of Bike-Sharing ProgramsOriginally a concept from the revolutionary 1960s bike sharing was slow to grow over the years. However better approaches to bike tracking as well as improved information technologies had given birth to the rapid expansion of bike-sharing programs throughout the globe in recent decades.The past 50 years had seen four generations of bike-sharing systems. The first generation started in the summer of 1965 in Amsterdam with Witte Fietsen (White Bikes). Ordinary bikes painted white were provided free of charge for public use as a political statement of concern for pollution and against the growing number of cars in the city. Even though the program collapsed within days due to heavy bike theft and vandalism the White Bikes were the world’s first demonstration of a bike-sharing program providing increased mobility to Amsterdam dwellers.The second generation led by Copenhagen’s Bycyklen (City Bikes) began to emerge in Europe through public–private partnerships in the late twentieth century. Aside from significant functional improvement in bikes specifically designed for intense utilitarian use the development of software for tracking and managing bicycles laid the foundation for the locking system at specific stations. City Bikes allowed users to pick up and return bicycles at different stations throughout the central city via a coin-deposit system which answered the need to deter theft and incentivized bicycle return.The invention of individualized magnetic stripe cards in 1996 put an end to the bike theft problem. In contrast with the first two generations the third generation used a smart card to produce real-time information and assist in rebalancing the bikes between different stations as part of a complete technology-enhanced operating plan. The bike-sharing system started to adopt smart-card technology in 1998 and when the Vélo'v system in Lyon France opened in 2001 it soon became the prototype for the third generation of the system. Throughout the following 10 years the demand-responsive and multimodal “smart” dock system took hold in multiple locations across the globe with many stations installed at strategic locations to answer riders’ natural demand for “the last mile” problem in their commutes and to grow a top-of-mind green transportation method in dense urban areas.In 2015 a new free-floating bike-sharing model started to become popular in Asia particularly in China. The rapid development of bike-sharing schemes was enabled by the advent of new technologies such as mobile payments the Internet of things and bike locking and tracking systems which allowed dockless bike businesses to thrive.Motivation and Evaluation for Bike-Sharing ProgramsFrom the perspective of the individual bike sharing attracted riders through its convenience and practicality. When leveraging other modes of transportation bike sharing could provide a fundamental shift in the way people moved around and made decisions about transportation. It filled the critical gap between the bus or train station and the final destination and improved public mobility by extending fixed-route transit services thereby increasing accessibility for dwellers and visitors. Bike sharing also offered an active transport choice providing easy access to the physical and mental health benefits of bicycling while helping riders to fulfill their personal mission of embracing an environmentally friendly and green lifestyle.From a municipal perspective bike sharing could improve a city’s image and branding as a green or innovative “smart” city and held the potential to stimulate general investments in local industries through continuous demand for hardware software and the provision of operations. From an investment perspective bike-sharing systems offered many key advantages over other transportation systems with the capital cost in establishing a viable network comparatively lower for bike-sharing systems. Furthermore the relatively short timeline to begin operating the system meant that the benefits to the public were attained quicker than was the case with most transportation projects. In the planning stage there were five key elements to consider when building a cost-effective high-performance bike-sharing system. The stations needed adequate spacing to offer maximal coverage as well as convenient walking distances to riders. It was common to have 10–16 bike stations in every square kilometre with stations spaced 300 metres apart. To ensure reasonable demand for the system typical bike-sharing programs covered areas of at least 10 square kilometres. The number of bikes that were deployed depended largely on the density of the area. Typically 10–30 bikes were allocated for every 1000 residents. Areas with a high influx of commuters received an even higher number of bikes to ensure capacity during peak demand hours. Bikes needed to be durable attractive and practical to limit repair costs and encourage adoption. The bikes were also designed to discourage theft. Finally technology needed to permit easy bike checkout and return processes. The real-time availability of bikes mobile payment and automated locking were essential elements for a desirable bike-sharing system.Bike-sharing operators and cities presented bike-sharing programs as a viable means of transportation rather than as an occasional fun activity. Paul Stratta director of the Platform for European Bicycle Sharing & Systems a European forum for intra-industry collaboration that guided cities in planning and operating bike-sharing programs stated thatfor bike share schemes to be seen as a real public transport solution and a smart answer to urban mobility they need to work as good or better than existing public transport services. People go to bus and railway stations expecting the services to be there and for them to operate on time. It should be the same with bike share schemes.While the bike-sharing idea was gradually advocated by the general public across the globe and with high expectations the need for continuous strategic and operational improvements required special attention to fulfill riders’ dynamic demands and to respond agilely to external variabilities.BIG DATA BEHIND Bike SharingAs bike-sharing models entered into the new era of “smart mobility” which was often considered a city’s virtual sensor network a key trend of bike-sharing culture was the open sharing of data about ridership trends allowing the public to analyze trip patterns and build various predictive algorithms to help maximize utilization of the bike fleet. The data generated by these bike-sharing programs was attractive for studying mobility in a city as customer data duration of travel departure location arrival location time elapsed and other trip features were systematically collected exchanged with partners and used to improve the customer experience. Smart cities and smart companies alike had already seen the additional potential value of bike-sharing systems to provide sanitized and enriched movement data for generating ancillary commercial revenues.Goldbeck knew that Capital Bikeshare also kept a complete history of its ride trips and he was particularly interested to see how data analysis could provide some insights about Capital Bikeshare’s bike-sharing users as well as suggest some improvements in Capital Bikeshare’s operation model. Hourly rental demands on the Capital Bikeshare system were collected for the period between October 1 2016 and September 30 2018 (see Exhibits 1 and 2).THE DEMAND FOR BIKESOver the years Capital Bikeshare experienced a steady rise in bike rentals. The bike-sharing program tried to keep up with growing demand from its enthusiastic fans through expanding its coverage area and adding new station locations. It also wanted to incorporate a strategic evaluation into its current operation system to optimize its top line by raising system efficiency and recruiting more people to join this green transportation alternative. One of the challenging problems that Capital Bikeshare now faced was the difficulty of meeting the fluctuating demand for bike rentals among stations across the whole system. Research into past years’ bike rental data showed that the overall demand increased during warmer months and decreased during colder months. Therefore Goldbeck questioned whether ridership patterns within different seasons for the past two years also followed a similar trend. He was equally curious to find out how seasonality affected Capital Bikeshare’s business and when the best time of the year would be for a promotion strategy to boost demand and encourage the use of Capital Bikeshare’s bikes.On a per-day basis Goldbeck also knew that while the flow of commuters was approximately balanced over the course of a day ridership patterns could be changed by a variety of external factors such as temperature and weather conditions that would cause the flow of bicycles to behave differently. Therefore Goldbeck wondered how these factors affected users’ riding decisions and how different timing would affect the system’s operations.LOOKING AHEADWith radio-frequency identification global positioning system technology and an adequate artificial intelligence system the system’s data would continually become more accurate as more Capital Bikeshare users entered and exited the system. Goldbeck knew that invaluable insights about ridership patterns were embedded in the collected data and he needed answers before he could develop a sound strategic expansion plan.EXHIBIT 1: SELECTION OF Historical Data for CAPITAL BIKESHARE DEMANDSource: Created by the authors using data from “System Data” Capital Bikeshare accessed October 1 2018 https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.EXHIBIT 2: DESCRIPTIONS OF DATANote: °C = degrees Celsius; mph = miles per hour; kPa = kilopascal.Source: Created by the authors.,30,"[{""start"":1064,""end"":1078,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1198,""end"":1211,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1213,""end"":1221,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1374,""end"":1382,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2568,""end"":2576,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2882,""end"":2890,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2971,""end"":2979,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":12878,""end"":12886,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14120,""end"":14128,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14490,""end"":14498,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":14777,""end"":14785,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":15161,""end"":15169,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1314,""end"":1327,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2244,""end"":2254,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3177,""end"":3190,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1093,""end"":1096,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2581,""end"":2584,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

Prior to joining the APY Art Centre Collective O’Meara had worked in various roles in the Indigenous art industry for over a dozen years (see Exhibit 1). She joined the Collective in 2017 and by 2018 was immersed in opening the Collective’s first gallery in Sydney more than 2500 kilometres from the APY communities. Now barely a year later the board (see Exhibit 2) wanted to open another gallery this one in Adelaide in large part because Adelaide was closer to the APY Lands and a large contingent of APY community members lived in or visited Adelaide at any one time.O’Meara shared the board’s excitement about starting a gallery that could also serve as an urban art centre for the APY community residents in Adelaide and she was happy about the prospect of being closer to the APY Lands that she loved and visited monthly. At the same time O’Meara was worried about the expansion. She had doubts about whether the small isolated city of Adelaide could support a gallery: Would there be enough demand and donors? O’Meara was also concerned about whether she and her small staff could manage two galleries thousands of kilometres apart and still keep their ties to the APY Lands. On top of it all O’Meara was developing a digital presence for the APY Gallery Sydney and was worried that opening a new gallery would distract her from building that presence. The board’s vision was certainly compelling but was it practical?APY Lands and ArtAPY stood for Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Aṉangu (pronounced arn-ung-oo) being Indigenous peoples of Australia. The APY Lands were a parcel of land set aside for the traditional landowners from the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples. The Lands were in the north-west corner of South Australia south of Uluru near the centre of the Australian outback. In 2019 approximately 2300 people lived on the APY Lands in approximately seven small communities spread over a vast area (see Exhibit 3). Remarkably each community had its own art centre.In the late 1930s into the 1940s the Australian government supported mission organizations in establishing settlements on the lands. The clans slowly settled into seven communities around the missions although it wasn’t until the 1950s that the last clans settled down. Many of the elders on APY Lands had memories of the pre-contact period. Their parents spent most of their lives with no contact with the “whitefellas” and the elders themselves remembered both the “walking around time” (when clans were nomadic) and the early period of settlement.By 2019 the economic and health conditions on the Lands were dire. Sedentary life combined with poverty had led to significant health problems. Obesity was endemic due to a combination of food insecurity and the prevalence of poor-quality high-calorie food. Alcoholism and violence were pervasive and petrol sniffing was making a comeback despite the legacy of death and brain damage left by the previous wave of petrol sniffing in the late 1980s. Incarceration rates were extremely high in part because of the poverty and substance-related violence and in part due to cultural rifts between the communities and the police. The widespread health problems resulted in many people from the APY Lands travelling to and living in Adelaide to receive medical treatment related to diabetes and associated kidney disease. The need to seek treatment 1400 kilometres from home resulted in isolation from families and communities which only added to the stress and illness.One of the few bright spots in this grim picture was art. Remarkably approximately 500 active artists were on the APY Lands and most were working out of one of the art centres located in the communities. The art centres such as Ernabella Arts grew out of craft rooms set up in the missions; they provided art training mentoring and community (see Exhibits 4 and 5). They also offered emergency financial support often in the form of small jobs that might pay enough to cover a tank of petrol or food for a week. Over time each community developed a distinctive style of art but across the APY Lands art expressed preserved and rejuvenated culture; generated continuity across generations; and provided one of the only sources of income independent of government assistance.APY artists were a force in the Australian art world. For example in 2017 APY artists accounted for 14 of 15 finalists for the AU$50000 Wynne Prize awarded annually for the best landscape painting of Australian scenery or for the best example of figure sculpture by Australian artists; two finalists for the $100000 Archibald Prize awarded annually to the best portrait painted by an Australian resident; and 25 nominations for the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards Australia’s longest running and most prestigious Indigenous art awards.Nationally a handful of recognized APY artists could command $100000 or more for canvases and established galleries in the big cities competed to showcase their art. For the other artists distribution choices were few and risky because unscrupulous dealers travelled to Adelaide and the art centres to purchase canvases for tiny amounts offering “day rates” of $20 or $100 for quick paintings then re-selling the work without attribution royalties or fees throughout urban Australia. Some dealers even set up painting sheds located in and around Alice Springs and paid young artists a few dollars a day to work in the painting sheds and create cheap reproductions of famous works. O’Meara explained:Carpetbaggers do not often come to the Lands; they lure artists into their sheds or sweat shops with a promise of fast income. They often exploit vulnerable disadvantaged families living in extreme conditions and they take advantage of the lack of numeracy and literacy skills and family social challenges.... Fake works are also produced in these sheds with artists being paid to copy works of higher profile artists.APY Art Centre CollectiveIn response to these abuses the APY Art Centre Collective was organized to create new markets support region-wide collaborative art projects and increase the money flowing to the art centres and the artists. The Collective was controlled by a board of elders each elder representing a community art centre.One example of an APY Art Centre Collective project was the canvas painted for and presented to the mosque in Christchurch New Zealand after the March 2019 massacre there. Elder artist and board member Nyunmiti Burton conceived the idea of giving a canvas after seeing television coverage of the massacre. She felt sad for the families and a connection with the spirituality of those in the mosque; she decided that the APY community needed to use its art to make a statement about the insanity of this kind of killing.Reflecting on her inspiration Burton spoke eloquently about “looking back to the time when we were strong—back when we walked around with no clothes—to find elements of our culture to become strong again moving into the future.” She was talking about making art but art rooted in culture stories and oral and visual histories leading from water source to water source. She spoke about how all these elements were interconnected into one narrative told and retold painted and repainted. But the artists did not just retell the old; they spoke of the current and future using techniques and colours that made sense for the present.Burton went on to talk about “sorry camps” another cultural practice that had evolved. When someone died the clan dropped everything and gathered in the desert for a week or more to mourn tell stories and bury their relative. A newer tradition involved placing yellow plastic flowers on the coffin and on the grave. These yellow flowers were a prominent feature of the canvas the APY Art Centre Collective gave to the Christchurch mosque.The canvas was painted in a weekend by a group of women artists old and young. After conversation about the massacre and the goal of the canvas about sorry camps and grieving about the connections they saw and felt two or three of the elders painted the basic scaffolding—the black lines in the picture—and then the rest filled in the colours each working on a small patch of canvas. Besides being a moving offering in and of itself the finished painting was valued at well over $100000 due to its beauty and the notoriety of some of the artists. It was an all-star canvas.Big City LightsTo circumvent the carpetbagger art dealers and support emerging artists the APY Art Centre Collective decided to open its own gallery. The Collective’s goals were to command higher prices build the reputations of emerging artists protect them from unscrupulous dealers and channel more money back to the APY Lands.The elders envisioned not just a gallery space but an urban version of an art centre—a space that would provide support for the APY community members in the city a communal studio a launch pad for emerging artists and an economic engine that would send money back to the APY Lands. The brick-and-mortar APY Art Centre Collective gallery would also provide a rich experience for art buyers by creating opportunities for customers to view and buy finished pieces and to learn about the art and its cultural roots from APY artists working on site. The gallery would educate customers and the broader community about APY art and about the workings of the market for Indigenous art. Finally art buyers could be confident that the art they bought through the APY Art Centre Collective gallery was genuine and that the proceeds would provide financial support to both an APY artist and the APY community at large.The elders asked O’Meara a trusted “whitefella” to represent the Collective and interact with the urban world. O’Meara had spent 12 years in the APY Lands working at first for the government and later for various art centres. Although she had no dealer or gallery experience O’Meara had proven to be a good administrator a passionate advocate and critically a trustworthy employee. O’Meara estimated that about 200 rising artists had work that could be priced at $1000 to $3000 per piece if sold in an urban centre.From the outset the Collective was determined to challenge existing industry commission structures. Working with the elders the Collective decided that the gallery would pay 60 per cent of the sales price to the artists and keep 40 per cent for operations; in addition the gallery would channel any profit back to the art centres on the APY Lands. This payment structure was in marked and intentional contrast to the conventional gallery structure in which the gallery kept 60 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of the established artist’s work (see Exhibit 6). The Collective’s gallery fees were even further removed from the carpetbaggers’ practice of paying artists a small flat fee and then keeping the entire selling price for the dealer. At first the APY Art Centre Collective wanted to open its gallery in Adelaide the capital of South Australia. South Australia was a sparsely populated desert state about the size of France and approximately 1.3 million of its 2 million residents lived in Adelaide. Although Adelaide’s economy had suffered from the steep decline of automotive manufacturing in Australia Adelaide remained the economic and service hub of the state with three universities two large hospitals a port and a large number of small businesses. Adelaide was also familiar ground to the APY communities. While it was a two-to-four-day drive on dirt roads from the APY Lands in the far corner of South Australia Adelaide was still the closest city of any size and was home to a constantly changing population of people from the APY communities drawn to Adelaide for health care and economic opportunity. A gallery in Adelaide could do double duty as an art centre and place of support for the APY people navigating the city.To fund the gallery dream the Collective applied for government and private support while also raising seed money by producing and selling all-star canvases. After struggling to find enough philanthropic or government support to open in Adelaide the APY Art Centre Collective received a donor’s offer to match the Collective’s seed money if the art centre would open its gallery in Sydney. Much larger and wealthier than Adelaide the Sydney region had a population of more than 5 million residents a diverse array of firms—many with global ties—and a burgeoning art scene. Further Sydney was located in the state of New South Wales the richest and most populous of Australia’s states. But Sydney was more than 2500 kilometres from the APY Lands and although it was home to an extremely diverse population it had virtually no APY community. After painful deliberation the board decided to take the risk follow the money and launch its first gallery in Sydney despite concerns about the distance and lack of APY community there.APY Gallery Sydney opened in March 2018 in a two-story building just blocks from the National Art School where artists visiting from the APY Lands could participate in professional development opportunities across a diversity of mediums including printmaking ceramics sculpture new media arts and photography. Despite a rushed launch scant initial notice from the art world and the lack of an APY presence in Sydney the gallery surprised everyone including the APY Art Centre Collective by selling $700000 worth of artwork in its first year.Part of the gallery’s success was attributed to the occasional presence of the artists: gallery goers could interact with visiting artists making art. Also contributing to first year success was a concerted effort to reach art buyers through digital marketing techniques. The APY Art Centre Collective created a presence on the web Facebook and Instagram and developed a mechanism for selling directly to buyers through direct messaging and email. The increased visibility also paid off indirectly with more APY artists winning awards selling their art works at higher prices and even being invited to travel internationally to display their work (see Exhibit 7).By the end of its first year the Sydney gallery had helped the Collective direct $941000 to artists and the art centres on the APY Lands. However as successful as the Sydney gallery’s first year was the Collective remained reliant on donor support (see Exhibit 8). The gallery contributed to an increase in art sales from just over $913000 in 2018 to just over $1458000 in 2019 but the cash proceeds from art sales contributed only $517000 to cash operating expenses in 2019 of $1076000. The balance was made up from donated funds especially government grants.The success of APY Gallery Sydney sparked renewed interest in South Australia and the state’s premier urged the APY Art Centre Collective to open a gallery in Adelaide. Because the Collective had always wanted to locate in Adelaide where so many APY people lived or visited for medical care the elders were interested in the offer and asked O’Meara to move from Sydney to Adelaide to open a second gallery.O’Meara was not so sure of the plan. Although the APY community was strong in Adelaide and many more artists would be able to work from a gallery located there the Adelaide art market was tiny compared to that of Sydney. Also South Australia’s capacity to support both art and Indigenous communities was much smaller than that of New South Wales. Further the Sydney gallery was just finishing its first year staffing was thin and projected profits were uncertain. O’Meara worried that opening an Adelaide gallery would dilute attention time and money and increase the chance that the Sydney gallery the digital marketing initiative and the Adelaide gallery would all fail. Finally the board had recently asked O’Meara to help several artists tour Europe and to organize a trip to Christchurch to present the sorry camp canvas. She was not at all sure that she could manage Sydney Adelaide digital marketing and the tours especially given the large distances involved and her commitment to the elders to spend as much as 40 per cent of her time on the Lands.With all this in mind O’Meara argued that she should stay in Sydney to develop both the Sydney and online customer base using any extra time to work on special projects such as the tours. She was confident that in one or two more years she could develop the gallery and its online store into a reliable source of income and reputation for the APY community. Once a strong foundation was in place in Sydney and online the time would be right to open an additional gallery in Adelaide.But the elders had been dreaming about a gallery in Adelaide for nearly a decade. A large APY community in Adelaide needed support the state was interested in providing funding and a gallery and workshop space were available. Further while the Sydney gallery operations were shaky its online presence was growing and there was cash in the bank from previous fundraising various special projects and all-star canvas sales. The elders were adamant: it was time to launch the Adelaide gallery. O’Meara’s challenge was to make the expansion a success—without undermining the rest of the APY Art Centre Collective’s initiatives.Exhibit 1: Biography of Skye O’MearaSkye O’Meara started her work in the Indigenous art industry in 2003. She worked first for the Australia Council for the Arts the federal government’s funding body for the arts for four years before becoming manager of Tjala Arts in the Amata Community in 2007. During her years at Tjala Arts she supported Tjala Arts directors and senior artists across the region to drive innovative artistic projects and strategies such as the Kulata Tjuta Project (Many Spears) and the APY Young Photographers program.
In 2017 O’Meara accepted the position of general manager of the APY Art Centre Collective. In that role she coordinated and delivered an expansive range of prestigious artistic projects and regional business initiatives. Her passion was creating Indigenous employment in communities through art centres. Her self-described professional focus was “positive social change.”Source: “Skye O’Meara” W [Westpac] Scholars accessed December 18 2020 https://scholars.westpacgroup.com.au/Scholars/Profile?Id=3331; “Skye O’Meara” LinkedIn accessed December 18 2020 www.linkedin.com/in/skye-o-meara-9234551a2.Exhibit 2: APY Art Centre Collective Board of DirectorsSource: Company documents.Exhibit 3: Location of APY CommunitiesSource: Company documents.Exhibit 4: Ernabella Arts Centre Philosophy and SpiritI hear the singing and my mind takes me back to my life as a child when we didn’t know about your world. To a time where song was strong and echoed around our beautiful country around the creek beds rock holes and sand dunes of the Lands.I am an old woman now. The songs of my childhood are still alive. There were years where we sang with softer voices our voices were weakened from the challenges we faced when our worlds collided.The job of the Elders became clear and our focus grew stronger. Through our culture we would find the solutions. Through our culture we would find the opportunities and roles for the next generations.We started our art centres first in Ernabella and then one by one in each of the communities. The song spread across the Lands. Together we sang and our voices became clear and strong as strong as it was when I was a child. As we sing we feel the spirit of the leaders we have lost beside us. Our voices crack and shake with pride for the new leaders who have followed in their footsteps carry the song today.And so the song continues.Nyurpaya Kaika APY Artist and Board Member 2017Source: Company documents.Exhibit 5: Learning by Doing at an Arts CentreSource: Company documents.-Exhibit 6: APY Art Centres Versus Private DealersSource: Company documents.Exhibit 7: Social Media Traffic 2018Note: The Twitter account for APY Art Centre Collective (@apyacc) was not open until 2019.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 8: Financials for APY Art Centre CollectiveStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income Year Ending June 30 2019Exhibit 8: CONTINUEDStatement of Cash Flows Year Ending June 30 2019Note: These consolidated financials include the APY Gallery Sydney the tours and the sale of all-star paintings; they do not include information about the proposed Adelaide gallery.Source: “Financial Report Updated (Lodged)” Documents for APY Art Centre Collective Aboriginal Corporation February 7 2020 accessed June 22 2020 https://register.oric.gov.au/document.aspx?concernID=4242480.",31,"[{""start"":1050,""end"":1062,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18551,""end"":18563,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18563,""end"":18575,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19450,""end"":19462,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1243,""end"":1250,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1767,""end"":1774,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2042,""end"":2049,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2214,""end"":2221,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":2397,""end"":2404,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":6746,""end"":6753,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":10924,""end"":10931,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11018,""end"":11025,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11182,""end"":11189,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":11289,""end"":11296,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16299,""end"":16306,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16364,""end"":16371,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":16828,""end"":16835,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17074,""end"":17081,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":17443,""end"":17450,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":18395,""end"":18404,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":19078,""end"":19085,""labels"":[""PERSON""]},{""start"":1454,""end"":1460,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2459,""end"":2465,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13550,""end"":13556,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13602,""end"":13608,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13749,""end"":13755,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13857,""end"":13863,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14119,""end"":14125,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14206,""end"":14212,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":14603,""end"":14609,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15431,""end"":15437,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15565,""end"":15571,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":15985,""end"":15991,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16320,""end"":16326,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16577,""end"":16583,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":16948,""end"":16954,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17237,""end"":17243,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17482,""end"":17488,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17509,""end"":17515,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":17820,""end"":17826,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18148,""end"":18154,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2750,""end"":2759,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":2948,""end"":2963,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":3247,""end"":3257,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":6538,""end"":6547,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":5994,""end"":6005,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12269,""end"":12278,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12286,""end"":12295,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":12530,""end"":12539,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":18658,""end"":18667,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":13833,""end"":13844,""labels"":[""LOCATION""]},{""start"":1350,""end"":1353,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1923,""end"":1926,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2083,""end"":2086,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":1994,""end"":1997,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2255,""end"":2258,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7819,""end"":7822,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":7912,""end"":7915,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8261,""end"":8264,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8401,""end"":8404,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":11142,""end"":11145,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2263,""end"":2266,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":2524,""end"":2527,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":8046,""end"":8049,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17399,""end"":17402,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":17335,""end"":17338,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18584,""end"":18587,""labels"":[""GENDER""]},{""start"":18832,""end"":18835,""labels"":[""GENDER""]}]"

(HPI) the country’s leading cement maker for a full (100 per cent) enterprise value of US$2.15 billion (₱112.3 billion). SMC planned to buy an 85.73 per cent controlling stake in HPI which would make SMC the biggest cement player in the country. The transaction involved the potential transfer of the 5531566062 common shares in HPI (or 85.73 per cent of outstanding shares) that had previously been owned by Union Cement Holdings Corporation (UCHC) Holderfin BV (Holderfin) and Cemco Holdings Inc. (Cemco) (see Exhibit 1). The buyer was First Stronghold Cement Industries Inc. (First Stronghold) a wholly owned subsidiary of San Miguel Equity Investments Inc. which in turn was a wholly owned subsidiary of SMC. SMC had won a bidding process against Anhui Conch Cement Co. Ltd. the largest cement manufacturer in mainland China in the final round. Because SMC’s First Stronghold was acquiring controlling interest of a publicly listed company the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required First Stronghold to conduct a mandatory tender offer for the remaining HPI shares held by minority shareholders which represented 14.27 per cent of the total issued and outstanding capital stock. It would also need prior approval from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) since the transaction was valued in excess of ₱1 billion. While waiting for the approval of the PCC and the completion of the post-closing purchase price adjustment First Stronghold and SMC filed a request with the SEC for exemptive relief which would allow the tender offer to be deferred until after the final purchase price had been determined and paid. First Stronghold had made no specific disclosure about the per-share price of the acquisition. However according to market estimates reported in the Philippine Star SMC had bought HPI for an attractive price of at least ₱16.85 per share higher than the closing price of ₱15.30 on May 10 2019. On December 28 2018 HPI shares had traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange (under the ticker symbol “HLCM”) at ₱5.80 (see Exhibit 2).  Richard Saavedra a retail investor had bought HPI shares at ₱7.30 on June 29 2018. He wanted to understand the current prospects of the cement industry and assess the financial health and valuation of HPI in order to decide whether he should (1) sell his shares in HPI at the current market price and take the immediate gain (2) wait for the mandatory tender offer price from SMC or (3) keep his investment in HPI indefinitely. He wondered if the press had reported the right purchase price per share.PHILIPPINE CEMENT INDUSTRYThe Cement Manufacturers’ Association of the Philippines (CeMAP) which represented the industry in projects and programs with the Philippine government comprised five members: HPI; CEMEX Holdings Philippines Inc. with its operating subsidiaries Solid Cement Corporation and APO Cement Corporation; Republic Cement and Building Materials Inc. (Republic Cement); Northern Cement Corporation; and Taiheiyo Cement Philippines Inc. Eagle Cement Corporation (Eagle Cement) a key industry player was not part of the CeMAP.After the PCC investigated CeMAP HPI and Republic Cement for alleged violations of competitive practices in 2016 CeMAP stopped collecting sales data in August 2017 which resulted in the absence of any report on the cement industry. However it was reported in an affidavit that CeMAP president Ernesto Ordoñez HPI and Republic Cement had violated the Philippine Competition Act’s provisions by using anti-competitive agreements by “restricting competition as to price or components thereof or other terms of trade abusing their dominant position by engaging in conduct that substantially prevents restricts or lessens competition imposing barriers to entry or committing acts that prevent competitors from growing within the market.” Demand for cement in the Philippines had expanded from 15.45 metric tons per year (MTPY) in 2010 to 24.40 MTPY in 2015 representing a compounded annual growth rate of 9.53 per cent. This was faster than the Philippine nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.21 per cent over the same time period. At the end of 2016 CeMAP reported an overall increase in sales of cement including imported cement (see Exhibit 3) which had risen to 25.96 million metric tons with 1.59 million metric tons coming from imported cement. To keep up with the rapidly growing demand the cement industry was expected to produce an “additional 11.5 million tons until 2025” which was up from the 26.82 million tons demanded in 2017 and increased the pressure to either import or increase the capacity of cement plants to bridge the gap between demand and supply. In the first quarter of 2019 the cement industry had reported a 64 per cent increase in imports which continued to rise in spite of the imposition of a provisional safeguard duty of ₱8.40 per bag (US$0.16 per bag) imposed in February 2019. The huge demand–supply gap was the result of the poor state of cement plants in the Philippines which were over 20 years old needed renovations and had a clinker-to-cement ratio below 0.80.Future cement demand was expected to continue being driven by growth in the construction sector. Strong government infrastructure spending to support economic growth such as the Build Build Build! program and developments from the private sector were likely to create a major spike in demand for construction supplies including cement. The construction sector had seen massive growth and was expected to reach US$47 billion in value by 2020 following the government’s push for infrastructure development rural-area urbanization and low- and middle-income group housing; there were also increasing demands from a growing expatriate population for posh condominiums. The government had also committed US$23 billion to tourism infrastructure development from 2019 to 2024 under its National Tourism Development Plan. According to industry reports the Philippine residential market was expected to account for 33.9 per cent of the construction industry’s total value in 2020. Following the growth trends the National Economic and Development Authority planned to increase the government’s infrastructure spending to 7.4 per cent of GDP by 2022 up from 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2017. The government had not only identified 75 projects for prioritization approval and implementation but it had also outlined financial aid for middle- and low-income families under several programs. Because of the Philippine peso’s slide against the US dollar bank lending interest rates had increased from 6.1 per cent in 2018 to 7.1 in 2019; this was expected to increase the cost of interest on home loans and thereby lower the demand for housing. Despite this the construction industry looked positive and its contribution as a percentage of GDP had grown steadily from 2005 to 2015.  HPI’s MAJOR competitorsAs of December 2016 the Philippine cement industry had an estimated clinker capacity of 20.60 metric MTPY and cement capacity of 28.63 MTPY. The top four players in the industry (HPI CEMEX Republic Cement and Eagle Cement) accounted for about 80 per cent and 82 per cent of the total clinker and cement domestic production capacities respectively. Although HPI’s cement production capacity was the largest at 8 million metric tons as of 2016 (see Exhibit 4) all four players had invested more funds and introduced newer projects to boost production output by the end of 2020 making the competitive space very unpredictable. CEMEX Holdings Philippines Inc.A subsidiary of the CEMEX Asian South East Corporation CEMEX was a global building materials company with a footprint spanning 50 countries. Besides ordinary Portland and blended cement it produced masonry or mortar cement and ready-mix concrete. CEMEX and its subsidiaries owned two cement plants (see Exhibit 4) a ready-mix concrete plant and an admixtures facility. It also owned many shipping terminals and land-distribution facilities throughout the Philippines. As part of its corporate social responsibility program CEMEX developed green products and introduced many skill-enhancing initiatives. In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Typhoon Haiyan) in 2013 it also helped rebuild the northern part of Cebu province and rehabilitate affected communities in collaboration with the local government and non-profit organizations. Republic Cement GroupThe Republic Cement Group a joint venture between the Ireland-based CRH and local conglomerate Aboitiz Equity Ventures had several companies under its umbrella: Republic Cement & Building Materials Inc. Republic Cement Iligan Inc. Republic Cement Mindanao Inc. and Republic Cement Services Inc. While Aboitiz Equity Ventures a public holding company of the Aboitiz Group was a Filipino business group listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange its partner CRH a Fortune 500 building materials company was a listed on the London and Irish stock exchanges. Besides cement the group had business interests across the banking and financial services infrastructure power food and real estate sectors. Republic Cement was committed to nation-building through several corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives: Stronger Communities focused on community welfare Stronger Kids focused on child welfare Greener Cement focused on environmental restoration and preservation Stronger Homes focused on affordable housing and Stronger Structures focused on infrastructure development.Eagle Cement CorporationThe president and chief operating officer (COO) of SMC Chinese Filipino businessman Ramon Ang was reported to be the majority owner and manager of Eagle Cement Corporation. Through one of this company’s two wholly owned subsidiaries South Western Cement Corporation Eagle Cement was engaged in the manufacture marketing sale and distribution of cement products and by-products and owned mineral rights in Malabuyoc Cebu. Through the other subsidiary KB Space Holdings Inc. it owned large pockets of prime commercial land in the City of Mandaluyong. Eagle Cement’s plant at Barangay Akle in San Ildefonso Bulacan was not only the newest and most technological advanced with two production lines but it also had the largest production capacity (in number of cement bags) in the Philippines. HOLCIM PHILIPPINES INC.HPI was created through the 2000 merger of three companies—Bacnotan Cement Corporation Davao Union Cement Corporation and Hi Cement Corporation—and the acquisition of the Alsons Cement Corporation in 2002. As of December 31 2018 60.55 per cent of HPI was owned by Union Cement Holdings Corporation (UCHC); 18.11 per cent by Holderfin BV (Holderfin); and 7.08 per cent by Cemco; while the remainder of its shares were owned by the public (see Exhibit 1). Product LinesHPI manufactured sold and distributed cement dry-mix mortar products and clinker. It offered various cement brands in cement bags and in bulk and it also sold a semi-finished product called clinker which was sold only in bulk to cement producers. Moreover it was involved in the ready-mix concrete business aggregates and dry-mix mortar products.Marketing and DistributionHPI had four cement production facilities one cement grinding mill and various ports and warehouses around the Philippines enabling it to serve customers around the country. HPI’s customers were composed of traders wholesalers retailers and contractors who supplied private and public projects real estate developers and concrete producers. HPI supplied various commercial and government infrastructure projects with the goal of having a well-balanced portfolio containing different categories of customers so that it was not dependent on just a few customers.Risk FactorsOne significant risk factor for HPI was the level of construction activity in both the private and public arenas. Public construction was driven by government spending in sectors such as infrastructure and housing which were subject to budgetary constraints and political considerations. In contrast private-sector construction was affected by investors’ confidence in economic and political conditions in the country.Another risk factor was the possibility of prolonged damage or a breakdown in the company’s large production facilities on the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. It also needed a stable source of power for the continuing operation of these production facilities. Finally company operations were subject to environmental and regulatory risks. For example cement manufacturing involved the use of fossil fuels and electric power and ran the risk of possible emissions of dust into the atmosphere which might adversely affect the environment.Company PerformanceHPI showed a modest financial performance in 2018 with earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) declining to ₱4.9 billion from ₱5.4 billion in 2017 on the back of weak revenue growth in the first three quarters of 2018. Its revenue increased by 2.54 per cent based on stable prices and higher volume. Revenues rose from ₱34.7 billion in 2017 to ₱35.6 billion in 2018 driven by expanding demand from the public and private sectors and tighter competition among cement players. Net income after tax declined from ₱2.7 billion to ₱2.5 billion in 2018 because of higher interest expenses from higher debt (see Exhibits 5 and 6 and the accompanying student spreadsheet product no. 7B21N006). Going forward HPI planned to improve and expand its cement and clinker production facilities as well as to continue cost improvement initiatives to address the impact of higher costs.DIVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF LAFARGEHOLCIM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA LafargeHolcim Ltd. (LafargeHolcim) was the global leader in building materials and solutions. It was active in four business segments: cement aggregates ready-mix concrete and solutions and products which included precast concrete asphalt mortar and building solutions. Headquartered in Switzerland LafargeHolcim held leading positions in all regions across the globe (Asia Pacific Europe North America Latin America and the Middle East/Africa). It employed approximately 75000 people in around 80 countries and had a portfolio that was equally balanced between developing and mature markets. LafargeHolcim was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and on Euronext Paris and was a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) European Index.In 2017 as part of its five-year turnaround plan called Strategy 2022—Building for Growth LafargeHolcim announced plans that included the divestment of its assets in Southeast Asia worth at least US$2.0 billion. These divestments were planned to significantly improve LafargeHolcim’s debt ratios: its target was to achieve two times net debt–to–recurring earnings before EBITDA by the end of 2019 and to concentrate on the United States Latin America India and Africa. Why Southeast Asia?LafargeHolcim’s largest business area in terms of volume and number of employees was Asia Pacific which covered India China Bangladesh Australia and Southeast Asia. The company operated 117 integrated cement and cement grinding plants in the Asia Pacific region with total cement grinding capacity of 117.4 million metric tons. Unfortunately in 2017 Asia Pacific reported lower earnings despite higher volumes among the company’s three product lines namely cement aggregates and ready-mix concrete and its full-year recurring EBITDA had declined by 6.9 per cent to US$1.42 billion. In the Philippines operating EBITDA in 2017 had declined by 49.6 per cent from the previous year because of lower revenues and higher fuel and production costs. LafargeHolcim’s chief executive officer (CEO) Jan Jenisch said in May 2018 that the company’s Southeast Asian business had been “a bit more challenging” amid price pressure in markets such as the Philippines and Malaysia.Subsequently in November 2018 LafargeHolcim announced that it was selling its 80.6 per cent stake in Holcim Indonesia for an enterprise value of US$1.75 billion to PT Semen Indonesia. The assets sold included the entirety of LafargeHolcim’s operations in Indonesia which consisted of four cement plants 33 ready-mix plants and two aggregate quarries. PT Semen Indonesia was a major building materials company in Indonesia. In May 2019 LafargeHolcim also announced the sale of its 51 per cent holding in Lafarge Malaysia Berhad for US$396 million (MYR3.75 per share). This price represented a 43 per cent premium over the prior three-month average trading price of Lafarge Malaysia Berhad on the Malaysian stock exchange. Lafarge Malaysia Berhad operated three integrated cement and two grinding plants. The buyer was YTL Cement Berhad which was a part of YTL Corporation Berhad a Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate involved in cement production construction property development and utilities. Finally LafargeHolcim also sold its entire 91 per cent holdings in its Singapore operation for an enterprise value of US66.85 million to YTL Cement Singapore PTE Limited.Sale of HPIRumours about the potential sale of the Philippine unit of LafargeHolcim first came out in January 2019 when it was revealed that Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)-listed company Eagle Cement Corporation the fourth-largest cement company in the Philippines was interested in taking over HPI’s local assets. Ramon Ang was the chairman of the Eagle Cement Corporation board as well as the vice-chair president and COO of SMC. Shares of HPI surged on news of the potential sale. Finally on May 11 2019 HPI and SMC confirmed that LafargeHolcim had signed an agreement for the divestment of LafargeHolcim’s entire 85.73 per cent shareholding in HPI for an enterprise value of US$2.15 billion on a 100 per cent enterprise-value basis.LafargeHolcim announced that its sale of operations in Indonesia Malaysia Singapore and now the Philippines would enable it to exit Southeast Asia with an enterprise value of US$4.9 billion. These divestitures were negotiated based on a 2018 enterprise value–to–recurring EBITDA multiple of above 21 times. These would also reduce the company’s net debt–to–recurring EBITDA ratio by 0.6 times.According to Jan Jenisch LafargeHolcim’s CEOWith the divestment of our activities in the Philippines we are completing our exit from the increasingly hyper-competitive arena in Southeast Asia. While this decision was based on our strategic portfolio review we had reached very attractive valuations allowing us to achieve a new level of financial strength. We would have over performed our target ratio of net debt–to–recurring EBITDA of two times or less by the end of 2019. We had delivered on the promised strengthening of our balance sheet and we are on track to accelerate the execution of our Strategy 2022–“Building for Growth.”LafargeHolcim said that it had conducted competitive bidding for HPI and that SMC had presented the best offer. Industry sources indicated that SMC overcame various international players such as China-based Anhui Cement Corp. Japan-based Taiheyo Cement Corp. Thailand-based Siam City Cement and the Philippines’ Eagle Cement Corporation.SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION SMC with its subsidiaries was one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines with sales that accounted for approximately 5.9 per cent of the Philippine GDP in 2018. SMC businesses included a globally recognized beer brand food and packaging fuel and oil energy infrastructure and banking investment. Almost 66 per cent of SMC was owned by Top Frontier Investment Holdings Inc.; however deeper research showed that Ramon Ang held over 32 per cent of SMC shares through his wholly owned companies Privado Holdings Corp. and Master Year Limited (see Exhibit 7).In its corporate disclosure with the PSE SMC said its acquisition of HPI would increase the foothold of the San Miguel Group in the cement business and would provide the company the opportunity to implement its plan to expand its cement business nationwide. In 2013 SMC purchased 35 per cent of Northern Cement Company which was controlled by Eduardo Cojuango the chair of SMC. In 2017 SMC entered a joint venture with Northern Cement Company to build a new cement plant in the province of Pangasinan. SMC owned 70 per cent of the joint venture company. The acquisition of HPI was widely seen as Roman Ang’s expansionary move into the cement business amid the government’s ongoing massive infrastructure push. Astro del Castillo managing director at First Grade Finance Inc. said “It’s a logical move for San Miguel considering its exposure to road and airport projects. The company was capitalizing on the government’s ‘Build Build Build’ infrastructure program.” In an interview Ang said he was confident the company would receive the necessary PCC approval since both the public and government considered it positive for a Filipino company to acquire HPI. He added “Do you know that 35 per cent of cement being sold in the Philippines today are imported cement? And the major players in the Philippines―HPI CEMEX Lafarge-CRH and Japanese firm Taiyo and another Taiwanese―they are all foreigners. Don’t you want a Filipino to acquire it?” SMC disclosed that it was buying controlling interest of HPI from three companies controlled by LafargeHolcim namely the Dutch company Holderfin BV Union Cement Holdings Corp. and Cemco Holdings Inc. The consideration of the transaction was to be paid in cash on closing subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment. Furthermore it was disclosed that the amount of the consideration had been negotiated and determined based on the valuation of the business of the target through a discounted cash flow method as well as other methodologies customary for transactions of this nature.PHILIPPINE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONSAs a result of this transaction First Stronghold as the purchaser was required to conduct a mandatory tender offer for the remaining HPI shares held by minority shareholders which represented 14.27 per cent of the total issued and outstanding capital stock. In any acquisition that would result in ownership of over 50 per cent of the equity of a public company the SEC required the acquirer to buy out the minority shareholders through a tender offer at a price supported by the fairness opinion provided by an independent financial advisor. In addition parties to a merger or acquisition valued at over ₱1 billion were required to notify the PCC of their agreement which could not be completed without the approval of the PCC. The PCC had been mandated under the Philippine Competition Act to review mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they would not substantially reduce competition in the relevant market or harm the interest of consumers. Accordingly SMC and HPI notified the PCC of the transaction on June 6 2019. While the HPI acquisition was announced at a time when the PCC was also investigating a possible cartel in the local cement industry details and even updates about this probe had been kept secret. However Renato Balisacan chair of the PCC said that the SMC-HPI takeover deal was “different” from this ongoing investigation saying “Unlike cartel investigations which look into past conduct merger reviews are carried out to determine any competition concerns before the transaction is consummated to prevent potential damage to consumers.” While they waited for the PCC’s approval and the completion of post-closing purchase price adjustment First Stronghold and SMC filed a request for exemptive relief with the SEC to allow the tender offer to be conducted after the final purchase price had been determined and paid. VALUING HPIOn Friday May 10 2019 shares of HPI closed at ₱15.30 per share. Saavedra wanted to confirm this value with his own estimates in order to decide whether to (1) sell his shareholdings in HPI at the current market price and take the gain (2) wait for the yet unpriced mandatory tender offer that SMC was required to launch or (3) keep his investment in HPI indefinitely. Saavedra was able to get a copy of HPI’s financial statements (see Exhibits 5 and 6). From this he thought that he could make income statement free cash flow and working capital forecasts. He wanted to estimate the share price value of HPI as of January 1 2019 incorporating a full-year 2019 forecast. He planned to run a five-year value growth duration from 2019 to 2023 and a sixth-year normalized free cash flow forecast for 2024 which he would use to estimate the terminal value. He projected that revenues would grow at the rate of 10.5 per cent annually over the value growth duration. This was the same nominal growth rate exhibited by the construction industry in the first quarter of 2019. He also assumed that cost- and expense-to-revenue ratios would be based on the average of the last three years leading up to 2018 (inclusive). He expected that net working capital (namely operating cash receivables inventory and trade payables) would follow 2018 estimates and he assumed that HPI intended to set aside 7 per cent of revenues as operating cash.  There was some publicly available information to help forecast capital expenditures. In early 2019 HPI had invested US$54 million (₱2.82 billion) to expand cement production in its La Union plant. For simplicity Saavedra assumed that depreciation would be 5 per cent of revenues and that capital expenditures (CAPEX) would equal depreciation from 2019 to 2023. As things stood he knew that depreciation was already embedded in the cost-of-sales number. For the 2024 free cash flow estimate for terminal value he assumed that depreciation would be same percentage of revenues but that CAPEX would be ₱350 million more than depreciation based on the 10-year historical difference between these two accounts.  He found out that the market risk premium for the Philippines was 6.33 per cent which was the long-term equity market return in excess of the 91-day Treasury bill rate. For revenue and free-cash-flow growth rate for terminal value he had a few possible choices: he noted that the World Bank had projected the Philippine inflation rate at 3.5 per cent for 2019; he read that the Philippine nominal GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 had been 7.8 per cent; and he saw from his previous research that the cement industry was expected to produce “an additional 11.50 MTPY until 2025” from a base of 26.82 MTPY at the end of  2017.  He decided to estimate beta based on monthly HPI stock prices and PSE index (PSEi) values over the last three years (see Exhibit 8). He assumed that SMC would retain HPI’s current capital structure after the acquisition and that the pre-tax cost of debt would remain at 4.66 per cent. He thought he would use the current market capitalization for the weight of equity. He assumed that the “Due to Related Parties” account was non-interest bearing. He also found additional data on the rate of Philippine government securities (see Exhibit 9). He assumed a tax rate of 30 per cent which was consistent with the Philippine corporate tax rate. With all this information on hand Saavedra proceeded to run a discounted cash flow valuation of HPI. Saavedra was also able to gather financial ratios for SMC and for comparable companies in the construction infrastructure and allied services sub-sector of the PSE (see Exhibit 10). He wondered if the trading multiples of HPI would compare well with those of its competitors. Did HPI’s controlling stockholders get a good offer price from SMC? What should Saavedra do given the prevailing market price of ₱15.30? The tender offer price was unknown but he expected it to be the same as that offered to HPI’s controlling stockholders. Should he sell now should he wait for the tender offer or should he do nothing at all and just hold on to his stock?Exhibit 1: Ownership Structure of Holcim Philippines Inc.Source: Holcim Philippines Inc. 2018 Annual Report 142 February 28 2019 accessed July 262020 https://www.holcim.ph/sites/philippines/files/atoms/files/hpi_2018_annual_report.pdf.Exhibit 2: Holcim Philippines Inc.

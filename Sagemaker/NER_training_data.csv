Musthafa chief executive officer (CEO) of iD Fresh Food (India) Private Limited (iD) was preparing for a virtual meeting with his co-founders. iD was a food company located in Bengaluru India manufacturing ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat food products. The company’s flagship product was its batter for preparing popular Indian breakfast dishesidlis and dosas. The company also manufactured and sold cottage cheese (paneer); curd; parathas and chapatis which were ready-to-heat Indian flatbreads; filter coffee decoction; tender coconut; grated coconut; and batter for making vadas. The company was set up in 2005 by Musthafa and his cousins and had weathered many storms since its inception. Creating a position for itself in the unorganized business of idli-dosa batter had not been easy. iD offered a unique value proposition to its customersthat of freshness which resonated with customers. The company had grown in revenue from a mere ₹0.8 million in 2005 to ₹2.385 billion in fiscal year 2020. The company’s vision was “to grow into a ₹10-billion market leader admired and trusted the world over” in addition to being one of the best and most sought-after companies to work for. Musthafa and his co-founders wished to achieve the ₹10-billion turnover mark by 2023. As Musthafa mulled over issues that had arisen on both the demand and the supply side of the business his thoughts were on how iD could achieve its vision amid a pandemic. The pandemic had brought about production and logistics challenges besides a dip in demand brought about by the fear of the virus itself. How could Musthafa and his team ensure that iD continued to produce amid the disruption of supply chains all over the country? With the logistics sector disrupted due to COVID-19 how could iD ensure that its products maintained the promised value proposition of “freshness”? How could he and his team ensure that wary customers continued to trust iD and not switch to home-made batter or to competitors’ products? iD Fresh FoodThe GenesisiD was started by Musthafa and his four cousins Abdul Nazer Shamsudeen TK Jafar TK and Noushad TA. Hailing from a small village near Wayanad Kerala a state in the south of India the cousins had migrated to Bengaluru another South Indian state where all of the cousins (except Musthafa) engaged in running a small retail grocery store. One of the products sold in the grocery store was locally packaged batter for making idlis and dosas a staple breakfast among South Indians. Idlis and dosas originated in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The batter for idlis and dosas was simple to make. A certain proportion of rice and a kind of black gram called urad was soaked ground and fermented before being used to make idlis and dosas. Indians had been preparing this batter in their homes for centuries using manual stone grinders (and later electronic mixer-grinders). However with more and more women joining the workforce the search was on for convenient alternatives and ready-made batter was one such alternative. Such batter as was sold in grocery stores across India mostly came packed in plastic bags sealed with a rubber band having been prepared by women as part of small home-grown enterprises and supplied locally given the perishable nature of the product. This batter was often perceived as unhygienic with regard to both the quality of water and raw materials that went into it and the manufacturing process itself. Other brands of batter were sold at the grocery stores that came in better packaging and that through the use of preservatives offered slightly longer expiry dates of up to two weeks. These brands were slightly more expensive than the batter in plastic bags. All batter however was priced within a narrow range of ₹20₹30 which included the local grocery store’s margins. Consumers would purchase such batter for regular use based on considerations of price hygiene or total shelf-life.As Nazer complained about the batter sold in their local grocery store Musthafa a computer engineer who had pursued his management degree from a well-known Indian business school noticed that consumers who bought the product often provided negative feedback on it since there was no consistency in the quality of the batter. Musthafa who at the time was employed with Fair Isaac India Software Private Ltd. a data analytics company decided to venture into the business of manufacturing batter with his cousins. The enterprise was initially called Best Food Enterprises. Distinguishing Itself from the CompetitionThe ready-to-cook batter segment belonged to the unorganized market which was localized and extremely fragmented with neighbourhood grocery stores stocking the batter. Even as other brands were engaging in research and development to extend their products’ shelf lives iD decided to adopt and offer to customers the value proposition of freshness with batter that was made with fresh raw materials of a specific quality. The iD founders who themselves had little knowledge of this business arrived at the right mix of rice and urad by speaking to various customers who were experienced at preparing such batter. This was a 5:1 proportion of rice and the gram respectively together with a .03 per cent portion of fenugreek seeds which was to be blended to make a distinctive batter. In keeping with its unique selling proposition of being 100 per cent natural iD’s batter did not contain any chemical preservatives or additives to make the batter soft and fluffy and instead relied on the traditional fermentation process. Further the batter contained low-sodium salt and used water purified by the reverse osmosis method. With no added preservatives the batter had a use-by-date of seven days from the date of manufacture. Similarly the paneer launched later by iD was made using the traditional method of adding lime to milk instead of the commercial method of adding citric acid.While its recipes were simple iD innovated around packaging and distribution. In 2014 iD introduced idli-dosa batter packaging in the form of a sealed pouchwhich when opened took the shape of a small tub with a boat-shaped bottomthat Musthafa termed the “transformer pouch.” While the cost of the packaging was slightly higher it gave customers the convenience of storing the batter in the pack itself which could be reused instead of having to transfer the contents into a bowl after cutting the packet open. Another packaging innovation was for the vada batter which was made available in a pouch with an attached spout through which customers could squeeze a perfectly shaped vada with a hole in the centre out of the package and into a frying pan. iD was thus able to bring science into the art of making vadas which otherwise likely would have remained restricted to those who would have received this knowledge and skill passed down through the family.Early YearsIn 2005 with an investment of ₹50000 the cousins rented a shop in Bengaluru’s Tippasandra locality; they bought a grinder a mixer a sealing machine and a second-hand scooter and started their batter business. The idea was to offer hygienic well-packed preservative-free batter to Indian households by supplying it to retail outlets personally from their 50-square-foot kitchen. The target was to sell 100 packets per day at over 20 stores in the city. Reminiscing about the initial days Musthafa recalledWe would buy the grains clean them soak grind [and] package [them] and then load the packets in the evening. I would personally load these packets on my scooty [a two-wheeler] and go [from] store to store in Bengaluru. However the initial months were those of struggle and sales did not pick up for a good nine months. The packets that were not sold and had not yet expired were supplied to business-to-business (B2B) stores at a reduced price in the initial months which helped iD stay afloat until retail sales picked up. It took the cousins nine months to achieve the target of selling 100 packets daily. The fact that many of the grocery stores in Bengaluru were run by people from Kerala known as Malayalis also helped the business by allowing the cousins to forge immediate social connections.The founders knew nothing of breakfast food let alone food technology. They spoke to older women who were responsible for the family cooking in order to get the batter right. They focused on sourcing the right quality ingredients from the same farms and mills in order to maintain consistency in quality. However such focus on quality did not prepare them for the unexpected challenges that arose. In April 2006 the cousins found themselves in an ugly situation—one that could possibly damage iD’s credibility—when the batter packets supplied to a grocery store that did not possess adequate refrigeration facilities became over-fermented and resulted in the packets bursting. This was an important lesson for the team and accordingly they began to focus only on larger stores that had refrigeration and that did not turn off the electricity at night. The team learned that of the 65000 retail stores in Bengaluru 12000 had refrigeration. These became the target segment for iD and Musthafa and his co-founders decided that they would need to get their product into as many of these stores as possible.By 2007 the company was selling 3500 kilograms (kg) of batter per day. Musthafa decided to quit his job and officially join iD full-time as CEO in 2008. He also sold his land in Wayanad and used the money to set up a 2500-square-foot factory in Hoskote Bengaluru. As the company scaled up its operations it was clear that the existing machinery would not be sufficient. The small grinders the founders had procured from vendors in Coimbatore could grind only 1.5 kg per hour. Nazer thus designed a unique machine (which the cousins had manufactured by their vendors) that helped them scale up. As the company grew to ₹5 million turnover by 2008 Musthafa decided to explore new markets. In 20092010 the company decided to set up operations in Chennaithe so-called “Mecca” of idlis. Of the foray into the Chennai market Musthafa said:We decided to plough all our profits into setting up a plant in Chennai and launched the product in 2010. Only after we launched it did we realize what a tough market it was. For one we couldn’t compete with the local players on price. They were buying rice subsidized by the state government at ₹1 per kg to make the batter. So they were able to supply batter at ₹20 per kg and iD batter at ₹45 per kg was way too expensive. Secondly since the subsidized rice was not really suitable for the batter they would add loads of [baking] soda to it and that would make their idlis softer than ours. Therefore for the Chennai customer not only was our batter much more expensive the quality didn’t meet their expectations. But we didn’t want to compromise on our product quality.Meanwhile business in Bengaluru had begun to slip because the core team was focused on setting things right in Chennai. The cash flow was impacted as a result since iD was losing money in the new market. The founders had put their entire profit into setting up the infrastructure in Chennai. For nearly six months they were not able to pay salaries on time. Although a few of the employees left most stayed. The business was proving to be a costly journey. Finally the only option for preventing further losses was to shut down the Chennai operations sell the assets and use the money to pay salaries. iD decided to exit the Chennai market in early 2012. The foray into Chennai had cost iD’s founders about ₹3.5 milliona huge loss for an entrepreneurial venture in its early phase.The Chennai debacle had taught the founders that even more than a food business iD was a logistics business. Poor quality refrigeration and air-conditioning facilities had also been responsible for the failure in the Chennai market. The founders also learned that it was important to find a target group that valued the company’s positioning.iD decided to look at other geographical locations and grow business elsewhere (see Exhibit 1). The company also decided to pay attention to logistics and technology. iD set up operations in Mumbai and Hyderabad in 2012 and in 2013 respectively and ventured onto foreign shores when it commenced operations in Dubai. The founders also decided that it was time to diversify their product offerings. Nazer who understood people’s palates and their tastes and preferences better than his co-founders created additional products such as flatbreadsparottas and chapatis. In late 2012 they again tapped the Chennai market with their other products especially parottas selling only these in Chennai for more than a year. When the team was convinced that they had created a brand and retail presence in Chennai they relaunched their batter there.In 2014 the company was renamed as iD Fresh Food (India) Private Limited. While Musthafa had the word “identity” in mind for the acronym his cousins were thinking of iD as standing for idli-dosa. A logo and the packaging were designed. As the company expanded its operations it searched for better machines—ones that could help it scale up and become profitable. In 2014 Musthafa visited Germany with the intent to purchase better machinery. While he could not find a machine that could make the batter for the Indian breakfast items by grinding rice and pulses he did find a machine that the Germans used to make mustard paste. With the help of the German machine manufacturer Musthafa adapted this machine into a heavy-duty grinder that worked as an idli-dosa batter making machine. It cost the iD owners around ₹10 million but it also helped them to increase their capacity dramatically. With its capacity of 5000 kg batter per houralmost 100 times the capacity of traditional machinesthe machine helped iD to scale up and leverage costs as well as maintain hygienic practices. The company was able to service its stores across 45 locations including eight in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through its five plantstwo in Bengaluru and one each in Hyderabad Bhiwandi (Mumbai) and Ajman (UAE). Challenges and Early LessonsThe company faced several challenges in its journey. In the initial days even as the founders struggled with finances the company received an order from a reputed five-star hotel chain to supply it with thousands of packets of “diamond cuts” a popular Indian snack. Musthafa approached the hotel’s chef to understand how the diamond cuts would be used. When he was told that the hotel chain intended to use the product as a bar snack to accompany the liquor served in the bar he rejected the offer since it contradicted the cousins’ value system. The initial days of the company was also when the company’s vision was crystallizednot to just make money by any means but to assist cooking in kitchens across India. The goal was to complement households in taking care of the family by providing them with fresh food and not compete with the cook.   The company also did not want to be acting as third-party manufacturers for restaurants and hotels. Musthafa and his co-founders  realized that products such as rose cookies and diamond cuts were not in line with their value proposition. The company believed it should stick to its core strengthmaking products with a short shelf life.However as testified by a veteran of the Indian food industry the fresh-food business was risky because of the products’ short shelf life as well as the problem of logistics. With a three-to-seven-day shelf life for its products iD could not have used the traditional fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution model with its time lag of two to three weeks for products to reach the retail stores post-production. Musthafa and his co-founders made two fundamental decisions. One was to create a zero-inventory business model and the other was to create their own distribution model called the DSD (direct store delivery) which used a DCS (driver cum salesperson). Every day the DCS would load the truck with an approximate quantity of idli and dosa batter visit each store take the order supply the quantity then and there create the invoice and collect the payment. Unsold goods were exchanged daily. With this model the company had 600 salespeople visiting close to 30000 outlets every day. The model had its challenges; for instance it was extremely important to get the volume right as Musthafa explained:It was a magical balance. To give you an example imagine a store which can consume only 50 packs a day. If I supply 60 packs I lose 10 packs as wastage. If I supply 40 then it is an opportunity loss for me and the store. So I had to get the magic number of 50 right. When we started iD we focused on availability and supplied more. This resulted in huge wastage as high as 2425 per cent. We had to get the ideal mean between ensuring availability and minimizing unsold inventory.The founders then made their third fundamental decision. They started investing in technology. Musthafa’s information technology (IT) experience helped them to develop an application (app) to capture data on a real-time basis reducing their wastage by 1.6 per cent. In 2012 using a Nokia phone they started capturing store- item- and day-wise sales and wastage data. They then used data from the previous eight years to predict demand and plan their daily production accordingly to supply the magic number to the right store on the right day. Musthafa explained the use of technology as follows: Our day starts early when we ensure that batter is made seal-packed and loaded into chiller vans by 5:00 a.m. We supply this batter to stores across Bengaluru and other cities we operate in by 2:00 p.m. [at the] latest. We have geo-tagged every store and optimized the routes so that our representative reaches [them] in the shortest time. And to ensure that the salesman actually visits the store we invented geo-fencing. This means he has to reach the store to do a transaction. iD managed to create a large data bank through this process and reduce wastage. Previously 90 of the 100 packets it sent out to the market would come back unsold. When iD started sending out 4000 kg of batter 500 kg would come back. The company could not have grown a profitable business with such wastage. The mobile app helped iD track store-wise and item-wise sales and wastage data on a daily basis. The data helped the company to predict the right demand for a store on any given day. Musthafa proudly said Today with our intelligence-using technology my warehouse manager hands over the precise stock along with a pre-printed invoice to the DCS. This invoice is not based on a pre-order and is accurate 99 per cent of the time. Today in a matured city and [with] a matured product we run at less than 2 per cent wastage. Techies call it analytics we call it common sense. iD runs on IT. We have transformed into a logistics company besides being a fresh food company.As an entrepreneurial venture the company had faced challenges with raising capital in the initial years. Islamic religious principles forbade iD from taking loans. For the first 10 years then the company relied on re-ploughing its profits for financing its expansion plans. In 2014 iD raised ₹350 million from Helion Ventures Partners a venture capital fund to “modernize its [iD’s] factories expand its fleet and for marketing and R&D [research and development]” in addition to receiving mentoring support.The company also undertook aggressive distribution. As was attested by the chairman and managing director of an advisory firm “Wherever there are stores selling bread milk and butter you can find iD Fresh Food. They are not restricted to just the supermarkets. This has put them in pole position.”iD Tastes SuccessThe company grew its product portfolio to include curd and paneer in 2016 as well as other products such as ragi idli and dosa batter introduced in 2017 and its innovative vada batter and filter coffee decoction packs in September 2018 (see Exhibit 2). Simultaneously iD explored newer channels of delivery through partnerships with grocery delivery portals such as BigBasket Grofers DMart and others. Musthafa realized that while such portals were great for customers to order what they needed on demand online sales were still a small fraction of iD’s overall sales. The company which had relied on right product packaging right store placement and word of mouth in its initial days started in 2015 to communicate its success through mainstream media campaigns including print out-of-home and radio advertising. In 2017 iD raised US$25 million from Wipro Limited chairman Azim Premji’s family office PremjiInvest which led to PremjiInvest acquiring a 25 per cent stake in the company at iD’s valuation of US$100 million.In 2019 iD decided to launch an economical variant of the idli-dosa batter Daileez in the relatively price-sensitive smaller towns and rural areas. The primary objective of this flanker sub-brand was to create demand for quality products in markets that were traditionally considered as not being brand-conscious without damaging the existing flagship product. Daileez was launched at a price point of ₹49 for 1.2 kg as opposed to the regular variant priced at ₹70. In 2019 iD also launched its filter coffee decoction across 600 stores in the United States after receiving clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Between September 2018 and March 2019 the company earned ₹60 million through the sale of its coffee decoction pouches in India the UAE and the United States. The company aimed to achieve sales across 5000 US stores in six months and reach monthly revenues of about ₹10 million even as the Indian sales of coffee alone were expected to reach ₹3 billion by mid-2020. In February 2020 iD launched its tender coconut and fresh-grated coconut products. The grated coconut was put back in the coconut shell and sealed while the exterior of the tender coconut was shaved off to bring down its weight to only 600 grams. The company ended fiscal 2020 with a revenue of ₹2.5 billion of which 50 per cent came from the batter; 35 per cent from parottas which had a three-day shelf life; 10 per cent from cottage cheese; and 5 per cent from filter coffee decoction.Going OrganicIn March 2019 with its eye on sustainability iD announced its intent to transition into a completely organic brand. An industry chamber report published in 2018 had estimated the size of the organic products market to reach ₹871 million by 2021 up from ₹533 million in 2016 growing at a rate of 17 per cent. Such an increase was expected to be buoyed by trends such as “an expanding urban population base rising health concerns growing consumer spending on food products and deterioration of food quality.” iD wished to make organic foods mainstream starting with the Bengaluru market.An “organic” label came with challenges. A company could label its products as organic provided no chemicals had been used on the land for the previous three years. Organic farming itself posed further challenges: on the supply side a change in mindset was required for farmers to adopt the required bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers. This was made more complicated by the low yield associated with organic farming as well as a lack of certifying agencies in India. On the marketing side higher perceived prices of organic products leading to lower expected profits prevented the adoption of organic farming. iD partnered with three vendors who were working with over 1000 farmers and offered these farmers a 2530 per cent premium for the organic crops they grew. The company had been working on the requisite technology and supply chains to transform itself into an organic company for the past two years. The ingredients for iD’s products as well as its processesfrom suppliers to storage facilities and manufacturing unitshad all been made compliant with organic certification norms. It also obtained certifications from the Agricultural and Processed Foods Export Development Authority the National Programme for Organic Production the United States Department of Agriculture and Jaivik Bharat under the supervision of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.The organic food business itself posed three challenges: affordability availability and trust. Most organic foods were priced at a high premium of 8090 per cent compared to regular products. The availability of organic foods also posed a challenge as Musthafa explained: “Of the 65000 outlets selling food products in the Bengaluru market [fewer] than 1000 stores would have organic products available. Unless these products are made available the demand for organic won’t grow.” The final challenge was to ensure consumers trusted the claims of organic food and that the company met the need for adequate certification agencies that could provide credible certifications of organic.iD commenced its phase-wise transition of iD products into the organic mode by making its flagship batter Malabar parotta and wheat parotta available in the Bengaluru market. These products were available across 25000 stores with iD planning to increase this number by 10000 based on product demand. iD also planned to convert its other offerings into organic over the next year thereby converting 50 per cent of its consumers’ daily food intake into organic since it believed idlis chapatti and coffee constituted 2030 per cent of consumers’ daily consumption. The company also planned to offer the organic range at 25 per cent less than the price of the processed organic range available in the market at the time. Musthafa stated in an interview that iD would charge ₹80 for an organic parotta (the regular variant cost was ₹70) while there would be no change in the prices of the chapattis.India and the COVID-19 PandemicOn December 31 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) received an alert from China regarding several cases of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan a city in China with a population of 11 million with several of those infected reported as working at the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The market was closed on January 1 2020. On January 11 2020 China reported the first death due to the coronavirus a 61-year old man who had purchased goods from the seafood market.India’s first COVID-19 patient was reported on January 30 2020 who coincidentally was from the same state Kerala as the iD founders. The patient was a 20-year old medical student who had returned from the Wuhan district in China. Meanwhile on February 11 2020 the WHO announced that the disease caused by the new coronavirus would be called COVID-19. The new coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2. Exactly a month later on March 11 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 12 2020 India reported its first fatality due to COVID-19 when a 76-year-old man from Kalburgi Karnataka died.On March 22 2020 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a 14-hour voluntary lockdown—the “Janata curfew” (the people’s curfew). This was followed by a nation-wide lockdown imposed until April 14 2020 with only essential services kept outside the purview of the lockdown. By April 14 2020 more than 10000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in India and the lockdown was further extended to May 3 2020. The lockdown was further extended by two weeks on May 3 2020 and further extended again later until May 31 2020.At a press conference in May 2020 India’s central bank the Reserve Bank of India stated that the gross domestic product growth in fiscal year 20202021 was expected to remain in the negative territory with economic activityand as a result growthhaving slumped due to the lockdown. Most of the slump in economic activity on the demand side was on account of the drop in private consumption while on the supply side there had been contraction in the service sector even as agricultural growth offered a glimmer of hope.The COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to cause severe business disruption on a large scale impacting multiple stakeholders systemically with a long duration and intense velocity as it could spread like a market contagion and have long and severe cascading impacts. It could also lead to shortages in the availability of workers and infrastructure as companies would be impacted simultaneouslyin addition to being affected by changes in the behaviour of customers suppliers competitors and so on.The Ready-to-Cook Food Category amid COVID-19As the pandemic spread in India and as working from home became the norm consumers started seeking convenient food options even as there was a decline in eating out. A study by an Indian consulting company found there was a 60 per cent increase in consumer spending on home cooking during the pandemic. The ready-to-cook market in India which was at ₹21 billion in 2019 was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18 per cent to reach ₹48 billion by 2024 while the organized ready-to-eat category which was at ₹80 billion in 2019 was expected to double in the next five years.  iD’s competitors included companies such as MTR Foods and Maiyas in addition to a host of local players who had introduced a variety of breakfast mixes including idli and dosa as part of their offerings. Some of these companies such as MTR Foods had differentiated themselves by offering a range of breakfast mixes with the value proposition of being “easy-to-cook” and “instant” since they required only hot water to be added and would be ready in three minutes. The pandemic and the resultant opportunities led to the entry of new companies into the ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook categories including Jubilant Foodworks Veeba Foods Adani Wilmar Licious and Cure.fit. Amul one of the well-known Indian brands in the dairy industry entered the ready-to-cook segment with frozen products such as parottas patties and potato wedges even while it expanded its ready-to-eat portfolio. These frozen foods had been expanded across 6070 per cent of the company’s retail network. Companies like Adani Wilmar had entered the ready-to-cook category with competitive ready-to-cook products such as khichdi (porridge). Licious had entered both segments with its meat-based products and sought to tap modern trade storesbesides its own app and e-commerce platforms such as Dunzo Swiggy and Amazon Freshfor retailing its ready-to-eat products.Even traditionally the biggest challenge for the ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat categories was to maintain taste since these categories encompassed processed foods and depended heavily on the use of preservatives. One analyst explained the challenge as follows: “These companies have to match the individual taste preferences of consumers which vary throughout the country and at the same time keep economics in mind and do it profitably.” Another analyst had referred to the risk associated with the frozen foods category where temperature control was a challenge. Scaling up in the category was also difficult since doing so would require a lot of capital being a “fairly complicated category.” Managing Supply Chains iD had drawn on rural youth from across India to work in its manufacturing plants. A large part of its 2000-strong workforce had been with the company for a long time with the workforce being at iD an average of 6.5 years. It was important to put human resources policies in place to ensure that production carried on unhindered and that workers and other staff also felt safe psychologically.The iD team took many steps towards ensuring workforce safety and smooth production amid the pandemic. It created an air bubble for its manufacturing team to ensure their safety while at the same time implementing temperature screening sanitization of the premises and the use of masks and sanitizers by employees to ensure safety and hygiene. Health camps and one-on-one sessions were held from time to time by doctors and medical professionals at the units to promote awareness regarding the pandemic as well as to manage employees’ well-being. Such training involving workplace etiquette and safety measures was undertaken to prepare for the new normal.As an organization iD had to adapt to the changing reality to re-emerge stronger. Given the challenges in the procurement of raw materials and the transportation of products to some regions iD decided to scale down its production and provide only key products including idli-dosa batter parottas filter coffee decoction and paneer to limited stores in certain markets. iD stopped supplying to upcountry and smaller markets as this not only involved extra transportation time for logistics and distribution but also posed challenges for ensuring employee safety and well-being. Instead it decided to focus on the main cities and supply enough product to meet the increased demand for iD’s products keeping the interactions and exposure of its salesforce as minimal as possible. iD also decentralized the decision-making process in order to cope with the changing dynamics of each region. The COVID-19 pandemic had triggered layoffs and pay cuts across industries in India. The iD team could see that building a robust and responsive supply chain held the key to success especially during the pandemic and the uncertain times. This in turn depended on building the right human resources. The team decided to work on developing existing talent even as they minimized lateral hiring. Even as iD scaled down its production it decided against taking drastic measures such as job cuts or pay cuts as these would demotivate staff. A comprehensive insurance policy covering pandemics like COVID-19 was introduced for all employees. iD built a system of regular employee communication in order to keep morale high. The company also undertook initiatives to reskill employees through functional online training while at the same time encouraging staff to participate in cross-functional tasks and assignments which helped in reinvigorating teams in the organization.Delivering Trust and ConvenienceIn 2016 Musthafa had experimented with a “trust-based” model called Trust Shops which were unmanned kiosks launched on an experimental basis in four citiesBengaluru Chennai Hyderabad and Mumbai. Thirty-seven such trust kiosks were installed across apartment complexes and corporate offices in these four cities with people expected to deposit the exact value of the products and pick them up on their own (see Exhibit 3). There were challenges and malpractices however with people depositing fake currency coinseven Monopoly coins—to pick up the products. The experiment was continued for a year with the same shops displaying better results after a few months. In April 2020 amid the pandemic and with retail stores shut it was time for “Trust 2.0.” Musthafa spoke of the thought process behind this initiative: “We received a lot of calls from customers in Mumbai especially in the red zone areas saying that they were unable to step out of their homes to buy food.” With retail stores shut or open only for limited hours and with people fearful of going out or facing long waiting periods if they did step out iD realized that it would not be able to attend to such calls and consumer concerns given supply chain disruptions and shipping delays. The company decided to reach out to customers directly especially those living in gated communities without a grocery store or shopping complexes. The trust-based model experiment of 2016 was reinstated in 500 resident welfare associations (RWAs) across Mumbai alone. However there was a challenge with this. RWAs were not sure about being able to collect and reconcile payments from the large number of residents in these apartment complexes. Musthafa knew that with the lockdown trust was the only currency that would work. iD decided to trust the customers to pay for the products they had taken.The RWA representative would coordinate with iD and place the order on behalf of the residential society through WhatsApp or a phone call. Residents could collect the products upon delivery and pay at their convenience through e-wallets. The company based its relationship with each RWA and its members on trust with no calls for payment made to individual residents and no keeping tabs on how much each resident bought.Additionally given the overall supply chain issues iD realized that consumers were facing challenges in locating and purchasing the products. For this reason it rolled out a new feature on its website called the iD Store Finder. With this feature customers could easily identify open stores near them and find out the exact quantity of fresh iD products supplied on that day.iD also partnered with Supr Daily a subscription-based delivery service for daily consumable goods in Mumbai. This allowed consumers with Supr Daily subscriptions across Mumbai to place orders for iD batter and other products in advance so that the products could be delivered on the day they were required along with the milk delivered in the morning.Would iD’s product ideas logistics and distribution advantage and strong employee base help it in scripting a fresh story amid uncertainty? Would it be able to withstand the competition from existing and new players emerging in the ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat segments? How could iD reach its vision of becoming a ₹10-billion company by 2023 despite an economy ravaged by the pandemic?EXHIBIT 1: iD fresh food TIMELINENote: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹75.5132 on May 31 2020; CEO = chief executive officer; kg = kilograms; B2B = business to business.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: iD fresh food Product lineIdli-dosa batterRice rava idli batterWhole wheat parottaNaanRice idiyappamGarlic naanCurdRagi idli-dosa batterWhole wheat chapatisMalabar parottaMini parottaKulchaPaneer (cottage cheese)Tender coconutVada batterGrated coconutFilter coffee decoction Source: Company sources.EXHIBIT 3: TRUST KIOSKSSource: Company files.ENDNOTES

Bronconnier knew that to achieve this goal Calgary’s downtown core and the areas immediately adjacent would have to be rejuvenated and re-energized through redevelopment. The East Village area in particular was underutilized and often associated with urban blight. Located behind Bronconnier’s office in city hall the East Village had plenty of development potential given its proximity to downtown and the beautiful Bow River. However Bronconnier knew there were economic social and environmental issues that had to be addressed first—he could clearly see most of these from his office. While he believed it was possible to redevelop the area he could not help but be concerned that the most difficult task would be to convince Calgary City Council that it was time to act; and he wondered even if he did convince council members how could they ensure success this time around?  In 2001 the East Village was little more than a zone of containment for homeless shelters high-rise housing for low-income seniors and a wasteland of crime-ridden surface parking lots. The East Village had not always looked like this nor was its current state due to a lack of redevelopment efforts. Somehow half a century of improvement attempts had all failed. In 2007 Bronconnier had the finances in place to revitalize the East Village. With failure in the past how could he ensure that the attempt would be a success?CALGARY In 2017 Calgary in the western Canadian province of Alberta was a city of just over 1.2 million people. It was the third-largest municipality in Canada and had the second-highest number of corporate head offices largely due to its role as an administrative centre for the Canadian oil and gas industry. Although population growth had recently slowed due to an economic downturn the city had been among the fastest growing cities in Canada in recent years. Since 1996 Calgary’s population had grown from 767059 to 1235171—an average of just over 2.5 per cent per year. Calgary’s economy was characterized by boom and bust cycles attributed to the volatility of oil prices but recent booms had ensured that Calgary was generally prosperous. Households in Calgary had the highest median total income in Canada and close to 70 per cent of housing was owner-occupied. However not all areas of the city had participated in the prosperity and the East Village was a case in point.the EAST VILLAGECalgary’s East Village covered 49 acres (19.83 hectares) on the eastern side of the city’s downtown (see Exhibit 1). The neighbourhood was established when the Canadian Pacific Railway built a station west of Fort Calgary in 1883. Maps of the East Village from the beginning of the 1900s show a mixed-use community with commercial residential and industrial uses; it was essentially a small town largely serving the working class and the railway. Apartment and tenement buildings were built for men seeking employment in the city. Despite an economic boom that attracted these newcomers development began to slow down over the next decade and in 1912 a “homeless men problem” was mentioned for the first time. By the 1920s the automobile was competing with the streetcar and the demand for auto-related services increased. Mechanics’ garages and motor and machine shops sprung up in the East Village changing the physical environment toward being more industrial. After the Second World War the growth of the oil industry raised the standard of living in Calgary and suburban expansion away from the city’s core began. During this time many more of the designated residential uses in the East Village were converted to garages and to auto body auto parts glass and paint shops. By the early 1960s the East Village housed a variety of industrial and transportation uses as well as the city abattoir and cattle pens. The few residential uses remaining were overwhelmingly apartments and rooming houses as well as inexpensive single-room-occupancy hotels. In 1964 the area had the highest percentage of welfare caseloads in the city and several social agencies had by then increased their presence. The physical environment of the East Village had adapted to the evolving economy with more industrial sites but had concurrently become a place where the down-and-out could secure cheap accommodation in an undesirable part of town. Amendments to the National Housing Act in 1964 and to the Alberta Housing Act in 1965 culminated in an urban renewal scheme for the East Village. A 1966 report to Calgary City Council claimed that the renewal area comprised 20 per cent of the downtown core yet yielded only 4 per cent of downtown property revenues and contained 54 per cent of condemned buildings. Thus a master plan was put in place to remove “urban ills” from the East Village including what the City considered an undesirable population made up of mostly single unemployed men. Underused areas were to be replaced with parcels for private developers and civic purpose buildings many of which were later built on the western edge of the area. The unwanted population would be pushed out when their homes disappeared but no one gave any thought to where they would go. While a significant number of buildings were torn down for redevelopment they were not replaced by the time the urban renewal scheme was terminated in 1972.In 1978 a new proposed Downtown Plan envisioned the East Village as a residential community within the downtown characterized by a high-quality pedestrian environment and integrated public spaces. This concept for the East Village was next incorporated into the 1981 Downtown Area Redevelopment Plan which ultimately failed to be passed by the city council of the day and left the East Village underdeveloped once again. By 1985 the seemingly final blow to redevelopment of the area was the construction that year of the Calgary Municipal Building which faced west and opened onto a plaza designed for the 1988 Winter Olympics. City hall had—literally—turned its back to the East Village. Compounding this insult (intended or not) was the construction of a safety fence to prevent people from crossing the Light Rail Transit tracks that ran behind the municipal building along the western edge of the East Village leaving just a small passageway through which East Village residents could leave to enter the rest of downtown and return home. Later in 1990 another attempt at redevelopment surfaced through the proposed New Directions for the East Village plan where only 15 per cent of the area included residential uses. The New Directions plan envisioned a low- medium- and high-density residential area with affordable rental and owned housing for up to 5000 people. However this proposed plan was doomed for failure based on assertions that Calgarians’ preference for living in the suburbs combined with the shelters and dilapidated hotels of the East Village would make it impossible to attract residents. The plan had no political backing and never came to fruition. More than 10 years passed before another attempt at redevelopment was launched in 2002. Known as the Canal Project the plan envisioned a mixed-use dense and walkable community featuring a canal and pond. The Canal Project like its predecessors did not present a concrete strategy for the infrastructure improvements needed to spur private investment in the East Village nor did it involve any community engagement. It also blatantly ignored the social and environmental issues present in the area. Questionable land valuation processes further plagued the plan which ultimately also went nowhere. Each plan for revitalization had left the area stagnating and therefore worse off than it had been before. The result of 50 years of incomplete plans and unfinished fragmented development had left the East Village severely lacking vision and cohesion. There was no immediate solution in sight as the Canal Project had divided city council between those who felt that innovative municipal intervention was needed and those who felt the market should take care of itself. Mayor Bronconnier represented the first camp as he was well aware of the area’s complex history and recognized the need for environmental remediation. Bronconnier also knew that the lack of infrastructure made it unlikely that any private sector developer would take on the risk of a project of this scale and cost. The initiative would have to be led by the public sector but Bronconnier had to be strategic about how to approach the matter.POLITICAL WILL AND PLANNING CONTEXT When Bronconnier initiated another effort to develop the East Village in 2004 he received backlash for fighting what many believed was a losing battle. He brushed off the criticism and set himself to the task of creating a plan to finance the redevelopment effort. Bronconnier understood that investing in the East Village would not be popular with many of his colleagues or citizens but he also knew that delivering the best value for the City of Calgary in the long term was a priority. He would need to effectively communicate to council his vision for another try at redevelopment and convince the skeptics that his idea was not just another plan doomed to fail. It would be a long process and the initial scope would have to extend beyond the East Village. Thus Bronconnier embarked on creating a shared vision of a thriving downtown that would benefit all Calgarians with investment in the East Village as a worthwhile commitment to reaching that goal.The first step toward realizing this vision was the resuscitation of the East Village Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP) which dated back to 2001 and the ill-fated Canal Project. An ARP was a detailed planning document created by a municipality and adopted by city council to facilitate development and improvements in a specific area. The renewed version of the ARP for the East Village set out to “ensure that lands within the planning area be made ready and capable for redevelopment at the earliest opportunity.” The ARP was situated within the context of imagineCALGARY the city’s long-range urban sustainability plan developed in 2006. ImagineCALGARY was “a blueprint for a sustainable future . . . a community visioning and consultation process” involving input from 18000 residents. In other words imagineCalgary was a concrete plan for achieving the sustainable growth principles Bronconnier had been advocating for. After several revisions the East Village ARP was approved in March of 2005 (resulting in Bylaw 24P2004). In January 2007 city council also adopted the Sustainability Principles for Land Use and Mobility as set out in imagineCALGARY.Following the formalization of a strategy through the East Village ARP spring 2007 saw the release of the Rivers District Community Revitalization Plan (RDCRP). This plan outlined: 1) a comprehensive redevelopment plan for the East Village and surrounding areas to the south; 2) the economic social and environmental barriers to development; and 3) concrete solutions to deal with these issues. While the RDCRP would extend into two neighbouring areas the Beltline and Stampede Park (see Exhibit 2) primary investment would occur in the East Village. The RDCRP involved a public infrastructure program that would “facilitate the reclamation redevelopment and revitalization” of the area and would involve an innovative method of funding through a community revitalization levy (CRL). FINANCING THE RDCRPWhen Bronconnier and the City of Calgary’s Asset Management and Capital Works department were researching financing solutions used by cities that had taken on similar projects they noticed that many successful examples had involved tax increment financing (TIF). Dating back to 1952 in California TIF involved determining a catchment area that would provide the needed tax uplift to finance infrastructure improvements in a redeveloping area. The existing tax base was determined and scenarios were built to predict future tax revenue based on improvements through redevelopment. The assessed existing tax base became a baseline. Over time as city investment occurred any increments in taxes collected beyond the baseline were used to fund the investment in the area. TIFs were imposed for a set time frame (typically 20–25 years) with taxes reverting to the larger municipal pool when the TIF expired (see Exhibit 3).TIF schemes were long-term investments that could pay off in the appropriate circumstances. In a successful TIF setting the selected area was generally underutilized and it often required environmental remediation. In fact TIFs worked best for downtown mixed-use areas that had been neglected had seen limited (if any) private investment and had vacant land. The East Village met all the criteria. These criteria were also the reason why land developers had lost confidence over time that change could happen in the East Village and were unwilling to invest there. Bronconnier knew that if redevelopment was ever to happen public intervention and funding was needed. In the summer of 2004 he managed to convince council to direct City administration to look at TIFs as a way to finance the East Village. After careful research review of evidence-based case studies and the completion of financial analyses Bronconnier was prepared to argue that TIF was a viable option for the East Village. Bronconnier’s path toward council approval of this new financing tool however was not easy. In April 2005 council approved TIF as an urban revitalization tool and approved in principle the creation of a “special purpose vehicle” to implement it. However the scenario was hypothetical and Bronconnier knew that to succeed with the redevelopment they would need something concrete—and they had no Canadian examples to follow. Despite being used in almost all U.S. states TIF was a foreign concept in Canada. For this reason introduction of this type of financing tool required buy-in and facilitation from the provincial government which oversaw municipal affairs through the Municipal Government Act (MGA). When Bronconnier initially approached then Premier Ralph Klein in 2005 about using the mechanism Klein was open to exploring the idea. Having been a former mayor of Calgary Klein recognized that the East Village required stable funding over an extended period to get it off the ground. However Klein did not like the implications of the word “tax” and maintained that provincial legislation would need to be written and enacted to address this financing option to avoid potential misuse. For these reasons two things happened at the provincial level to facilitate the East Village TIF: 1) the province agreed to forgo a portion of its property tax revenues in the RDCRP to enable the City to leverage funds for infrastructure redevelopment and 2) the Alberta equivalent of a TIF would be named community revitalization levy (CRL). Because the City needed CA$135 million just to begin initial infrastructure upgrades (see Exhibit 4) this was a significant signal of support from the province.This new way of financing major infrastructure projects was possible through amendments to the MGA which the province of Alberta initiated after Bronconnier met with Premier Klein. The actual tool for achieving this was the CRL essentially a “technique for harnessing future revenues to pay for current expenditures.” A successful CRL would need to be supported by its own future cash flows meaning that predicted tax uplifts from redevelopment were critical to the City’s ability to pay back the upfront investment in infrastructure. Using an analysis of the external business environment—including economic trends in residential and commercial real estate interest rates and the strength of the Canadian dollar—the CRL was estimated to generate between CA$725 million (low scenario) and CA$1.166 billion (high scenario) over 20 years (see Exhibit 5). These calculations used for the CRL projected a viable working model even with the most pessimistic forecasting.Yet Bronconnier still had to consider what would happen if the revitalization effort were unsuccessful and the CRL failed to be economically viable a scenario that had not been uncommon south of the border. Bronconnier worried what would happen if this inaugural attempt at TIF through a CRL in Canada failed with Calgary’s East Village project. He knew that a CRL was not a sure win; what if the City had overestimated growth in land values or potential developer interest? The CRL hinged on private investment after the City of Calgary provided the necessary infrastructure for redevelopment. What would happen if there was not enough growth to support the CRL? Even worse what if Alberta’s oil-and-gas-dependent economy faced a disruption and slid into a bust cycle? Despite the careful calculations that had been considered to date Bronconnier felt more assurance was needed. Part of his concern focused on how to determine the geographic area that the CRL should cover. When drawing maps for TIF areas in the United States properties that had maximized their tax growth potential as well as institutional and government buildings were often excluded from modelling. Instead the focus was on the potential for development and the subsequent tax lift from the properties to be built. In the case of the East Village very little property tax revenue was generated from the area itself with it having just a few condominiums and small businesses. The rest of the East Village consisted of social housing not-for-profit organizations’ premises and municipal or provincial government uses which yielded little or no taxes. It would therefore be critical to create a catchment area that would invite interest from the private sector to build properties that would generate the needed tax lift.In this regard the City received a lucky break. In 2006 Encana Corporation announced plans for the construction of a skyscraper—to be known as “The Bow”—to serve as its corporate headquarters which would be located in the east end of downtown. It would be the tallest skyscraper in Western Canada and would produce millions of dollars in property taxes. While Bronconnier was aware that there were no guarantees in redevelopment scenarios he determined that including The Bow in the East Village CRL zone would be the next best thing. After making the case to city administration and his council colleagues The Bow development which broke ground in 2007 was officially included in the CRL zone in the RDCRP (see Exhibit 2). The ARP and RDCRP processes combined with financial modelling and risk assessment had produced a thorough analysis that supported the CRL. The financial groundwork had been laid and political support for the project had been established at the provincial level. Implementation of the CRL required new legislation policies and bylaws all of which were supported by public investment in the project. This signalled confidence that the East Village was worth the effort of redevelopment.As he stood in his office and looked out on the East Village below Bronconnier knew that he now had to educate his fellow city council members on the merits of the plan. In order to get their support he needed them to see not only the financial viability but also how the plan fit with the vision he had for a world-class city. Without their support the plan would suffer the same fate as the redevelopment plans that came before it and the residents of the East Village would be overlooked yet again. He knew this would be a defining moment for the City of Calgary. With one amendment the RDCRP was approved as part of Bylaw 27M2007 on April 16 2007. The approval of the RDCRP was a victory for Bronconnier and a testament to his dedication. He understood the significance of the decision he and his fellow council members had just made. By approving Bylaw 27M2007 they had introduced the first (ever) CRL in an Alberta municipality since the enabling MGA amendment came into place in 2005. The final vote was 12 to three in favour of the CRL with only one minor amendment to the motion. This meant he had strong support from council to revitalize a critical part of the city. With the financing tool in place to create the infrastructure necessary for revitalizing the East Village council’s next task was to determine how this infrastructure project should be managed. Skepticism was high as previous redevelopment efforts for the East Village had failed for a variety of reasons and it was strongly suggested that the City should not be responsible for implementing the RDCRP. With so much at stake financially for the City and reputation-wise for Bronconnier how could Bronconnier ensure that this attempt at redevelopment would be successful without the City’s direct involvement?EXHIBIT 1: LOCATION OF THE EAST VILLAGE RELATIVE TO DOWNTOWNSource: City of Calgary East Village Area Redevelopment Plan 10 2017 accessed July 5 2017. www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Documents/arp-asp/arp/east-village-arp.pdf.

Ltd. (Midea Group) He Xiangjian (He) retired as board chairman to focus solely on Midea Group’s holding company. This was He’s second voluntary retreat from a chairmanship: in 2009 He had handed over the chairman position of Guangdong Midea Electric Appliances Co. Ltd. (Midea EA) a former listed company controlled by Midea Group before the group’s overall listing in 2013. Midea Group was a white goods empire built by He over decades and the Midea brand led the home appliance industry. He’s successor was Fang Hongbo a 45-year-old professional manager and the former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Midea EA. Fang faced a grim situation as he took over the position: business performance was plummeting Midea Group was urgently in need of a strategic transformation senior management would likely resist taking orders from Fang and at a basic level the organization was overstaffed and ineffective. In addition many senior managers felt that He’s son would have been a better choice as successor to his father according to Chinese cultural traditions.Fang was worried about how to handle his new position. His duties would be much heavier than those he had faced after becoming chairman of Midea EA in 2009. He knew that even if he did his utmost for Midea Group’s growth he might not be able to count on the allegiance of all of its senior managers who had been equally competitive in the successor contest. If they did not listen to—or deliberately sabotaged—Fang’s commands his leadership could lead to adverse business results and wild accusations. Fang reflected and came to a grave realization: “Only hard operating data is convincing enough. It is high time the old operating model was changed. Changing business operations while keeping key staff stabilized will be challenging [but it is] imperative for Midea Group to thrive in the future.”Before THE SuccessionHe Xiangjian Founder of Midea GroupBorn in 1942 He was the founder of Midea Group. Before founding the company He was an undereducated but sophisticated serial entrepreneur struggling to fit into a social system that did not acknowledge private businesses or market economy. After China’s market was reformed and opened up in 1978 his business shifted from producing fan parts to producing fans and then air conditioners. In 1993 Midea EA went public as the first private listed company transformed from collective ownership in China. From 1990 to 1994 Midea EA was among the top three companies in China in terms of air conditioner sales. Building Business UnitsIn the 1990s every competitor in the white goods market tried to bring down opponents by executing significant price cuts; most firms stumbled with across-the-board losses. In 1996 Midea EA’s air conditioner sales dropped to seventh place in the industry. The company’s only profits that year came from outside investment returns. In painful reflection He believed the root of this decline was bureaucracy. At that time Midea Group had built five product lines (mainly air conditioners fans and electric cookers) accounting for hundreds of product models. All operating decisions were centrally made by the headquarters and that caused inefficiency. In 1997 He decided to reform the organization into five business units (BUs)—namely air conditioners home appliances air compressors electric motors and kitchenware—and gave each unit a high degree of autonomy. Business relationships between BUs were market oriented and transactional. Meanwhile the company appointed several professional managers as heads of these BUs. For example Fang was in charge of domestic sales of Midea Group’s air conditioner BU. The head office mainly focused on overall strategic decision-making and management control. In order to clarify the boundaries of power and responsibility Midea Group laid out principles in a “Manual of Power.” This became the foundation of many future structural changes.Taking the opportunity to enact organizational reform and power decentralization He persuaded some founding members of Midea Group (including his wife) to retire early and purposely reduced family influence in the company. He also retired from most daily operations. Young professional managers replaced old ones in key positions soon after. Since 1997 Midea Group’s executive team had only professional managers and no family members. He believed that talent was naturally attracted to the organization because of “appropriate incentives power separation and accountability systems in place.” However after decades of a centrally planned social system China did not have a mature talent market especially for professional managers. In fact almost all of Midea Group’s newly appointed managers were promoted from within.Fang Hongbo’s Career in Midea GroupIn 1992 25-year-old Fang joined Midea Group as an editor of the corporate magazine working in the president’s office. His talent was recognized by He who promoted Fang repeatedly over the next five years (see Exhibit 1). Fang recalled “I do feel he was purposely mentoring me. He often called me to his office and took out a small piece of paper full of things that he recorded about me. He would specifically talk to me about some of my indiscretions he saw including a bad speech or impulsive reflexes.” In 1997 He promoted Fang to oversee Midea EA’s biggest business—domestic sales of air conditioners. Most of the company’s senior managers objected to this appointment but He insisted that he wanted Fang to execute his customer-oriented marketing philosophy and a flat channel system. Fang helped Midea EA’s air conditioner sales regain the number-three position the next year with a 200 per cent growth rate. His success impressed He who commented “What gratifies me more than anything else is not sales growth but being right in seeing the potential in young people.” After this first victory Fang was soon promoted to even higher positions (see Exhibit 1). The Problem of Countless SubculturesFrom 2000 onward nearly all home appliance manufacturers chose to prioritize rapid expansion; through mergers and acquisitions they aspired to build the world’s largest production lines seek product diversification and grow further. Fang recalled “In 2004 Midea Group did not have refrigerator or washer businesses. In only five years’ time Midea Group was already able to rival Haier Group Co. Ltd. the market leader at that time in the home appliance market.” Meanwhile Midea Group’s organizational structure became complicated. Management determined that the ultimate reason for repetitive investment and lack of synergy was due to the large number of BUs. In 2004 the group added a new management layer—so-called “secondary groups”—to oversee the BUs. He intended to make Midea Group an investment holding group. Some powers previously held by BUs were centralized to these secondary groups creating higher positions for professional managers. From this point onward Midea Group’s structure included four tiers: Midea Group secondary groups (such as the listed company Midea EA) 25 business divisions and product companies. Every tier had functional departments and staff; He believed that such a structure reflected the horizontal and vertical power balance.The 2009 Succession: The Listed CompanyRumour in 2004Around the end of 2004 it was rumoured that Midea EA’s board of directors was about to change. He’s only son He Jianfeng (Jianfeng) was expected to become a board member soon. This rumour collapsed when He announced a group restructuring plan in 2004 which actually gave two professional managers even more power. Yet the media quickly gathered evidence to support a new theory that Jianfeng was aiming for the chairman position of the overall group rather than that of the listed company Midea EA.He Jianfeng and Infore GroupJianfeng started his own business Infore Group (Infore) in 1994. Infore was primarily concerned with manufacturing products for Midea Group. By 2002 Infore had seven subsidiaries with more than 5000 employees. The firm was regarded by outsiders as a training ground that He had prepared for Jianfeng because if Jianfeng eventually intended to join Midea Group he would be faced with many senior executives who might dwarf him in business decisions. However Jianfeng chose not to follow his father’s path of home appliance manufacturing and instead declared that his company would pursue business opportunities in the capital market in 2008. He also had two daughters He Qianchang (QC the elder daughter) and He Qianxing (QX). He and his daughters invested in Infore. QC and QX were running a moulding company and a new materials company. Both daughters were undertaking upstream business in relation to Midea Group. Meanwhile QX also ran an electronic device company. He had long felt that “Midea Group was never a family business. The company needs professional managers to sustain future growth.” In 2009 after Jianfeng declared the strategic change for Infore Group He’s thoughts became more crystallized as he confidently stated “CEOs of the group will all be professional managers and my family will always stay in the role of shareholder.”Succession on the Fast TrackOn August 26 2009 He resigned as chairman and director of Midea EA. Fang then vice-chairman and CEO of the company succeeded He as chairman of the board. From then on the board of Midea EA contained no members of the He family. This was the point in time when Midea EA completely entered into a “professional manager era” as dubbed by many professional managers. Fang was not surprised by his appointment as chairman. Ten years before He had told him “You need to look beyond the current position and shoulder more responsibilities in the days to come.” Fang clearly remembered He changed his wording to be more concrete but without specifying a time: “In the future I will hand this over to you.” The handover of Midea EA was timely because Midea Group was experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. The company’s growth-oriented strategy led to revenues of over CN¥100 billion for the first time in 2010. At that exciting point in time He (who was 68 at the time) announced a five-year plan to “recreate a new Midea.” The new plan involved realizing ¥200 billion revenue by 2015. Employees and managers were excited about this goal and began to develop new business areas and projects. A senior executive recalled “We thought the ¥200 billion target could easily be achieved before 2015.”Business Downturn and Transformation EffortsSetback in ExpansionAt the end of the second quarter of 2011 Midea Group experienced some disturbing financial results. For example in the first quarter of 2011 Midea EA’s sales revenue grew by 59 per cent but net profit only increased by 13.7 per cent. Internal analyses concluded that actual market demand did not show substantial growth. Overstocking channels with inventory and conducting price-cutting campaigns effectively ballooned revenue figures but these measures inevitably undermined Midea Group’s profitability. In addition many projects had been hastened into operations to boost revenue levels. Midea EA Leads the TransformationMidea EA under Fang’s leadership was the first branch to transform within Midea Group. In the second half of 2011 Fang proposed a new product upgrade strategy: making premium products to boost prices and the Midea brand image. However it was hard for the whole management team to transform its old mindset of producing basic products and recklessly cutting prices. The inefficient and unprofitable businesses within Midea EA caused year-over-year (YoY) growth of revenue and profits to slow. As chairman and CEO Fang was able to close them (see Exhibit 2). In the first half of 2012 the number of product models decreased from 22000 to 15000. Fang remembered “It was like if you didn’t cut off the infected arm you’d lose your life.” From 2010 to 2011 Midea EA cut its 100000 employees by one-third. Fang also streamlined the channel system. At the peak of scale expansion Midea EA had distributors in every county in China. When China’s policy of “home appliances outreach to the countryside” stopped neither distributors nor Midea EA saw profits.Midea EA began to integrate channels and changed key performance indicators in accordance with the new strategy. In the previous performance measurement system profit was not as important as revenue which created a giant company that could not generate value to shareholders. Since 2012 it was required that profit growth must be higher than revenue growth so that profit margins would rise. New products that could generate higher margins were developed while many lines of low-price products were reduced. The company started declining large orders of low-profit products which was alarming to some managers who firmly believed that no order should be dismissed. The 2012 Succession: Midea GroupLargely due to the increased efforts in the second half of 2011 Midea EA’s operating profits jumped by 96 per cent although its YoY revenue growth dropped by 24.9 per cent (see Exhibit 2). He was satisfied with Fang’s success and began to contemplate how to turn around Midea Group as a whole. But Fang was worried: he knew that Midea Group was encountering a bottleneck after years of growth and expansion (see Exhibit 3). Fang felt that Midea Group needed a leader powerful enough to press the brakes find another direction and regain high speed soon afterward. He would be the perfect person for that role but Fang also knew that the role would involve reducing the interests of very senior people—something He would not feel comfortable doing on his own. The HandoverIn the summer of 2012 He’s idea of complete retirement from all positions in Midea Group came to fruition. He summoned key executives and asked them to discuss how they felt about Fang. On August 25 2012 He officially handed over the whole group to Fang the new board chairman. At the farewell meeting He made it clear to all that he no longer wanted to be involved in any “daily affairs and meetings.” The newly announced board of directors included Fang Jianfeng six other professional managers and two representatives from strategic investors. Fang and the other six directors had been at Midea Group since the 1990s and had all been promoted by He (see Exhibit 4). According to a former executive He had been monitoring professional managers’ personal performance for over 10 years assigning independent tasks to them and observing the results so that he could identify his ideal successor.Preparations for the HandoverOverall ListingBefore handing the Group over to Fang He planned for an overall listing; first Midea EA would be delisted then all other businesses under the Midea Group but formerly outside Midea EA would be combined to form a packaged portfolio which would be a new overall listing. The added businesses included small household appliances electric motors and logistics services. Midea Group became the largest listed white goods company in China’s domestic stock exchange market surpassing the market capitalization of Haier Group and Gree Electric Appliances Inc. Group RestructuringHe also restructured the group before handing it over to Fang. He dismantled the four secondary groups and split them into 15 product BUs. Many powers and resources were centralized in the head office to realize synergies in finance supply chains sales channels storage and other resources. The disappearing secondary groups had been on the same level as Midea EA. After Fang became group chairman the president of the home appliance group (Huang Jian) and the head of the electric motor group (Cai Qiwu) were appointed president and vice-president respectively reporting to Fang; both had seats on the board of directors. In a media report a previous employee suspected that there would be difficulties between Fang and these two heads: “When He was still the figurehead of the company the professional managers looked up to him and listened to him. Now they needed to learn how to live in harmony under the current power structure; after all their positions are no longer in parallel like before.” However these appointments paved the way for Fang giving him actual authority over the whole Midea Group. Fang quickly clarified Midea Group’s future organizational guideline: a small head office and an integrated system.Stock Ownership PlansMidea Group’s 2012 performance figures looked grim. Revenue was just over ¥100 billion meaning ¥30 billion in revenue had evaporated compared to the previous year. Fang knew that the senior executives’ mindset had to change immediately to facilitate the new operating model that he was calling for and he would need to convince these executives using hard numbers rather than wordy explanations. Fang also knew that appropriate incentive plans needed to be in place for the change in strategy to work. The incentive system needed to be oriented toward future growth rather than based on immediate financial performance. 2007: The First Stock Ownership PlanSince 2007 Midea Group had been trying to raise senior executives’ personal salaries to international standards to reward the executives’ contributions toward the company’s rapid growth in past years. A virtual stock ownership plan was developed covering seven core executives including all heads of secondary groups and several functional department heads. When Midea Group completed its overall listing in 2013 these executives immediately became very wealthy (see Exhibit 5). Only five of them remained at Midea Group. Midea Group’s compensation structure adopted a “low basic salary high performance salary” pattern. The year-end bonus could be five times as much as the basic monthly salary and the company mostly distributed bonuses in cash. Midea Group managers’ overall pay level was admired by their peers working for competing firms. One Midea executive commented “We worked [very hard] to achieve performance targets so that we could get the bonus but many business analysts thought we were pushing next year’s business ahead of time and this practice lacked sustainability.” The 2007 stock ownership plan did not cover BU general managers—not even for the biggest BU which had greater revenue than a secondary group.Meisheng Plan When Midea Group’s structure changed to encompass 15 BUs in 2012 the group initiated a new stock ownership plan the “Meisheng (MS) Plan” to cover 47 BU general managers deputy general managers and some departmental heads in the head office. These executives co-founded a partnership to purchase 3 per cent of the pre-listing equity of Midea Group (diluted to 1.75 per cent after overall listing) from Midea Group’s holding company at book value (see Exhibit 6). Because the executives could sell their shares at market price after a three-year lock-up period starting from September 18 2013 the actual personal income from the MS Plan could be remarkably high. As one executive understood it “[He] used his own money to motivate us and thus we were able to lead a decent life. The stock ownership plan supplemented the existing cash incentive system and urged managers to look seriously at long-term growth.”Future Stock Ownership PlansFang believed long-term incentives should be extended to middle management. In 2014 and every year afterward Fang planned to launch a new plan that might cover up to 1000 middle managers. Fang realized that such an incentive plan would not satisfy everyone and might even hurt some feelings but he decided that BU heads would have to be able to identify key talents and motivate them using long-term incentive tools. Challenges for Fang HongboFang was very sure of the direction that Midea Group’s transformation would take but there was no guarantee that the group’s financial results would rebound immediately. There were already doubts circulating throughout the company: what if things did not turn around soon? Fang tried to keep calm and resolute. He knew that selling unprofitable businesses and laying off employees could turn the group inside out so he decided to move quickly before employees started to raise questions based on speculation and rumour.Activating ManagersFang recognized a lack of willingness to learn new things among some managers. Many managers also resisted change. Fang analyzed their collective mindset: “It usually takes several years for a manager to be promoted to director. After that their personal growth stagnates. They resist learning new concepts like Internet-based business models. They form small circles protect members and do not work with others.” On many occasions Fang reiterated to managers how the company should change to conform to the new era (e.g. with respect to e-commerce and customer orientation). For those who did not want to follow Fang was clear and direct about the consequences: “At this critical point in time you either change or go. . . . Whoever you are no matter how senior you are I’ll remove you if you can’t follow my lead. I don’t care if this means I have to lose the chairman title because of this.” In fact after the head office BU restructuring Fang’s former competitors (the other former secondary group heads) were gradually deprived of most of their authority. Fang knew that he had disrupted many people’s equanimity by streamlining businesses and firing people. He believed that the moment he took over at Midea Group certain people had already secretly decided to leave. But there was no turning back. Fang had to boost performance results or else he would fall into a very difficult position with everyone turning on him. What was troubling for Fang was that even if the streamlining initiative did boost efficiency revenue would still drop in the short term. He also knew that his tough approach was in sharp contrast to He’s genial and easy-going style. Fang might not have been a “people person” but he tried to let everyone know that while he had high expectations of his staff members they should not take his attitude personally. To show his solidarity with the other employees Fang refused to use the exclusive elevator and private dining room for executives and started to take the ordinary elevator wait in lines and have lunch in the cafeteria like everyone else. Facing He XiangjianFang thought he had to report major changes to the board of directors. After 20 years of service He and Fang were almost like father and son. Would the succession change the nature of their relationship? He left enough power and space for Fang to do what he needed to do. In fact He only attended meetings to listen to Fang’s updates twice a year. Jianfeng also had a seat on the board but like his father he seldom gave feedback. However Fang thought he needed to guard against developing any arrogance and self-importance. He doubted that he needed to redefine his relationship with He as that of “agent and owner.” The trust between them needed to be solidified rather than sabotaged by doubts that could be triggered by unexpected events. Fang believed he needed to act as professionally as possible by reporting to He periodically even though he rarely offered feedback.Fang tried to analyze the subtleness of his relationship with He: “Our relationship had dozens of years of trust as its foundation. But every second after my succession it could go sour if I did not attend to [all necessary] details. It was not a blood relationship after all. It was much weaker as it was employment based in nature.” At the same time Fang realized that this relationship was stronger than those between other professional managers. He commented “I had followed [He] since the beginning. His every look every move and even how he put his hands—I knew exactly what he was thinking. No outside CEOs would be able to do this. I don’t think this succession case is replicable in the future.” This realization prompted Fang to think about the next generation of Midea Group’s leaders: “The situation between me and the next generation of leaders might be a lot different than what [developed] between He and me.”Fang sometimes asked himself why he was taking on this new role. His increased authority had isolated him from his peers. Performance pressures the resistant management team and his complex relationship with the He family were all heavy burdens for Fang. Excluding equity gains Fang’s nominal annual salary was only half that of his previous position. Fang knew he was driven by the need to repay He saying “If only driven by personal interest I would not be able to lead the company further. I was very grateful that [He] had dug me up and made me extraordinary.”Change in Top ManagementIn October 2013 the resignation of one BU president Huang Jian shook the whole company. Employees traded internal details about how fierce the power struggle was among top managers. In April 2014 senior vice-president Huang Xiaoming also resigned and in July of the same year Cai Qiwu followed. Huang took a new position in Midea Holding. Under China’s stock exchange rules if managers resigned their shares from the MS Plan were locked until September 18 2016. It struck Fang that every manager who had participated in the 2013 MS Plan would become very wealthy in 2016. He had to design a new plan to motivate them when that time came. The MS Plan based on He’s personal contribution was not sustainable. New sources of incentive shares needed to be in place. New Business DirectionHe assigned Fang a hard task: “accelerating while looking for new exits” as Fang put it. Midea Group’s past success represented China’s competitive advantage in terms of low manufacturing costs. However China was at a turning point; its labour cost was rising quickly. Midea Group had to find a new core competency to replace low-cost production while at the same time maintaining fast growth. Fang had a term for the new strategy: “second track.” From 2013 to 2015 Midea Group chose to pursue a mobile strategy developing smart home appliances that could be controlled by mobile apps. Encouraging new businesses might represent the way forward for Midea Group but it could also complicate the firm’s motivation system. Fang needed to bear that consideration in mind when designing the new stock ownership plans. It seemed that too many things needed to be balanced to achieve sustainable success.Exhibit 1: Fang Hongbo’s CareerSource: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Midea EA—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2013 (in ¥)Note: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan; US$1=CN¥6.8 on January 1 2010; YoY = year over year.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 3: Midea Group—Key Financials 2005 to SECOND QUARTER of 2015 (in ¥)Source: Company materials.Exhibit 4: PROFILEs of KEY MIDEA EXECUTIVES Note: All of the above individuals were Chinese nationals with master’s-level educations.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 5: ExecutiveS’ ShareholdingS and Value When Midea Group ListedNote: Shareholding value based on issuing price of ¥44.56 per share.Source: Company materials.Exhibit 6: Midea HoldingMidea Investments Holding was founded on August 5 2002 with registered capital of CN¥330 million and only two natural-person shareholders: He Xiangjian holding 94.55% and He Xiangjian’s daughter-in-law Lu Deyan holding the remainder. This meant He Xiangjian’s family held 100% of Midea Holding. He Xiangjian became executive director of Midea Holding; his wife Liang Fengchai was supervisor; and Li Jianwei was manager. Midea Group Midea Real Estate and other secondary groups were subordinate to Midea Holding.

Sitting in the lounge of Toronto’s Pearson International Airport Youbin Leng the chairperson chief executive officer and president of Feihe International Inc. (Feihe) was reading a joint statement from the governments of Canada and the People’s Republic of China which communicated an open attitude toward direct investment. Leng was excited about the Canadian government’s desire to attract foreign investment. He and the executive team of Feihe were considering entering the Canadian market very soon. Leng was confident that internationalization would make Feihe one of the most widely known infant formula brands; however as he considered the cultural and institutional differences between China and Canada and the uncertainty involved in the Canadian–Chinese business relationship he wondered what would be the best way to enter the Canadian market. Should Feihe use a greenfield investment an acquisition or a joint venture? Feihe InternationalIn Chinese feihe meant “a flying crane” a symbol of auspice loyalty and longevity. Feihe was founded in 1962 in Qiqihar a city in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China which was famous for its habitat for red-crowned cranes. This company started as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) that manufactured milk powder. In the 1990s Youbin Leng joined the company and found that the company was growing slowly under the planned economy. In August 1996 it was incorporated as Feihe Dairy during a period of China’s nationwide SOE asset restructuring. Leng acquired a majority of equity in the company in 1998 and transformed Feihe into a privately owned company in 2001.Fifteen years later Feihe was headquartered in Beijing China. It became the largest domestic Chinese infant formula company and the third-largest dairy company operating in China (including both domestic and foreign brands). In 2016 Feihe had 16.9 per cent of retail sales in the domestic infant formula market and 7.7 per cent of retail sales in the overall infant formula market (including both domestic and foreign brands). The company earned revenue of ¥3724.4 million with a profit of ¥406.2 million (see Exhibit 1). It mainly manufactured infant formula but also produced adult milk powders liquid milk and soybean powders. It provided milk powder formulated from fresh milk for infants and children under six years old. In addition to producing cow milk infant formula Feihe was exploring the market for goat milk infant formula. Feihe’s principal products were high-end and regular infant formulas. Its high-end products included the award-winning Astrobaby premium infant formula. In 2017 Astrobaby won for the third consecutive year the International High Quality Trophy from Monde Selection in Belgium which served as an endorsement of Feihe’s product safety and premium quality. More importantly Feihe’s high-end products were very profitable. For 2014 2015 and 2016 Feihe’s overall gross profit margin was 47.8 per cent 55.3 per cent and 54.6 per cent respectively; and the gross profit margin for the high-end products was 60.2 per cent 68.5 per cent and 68.9 per cent respectively.The success of Feihe in China depended on its clear positioning in the market. Feihe had hired Junzhi Consulting to clarify its strategies as “producing the milk powder that is more suitable for Chinese babies.” More specifically it aimed to be “standing at the top of the industry to avoid the price war winning the consumers’ faith with the rise of brand strength and building competitiveness by focusing on resource acquisitions and corporate strengths development.”Aligned with the strategic positioning Feihe successfully managed its supply chain. The infant formula industry had a long value chain and the price and quality of the raw materials were two primary factors that affected the operation of dairy enterprises. Feihe’s supply chain gave it control over the entire production process including choosing the raw materials implementing its unique processing technology enforcing its strict inspection system and accessing diversified suppliers.As for the choosing of raw materials Feihe differentiated itself from most domestic brands by using fresh milk as the main ingredient in all its infant formula products. Depending on individual brands’ strategies both milk powder and fresh milk could be used as raw materials for producing infant formulas; however many Chinese customers believed that using fresh milk maintained the most nutrients in infant formula. Complementary to the use of fresh milk Feihe exclusively used the wet blending–spray drying process to manufacture its infant formula products. Compared with a dry blending process the resulting products were more water-soluble the nutrients were more uniformly distributed throughout each batch and the powder particle size and colour were more consistent. In 2016 Feihe’s fresh milk procurement costs amounted to ¥569.9 million 33.7 per cent of the sales revenue. To ensure freshness and timely delivery Feihe had spent 10 years building a vertical supply chain that included the cultivation of cattle feed large-scale dairy farming production and processing logistics warehousing channel control and after-sales service. The major farms in Feihe’s supply chain were along the 47th parallel north which the dairy industry regarded as the “world gold milk source” because of its climate conditions and natural environment.Feihe ensured the quality of its raw materials through an overall quality control system comprising 25 comprehensive procedures and more than 300 checkpoints from the inspection of feed in the whole production process to the delivery of finished products. The company designed highly automated production lines and procured advanced equipment and machinery to decrease risks of both contamination and human error while increasing production.The company’s main suppliers were dairy farms close to Feihe’s production facilities which was aligned with the Chinese government policies to support the local smaller-scale milk suppliers. Its exclusive suppliers included internationally accredited farms in Gannan and Kedong which housed approximately 45900 Australian Holstein cows. The largest supplier was YST Dairy Farm Ltd. (YST) in Heilongjiang Province. In 2016 fresh milk purchased from YST accounted for 80.1 per cent of the company’s total procurement cost at a cost of ¥456.4 million. Although Feihe had 25 other raw material suppliers its business and operations were highly dependent on fresh milk from YST. Besides fresh milk Feihe also procured a variety of other ingredients for its infant formula production such as whey protein powder and non-fat milk powder which were generally procured from domestic trading companies and international suppliers including powder manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand. Feihe also had its own milk collection stations production facilities and an extensive distribution network throughout China. Thus the majority of Feihe’s production facilities were within a 30-minute drive of the milk suppliers which enabled the company to process milk quickly to ensure freshness and better quality.Feihe’s diversification of suppliers ensured the stability of raw materials sourcing. However due to increasing costs of land water and labour resources the overall costs of feed and fodder were rising in China. Thus upstream processors such as Feihe suffered from the high costs and price volatility of raw materials.The Chinese Dairy SectorIn 2008 a milk scandal had seriously damaged the Chinese infant formula sector. During this food safety incident dairy products including infant formula and other food products from China were adulterated with melamine which killed six infants and sickened 300000 others. Although Feihe was not one of the brands involved this scandal damaged the whole domestic dairy industry by eroding consumers’ trust in Chinese domestic dairy brands.After 2008 the Chinese dairy sector had stepped into a reforming stage when more and more domestic and foreign brands were emerging. The domestic dairy companies continuously optimized their management systems improved food quality and participated in global competition. Although the safety issues of domestic dairy products were eliminated consumers’ safety concerns and trust were still the biggest challenges to the recovery of the industry. Due to the loss of consumers’ trust in domestic dairy products China became a net importer of dairy products and the trade deficit in this sector increased each year. China’s percentage of imported dairy products increased from 5.2 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2010 and 27.0 per cent in 2014. In 2016 China’s main dairy imports were milk powder products mostly from New Zealand but also from Australia the United States France Germany and Canada (see Exhibit 2). From 2008 to 2017 China’s imports of dairy products and infant formula had increased 3.62 times and 3.80 times respectively. The Chinese dairy sector failed to quickly recover from the scandal not only because of safety concerns but also for three other reasons. First the production costs of domestic milk powder were higher than the production costs for imported milk powder due to China’s limitations in terms of agricultural land clean water and cattle resources. At the same time the price of the dutiable imported dairy products was significantly lower than the price of domestic dairy products. Second Chinese consumers’ purchasing habits were being shaped by an e-commerce boom in China resulting in more online sales and cross-border purchases which enabled foreign infant formula to pour into the domestic market. Finally to satisfy consumers and obtain high profits some manufacturers chose to register their brands overseas but produce domestically or to label their products “imported with original packaging” or “100% foreign milk source” which contributed to a disorderly and competitive marketing environment.However domestic producers also had opportunities. First with the relaxing of the one-child policy the demand for infant formula was increasing. According to AskCI Consulting Co. Ltd. the retail sales value of the infant formula market increased from ¥63.7 billion in 2012 to ¥84.4 billion in 2016 and its sales volume increased from 375000 tonnes in 2012 to 465800 tonnes in 2016. Observers estimated that the market growth would continue as a result of the government supports for the dairy sector increasing industry concentration and the implementation of the universal two-child policy.Second the demand for goat milk infant formula was increasing in China. One reason was that some Chinese infants suffered from lactose intolerance or other cow protein allergies so that the parents preferred to source goat milk powder for their babies. These parents were willing to pay a premium price for goat milk infant formula. Many domestic infant formula milk producers including Feihe were trying to develop their goat milk production lines after 2013 and some industry experts estimated that goat milk infant formula would be the next high-end star product in the Chinese infant formula industry.Third in 2016 China announced a new regulation that required all infant formula manufacturers to register the ingredients in their brands before selling in China. The regulation aimed to increase the market concentration of the infant formula market and would likely drive some small brands out of the market while the major domestic dairy companies would benefit from this new policy. Fourth supported by the Chinese government the dairy sector had entered into a period of rapid revolution after 2008 with massive mergers and acquisitions and internationalization. The leading domestic dairy enterprises began to invest in farms and plants and to collaborate with strategic partners overseas. Through this internationalizing approach domestic firms introduced high-quality foreign milk products into China to meet domestic consumer demand and improve their brands’ reputations and competitiveness. Internationalization strategies became an important part of the Chinese dairy sector’s market expansion.The Internationalization of Chinese Infant Formula CompaniesIn 2016 China had a total of 103 infant formula companies which produced approximately 725700 tonnes of powdered infant formula. Major domestic infant formula brands grew to 45.5 per cent of the Chinese infant formula market in 2016 from 41 per cent in 2012 and were estimated to reach 48 per cent by 2021. The industry was dominated by 10 big players that together held a concentration ratio of almost 80 per cent. Among them eight companies—Yili Inc.; Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd.; Bright Dairy & Food Co. Ltd.; Want China Holding Limited; Shijiazhuang Junlebao Dairy Co. Ltd.; Nestlé China; Feihe Dairy; and Beijing Sanyuan Foods Co. Ltd.—accounted for 51 per cent of the infant formula market’s total production and 54 per cent of its sales (see Exhibit 3).All of these major Chinese dairy companies had started to expand overseas. Yili Industrial Group Co. Ltd. (Yili) from Inner Mongolia which was one of the forerunners among the Chinese dairy enterprises began internationalization in 2007 and accelerated the process after 2013 by seeking high-quality low-cost destinations. Within two years Yili had successfully established a global supply chain covering Europe Asia America and Oceania. Yili’s production plant in Waimate New Zealand was the company’s flagship international innovation project. The plant was the world’s largest integrated dairy facility to date; it included research and development (R&D) production deep processing packaging and manufacturing facilities and represented an investment of US$600 million—a new record for economic co-operation between China and New Zealand. China’s Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd. (Mengniu) another leading dairy enterprise in China moved relatively slow. In June 2013 it acquired Yashili International Holdings Ltd. for HK$12.4 billion obtaining two infant formula brands Yashili and Scient. Yashili a wholly owned subsidiary expanded overseas as part of Mengniu’s internationalization strategy. Construction of Yashili’s New Zealand plant—a NZ$220 million investment—began in July 2012. The plant was expected to have an annual output of approximately 47174 tonnes of infant formula. In April 2017 Mengniu signed an agreement with several large farms in New Zealand to supply its Deluxe milk line; it aimed to develop a joint strategy that would include its supply chain and dairy processing. Mengniu also entered into strategic co-operative arrangements with several leading international dairy enterprises including Arla Foods based in Denmark and Danone based in France.The Biostime International Holdings Ltd. (Biostime) another major infant formula producer in China had a long history of collaborating with French strategic partners in seeking milk resources. In 2013 Biostime and Isigny Sainte-Mère a leading French dairy brand signed an agreement to expand their infant formula production capacity. On June 12 2015 the company’s French infant formula plant became operational through a €65 million investment; Biostime’s investment accounted for €20 million. The 40000-square-metre plant was designed to process approximately 45359 tonnes of infant formula by 2018. Another Chinese leading infant formula producer Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co. Ltd. (Beingmate) invested ¥170 million to set up a subsidiary in Ireland in 2013 for R&D production and sales of infant formula and related products. In 2015 Fonterra Brands (Australia) Pty. Ltd. the dairy giant from New Zealand acquired Beingmate which enabled Beingmate to acquire 51 per cent equity in Darnum another processor under that group’s umbrella. The company thus formed an unincorporated joint venture with Fonterra and established an infant formula production plant in Victoria Australia.Acquisition was a widely used strategy in the Chinese dairy sector. Bright a leading brand in southeast China with a 100-year history divided its international acquisition and strategic alliance strategy into three steps. First it acquired 51 per cent of the New Zealand New Wright Dairy in August 2010 for NZ$82 million. Second it started a strategic co-operation with the Australian Pactum Dairy Group in April 2014. Third it acquired full control of Tnuva the largest integrated food enterprise in Israel in June 2015. Another high-end brand Ausnutria Dairy Corporation Ltd. (Ausnutria) used a similar strategy by acquiring 51 per cent equity in the Dutch company Hyproca Dairy Group (Hyproca) with equity exchange and cash in 2011. This acquisition provided stable milk resources and production plants in Europe and thus developed Ausnutria’s experience in farm management resource control R&D technology and quality system design which improved the company’s operation. In July 2013 Ausnutria acquired 100 per cent equity in Hyproca and aimed to develop its production capacity further in the high-end market.But internationalization could be risky. For example in 2012 another infant formula producer Synutra International Inc. (Synutra) signed an agreement with Sodiaal International SA the largest French dairy company and invested €90 million to build a new modern infant formula plant with an annual capacity of approximately 90718 tonnes. However in 2016 it was reported that Synutra was unable to pay its bills because of its undesirable sale of French products in China. Canada’s Dairy IndustryCanada’s dairy sector was an important and growing part in the Canadian economy (see Exhibit 4). According to the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) the dairy industry was Canada’s third-largest agricultural sector (behind grains oilseeds and red meats) and contributed significantly to the Canadian economy. It employed approximately 221000 people in 2015 contributed about CA$19.9 billion each year to Canada’s gross domestic product and remitted CA$3.8 billion each year in federal provincial and regional taxes. In 2016 it generated CA$6.17 billion in net receipts and employed approximately 22900 workers in dairy processing alone. Canada had developed a system to ensure the quality of dairy products and its strict quality standards resulted in the great reputation of Canadian dairy products. A wide range of institutions including the federal government departments regulatory bodies and advocacy groups supported the implementation of these standards. For example the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of dairy products both exported from and imported to Canada through the establishment of dairy product standards and grades dairy plant inspections packaging and labelling requirements regulations animal health programs and product safety monitoring. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada worked with farmers and producers to enact dairy policy conduct research assist market and rural development and help with the livestock improvement. The Dairy Farmers of Canada also developed the Canadian Quality Milk Program which provided guidance for dairy producers to improve food safety management in dairy farms.Although the Canadian dairy industry occupied an important position in Canada its output was relatively low compared with that of other major countries. In 2016 Canada’s milk production was approximately 8 million tonnes which was significantly lower than production in New Zealand (approximately 21 million tonnes) the European Union (approximately 221 million tonnes) or the United States (approximately 96 million tonnes). Because of its relatively small population Canada was able to meet its domestic requirements with its milk and dairy production but the country was not very active in the international dairy trade (see Exhibit 5). From 2007 to 2016 Canada’s exports and imports of dairy products both increased but imports were consistently higher than exports leading to a deficit each year. In 2016 the country imported 233560 tonnes of dairy products valued at CA$969.4 million representing an 8 per cent growth rate; it exported 98758 tonnes valued at CA$235.3 million representing an 11 per cent growth rate. The Supply Management SystemOne important reason for Canada’s smaller scale of dairy production and deficit was the unique Canadian Supply Management System monitored by Dairy Farmers of Canada. This system aimed to stabilize producers’ revenues and consumer prices and to avoid costly product surpluses through “three pillars” namely setting production quotas managing minimum prices and controlling imports. Every year the Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee looked at yearly demand to determine the production and supply quotas of milk for each province and to set a minimum price for milk. This system led to three notable outcomes: it kept foreign products out through its high tariffs beyond the quota; Canadian producers and consumers avoided unpredictable price fluctuations; and the sustainability of this sector was ensured so that producers did not need a government subsidy as producers did in other countries. However this system was also criticized for trade protectionism. Since the dairy industry was not covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) it became a target of the NAFTA renegotiation between the United States and Canada. The Canadian government also attempted to expand similar protections to other milk ingredients by implementing a new price class Class 7 to lower the price paid by domestic producers which angered not only the US producers but also producers from Australia the European Union Mexico and New Zealand who were driven out from the Canadian dairy market by this policy. As an opinion piece from the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy noted such protection had “resulted in low Foreign Direct Investment to the Canadian dairy sector. Of the [US]$21 billion invested globally into the dairy sector Canada attracted a minuscule amount—less than one per cent.” Dairy Industry in OntarioThe majority (approximately 82 per cent) of Canada’s dairy farms were in Ontario and Quebec approximately 12 per cent were in Western Canada and just over 5 per cent were in the Atlantic provinces. Ontario’s share of the total Canadian milk market was approximately 32.0 per cent with 2.77 million litres of milk produced in 2016. Ontario had 3705 dairy farms and 72 dairy processing plants that supplied and processed not only raw milk but also all the other milk products. Ontario was also a major goat milk production base with 52 per cent of Canada’s goats and 36 per cent of Canada’s goat farms. According to Ontario Farmer magazine “There were 240 goat milk producers licensed by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs in 2015. The Ministry licenced 22 new producers in 2014 and 35 in 2015. There were already 24 new producers ‘pending’ in 2016 ‘in all ranges of farm size.’”Feihe’s INTERNAtionaLIZATIONThe Chinese customers’ awareness of product quality and safety had been increasing since the milk scandal in 2008 that had involved Sanlu the producer responsible for the tainted infant formula. Many Chinese customers were willing to buy foreign products to ensure food safety for their babies. As a result the Chinese market was currently dominated by international brands but domestic brands including Feihe were attempting to catch up by increasing their investments in raw material sourcing and technology.Feihe aimed to compete with international brands on both quality and price. It seized a chance to grow in the domestic market after the falling of Sanlu in 2008. In 2016 it beat foreign brands in 10 provinces of China. Also the company noticed that since 2012 the high-end infant formula segment in China had increased from a sales value of ¥19.9 billion (31.2 per cent of the overall market) and was expected to reach ¥66.4 billion by 2021. Although Feihe had begun its internationalization strategy as early as 2005 when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange it did not have any foreign manufacturing plants. Further it delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2013 to free more capital for domestic mergers. However Feihe needed more suppliers of low-cost high-quality raw materials to satisfy the growing demands in China. To support its internationalization strategy the company positioned its brand as “more suitable for Chinese babies” and spent ¥13.8 million in R&D in collaboration with international research institutions including the Feihe Nutrition Laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre at Harvard Medical School in 2016. Feihe then filed its initial public offering application with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May 2017 which indicated that the company was trying to obtain more capital and secure its leading market position in China. However since this company had not yet been listed it still lacked sufficient capital for a large investment. In November 2015 Feihe announced a plan to invest US$100 million in building an intelligent plant with an annual output of approximately 45359 tonnes of milk powder in California. However it soon found that due to the local laws and policy restrictions in the United States it might not be the perfect match for Feihe.Kingston’s AmbitionThe year 2016 was a milestone in the history of China–Canada relations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the G20 leaders’ summit in Hangzhou China; and only a couple of weeks later Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Canada for four days—the first Chinese Premier to do so in 13 years. The two leaders issued a joint statement to encourage more co-operation between their countries.It was exactly at this time—“a time to nurture cooperation” between these two countries—that Feihe targeted the Canadian market. Canada’s three largest dairy processors—Saputo Inc. Agropur Cooperative and Parmalat Canada—processed approximately 80 per cent of Canada’s raw milk and did not have a clear strategy on infant formula or tapping international markets. To attract more capital and diversity the CDC started to search for an infant formula processor in Europe or Asia. Kingston a city on the eastern end of Lake Ontario was chosen as a potential location. In June 2016 Feihe invited a small delegation from the Kingston Economic Development Corporation (KEDCO) to China to help celebrate its anniversary and this trip provided an opportunity for the city to forge a new relationship with this potential investor.Kingston was recognized by the London (UK) Financial Times 2017–2018 publication on “American Cities of the Future;” was the winner of “Small Cities in North America for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy;” and was rated sixth in the category of “Small City for Human Capital and Lifestyle.” While economic growth in 2016 was more robust outside the Kingston metropolitan area Kingston had a population of 167965 and a well-educated labour force of approximately 91000. It had access to an effective transportation system composed of highways railways and air transportation integrated with US networks which enabled passengers and cargo to conveniently arrive at major North American cities. Kingston also had four well-organized business parks with complete facilities infrastructure and was close to major highways and downtown.Another advantage of Kingston was that it had the support of KEDCO. Established in 1998 KEDCO was a not-for-profit agency providing sales and marketing for the City of Kingston. It facilitated investment and job creation. In its 2015–2020 strategic plan KEDCO aimed to reposition the city as an agri-business centre by focusing on food processing technology and sustainable agriculture. To achieve this goal KEDCO assisted enterprises in applying for funding and determining which programs and services would best meet their needs. The funding programs were supported by both provincial and federal governments and included two five-year federal programs to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture agri-food and agriculturally based product sectors in domestic and international markets which were in operation until 2019 with total funding of CA$391.3 million; a CA$5 million funding program offered by the Ontario provincial government for food and beverage processing; a development fund for economic development in eastern Ontario; and an innovation fund to help the agriculture sector adapt to the global and domestic market environment. Next StepsMost of Feihe’s competitors had invested in New Zealand and Australia; Canada was not a traditionally popular investment destination for the Chinese dairy giants. In addition Canada had not had an infant formula processor in the country in the past 20 years. Kingston was fuelled by the investment and ready for its ambitious plan. Any major dairy country would envy a large inward foreign direct investment in the competitive global market. At the same time Feihe was already on track for internationalization and was highly interested in investing in Canada. The question was: How could Leng formulate a best entry strategic plan for Feihe?Exhibit 1: Feihe Financial Data For the year ended December 31 (in ¥ thousands)Note: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1.00 = ¥6.94 on December 30 2016Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: 2016 China’s Milk Powder Imports by Country of OriginSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China The Chinese Dairy Yearbook 2017 [in Chinese] (Beijing China: China Agriculture Press 2017) 436–437.Exhibit 3: Top 15 Dairy Companies in ChinaNote: ¥ = CNY = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1.00 = ¥6.94 on December 30 2016.Source: Kungang Song “The Dairy Industry Review in 2016 and Focus in 2017” [in Chinese] China Dairy Industry Newsletter September 2017 accessed October 4 2017 www.cdia.org.cn/down.php?name=uploads/pdf/1510292756.pdf.Exhibit 4: Canada Milk Production 2007–2016Source: “Milk Volumes and Components” Canadian Dairy Information Centre Government of Canada February 23 2018 accessed Oct 10 2018 www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/index_e.php?s1=dff-fcil&s2=msp-lpl&s3=hmp-phl&page=histprod.Exhibit 5: 2016 Canadian Exports of Dairy Products by Region Source: “D033Y Canadian Imports / Exports of Dairy Products (Year)” Canadian Dairy Information Centre Government of Canada accessed October 10 2018 aimis-simia-cdic-ccil.agr.gc.ca/rp/index-eng.cfm?action=rR&pdctc=&r=166.endnotes

Over the previous couple of years major private equity (PE) investors�namely JP Morgan Mauritius Holdings IV Limited (JPMorgan) Ashoka Investment Holdings Limited (Ashoka) and Ambadevi Mauritius Holding Limited (Ambadevi)�had been contemplating reducing their stake in NH. Taking the company public would provide an exit opportunity to the PE investors whose ultimate objective was to realize returns by exiting from their investments at the end of the investment cycle.Relying on NH�s robust business model PE investors had invested heavily in Narayana Health in 2008 and also subsequently in 2014 which helped the company in expanding its network. Generally PE investors invest for a period of three to seven years in a company and eventually exit from the investment at the opportune time. Though there were catastrophic events happening in the finance sector around the world prospects for the company in India in 2015 were good with a stable stock market and the Indian economy rising at a decent pace after several years of lacklustre growth. The first half of 2015 witnessed increased initial public offering (IPO) activity driven by an enhanced need for companies to raise capital in light of the economic recovery and private equity-backed companies trying to provide an exit route for their investors by capitalizing on the positive sentiments of the market.After consultation with stakeholders�namely the board of directors promoters (founders) and management�PE investors of the company decided to go for an IPO through the �offer for sale� (OFS) route where existing shareholders would sell their shares in the primary market and the company would not receive any proceeds from the offer. The OFS would allow selling shareholders to realize a return on their investment. Given the preparedness of NH and the current state of the Indian economy PE investors had to decide the value of the IPO and whether the time was appropriate for NH to go public.MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONSIn financial year (FY) 2014�2015 the Indian economy grew by 7.3 per cent and it was projected to grow at 7.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent in FY 2015�2016 and FY 2016�2017 respectively by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). India�s FY 2016�2017 growth rate projection surpassed China�s projection and made it the fastest-growing major economy. As of 2014 data of the World Bank India was ranked as the ninth-largest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $2 trillion but in terms of per capita GDP India was ranked very low at 127th among 199 countries.In 2014 global crude oil prices fell to $57.33 per barrel registering a 47 per cent decline in the global market and they were expected to drop further to $30 per barrel by the end of 2015. This significant drop in crude oil prices had a positive impact on the Indian economy because India imported approximately 80 per cent of its oil requirements. Sectors like information technology healthcare telecom infrastructure and retail were key to the growth of the economy. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde had famously noted India as a �bright spot� in the world economy.THE INDIAN HEALTHCARE INDUSTRYAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) India�s total expenditure on healthcare was only 4�per cent of its GDP compared to developed countries like the United States which spent 18 per cent of its GDP. In 2013 annual expenditure on health was just $215 per capita. In terms of revenue and employment healthcare had become one of India�s largest sectors. The Indian healthcare industry was worth $100 billion and it was expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 22.9 per cent to $280 billion by 2020.According to a FICCI�KPMG 2015 report called Healthcare: The Neglected GDP Driver a robust healthcare system drove the GDP growth of an economy and also helped in employment generation and provided opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship. Indian healthcare was not yet capable of handling an increasing number of lifestyle diseases. It required private players to invest in rural areas where scope and opportunity of investment lay. The telemedicine market on the other hand which had been able to provide increased access to healthcare services at a much lower cost was expected to grow to $32 million by 2020 from the current level of $15 million.Life expectancy at birth of people in India had increased from 41.38 years in 1960 to 68 years in 2014. Healthcare played a major contribution in achieving this feat; however with the increase in life expectancy at birth people required healthcare access for a longer period of time. However several challenges remained. The lack of quality healthcare programs in rural India the growth of the health insurance market a growing pharmaceutical sector and an underdeveloped medical devices sector made the Indian healthcare industry a potential investment destination for private players and investors. An increase in the ageing population a rise in the income of the middle class and an increase in sedentary lifestyles that gave rise to lifestyle diseases also reflected the potential for the future growth of the Indian healthcare industry. According to the World Economic Forum and the Harvard School of Public Health using their EPIC model it was estimated that India would incur a loss of $5 trillion between 2012 and 2030 due to noncommunicable diseases. The creation of healthcare infrastructure especially in rural areas was required to provide affordable healthcare to people and to ensure inclusive growth of the country.Under WHO guidelines 3.5 beds per 1000 people was the minimum requirement for the healthcare sector; India which accounted for 21 per cent of world diseases had just 1.3 beds per 1000 people and 0.702 doctors per 1000 people. The number of doctors and beds was insufficient to meet the demand for healthcare services; India would require at least 100000 additional beds and approximately $50 billion in investment to fulfil its demand. The healthcare system in India was in dire need of investment from domestic as well as foreign private players.CompetitorsApollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. (AHEL) and Fortis Healthcare Ltd. (FHL) were the top two private-sector firms by size in the industry apart from government-owned hospitals which were not-for-profit (see Exhibit 1). AHEL reported the highest revenue among industry peers with a total of _46380.70 million. AHEL and FHL were considered to be the main competitors (see Exhibits 2 and 3) of Narayana Health in the healthcare industry and their enterprise value (EV) was estimated to be _203330.97 million and _87474.27 million respectively. On March 31 2015 AHEL and FHL stocks were trading at _1365.45 and _164.55 per share respectively.NARAYANA HEALTHNarayana Health was established with 225 operational beds in 2000 in Bengaluru India by Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty a renowned cardiac surgeon. By the end of August 2015 Narayana Health had a network of 23 hospitals eight heart centres and 24 primary-care facilities across a total of 31 cities towns and villages in India with 5442 operational beds. Dr. Shetty had approximately 33 years of experience as a cardiac surgeon. He had worked at Guy�s Hospital in London England Birla Heart Research Centre in Kolkata and the Manipal Heart Foundation in Bangalore India before establishing Narayana Health and becoming an entrepreneur himself.Dr. Shetty had always had a fear of losing his mother during his childhood; the recurrent illness of his own parents inspired him to become a doctor. He also had the privilege of being a personal physician to Mother Teresa and her philosophy inspired him to think about affordable healthcare for poor people. Mother Teresa�s statement that �Hands that serve are more sacred than lips that pray� had always inspired him to work for making healthcare available and affordable to all. The affordability of healthcare had always been a major concern for people in India; many families lived in fear of losing their loved ones because they could not afford the cost of medical treatment. Dr. Shetty said �A solution is not a solution unless it is affordable.� Disassociating healthcare from affluence had always been Narayana Health�s primary goal. Narayana Health was known for its clinical excellence and process innovation capability. Its widely recognized brand was associated with quality compassion and affordable healthcare services in India. Narayana Health was identified with the following mission statement:Our mission is to deliver high quality affordable healthcare services to the broader population in India. Our core values are represented by the acronym �iCare� which encompasses Innovation and efficiency Compassionate care Accountability Respect for all and Excellence as a culture. At the same time we seek to generate a strong financial performance and deliver long-term value for our shareholders through the execution of our business strategy.The mission of NH was to deliver high-quality affordable healthcare services to people in India. Dr. Shetty wanted to build 5000-bed �health cities� across India and a total of 30000 beds by 2020; his goal was to provide affordable healthcare services to people without compromising on quality. NH had been able to achieve its goal of providing healthcare at a lower cost by applying its economies-of-scale business model tweaking a few processes driving hard bargains and negotiating partnership deals. Dr. Shetty said �The healthcare industry needs more process innovation than product innovation.� In 2009 The Wall Street Journal described Dr. Shetty as �The Henry Ford of Heart Surgery� for doing a large number of surgeries at a lower cost in comparison to other hospitals across the world. In 2011 The Economist gave Dr. Shetty an award for a business process innovation that helped Narayana Health reduce healthcare costs using mass-production techniques. Narayana Health�s innovative business model had brought down the cost of healthcare services without compromising on quality. The mortality rate and infection rate at Narayana Health for coronary artery surgery were 1.27 per cent and 1 per cent respectively comparable to U.S. hospitals whereas the incidence of pressure ulcers (bedsores) at NH had been almost zero during the last four years compared to 8�40 per cent globally. NH had been honoured with many awards including �Public Health Champion Award� by the WHO in 2015 under the category of innovation.According to Vijay Govindarajan an expert on strategy and innovation and the Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth College�s Tuck School of Business Narayana Health had been able to recruit people who shared its vision that it must provide high-quality healthcare to people irrespective of their financial and socioeconomic status. The success of NH in providing high-quality affordable healthcare to poor people had been dependent on the success of low-cost insurance schemes like Arogya Raksha Yojana for the private sector and Yeshaswini for the cooperative sector and telemedicine. Telemedicine had helped NH in getting patients from rural areas.SOURCES OF FINANCING RISK AND GOVERNANCEBefore the 1990s there were very limited sources of financing available for businesses in India�namely bank financing and public equity markets. Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds then started functioning as an alternative source of financing and had been a significant contributor to India�s economic growth ever since. PE sector had invested more than $103 billion in approximately 3100 companies in India from 2001 to 2014. In 2015 India was a top destination for PE and VC investors with total investments of $22.4 billion. This huge interest among PE and VC investors towards India was a result of the strong fundamentals of the country its young population with rising incomes its high consumption and its growing economy.On February 6 2008 Ashoka Ambadevi and JPMorgan invested _4 billion in Narayana Health. Ashoka and Ambadevi were together referred to as American International Group Inc. (AIG) funds. AIG funds and JPMorgan invested _2 billion each for 25 per cent stakes in Narayana Health. Ashoka Holdings was allotted 29006 equity shares while 8701 equity shares were allotted to Ambadevi and 37707 equity shares were allotted to JPMorgan. CDC Group plc invested _2 billion on December 24 2014 for 20339 equity shares. It was also given extensive veto rights under the shareholders� agreement with respect to management of the company. An award of veto rights to PE investors increased the risk of the company. Because PE investors were based outside of India NH could be considered a foreign-controlled company.Over the last 15 years of operations NH had borrowed from banks and financial institutions in the form of term loans corporate loans cash credit overdrafts and commercial paper. Ten million 10.5 per cent optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) were issued to CDC India Opportunities Limited for a sum of _1 billion on December 24 2014 with the condition that OCDs would be converted into equity shares if NH went public. As of March 31 2015 the total debt capital of NH was _2.01 billion whereas total shareholders� funds were _7.91 billion. NH had maintained an average long-term debt ratio of 0.27 in the last five years. It had relied more on private equity investment than on debt capital since its inception. NH had 10 members on its board including Dr. Shetty who was chairman and executive director of the company five independent directors and Ms. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw. PE investors and banks were given the right to appoint nominee directors on the board of the company. Harjit Singh Bhatia was appointed as nominee director of Ashoka Holdings and Ambadevi (see Exhibit 5). Promoters of the company were required to hold at least 51 per cent of share capital at all times failing which counterparties were given rights to terminate all arrangements with the company and declare the company �defaulted.� In the case of non-compliance with debt covenants lenders were given rights to enforce their rights which included conversion of their debt into equity and taking over control of the management.By August 2015 a total of 204360804 equity shares were outstanding owned by promoters and private equity investors. The founder of NH Dr. Shetty and his wife Shakuntala Shetty held major chunks of 33.37 per cent and 32.06 per cent of the shares respectively as promoters. Majority shareholding in the company provided control of the business to the promoters of the company. Narayana Health had remained profitable in the last five years of operations from FY 2011 to FY 2015 (see Exhibits 6 7 and 8); its compound annual growth rate had been 29.15 per cent (see Exhibit 9).INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Issuance Process in IndiaThe decision to go public and the timing of the issue were the most essential strategic considerations for equity issuance to be successful. A private company not only had to have a credible business plan a predictable revenue stream the right management team and a standard financial reporting system as well as fulfilling eligibility criteria but it also had to acquire knowledge about the current economic situation and public appetite before pursuing an IPO. The Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) governed the IPO issuance process in India through the Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines of 2000 according to which a private company had to fulfil the eligibility norms set by the SEBI. Hiring one or more investment banks was the first step for equity issuance for firms going public. Investment banks had to submit bids to the firm with details about the money that could be raised from IPOs and their own share. These details had to be mentioned in the underwriting agreement once the bank had been hired.A private company had to file an offer document a red-herring draft prospectus (RHDP) with the SEBI for its review at least 30 days prior to filing a prospectus to the Registrar of Companies (ROC). Any changes suggested by the SEBI in the RHDP had to be made by the private firm before submitting the prospectus to the ROC. In this 30-day interval the RHDP had to be kept open to public comment. An unlisted firm was also required to obtain prior in-principle approval from stock exchanges where it intended to list. Private companies were also required to obtain grades by at least one credible credit rating agency and disclose all their grades to the public along with the credit rating agency rationale for the grades given. A private company had to appoint merchant bankers who would be responsible to do due diligence and ensure that all the requirements of the DIP guidelines of the SEBI were satisfied.The SEBI had no role to play in setting the price band of the offer which had to be decided by investment bankers of the company. However it was mandatory for the unlisted firm to disclose all the parameters considered and processes followed in arriving at a certain issue price. There were two ways at which the price of the issue could be arrived: fixed pricing and the book-building process. In fixed pricing the lead merchant (LM) decided the issue price whereas in book building the LM decided the price band instead of the fixed price. Market forces decided the final issue price in book building. In a book-built issue allocation to retail individual investors non-institutional investors and qualified institutional buyers had to be in the ratio of 35:15:50.Various marketing strategies for the issue�namely the appointment of an advertising agency a memorandum containing salient features and a statutory advertisement�were supposed to be drawn up by the LM. The post-issue activities to be performed by the LM included the finalization of trading the management of escrow accounts the coordination of non-institutional allocation the intimation of allocation and the dispatch of refunds to bidders.Gearing Up for the IPOGoing public was a monumental decision for Narayana Health and therefore PE investors in consultation with the board of directors chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) played a crucial role in arriving at this decision. Generally the CFO assumed a key role in the process of IPO process execution and acted as a key representative in financial matters while the CEO drove the strategic decision and monitored progress.Preparing for an IPO was a complex process. Before initiating the process PE investors needed to assemble a team of investment bankers underwriters registrar lawyers auditors tax advisors and accountants to plan and collaborate. NH was required to have net tangible assets of at least _30 million with distributable profits in at least three years and a net worth of _10 million in the last three years and its issue size could not exceed five times the pre-issue net worth. Narayana Health was able to fulfil all eligibility requirements.NH had to offer the company�s shares to the public for the first time in the primary market before it could be listed on India�s two prominent stock exchanges�namely the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It had an option of going public through a primary or secondary offering or both. In a primary offering a company offered ��new shares� to the public whereas in a secondary offering promoters PE investors and VC investors cashed out their shares in the company. In a primary offering the proceeds of the issue went to the company whereas in a secondary offering they went to the existing shareholders. In a secondary offering the total number of outstanding shares remained constant before and after the issue. PE investors wanted NH to pursue an IPO through a secondary offering i.e. an offer for sale (OFS). Generally companies had gone public in the past for two major reasons primarily to raise capital for further investments such that the weighted average cost of capital could be minimized. Allowing selling shareholders to cash out their initial investments had been another major reason for companies to go public. An IPO allowed investors to realize a high return on invested capital when market conditions were favourable. In the case of NH a primary motive of PE investors behind taking the company public was to provide themselves and other selling shareholders (promoters) with an opportunity to realize a return on their investment in the bullish market by selling portions of their stake in the company in the primary market. Enhancing visibility and brand image and achieving the benefits of listing on stock exchanges were other motives for going public.DECISIONIn the five years from FY 2011 to FY 2015 NH had reported a higher revenue growth rate than its peers and the average industry growth rate by successfully implementing its business model of economies of scale. It had also been able to provide affordable healthcare without compromising quality. The biggest task in front of PE investors was to determine the offer price band through the appropriate valuation of the firm. Hiring book-running lead managers deciding the timing for filing a red-herring prospectus with the SEBI and the size of the issue and determining the appropriate offer price band were additional concerns. PE investors were supposed to consider the future growth potential of the healthcare industry the strengths and weaknesses of NH�s business model valuation multiples of the industry and the financial performance of Narayana Health before arriving at any decision.EXHIBIT 1: PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS OPERATING IN THE INDIAN HEALTHCARE INDUSTRYas of March 31 2015 (in _ millions)Source: Case authors using data from annual reports of companies for FY 2014�15.EXHIBIT 2: BALANCE SHEET OF COMPARABLE FIRMS OF HEALTHCARE INDUSTRYas of March 31 2015 (in _ millions)Source: �Narayana Hrudayalaya� Moneycontrol.com accessed May 6 2016 www.moneycontrol.com/competition/narayanahrudayalaya/comparison/NH#NH.EXHIBIT 3: INCOME STATEMENT OF COMPARABLE FIRMS OF HEALTHCARE INDUSTRYas of March 31 2015 (in _ millions)Note: PBDIT = profit before depreciation interest and taxes; PBDT = profit before depreciation and tax.

Financial information of the past several years would help in forecasting future revenue streams. Multiple valuation could also help in finding the right value of the firm; however determining the right valuation multiple by considering various factors�like future growth potential of the healthcare industry and strengths and weaknesses of NH�s business model�was the real challenge. Valuation multiples namely price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio price-to-book (P/B) ratio enterprise value (EV)�sales ratio and EV/EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) could be used for multiple valuation. The DCF analysis method and multiple valuation method would help Narayana Health in determining the appropriate offer price range for the issue.Source:  Beta based on authors� calculation from historical share prices of comparable competitors Apollo and Fortis between FY 2014 and FY 2015; Risk-free rate of return = generic Indian government 10-year bond bid yield Bloomberg Markets accessed December 30 2016 www.bloomberg.com/quote/GIND10YR:IND; Total equity risk premium based on Aswath Damodaran �Country Default Spreads and Risk Premiums� NYU Stern July 2016 accessed January 2 2017 http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.htm; Cost of debt = average approximation of long-term debt annual interest rate given in red-herring prospectus of Narayana Health filed with the SEBI; Multiple valuation was a method of company valuation that used different multiples of comparable firm(s).ENDNOTES

This new form of commerce had been called the sharing economy the gig economy the platform peer sharing and even the on-demand economy. Within this context Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber) transformed itself into an international transportation powerhouse that dominated its sector of the sharing economy in just seven years. Uber had gross booking revenues of US$5.4 billion in 2016 and net revenue in the fourth quarter of that year of $1.7 billion. It operated in 70 countries had an approximate valuation of $70 billion in 2017 and maintained a polished web presence that was designed to reflect regional cultural norms. However Uber’s rise to prominence was controversial almost from the company’s inception. The corporation had an increasingly contentious relationship with its drivers and was the subject of numerous lawsuits which included a much-publicized sexual harassment lawsuit that eventually contributed to the departure of co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Travis Kalanick. What had been the substance of Kalanick’s tumultuous era and how had his leadership as CEO affected Uber’s organizational culture? How did Uber’s manipulation of its drivers through the use of knowledge derived from behavioural science affect the company’s operations? And finally after Kalanick had been fired what were the options for Uber’s next plan of action? KALANICK: The perennial entrepreneurKalanick was a product of the southern California suburbs. He attended high school in Northridge just outside of Los Angeles. Kalanick’s father was an engineer and his mother pursued a career as a retail advertiser with the Los Angeles Daily News. When he was young Kalanick was known for being confident persuasive and a particularly good salesman—a quality he demonstrated as he sold knives door to door for Cutco. Some described the young Kalanick as a perpetual hustler who always had his game face on. Those who had known Kalanick when he was young agreed in interviews and other commentary that he was a smart intense hyper-rational and driven entrepreneur. At the same time many viewed him as both an egotist and an opportunist who had no compunctions about stepping on people’s toes in order to succeed. Kalanick started his first business an SAT-preparatory service called New Way Academy when he was 18. His own impressive SAT scores helped him get accepted at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where he majored in computer engineering. This was where he met Michael Todd Vince Busam and Dan Rodrigues who were working on a peer-to-peer search engine enterprise called Scour which was supported by angel funding from their friends and relatives. Kalanick was hired at Scour in 1998 and he dropped out of college to work for the start-up. Although Kalanick was actually Scour’s second employee he often later described himself as one of the company’s founders sometimes to the dismay of the actual founders. Kalanick took no salary for a year but instead lived on unemployment insurance while he devoted considerable energy and talent to the file-sharing enterprise. Working out of Rodrigues’s apartment bedroom Kalanick handled business development and marketing for Scour and became known for the guerrilla marketing campaigns he undertook to push the product name. Scour was ultimately sued for $250 billion by a group of entertainment companies that claimed Scour had allowed consumers to obtain copyrighted content without paying for it. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000.After the demise of Scour Kalanick had a new venture underway almost immediately. He and Todd launched Red Swoosh a technology company that focused on delivering web content and worked by having users share bandwidth. In effect Red Swoosh was a networking software company. Kalanick called it his revenge company; he intended to make the customers of the companies that had sued Scour his customers. By mid-2001 the company had seven employees but was completely out of cash and struggled to meet its payroll obligations. Even worse the financial effects of the attacks of September 11 2001 meant that start-up funding—especially for companies in the software industry—was disappearing. As Red Swoosh struggled the company cut corners and neglected its financial responsibilities including the responsibility to withhold income taxes from employees’ paycheques. The company soon owed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $110000 for unpaid income tax—a criminal offence. The founders were able to pay the debt before the end of 2001. They avoided prosecution but the company was almost finished financially. Employees had gone through long periods without any pay at all and disputes arose over stock options that were promised but not realized. According to insiders both Kalanick and Todd had hidden business decisions from each other and each had accused the other in the IRS debacle. Their amicable business relationship was permanently destroyed and Todd left Red Swoosh. After Todd’s departure Kalanick managed Red Swoosh through a series of ups and downs until 2007 when he sold the company to Akamai for $23 million. Many former employees of Red Swoosh later made negative comments about their impressions of Kalanick noting his constant reinterpretation of events his pomposity and his winner-take-all attitude. Meanwhile Kalanick had been working for three years without a salary and had lived in his parents’ basement for a time after Todd’s departure from Red Swoosh. He had relocated the company headquarters to Thailand as a cost-saving measure and had made numerous changes to the team in order to make Red Swoosh a success.The sale of Red Swoosh made Kalanick a millionaire. He spent the first year after the sale travelling the world and investing in various projects. During his travels he met Garrett Camp from whom he first heard the idea for Uber. The company began as UberCab under Camp and co-founders Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan. Kalanick was brought on board in 2008 as an advisor and he quickly gave himself the title of chief incubator. UberCab was officially launched in 2010 with Camp as CEO but Camp in an amicable arrangement deferred to Kalanick at the end of the year. Kalanick became CEO while Camp assumed the role of general manager. Kalanick had earned a reputation for being a hard worker but he also spent much of his time embroiled in various controversies of his own creation. Kalanick made enemies quickly. His foes included regulators in jurisdictions where the company was located business and personal rivals the taxi industry and even customers who criticized the company. Kalanick expressed himself vigorously in speeches e-mails company blogs and videos. In early 2017 a video distributed by Bloomberg showed Kalanick losing his temper in an argument with one of his drivers about falling pay rates. Kalanick was verbally combative with the driver and used profanity—and was forced to quickly offer a public apology only hours after the video began airing. Kalanick did not deliver his apology to the driver in person but instead delivered an e-mail apology to all employees and referred to a different conversation with the driver. The apology was subsequently posted to the company’s public blog. At least one contemporary analyst noted that Kalanick’s approach was to win at all costs. This was a source of strength but was also the executive’s biggest weakness. Certainly Kalanick embodied the stereotype of a technology industry mover and shaker: he was young brash energetic known for his intensity and pompous style and was credited with being reckless although effective by many who had known him over the years. However the video of Kalanick’s argument with the Uber driver publicized the dark side of Uber’s top manager and shed light on another undesirable personality trait: immaturity. Employees who mimicked Kalanick’s full-tilt work- and lifestyle were known within the company as “Uberettos”—a comparison that was not meant to be flattering.Uber’s CultureLike that of all founders or early leaders of organizations Kalanick’s personality and style made a lasting imprint on Uber. The company’s organizational culture was influenced significantly by Kalanick’s demonstrated values and ethics. Some of these values and ethics were illustrated in a list of 14 core values Kalanick presented to employees before a company retreat in Las Vegas in 2014. Among the phrases in the list were “toe-stepping” “always be hustlin’” “super pumped” and “principled confrontation.” Kalanick demonstrated similar thinking early in the company’s history: a profanity-filled 2013 letter he sent to employees was found during an investigation into sexual harassment at the company just before his departure in June 2017. The document set “rules” for an upcoming company party in Miami; these included a monetary penalty for vomiting and a prohibition against throwing kegs from the tops of buildings and the document outlined explicit rules for sex between co-workers.Unethical behaviour was often the rule at Uber and the corporation’s highly publicized activities certainly influenced public perception of the company. Uber’s dispute with its drivers for instance was the source of numerous articles in the public press as well as the subject of blog posts from Uber itself and the topic of social media postings from current and former drivers. Uber’s internal measurement of driver satisfaction showed driver turnover averaged approximately 25 per cent every three months. The sexual harassment allegations levelled in 2017 by former employee Susan Fowler were certainly well-publicized. Uber used questionable tactics against rival ride-sharing company Lyft in San Francisco. Uber employees booked rides with Lyft drivers and then cancelled and Uber used “brand ambassadors” who booked rides with Lyft and then tried to persuade the Lyft drivers to work for Uber. Uber also purchased analytical data about Lyft’s customers and used the information to evaluate Lyft’s financial health. Additionally Uber gathered an intimidating legal team and hired a private investigator to interview friends and colleagues of its legal adversaries. It made extensive use of political operatives who argued the company’s merits with officials at all levels of government including the federal administration under President Obama. The corporation’s well-known aggressive philosophy and disregard for regulations was reflected in the observable artifact that hung proudly on a wall at Uber’s headquarters: the first cease-and-desist order issued to the company. The company’s reputation epitomized that of the Silicon Valley tech industry in general. For example executives had an overall disdain for regulation a penchant for flouting laws an active anti-union stance and a boy’s-club atmosphere that devalued female employees and was often rampant with sexual harassment. Uber also used technology such as Greyball and other cyber products that helped it evade government officials who were investigating Uber’s operations. Uber used surge pricing—that is raising rates at various times and locations when the corporation felt it could dominate the marketplace—to increase profits. Uber even instituted surge pricing during hurricanes and blizzards. Surge pricing infuriated users who perceived it as price gouging. controversial practicesIn early 2015 Kalanick had a meeting with Tim Cook the CEO of Apple Inc. (Apple). Although Kalanick showed up wearing his trademark hot pink socks and red tennis shoes his bravado was short lived. Cook had summoned Kalanick because Uber technicians had unsuccessfully tried to alter the company’s ride-sharing app so that its activities would be hidden from Apple’s technicians. Kalanick had used the app to identify and tag iPhone users—even those who had deleted the Uber app from their iPhones. Kalanick agreed to desist after Cook threatened to remove Uber’s app from Apple’s app store which would likely have decimated Uber’s customer base.In mid-2015 a privacy rights group the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a lengthy complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Uber. The complaint alleged that Uber’s information gathering practices were dangerous to consumers. EPIC claimed that Uber collected data about passengers after their rides were concluded by monitoring GPS data even after users had turned off their GPS location finders. This allowed Uber to access users’ contact lists for marketing purposes. This ability to track locations and identify and collect data about users was an internal program at Uber known as “God View” and the program worked without the users’ knowledge. EPIC further claimed that Uber had already abused users’ trust when it tracked the location of journalists who had reported on the app and then shared personal information about the journalists within the workplace.Uber similarly used a secret program called VTOS an acronym for “violation of terms of service” which identified potential abusers of the service as well as law enforcement officials who sought to ticket or otherwise compromise Uber’s drivers. VTOS included a tool called Greyball which was first noticed in operation in Portland Oregon in 2014 when the company used it to evade local officials who were trying to catch Uber drivers who operated illegally in the city. Greyball used an algorithm to identify where and when customers opened the Uber app; for example it identified those who opened the app in proximity to a government agency or building. After Greyball identified potential law enforcement agents the app tagged the users denied them rides or cancelled rides already accepted. It then sent them a fake app populated with ghost drivers to protect the actual locations of real Uber drivers. In May 2017 the U.S. Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation into Uber’s use of Greyball but neither the Justice Department nor Uber released any public comment about the situation. Uber had publicly announced in early 2017 that it would no longer use the Greyball tool.Economic Advisory CouncilThe year 2017 began poorly for Kalanick and continued that way until his eventual departure from the company in June. Kalanick joined President Trump’s economic advisory council in December 2016 and encountered a strong backlash from employees during the year’s first all-hands meeting in January 2017. Employees were primarily critical of the president’s immigration policies. In fact President Trump’s immigration stance was almost universally unpopular with workers and executives in the tech industry many of whom were immigrants themselves or believed strongly in globalization.When New York City taxi drivers supported protests against President Trump’s selective immigration ban by striking at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January 2017 Uber responded by saying that it was not going to institute surge pricing. This was perceived by the New York City taxi drivers as intimidation meant to break their strike although it was unclear if that was actually the intent of Uber’s press release.Kalanick announced his departure from the council after only a week but Uber employees had to convince him that he needed to distance himself from President Trump’s policies. Employees circulated a 25-page letter in the workplace that listed the reasons employees wanted Kalanick to resign from the council. Meanwhile more than 200000 customers had deleted their Uber apps and accounts since Kalanick had announced he would join the president’s council. There was considerable concern about how easy it was for them to delete the Uber app and replace it with Lyft’s. Uber’s Use of Behavioural ScienceUber used a variety of psychological techniques to influence where when and how long its drivers worked. These approaches used graphics and video game techniques and included noncash rewards that enticed drivers into working longer hours. The company intended to minimize its labour costs as much as possible and it often needed drivers to work in areas and at hours that were not as profitable for them as other times and places. At times the company’s own efficiency worked against it because faster pickup times overall meant more idle time for individual drivers and this led drivers to log off from service. To prevent this and because many individuals felt comfortable with earnings goals Uber alerted drivers to how close they were to achieving earnings targets which prompted some drivers to remain available. While Uber was concerned with shortages of drivers in areas where demand existed or was forecasted drivers were concerned with earning a sufficient wage. Uber tried to influence drivers to achieve dollar targets rather than working mainly when times were busy. One method Uber used to get drivers where it wanted them to be was by sending a continuous barrage of e-mails texts and pop-up boxes through the app to get the drivers’ attention. Sometimes these messages were accompanied by small maps with icons that indicated where they should go. Some local managers also realized that in areas with a high percentage of male drivers a female persona on the app produced better results in keeping drivers logged on for service. Uber also imitated an algorithm used by Netflix to keep its viewers watching. Uber automatically provided drivers with information on the next available fare opportunity in effect imitating Netflix’s technique that created binge-watching and was aimed at keeping viewers logged on. Uber’s version used a technique called forward dispatch which was an algorithm that sent drivers new fares before they had delivered their current customers to their destinations. This made Uber very efficient at choosing the closest driver but it also resulted in drivers working longer hours. Uber revealed that the number one complaint drivers had that led to them sign off was idle time. Unfortunately for the drivers Uber’s app did not allow them to see the next passenger’s destination before accepting the ride. Although drivers could pause the automatic forward dispatch feature it re-established itself as soon as the driver accepted another ride or logged on again.In addition to the persistence of forward dispatch drivers reported that Uber routinely resisted their efforts to log off. Uber usually responded with texts about earnings goals or encouraged the drivers to take another fare. Uber often showed drivers a graphic of a dollar sign with a needle that did not quite reach the goal. Uber was merely mimicking a technique that game developers had used for years: Uber had created a ludic loop—a psychological feeling of progress toward a goal that was always just out of grasp. Uber also used game-related metrics to influence drivers; these included graphics measuring passenger ratings and time logged on. Uber had recently developed a feature for its app that stored drivers’ preferences and gave them more control over their schedules by letting them set the times and places they needed to be. This would be good for the drivers and it also allowed Uber to forecast labour needs. However there was no evidence that this change was implemented or disseminated to the drivers. As a matter of practice Uber also gathered data on drivers’ driving habits such as braking and acceleration speeds and collected customer comments. Certainly Uber’s engineers could have discovered ways to use this data to improve driver and customer safety. It could be argued that Uber’s use of behavioural science was abusive to its drivers because the company maintained a low wage ceiling and influenced its drivers with gaming techniques that could be considered unethical. According to one perspective Uber manipulated its full-time drivers in ways that caused them to remain in a low-wage job and enticed others to continue to operate personal businesses that would not allow them to make ends meet. One commentator indicated that Uber’s drivers were paid with badges that did not cost Uber anything. By March 2017 the leadership at Uber knew they were in the midst of a serious cultural crisis and the realization was undoubtedly powerful. Top leaders called a press conference and announced they had been rethinking their relationship with their drivers who had complained about their indifferent treatment and shrinking pay for years. Self-Driving CarsUber’s attitude of principled confrontation was never more apparent than in the corporation’s quest to transition to self-driving cars. Uber had begun operations testing of self-driving cars in three states: California Arizona and Pennsylvania. In California 20 companies were certified to begin testing of self-driving cars on state roads. Uber was not on the list and the head of Uber’s autonomous vehicle program Anthony Levandowski publicly declared that the regulations limiting self-driving cars without state permits did not apply to Uber. Uber used self-driving cars beginning in California in August 2016 although the company neglected to inform the traffic division of the San Francisco Police Department. During the first day of the pilot run in San Francisco two of Uber’s self-driving cars were observed running red lights. Although Uber could have received permits for its self-driving cars if it had submitted to the regulatory process instead it had taken a defiant stance based on the form of technology it used. The corporation contended the technology made their cars different from other self-driving cars. Even after the mayor of San Francisco made a personal phone call to Uber to warn the company to stop using the self-driving cars Uber officials responded in blog posts that called the requirement for a permit debatable. The California Department of Motor Vehicles responded through the state’s attorney general with threats of immediate legal action. Uber’s woes were exacerbated even more in early 2017 when Alphabet Inc. the parent company of Waymo asked for an injunction against Uber’s use of self-driving cars and alleged that Levandowski had stolen the technology from Waymo when he was an employee there. Uber later suspended all operations with self-driving cars when one of its vehicles crashed in a highly publicized incident in Arizona although it appeared that the Uber car might not have been at fault. Despite setbacks Uber committed to a future business model that used self-driving cars. This was an example of automation at work: the replacement of the most expensive part of the business equation the human with a machine. One of Uber’s other strategic initiatives involved urban air transport using vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing—that is flying cars. Uber had already formed relationships with a variety of partners in the venture. Its primary goal was to transform urban transportation by creating an on-demand network of high-speed flight in cities facilitated by technology that was similar to the Uber driving app. The flying car initiative was announced in April 2017 and the notion immediately raised numerous questions. These related to issues such as noise problems in cities testing regulation implementation of the technology certification and control systems.Allegations of Sexual HarassmentIn February 2017 a blog post by a former Uber engineer who had left the company the previous December exposed the company’s entrenched atmosphere of sexism and sexual harassment. An investigation followed almost immediately 20 employees were fired and the executive group was restructured. The former employee Susan Fowler who said she had been ignored by Uber’s human resources department when she had tried to file a sexual harassment claim against her direct supervisor posted her lengthy public accusation after finding new employment. Fowler worked at Uber from November 2015 through December 2016. While she had gone so far as to supply screenshots of the executive’s offensive solicitations to the human resource department Fowler was told by upper management that they were uncomfortable punishing her supervisor because he had high performance reviews and that it was probably just an honest mistake on his part. Within hours of the publication of the blog post Kalanick delivered a public statement by e-mail to say that this was the first time he had heard of the allegations and to explain that he had instructed the head of the human resource department to open an urgent investigation into Fowler’s claims. Fowler’s post about the sexist corporate culture at Uber reinforced the widespread public notion that the tech industry was rampant with sexual harassment and sexism. Her allegations followed much-publicized incidents in 2015 when Ellen Pao had filed similar charges in a lawsuit against upper management at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and later in 2017 when six female employees at Binary Capital accused a co-founder of that company of sexual harassment.The atmosphere of sexual harassment at Uber began at the top with Kalanick who once bragged in a Gentleman’s Quarterly interview that his association with Uber had boosted his desirability with women and jokingly referred to his company as “boob-er.” In early June 2017 after the law firm Perkins Coie LLP had finished their internal investigation into the allegations of widespread sexual harassment Uber fired 20 employees for inappropriate behaviour. This was quickly followed by the firing of Eric Alexander the company’s president of business in the Asia Pacific region. Alexander had acquired the medical records of a woman in India who had allegedly been raped by her Uber driver. Alexander then shared those records with Kalanick and another vice-president. This resulted in a lawsuit by the woman who alleged that Uber wanted the records to destroy her credibility.Kalanick announced in early June 2017 that he would take an indefinite leave of absence and he handed over management of day-to-day operations to a group of executives. Within a week however five of Uber’s largest investors including Benchmark Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments demanded Kalanick’s resignation and forced him out of the company.Outlook for uberWhat options did Uber have for their next plan of action? While Kalanick had helped to build Uber into an international transportation powerhouse that operated in more than 70 countries and had a value of approximately $70 billion his often out-of-control style had also delivered the company to the brink of destruction. Uber’s U.S. market share declined in the first six months of 2017 as consumers and drivers alike reacted to the variety of negative issues that clouded the company’s future. By January 2017 approximately half a million subscribers had deleted the Uber app from their phones in a widespread campaign known as #DeleteUber. Rival on-demand provider Lyft gained 7 per cent of the Chicago market during the same time period.Uber had earned its reputation which was negative enough that having been employed at Uber was for some employees a black mark on their resumes. An anti-Uber website titled Why Everyone Hates Uber listed and described Uber’s controversial practices. Uber had needed to change its practices for some time. Top leadership at Uber perpetuated a hostile workplace that was rampant with sexism; the company was accused of using stolen intellectual property and it utilized behavioural science knowledge that manipulated rather than engaged its drivers. Many high-level executives besides Kalanick had left Uber by the middle of 2017. These included Jeff Jones the company president who left after a six-month tenure several high-level executives who left after the sexual harassment investigation the vice-president of product and growth and the top security researcher. After Kalanick’s departure top leaders at Uber quickly stressed the need for better top executives and an improved organizational culture while commentators speculated about the advantages of hiring a female CEO to help turn around the corporation’s culture. Uber had committed to self-driving cars but it had not developed a solution to the current challenges with its drivers which were significant because the cost of changing to an employee-based work system was prohibitive. Finally some analysts cautioned that Uber’s finances needed better controls that would generate cash and stimulate outside investment. There was no doubt that Uber needed to move quickly and decisively. Uber was especially vulnerable while it changed direction and leadership. Some analysts noted that it was a perfect time for competitors to steal Uber’s best remaining talent who had proven skills and it could be a dangerous time if company morale plummeted and consumer confidence in Uber faded.ENDNOTES

For quite some time he had been doing market research to explore the potential of an idea�namely geographical expansion of his current business into the western Indian states of Rajasthan Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Thakkar had seen the huge potential for profit in this expansion. With his 25 years of experience in trading plywood products he realized that these geographical areas had large volume requirements for plywood in housing corporate sectors and industrial projects. Thakkar discussed his dream of expansion with his childhood friend Ronit Shah.Based on an initial analysis Thakkar decided to set a production goal of 45000 units per year for the states into which he expanded but actual production would depend on market demand. Thakkar estimated that 29250 units could be sold per year at an average price of _2200 per unit. He wanted to evaluate the feasibility of the project using a cost�volume�profit (CVP) analysis.BACKGROUNDNipponply began its journey in 1994 when Thakkar conceived the idea of providing plywood and veneers to consumers. Over the years Nipponply developed various plywood products veneers laminates and flush doors with a strategy of delivering quality products based on natural raw materials. The firm preferred to obtain 100 per cent natural raw materials for its manufacturing and built its reputation on the quality of these materials. Further Nipponply carefully selected manufacturers who were conveniently located in places where quality raw materials were available locally. The manufacturers� modern technology combined with Nipponply�s experience resulted in continuous innovation and superior products. Nipponply had also established a strong and well-connected distribution network in the state of Gujarat. The firm had grown to provide one of the widest ranges of plywood veneers laminates and flush doors in Gujarat. Buyers favoured Nipponply�s products for two reasons. First Nipponply promised that its products had a longer life and were of better quality compared to competitors� products. This factor was important for many retail and industrial customers. Second Nipponply offered competitive prices and more options in design and customization. The products were prepared according to customers� specifications of shape size colour and design. For its production and delivery processes Nipponply followed a stepwise trading process (see Exhibit 1).THAKKAR�S expansion PROJECTThakkar had a plan to expand his current business geographically into western India by offering Nipponply�s plywood products through business-to-business and business-to-consumer sales. The firm provided plywood veneers laminates and flush doors in Gujarat state but Thakkar wanted to provide only plywood products in the areas Nipponply would be expanding to. Thakkar discussed the expansion with Shah.Shah. Your idea is good but why do you want to expand into western India?Thakkar. There are various reasons for the geographical expansion. First over the last 25 years of running this business in Gujarat I have developed superior products and a wide variety of designs using natural raw materials and continuous innovation. If I expand the areas where I sell these products I can take advantage of economies of scale to offset the costs of maintaining high-quality production. Due to their superior quality I anticipate that I will be able to sell the products in western Indian markets as easily as I can in Gujarat. Second after a few years my son Smit Thakkar is going to join this business; as a next-generation entrepreneur he wants to expand the family business for further growth. Third the expansion will help increase the profitability of the firm and reduce our dependency on the local (i.e. Gujarat state) market. Shah. What is the plan to manage the business while incorporating the idea of expansion?Thakkar. We use an enterprise resource planning platform to make every business transaction as smooth as possible. The products are distributed through an organized network of business partners and associates. After receiving an order it is processed by the warehouse and administrative departments. The product location is identified in the warehouse using information technology (IT) infrastructure. The products are shipped with a delivery note which lists the description and quantity of goods delivered. The products are then delivered against payment to the end customer through the business partner and associate. Finally the payment is transferred by the business partner and associate to Nipponply.Shah. Great but what about the organizational network?Thakkar. I am using a hierarchical organizational network for this expansion plan targeting three states in western India�namely Rajasthan Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. (Thakkar continued referring to the hierarchical organizational network [see Exhibit 2].) Each of these states will have one regional sales manager one business development manager two sales executives and one office assistant. The firm will appoint one business partner and associate for each district within a state to look after the district�s business and customer requirements. Shah. Good but who is going to manage the office?Thakkar. The office is going to be managed by people at three different levels. (Thakkar referred again to Exhibit 2.) At the top level I as managing director will provide oversight for all three states. At the middle level the regional sales manager will manage the office of their respective state though the business development manager will be in charge of the development strategy. The bottom level of management is concerned with district-level activities. The business partner and associate will be responsible for district-level management. Shah. Great but where will the employees come from?Thakkar. Employees will be hired from their local areas. In each state the regional sales manager business development manager sales executives and office assistant will come from that state only. The products will be distributed through a well-connected network of authorized business partners and associates who will be selected from their respective districts for two reasons. First employees who are local have better knowledge and understanding of their market as compared to outsiders. Second the local language differs from state to state so local employees can manage business-related communications better because of their familiarity with the local language. Shah. But what about the market?Thakkar. The availability of potential customers who want to buy plywood will never be a problem. With the growing infrastructure and urban development plans of the government of India the future demand for plywood is assured. I also see an opportunity generated by the conversion of the unorganized sector to an organized sector. Shah. Good. What about expenses?Thakkar. When expanding plywood products into new markets Nipponply must consider manufacturing advertising promotional and electricity expenses. These are the expenses related to the volume of sales per month. (Thakkar shared the cost sheet [see Exhibit 3].)Shah. Were you also doing some research on market potential?Thakkar. Yes I did do some research. Let me show you. (Thakkar then delivered a presentation on the market potential.)MARKET POTENTIALThakkar�s presentation predicted increasing market potential due to two new opportunities: (1) a new initiative recently launched by the government of India and (2) changes in market trends in the Indian plywood industry. First the government of India had undertaken an initiative to provide affordable housing to lower-income groups middle-income groups and the economically weaker section of society (essentially the urban below-poverty-line population) by 2022. According to the estimate this initiative would necessitate the construction of 114 million houses by 2022 and include the western Indian states (i.e. Rajasthan Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh). Because this scheme would require plywood materials and products used for housing development it would generate a rise in demand and a new opportunity for the plywood industry.In addition India�s plywood market was estimated to reach a value of US$5.5 billion by 2023 due to changes in market trends such as increasing incomes urbanization investment in real estate and western influence. The demand for plywood products was expected to increase among household consumers architects interior designers and original equipment manufacturers and for residential- and commercial-building purposes creating additional opportunities for the plywood industry. On the basis of this preliminary analysis Thakkar decided to pursue an expansion in the three target western states with a trading capacity of 45000 units. He presented the calculations to Shah for discussion.INVESTMENT NEEDEDThakkar. Shah according to my estimate the investment for the expansion project would be about _29.125 million. Investments would need to be made in various fixed assets such as information technology [IT] infrastructure a manufacturing plant and machinery a building or office and other miscellaneous assets. As we have already discussed there would be other operating expenses related to the volume of production. According to my estimates these costs would total _7.0125 million per month (see Exhibit 3). Shah examined the estimated investment costs (see Exhibit 4).Thakkar. In addition to the above investments I have estimated working capital requirements of _0.84 million per year to pay for routine expenses such as administrative costs office supplies electricity and other miscellaneous costs (see Exhibit 5). Further the estimated workforce cost would be about _2.952 million per year (see Exhibit 6). The personnel cost would be for the aforementioned regional sales managers business development managers sales executives and office assistants.FINAL DECISIONA comprehensive analysis followed the discussion. Thakkar�s initial decision was to pursue a business plan that had a trading capacity of 45000 units per year but the actual production had to be based on market demand. Thakkar estimated that ultimately 29250 units could be sold per year at an average price of _2200 per unit. Nipponply could produce 29250 units with 65 per cent capacity utilization (i.e. the lowest level of capacity). For the second and third year Thakkar estimated that Nipponply would have 38250 units and 45000 units with 85 per cent capacity utilization (a moderate level of capacity) and 100 per cent capacity utilization (the highest level of capacity) respectively. The initial investment in the project would cost _29.965 million of which _21.915 million would be drawn from the firm�s own resources; the rest would come from a bank loan at an interest rate of 11 per cent (see Exhibit 7). The life of the project was estimated to be fifteen years. The salvage value of the IT infrastructure plant and machinery at the end of fifteen years would be negligible and therefore could be ignored. The salvage value of the building machinery at the end of fifteen years would be _250000. Before investing in this project Thakkar asked a consultant to review his business plan.

With its headquarters in Brussels Belgium the majority of its operations were in Europe though B-Kay Tech was also active in North America and Eurasia.Kay had started with the company as a planning analyst in the Belgian office in 2005 and between 2008 and 2016 he was project manager in the supply chain office. During that period he successfully established several supply chain improvement programs with one of his major achievements being the vendor-managed inventory collaboration agreement he had set up with the company�s two biggest retailers in 2012. The agreement with the retailers resulted in higher delivery order stability which helped B-Kay Tech to improve the planning of production and transport in turn resulting in better resource planning and shorter delivery lead times. Service levels rose over the following years while at the same time inventory levels were reduced not only in Kay�s own warehouses but also in those of the retailers. Owing to this collaboration agreement Kay was able to achieve significant supply chain savings for the company over the years which in part led to his promotion to supply chain director at the start of 2017. In order to impress B-Kay Tech�s vice-president of Operations and Supply Chain Kay wanted to devise a new breakthrough innovation project. He had heard about a different type of supply chain collaboration�horizontal collaboration�that involved partnerships with companies that operated at the same level in the supply chain; these companies could even be (potential) competitors. The idea behind horizontal collaboration was to bundle the partner companies� shipments in the same transport so that any available space in one company�s truck hauls could be utilized to transport shipments for other companies reducing the overall number of trucks required. With the logistics team responsible for the greatest part of the company�s carbon footprint this shift would not only affect B-Kay Tech�s bottom line but would also help the company to reach the stringent 2020 sustainability targets set out by management. Kay discussed this idea with his vice-president who agreed that it could be a breakthrough project and signed off on it�with the stipulation that first results be visible within the year and that Kay looked at more than just monetary savings in transport. With top management support in place how could Kay find potential partners within the designated time frame and convince them too of the benefits of a collaboration?Driving logistics efficiencies through collaborative shippingB-Kay Tech had its own fleet of 25 trailer trucks for the local logistics that was supplemented with outsourced third-party logistics (3PL) shipping for the international lanes. One of the major inefficiencies Kay�s logistics team faced was that many of the trucks were driving only half-full. Owing to strict delivery demands and high inventory holding costs Kay�s planning team members had only a few degrees of freedom to improve their truckload factors especially if they did not want their service levels to suffer. Through collaborative shipping with another company Kay could fill the empty space in his trucks resulting in greater sustainability and cost improvements.Given the high value density of B-Kay Tech�s products and the limited number of shipments Kay felt that horizontal collaboration could improve the current situation. With the initiative for collaboration having originated with him Kay was in charge of detecting bundling opportunities with other companies. This type of bundling was proactive: opportunities were detected prior to shipment and if desired plans were changed and shipments were delayed or moved forward in order to benefit from joint transport. This system contrasted with traditional freight groupage which was mainly reactive: in groupage shipping the logistics provider decided on bundling less than container loads in the execution phase rather than in the planning phase and the consolidation was only geographical (i.e. the timing of the shipments was not allowed to change).It became clear to Kay that to maximize the gains of collaborative shipping he had to alter his replenishment policy and be more flexible; he had to replenish inventories either sooner or later than originally planned to benefit from joint transport. He was not yet sure what this additional flexibility would mean for his inventory requirements.Revisiting old friendshipsAt the annual Supply Chain Award ceremony in March 2017 Kay had gotten back in contact with David Rollins a former colleague who had started working at WARE-TOUCH during the summer of 2013. WARE-TOUCH was a U.K.-based multinational company that produced and distributed everyday consumer goods throughout Europe and the Middle East and whose production sites and distribution centres were spread across Europe and Turkey. On one of its lanes towards Southern Europe WARE-TOUCH travelled more or less the same route from its distribution centre in Flanders Belgium to its distribution centre in the Lake Como area in Northern Italy. In addition WARE-TOUCH�s warehouses were located only a few kilometres from B-Kay Tech�s warehouses. Given that WARE-TOUCH arranged most of its international logistics on the spot market it was not bound by a contract with a 3PL for that lane. Kay decided to get in touch with Rollins to see whether WARE-TOUCH would be interested in collaborating and bundling transport in the future.Synchronization of orders by joint replenishmentAs of March 2017 Kay�s team managed inventories using a traditional reorder point and order quantity model: whenever the inventory position (inventory on hand plus items on order) dropped to the reorder point an order was placed for a fixed reorder quantity. The reorder point was based on the demand�s forecast error during lead time whereas the order quantity was defined to balance the cost of inventory with the cost of transport. To synchronize shipments in a collaborative shipping agreement Kay�s inventory replenishment policy needed to be adapted to allow for joint orders with WARE-TOUCH. Therefore he devised a replenishment policy that was both straightforward and transparent: when one or both companies placed an order (when its inventory position dropped to its reorder level) and organized a transport the other company could decide to join the transport. With sufficient inventory it was not necessary to replenish and fill the truck needlessly. On the contrary when the inventory position was close to reaching its reorder point it was worthwhile to fill the truck and to replenish a smaller amount. This policy allowed for the placement of joint orders yet each company maintained the flexibility not to join the order in the case that they still had sufficient inventory.The business case of a horizontal logistics allianceDespite their distribution centres being close to each other Kay was aware that WARE-TOUCH was in a different type of business than B-Kay Tech was and that their daily logistics were not necessarily the same. For starters B-Kay Tech worked with a fixed 3PL contract for its international lanes whereas WARE-TOUCH sourced its transport on the spot market. With respect to products B-Kay Tech offered low-volume high-value-density products while WARE-TOUCH supplied low-value commodities in high volumes (see Exhibit 1). Given its high volumes WARE-TOUCH managed to ship full truckloads. On average it shipped a full truck of 100 boxes to its distribution centre in the Lake Como area 60 times per year where it carried about five weeks� worth of inventory (see Exhibit 2). B-Kay Tech shipped between once and twice per week (100 times per year on average) but its trucks were only 35 per cent full. Due to high inventory costs and high shipment frequency its order quantity was only 35 boxes per truck. As a result B-Kay Tech�s distribution centre carried only four weeks� worth of inventory on average.For Kay co-loading one of his trucks would enable him to fill the empty space in the truck and to share a major transport cost even if his truck had to make a slight detour to pick up the order at WARE-TOUCH. But he wondered what the advantages of this arrangement were for WARE-TOUCH. After all WARE-TOUCH already shipped full truckloads and at full efficiency.To find out Kay decided to simulate the costs in the case that B-Kay Tech and WARE-TOUCH both shifted towards collaborative shipping. If Kay initiated the order (i.e. if B-Kay Tech reached its reorder point) he would fill the truck with 30 boxes. With WARE-TOUCH joining the transport it would fill the remaining space for 70 boxes. If WARE-TOUCH replenished its inventory it would order 80 boxes and Kay would fill the remaining truck space with 20 boxes. This way Kay would be able to increase B-Kay Tech�s shipment frequency from 100 to 115 shipments per year; 90 shipments would be initiated by himself (for urgent inventory replenishments when the inventory position dropped below the reorder point) and 25 would be joined with WARE-TOUCH�s transport. Under this collaboration WARE-TOUCH would be able to reduce the number of (self-initiated) transports from 60 to 50 per year a reduction of over 15 per cent. In addition WARE-TOUCH benefited from joining B-Kay Tech�s trucks 30 times per year which meant that its shipment frequency would increase by more than 30 per cent (see Exhibit 3).Next Kay analyzed the impact of the collaborative shipping agreement on each company�s cost performance. If he placed an order and organized the transport B-Kay Tech would be charged the major order costs (i.e. transport costs to Northern Italy) regardless of whether or not WARE-TOUCH joined the transport. If WARE-TOUCH joined Kay�s transport it paid for the minor order costs (i.e. the marginal cost of handling and picking up the goods at the WARE-TOUCH distribution centre). The same reasoning would be applied if Kay joined the WARE-TOUCH truck in which case WARE-TOUCH bore the major order costs and B-Kay Tech had to pay only the minor order costs. Kay calculated that under collaboration the transport costs for B-Kay Tech (with both major and minor order costs but without inventory holding costs) would decrease slightly (less than 5 per cent) and the company�s inventory requirements would also decrease (from four to three and a half weeks� worth of inventory). To his surprise the benefits of this collaboration were much greater for WARE-TOUCH as it would be able to reduce its transport costs by 10 per cent. Kay observed that although WARE-TOUCH would have to increase its inventories this was to only a minor extent (from five to five and a quarter weeks� worth of inventory). Trust and adequate gainsharingKay found that there would clearly be gains for both companies if they were to collaborate but the gains were not automatically distributed evenly. He considered several angles from which to approach WARE-TOUCH with his proposal and drafted a partnership idea that was both equitable and sustainable. However he quickly realized he would need a neutral third party to make the arrangement work from a legal point of view.Kay decided to call Erika Owens a former classmate who specialized in commercial law and who had started her own firm as a collaborative shipping trustee in 2014. After speaking with her it became clear to Kay how vital it would be to have a neutral trustee party to gather analyze and govern any information sensitive to anti-trust laws. In addition Owens could take care of constructing a legal framework with multilateral contracts that would be anti-trust compliant. This framework would then also define the rules of engagement and secure the mechanisms for entry exit and gainsharing in the partnership thereby ensuring continuity and stability in the collaboration. To deal with this legal complexity without hurting the savings Owens presented a business proposal to Kay: she would take care of the legal set-up and would fill the trustee role for the first year in exchange for access to B-Kay Tech and WARE-TOUCH�s shipment data. This access would allow her to bring in additional partners or wholly new collaboration options at a later stage at which point she would then be remunerated based on a percentage of the realized gains. In this way Kay would be able to bring a financially fair and legally sound proposal to the negotiation table without having to hand over part of the gains realized at that point to the trustee. With all of the building blocks identified the next steps in making the project a reality were clear to Kay: he would need to devise a gainsharing mechanism that would convince WARE-TOUCH to begin the collaboration and to prepare the negotiations that would undoubtedly follow.

The Academy had just completed its fifth year of operations and Sharp was exploring potential expansion opportunities to grow the business and enhance profitability. He wanted to determine if it was a good time to open a second location in another part of the city and was also considering whether The Academy should invest in new equipment at its existing location. Prior to making a decision Sharp wanted to take a detailed look at current industry trends and the competitive landscape. He also wanted to assess The Academy’s financial performance to determine if now was the right time to make either of these moves. He needed to work quickly to pitch his chosen expansion strategy to the other owners at their meeting in two weeks. He gathered The Academy’s financial statements (see Exhibits 1 and 2) and got to work.  THE FITNESS industryDue to increasing obesity-related health concerns the gym health and fitness clubs (GHFC) industry in Canada was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent from 2017 to 2022. The industry generated CA$3.1 billion in revenues 61.4 per cent of which was attributed to fitness and recreation membership fees. Several population factors played a role in the GHFC industry’s success including per capita disposable income decreasing leisure time the number of adults aged 20 to 64 and the adult obesity rate. Adults aged 20 to 64 tended to have the highest per capita income making them the target consumer for industry players particularly as this age group was continuing to increase. Discretionary spending allocated toward health and fitness was increasing and industry profits were expected to grow from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent. In contrast to traditional gym memberships services such as personal training and individualized nutrition planning were becoming increasingly popular. Further per capita disposable income was expected to continue to grow in the coming years.The decrease in leisure time was another key factor to the industry’s success. As adults were spending more hours on the job or looking after family fitness activities and other recreational pursuits were becoming lower-priority items. However the adult obesity rate was expected to grow over the next five years. To help reduce the strain associated with higher healthcare costs many businesses and health insurance providers wanting to incentivize employees and clients to be more active were subsidizing gym memberships. The GHFC industry was still characterized by its growth phase although increasing variable costs in 2017 had resulted in a slightly declining contribution. The majority of operational costs were comprised of facility upkeep and labour costs but despite the high upfront capital requirements barriers to entry were low. Incumbents were able to increase profits and minimize revenue volatility by offering 12- or 24-month memberships and hiring part-time coaches. Given the low barriers to entry many new facilities established themselves to benefit from the industry’s rapid growth.CrossFitSince its founding by Greg Glassman in 2000 CrossFit had become one of the fastest growing global fitness trends. With over 13000 CrossFit affiliates across 120 countries by 2017 over four million people were participating in the sport. CrossFit combined various elements of fitness including weightlifting gymnastics and cardiovascular endurance. Its aim was to emphasize functional fitness with the goal of improving participants’ health and quality of life. A significant component to CrossFit’s success was in the community it created—CrossFit gyms created a safe space for people of all walks of life to come together to work toward their common goals. Members and coaches were supportive of one another and were often seen cheering each other on to complete workouts. The strong CrossFit community forged through completing challenging workouts together helped the sport gain much of its traction in the GHFC industry.Competition was another tool used to strengthen the CrossFit community. CrossFit headquarters (CFHQ) held three annual competitions: the Open the Regionals and the CrossFit Games. The Open took place over five weeks during February and March and allowed every CrossFit participant around the world to take part. Each Thursday for the five weeks one workout was released and all participants were given until Monday night to complete the workout at an official CrossFit affiliate and submit their scores online. At the end of the Open the top athletes were invited to the next round of competition the Regionals. There were 18 regions around the world each hosting the three-day competition. The top 40 men women and teams were invited to compete at the CrossFit Games in August where thousands of spectators gathered to watch. The Open gave all participants the ability to compete directly with the fittest athletes in the world which was unique to the sport.In order to use the trademarked CrossFit name gyms—or boxes as they were referred to in the CrossFit community—registered and paid annual affiliate fees to CFHQ. CrossFit coaches were certified by the company to administer fitness knowledge in a standardized way though affiliates were run with complete autonomy. Boxes therefore had vastly different environments—from the difficulty of workouts to the competitiveness to number and type of classes offered.In addition to the strong community fostered in the sport CrossFit boxes differed from traditional gyms in several other ways including the distinct physical differences in facilities. CrossFit boxes were typically located in large warehouse-style spaces with significant open areas without typical gym equipment. Instead members could find pull-up bars squat racks rowing machines free weights sandbags tires and a myriad of other functional fitness tools. This allowed for plenty of space to conduct coached CrossFit sessions. The majority of members took part in group classes as opposed to working out alone which also helped strengthen the local community. Members frequently commented on how a CrossFit box felt like a safe space to work toward personal fitness goals and this was not necessarily the case for traditional gyms. Finally boxes offered an element of friendly competition in group classes which helped push members to perform to the best of their abilities—this form of friendly competition was also not typically seen in traditional gyms. ConsumersCrossFit gym consumers considered several factors when determining which affiliate to join. The priority of each of these factors depended on the type of consumer seeking the training facility. The majority of CrossFit members had an average annual household income of over US$150000 and could be categorized into three broad groups: beginners and casuals regulars and competitive athletes. Beginners and casuals consisted of individuals trying the sport for the first time and those attending once or twice per week. This consumer group valued proximity cost and frequency of classes to meet their busy schedules. At most CrossFit affiliates beginners were required to take part in an initial foundations course which showcased the quality of the coaching staff and facility. The course was influential in determining whether a beginner would continue with their memberships or try another gym.Regulars typically attended classes four to six times per week and many of these consumers had experienced attending more than one CrossFit gym allowing them to be more selective. Knowing what other gyms offered these members valued the quality of programming coaching and facility. They were often willing to travel further away for a gym that met all of their requirements. Community and frequency of classes were also key factors for regulars as they tended to spend more time at the gym and had busy schedules. Competitive athletes prioritized facility size available equipment and proximity. These consumers were not concerned with programming and coaching quality as they tended to pay for individualized programs and worked out on their own. They did not participate in group sessions and were not concerned about the frequency of classes. They preferred to work out at official CrossFit affiliates and their gym needed to have enough space and equipment for them to complete their workouts. If multiple gyms in the area offered the same space and equipment proximity and cost became the next most important choice factors.Traditional gyms were typically focused on a different type of consumer; however of consumers falling within the CrossFit niche traditional gyms competed for the beginners and casuals group. CrossFit gyms tended to focus on beginners casuals and regulars as their target consumer groups because they comprised the bulk of revenues. Competitive athletes often did research prior to seeking out the specific gyms they wanted to train at.CompetitionGoodLife FitnessGoodLife Fitness (GoodLife) was the largest health club chain in Canada operating over 385 locations with seven of these locations in Kitchener Ontario. Established almost 40 years ago GoodLife had grown to capture 21.2 per cent of industry market share making it the largest player in the market. In line with its objective to be the most convenient health club GoodLife offered two types of biweekly membership options. The first membership was offered at a cost of $29.99 biweekly with a one-time enrolment fee of $179.99. The second membership option cost $34.99 biweekly waived the enrolment fee and required members to commit to a full year of payments. GoodLife also owned Fit4Less a price-sensitive alternative. Goodlife offered a traditional gym set-up in addition to group classes for a variety of different interests including yoga strength and cardio. It also offered personal training services for those wanting a more individualized fitness program. Planet FitnessEstablished in 1992 Planet Fitness had worked on establishing itself throughout the United States Canada Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico and had over 1400 locations 23 of which were in Canada and one of these locations was in Kitchener Ontario. Planet Fitness offered a traditional gym setup similar to GoodLife although it did not offer coached group classes. Planet Fitness was geared toward beginners and casuals and emphasized its mantra of creating a “judgment free zone.” Memberships started at $10 per month. Planet Fitness had approximately 1 per cent market share in the industry.Central Fitness KitchenerFounded in 2012 Central Fitness Kitchener (Central) was a local fitness facility offering a variety of coached group classes including those focusing on gymnastics strength conditioning and mobility. A variety of membership options was available and tended to average approximately $160 per month. It was also an official CrossFit affiliate gym. Central Fitness was one of the two largest competitors in the local CrossFit space the other being The Academy. Central currently operated out of a 15000 square-foot (about 1395 square metres) facility and was considering moving to a larger facility a few kilometres away from The Academy as the current facility was only accessible by one bus route in the city. In addition to group classes Central offered personal training services. Other CompetitorsSeveral other CrossFit affiliates operated throughout the city. These affiliates typically had smaller facilities (less than 3000 square feet or 280 square metres on average) and offered fewer training times but they were convenient to consumers who lived nearby. Given their limited financial capabilities and differing business objectives they were not primary competitors of The Academy. Many other traditional gyms also operated in the Kitchener area targeting a different consumer group than The Academy and its direct competitors (see Exhibit 3). The AcademyThe Academy began operations in Kitchener Ontario in 2012 and was founded by four partners who had a common passion for fitness and improving the health of their community. Over its years in operation The Academy had expanded to offer 50 group classes per week and was constantly looking to add new classes based on member demand. The gym was open for 52 weeks of the year. The gym’s popularity could be seen by how full the classes were particularly during weeknight evenings. Coaches offered personal training and were CrossFit Level 1 certified and were or had been competitive athletes throughout their lives. Coming from a variety of backgrounds including gymnastics powerlifting Olympic weightlifting and functional fitness the coaches shared one common goal—to help The Academy’s members improve and work toward their personal fitness goals. The Academy operated in a 5500 square-foot (about 511 square metres) facility and was continuing to grow rapidly with over 400 current members. After graduating from Fanshawe College in 2012 with a diploma in Fitness and Health Promotion Sharp spent over two and a half years coaching at GoodLife Fitness prior to joining The Academy where he served as head coach and co-owner for over three years. Sharp spent years competing in athletic disciplines such as martial arts hockey and functional fitness before pursuing a career in coaching and was still a competitive CrossFit athlete. Sharp’s talent for fitness programming allowed him to successfully launch his own personal training business two years ago through which he personally coached several athletes to compete at a regionals level. Sharp was dedicated to the fitness process and passionate about helping his clients reach their health and fitness goals.The community aspect of CrossFit was important to The Academy and was embodied through community events annual intra-gym competitions and the daily support members and coaches shared when milestones were achieved. These factors led to the gym becoming one of the largest CrossFit communities in the city. It was important to Sharp that any future growth experienced by The Academy fostered the community that had been created. The Expansion OpportunityWith the increasing number of competitors setting up CrossFit gyms within the city Sharp was keen to implement a strategy that would allow The Academy to continue to grow and remain one of the top training facilities. He believed that opening a second location would allow The Academy to capture a segment of the market that was at present limited by distance and travel time. Sharp also considered that a second location would provide The Academy with a competitive advantage as Central also had only one location in the city. However Sharp was not sure how successful a second gym would be and he knew it would require a significant amount of his time. He was concerned that this might affect the quality of coaching at the existing location.With or without any expansion Sharp expected The Academy’s sales to grow by the same percentage as the prior fiscal year. He expected the second location would generate 40 to 80 per cent of The Academy’s projected 2018 sales. As with the existing location he expected all the new sales to be made on credit. Under both scenarios he expected 5 per cent of the existing location’s projected fiscal 2018 sales to be lost to cannibalization as existing members would benefit from a closer location and transfer their memberships. Sharp located a facility space in the east part of the city which was available to rent for $40000 per year. He also planned on hiring a part-time administrative assistant for an annual salary of $30000. All other cash expenses for the new location would remain at the same percentage of sales as The Academy’s fiscal 2017 expenses although Sharp expected to realize several cost synergies. Expenses including interest and bank charges professional fees meals and entertainment and conventions and courses would not be incurred by the second location and 50 per cent of business taxes licenses and memberships expenses would be allocated to the new location.The initial investments required to set up the new facility included renovation and installation of fixtures totalling $30000. The fixtures comprised one third of the investment and had a useful life of five years. Sharp was debating between two sets of equipment—one that could facilitate classes up to 15 people or a smaller set facilitating classes up to 10 people. These equipment costs were $60000 and $45000 respectively and he anticipated that if sales were on the higher end of his estimate larger class sizes would be necessary (see Exhibit 4). Both equipment sets would be depreciated on a straight-line basis over five years after which each would be donated and replaced. To promote the new location Sharp wanted to spend $15000 on a launch event. Sharp considered that cash tied up in working capital accounts would also change. He projected that the added operations would average 35 days of accounts payable and 10 days of accounts receivable. No initial inventory investment was anticipated. Sharp wanted to ensure the decision met a hurdle rate of 20 per cent.THE FACILITY UPGRADEThe second alternative Sharp considered was upgrading and adding to the equipment at the existing location. He envisioned the facility upgrade would have a positive impact on The Academy in several ways. Given the new equipment the upgrade would allow the gym to offer additional classes and the new equipment would also improve the aesthetic appeal of the facility. However a significant capital investment would be required in addition to increased cost of sales and he was uncertain of the return. Sharp knew that some members might want to use only the new equipment.To estimate additional sales arising from the upgrade Sharp considered that a fair estimate would be to use the same average revenue per class. He expected one to four additional classes to be offered per week and that 80 per cent of these sales would be made on credit. Given the additional classes he anticipated cost of sales to remain at the same percentage of sales as in fiscal 2017. The new equipment would require repairs and cleaning and those expenses were also expected to remain at the same percentage of sales as in fiscal 2017. In the event that four classes would be added per week utilities would increase by $500 annually. Administrative duties would increase due to the greater volume of classes and Sharp believed that The Academy’s office expense would increase by $40 per month. If only one class was added this expense would increase by $24 per month. The cost of the upgrade—equipment and installation—was expected to be $28000. The new equipment would be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 10 years. To advertise the new classes being offered Sharp was going to put $2000 toward a media campaign that would run immediately leading up to the launch of the upgraded facility. He estimated the same permanent changes in working capital account estimates as with the new location alternative.Sharp expected most operating costs to remain at the same percentage of sales as in 2017 except for rent depreciation professional fees meals and entertainment and courses and conferences which were expected to remain at the same dollar amount as in 2017. Unless otherwise noted all items on The Academy’s statement of financial position were to remain at the same dollar amount as in 2017. Sharp was curious to see how much cash The Academy would have remaining on hand at the end of 2018.DecisionSharp was anxious to implement a growth strategy soon. He needed to decide whether given the risks involved The Academy should pursue the facility upgrade or add a new location. He was curious to determine how quickly the company could see a return on its investment. However he also wanted to evaluate the business environment risks associated with not moving ahead with the upgrades. After deciding on the best solution for The Academy Sharp wanted to project an income statement and balance sheet for fiscal 2018 in order to assess the overall impact on net income and the business’s cash balance. Before presenting his ideas to the other partners he knew he needed to develop an action plan and contingency plan for any decision he made.

(Walmart) the worldâs largest retailer. Foran was speaking at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) Global Consumer and Retail Conference on March 7 2019. âIt galvanizes an organization into doing somethingâ he said. Walmartâs supply chain strategy continued to evolve with its retreat from international markets a slowdown of retail expansion plans in the United States and a focus on its growing online business. With revenues of US$514 billion in the fiscal year (FY) ended January 31 2019 Walmart achieved 4.2 per cent comparable sales growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of FY 2019 the best performance in the last decade. Its shares jumped 3.9 per cent higher on the news.  As Walmart repositioned itself to grow its online presence it added 1000 grocery pickup locations during the past year and grew the number of grocery delivery locations to nearly 800. Walmart was working on the best way to deliver groceries directly to customersâit had a pilot test with Udelv for custom autonomous cargo vans to deliver groceries in Surprise Arizona and was collaborating with Ford on the development of self-driving cars for grocery deliveries. These were only a few of the changes Walmart was making as it reshaped its supply chain strategy to tackle the âlast mile.âWalmart seemed to have an advantage over Amazon in infrastructure. While Amazon had 75 fulfilment centres and 25 sortation centres in North America Walmartâs vast store network in the United States was within 10 miles of 90 per cent of the U.S. population. As competition between Walmart and its online and offline competitors continued to heat up a key challenge facing Doug McMillon the companyâs president and CEO was deciding what changes needed to be made to Walmartâs ever-expanding supply chain to support its strategic objectives. What supply chain capabilities would Walmart need as its business model continued to evolve?The RETAIL INDUSTRY The top five global retailers in 2018 were Walmart ($514 billion) Amazon ($160 billion) the Schwarz Group in Germany ($102 billion) Carrefour in France ($89 billion) and Ahold Delhaize in The Netherlands ($71 billion). U.S. retail sales excluding motor vehicles and parts dealers reached $6 trillion in 2018. Major categories included general merchandise food and beverage and health and personal care (see Exhibit 1). In the United States retailers competed at local regional and national levels with some of the major chains such as Walmart and Costco counting operations in foreign countries as well. In addition to the traditional one-store owner-operated retailer the industry included formats such as discount stores department stores (selling a large percentage of soft goods or clothing) variety and convenience stores specialty stores supermarkets supercentres (combination discount and supermarket stores) Internet retailers and catalogue retailers. Online retail sales were rising in importance in the United States reaching $517.4 billion in 2018 with Amazon accounting for approximately 40 per cent of the total. There were two broad strategies in global retailing: variable pricing or âhi-lo pricingâ and everyday low pricing (EDLP). Hi-lo pricing practiced by retailers for decades involved adjusting the retail price of items to optimize total gross margins. For example at traditional grocery stores while most prices of key itemsâsuch as milk sugar eggs toothpaste and detergentâwere kept at market rates a small number of products were discounted at below-market prices as part of short-term promotions. This strategy was used to attract customers with low-price offerings expecting that they would also buy some of the high-price items thereby expecting to increase overall profitability despite incurring losses on the few discounted items. Rotating promotional items allowed retailers to shift target customer segments.On the other hand an EDLP strategy meant that prices on items were generally consistent from week to week and were kept as low as possible in order to generate high consumer traffic. An EDLP strategy generally required the retailer to focus on opportunities to reduce operational and supply chain costs which translated into lower retail prices. The goal in an EDLP environment was to generate higher aggregate gross profit by increasing the volume of items sold.An emerging trend was demand from consumers for home delivery especially from millennials who prioritized convenience as part of the shopping process. This trend was spurred by the emergence of Amazon and other online retailers.WALMART STORES INC.Based in Bentonville Arkansas and founded by the legendary Sam Walton Walmart was the number one retailer in the world with FY 2019 net income from continuing operations of $7.3 billion on sales of $514 billion (see Exhibit 2). Globally Walmart had 2.2 million associates conducted business in 27 countries and served nearly 275 million customers each week in its more than 11300 stores and numerous e-commerce websites that operated under 58 banners. In the United States Walmart had 1.5 million associates and 5362 stores and warehouse clubs. Beginning with its âbig boxâ discount store format in the 1960s Walmartâs store formats around the world had grown to include supercentres which were a larger version of a discount store that included groceries merchandise and apparel. Its strategy was to provide a broad assortment of quality products and services at âeveryday low prices.â In the United States Walmart faced a wide range of competitors including Target Home Depot Ikea Costco Kroger Aldi Walgreens and CVS. The company was also facing growing competition for large ticket general merchandise products and from online retailers such as Amazon.com. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WALMARTâS SUPPLY CHAIN Before he started Walmart Stores in 1962 Sam Walton owned a successful chain of stores under the Ben Franklin Stores banner a franchisor of variety stores in the United States. Although he was under contract to purchase most of his merchandise requirements from Ben Franklin Stores Walton was able to selectively purchase merchandise in bulk from other suppliers and transport these goods directly to his stores. When Walton recognized a new national trend discount retailingâbased on driving high volumes of product through low-cost retail outletsâhe decided to open large warehouse-style stores initially named âWalmart Discount City.â Because many suppliers were not willing to send their trucks to his stores which were located in rural Arkansas Walton set up his own distribution operations. Walmart undertook an initial public offering in 1969 to raise funds to build its first distribution centre (DC) in Bentonville Arkansas. As the company grew between 1960 and 1990 it benefited from an improved national transportation infrastructure and the slow response of its competitors to changes in legislation such as the removal of âresale price maintenanceâ which had prevented retailers from discounting merchandise. To keep an eye on his growing network Walton piloted a small single-engine airplane which he would land at air strips close to his stores.Walmartâs supply chain a key enabler of its growth from its beginnings in rural Arkansas was long considered by many to be a major source of competitive advantage for the company. It was one of the first firms to rely on data to make operational decisions use bar codes share sales data with suppliers control its own logistics and transportation activities and install point-of-sale information systems that collected item-level data in real time. As the companyâs supply chain practices became widely publicized many of Walmartâs practices were adopted by competitors and became industry standards. Walmart.comIn the United States Walmart had three main online programs: Walmart.com (launched in 2000) an online site selling an assortment of goods that were also available in company stores; Marketplace a seamless platform that hosted third-party sellers on Walmart.com; and Jet.com a high-end retailer of consumer goods. The company was also partnering with major retail brands such as Lord & Taylor and Advance Autoparts to bring upscale brands to Walmart.com.Launched in 2009 Walmart Marketplace was a third-party e-commerce platform that allowed independent sellers to sell both new and like-new products on Walmart.com. Many of these suppliers purchased overstocked items which were then resold. Some of the items that were sold by third-party resellers included $3000 Celine bags Miu Miu sunglasses and Chanel perfume. To differentiate itself from Amazon Walmart did not charge suppliers setup or monthly fees to list on Marketplace. However Walmart did not allow its Marketplace sellers to use its supply chain network. Marketplace sellers had to fulfill orders on their own and manage customer service including returns.Walmartâs e-commerce capabilities had been augmented when it purchased Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3 billion positioning the site to target higher income urban shoppers. The acquisition coincided with an effort by Walmart to source a larger variety of goods in an effort to attract a broader range of customers. For example in 2015 Walmart.com had 7 million different items for sale online. By October 2018 it had over 75 million items online. Doug McMillon indicated that Walmart had purchased Jet.com because of its customer service capabilities e-commerce foundation and talent base along with the belief that both customer bases were complementary. Jet.com focused on urban millennials and offered online features that allowed shoppers to lower prices by opting out of free returns and paying with debit cards instead of credit cards. In contrast Walmart.com featured low prices and attracted value-conscious buyers. McMillon was looking to grow both online businesses stating:Weâre in the business of âsaving people money so that they can live better.â But the value of our customersâ time cannot be overstated. To win the future of retail we must save customers both money and time. By combining with Jet.comâs technology shopping experience customers and talent we will do exactly that. We will exceed their expectations!In addition to trying to reach a higher income demographic by partnering online with retailers such as Lord & Taylor Walmart was looking to offer higher-end brands on its site. It purchased Bonobos an online designer and seller of higher-end menâs clothing; Moosejaw an online outdoor products retailer; Hayneedle an online furniture and home dÃ©cor shop; and Shoebuy an online shoe retailer. In October 2018 Walmart purchased plus-size digital brand Eloquii and lingerie retailer Bare Necessities. In May 2018 Walmart purchased 77 per cent of Indiaâs Flipkart an e-commerce retailer for $16 billion. Of that amount $2 billion was earmarked for funding growth. Walmart intended for Flipkart to â. . . support national initiatives and . . . bring sustainable benefits in jobs creation supporting small businesses supporting farmers and supply chain development and reducing food waste.â In February 2019 India introduced new e-commerce restrictions that prevented foreign online retailers from selling their own products online restricting them to â. . . operate marketplace platforms where others sell goods to retail consumers.â The result was that Flipkart had to pull thousands of products offline.The combination of an improved Walmart.com website positioning Jet.com at higher-end customers and allowing third-party sellers to use Walmart Marketplace resulted in online revenue growth of 40 per cent to $15.7 billion in FY ended January 31 2019. Amazonâs U.S. e-commerce sales were $206.82 billion in 2018 up 16.3 per cent from 2017.In an effort to raise profitsâand recognizing that fulfilling orders online was more expensiveâWalmart began raising prices on Walmart.com for basic food and household items. A Morgan Stanley data analysis found that while Walmart dominated the market for lower-income consumers Amazon attracted higher-income consumers. ProcurementWalmartâs buyers located in Bentonville worked with suppliers to ensure that the correct mix of staples and new items was ordered. As Walmart grew many of Walmartâs largest suppliers opened offices in Bentonville staffed by analysts and managers supporting Walmartâs business. Walmart expanded its global sourcing in the mid-1980s by establishing international purchasing offices in China and other countries and working directly with suppliers to expand the companyâs line of private-label merchandise. Private-label products were appealing to customers as they were often priced at a discount to brand-name merchandise; for Walmart the private-label items generated higher margins than suppliersâ branded products. Private-label sales at Walmart first developed in the 1980s accounted for approximately 16 per cent of revenues compared to about 25 per cent at U.S. rivals Safeway and Kroger. This was because Walmartâs strategy was to procure top brands in volume and sell them at low prices. Every quarter buyers met in Bentonville to review new merchandise exchange information and review a fully merchandised prototype store which was located in a warehouse. In order to gather field intelligence buyers toured stores and helped associates stock and sell merchandise. In addition to helping coordinate short-term plans for deliveries and inventories Walmart worked with suppliers on medium- to long-term supply chain strategies including product trends capacity management cooperation with upstream raw materials suppliers and forecasting. Globally Walmart was thought to have approximately 60000 suppliers of whom about 200âsuch as NestlÃ© Procter & Gamble (P&G) Unilever and Kraftâwere key global suppliers. Walmart wielded enormous power over its suppliers. For example P&G sales to Walmart represented 15 per cent of its annual revenues in 2018 but approximately two per cent of Walmart revenues. During negotiations with suppliers Walmart insisted on a single invoice price and did not pay for co-operative advertising discounting or distribution. With Walmartâs expectations for data analysis category management responsibilities and external research it was common for key suppliers to have several employees working full-time to provide support. In order to harness the knowledge of its suppliers âcategory captainsâ were introduced in the late 1980s to provide recommendations to improve overall category performance including shelf space allocation for all suppliers. Walmart announced in February 2019 that it would allow suppliers such as P&G Unilever and Modelez to advertise directly to consumers in its stores and online at Walmart.com. The company had approximately 300 million visitors to its U.S. stores per month and the retailer was looking to generate revenues and boost profits. The move came at a time when Amazon was positioned to surpass Microsoft in online advertising revenues moving into third place behind Google and Facebook in the $111 billion U.S. digital ad market.DistributionWalmartâs store openings were driven directly by its distribution strategy. Sam Walton had insisted on saturating the area within a dayâs driving distance of a DC in order to gain economies of scale with an average distance of approximately 130 miles. This âhub-and-spokeâ distribution-led store expansion strategy persisted as Walmart expanded from its roots in Arkansas adding thousands of U.S. stores. In 2019 Walmart had 173 DCs in the United States with 125.8 million square feet of total space. Its DCs were focused on a variety of roles in the supply chain including regional general merchandise full-line grocery grocery and perishable food fashion e-commerce fulfilment centres specialty products (e.g. export optical labs pharmacy returns processing tires print and mail) import and redistribution centre point and Samâs Club DCs. Approximately 77 per cent of store merchandise was shipped through its DC network with the remainder shipped direct-to-store (DSD) by suppliers. Exhibit 3 provides data showing the number and type of U.S. distribution centres.Walmart announced in January 2019 that it would add consolidation centres to improve supply chain efficiency. The current practice was for domestic suppliers with goods already in the United States to ship goods to one or more of the companyâs 42 regional general merchandise DCs. Suppliers sending goods from abroad would send their product to Walmartâs import and redistribution centre points and goods would then be sent to regional general merchandise DCs. In July 2019 Walmart planned to build its first consolidation centre a 340000 square foot high-tech distribution centre to receive product from suppliers. The new technology in the consolidation centre was expected to be three times faster than the manual processes used in traditional DCs. Walmart anticipated that it would add 10 consolidation centres to its supply chain network which would ship product to regional general merchandise DCs.The company estimated that incomplete deliveries resulted in one-third of out-of-stock incidents in its stores. As a result in 2019 Walmart increased requirements for on-time delivery performance. Suppliers shipping full truckload orders were now expected to meet their two-day window 87 per cent of the time up from 85 per cent previously. Suppliers delivering less-than-truckload amounts were expected to deliver on time 70 per cent of the time up from 50 per cent. Suppliers who did not meet its âon time in fullâ guidelines would be fined 3 per cent of the amount invoiced.   The company employed approximately 8000 truck drivers in the United States who logged nearly 740 million miles per year. Walmartâs truck fleet included an estimated 6000 tractors 53500 trailers and 5600 refrigerated trailers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise in the United States was transported primarily through Walmartâs private truck fleet and the company contracted with common carriers to transport the majority of its perishable grocery merchandise. Walmart invested in capabilities to improve delivery processes coordinating and deploying the entire fleet as necessary. Uniform operating standards ensured that miscommunication between traffic coordinators truckers and store level associates was minimized. Walmart categorized its inventory into four distinct types: finished goods and transit buffer and anticipation inventory. Finished goods referred to inventory that arrived from suppliers and was shipped at regular intervals to stores. Transit inventory referred to goods that were being transported via Walmartâs global supply chain to warehouses. Buffer inventory was extra stock held in storesâ backrooms to account for sudden and unexpected increases in demand. Anticipation inventory referred to goods held in stock for specific periods of high demand such as Black Friday.Information SystemsAs early as 1966 Sam Walton made information systems a focus at Walmart. The retailer had a central database by the 1980s point-of-sale systems and a satellite network. It launched its industry-leading Retail Link system in 1992 which was initially created to share inventory data with key suppliers. By 2019 Retail Link was a comprehensive information system providing all suppliers with access to information and decision support tools. Suppliers were able to use Retail Link to access real-time data on inventories and sales at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level and download to purchase orders. Incorporating information on product performance and regional consumer demographics Retail Link provided decision support systems that allowed suppliers to make data-driven decisions in areas such as sales forecasting route scheduling and assortment planning. Its capabilities provided even Walmartâs smallest suppliers with tools once reserved for only large companies. The access to the Retail Link resources also came with increased accountability for suppliers. It allowed Walmart to offload data analysis to suppliers expecting them to proactively monitor and replenish product on a continual basis setting targets for supply chain inventories and service levels. The companyâs vendor managed inventory (VMI) program required suppliers to manage inventory levels at the companyâs distribution centres based on agreed service levels. In some situations suppliers owned the inventory in Walmart stores up to the point that the sale was scanned at checkout.Walmart was an early adopter of RFID (radio frequency identification) tags to ensure cases of product moved efficiently through its distribution system and it was estimated that Walmart saved $500 million a year by using RFID in its operations. Store NetworkSam Walton was an original adopter of EDLP at a time when most retailers in the 1960s and 1970s such as K-Mart practiced hi-low pricing. EDLP was a strategy that Walmart refined over the decades. EDLP allowed Walmart to keep its costs low. Steady demand for product allowed management to control inventories and reduce stock-outs. The absence of promotions and discounts meant less spending on advertising. In turn the company channelled the savings to lower prices. Walmart grew rapidly as customers were attracted by its assortment of low-priced product as other retailers faltered. Over time the company copied the merchandise assortment strategies of other retailers. It bought in bulk bypassing distributors and passed savings on to consumers. Similar to its logistics operations the company strived to optimize the efficiency of its stores through efforts to continually reduce costs. Its stores were simply furnished and constructed using standard materials and light and temperature settings for all U.S. stores were controlled centrally from Bentonville. Each Walmart store aimed to be the âstore of the community.â The display of merchandise was suggested by a store-wide template indicating the layout of Walmartâs various departments. This template was created by Walmartâs merchandising department after analyzing data from Retail Link and the profile of the local community. Associates were able to alter the merchandising template to fit their local store requirements. Shelf space in Walmartâs different departmentsâfrom shoes to household appliances to automotive suppliesâwas divided up each spot allocated to specific SKUs. Thus two Walmart stores a short distance apart could potentially stock different merchandise.Retail Link provided Walmart DCs with close to real-time information on storesâ in-stock levels allowing merchandise to be pulled to stores automatically. In addition store level information systems allowed suppliers to monitor product sales. In anticipation of changes in demand for some items associates had the authority to manually input orders or override impending deliveries. To ensure that associates were kept up-to-date management shared detailed information about day week and month store sales with all associates during daily 10-minute long âstandingâ meetings. In 2018 Walmart announced that it would raise the hourly wages for entry level associates to $11âproviding total compensation including benefits of more than $17.50âin an effort to attract and retain talent. The company was also experimenting with organizational models that would provide more decision-making power to people on the floor in areas such as pricing and handling returns thereby allowing reductions in manager ranks. Other cost-cutting initiatives included the use of automation and robots in stores to monitor inventory clean floors and unload trucks more quickly.In 2019 Walmart was expected to add just 10 stores in the United States as it focused on remodelling existing stores and building its e-commerce capabilities. As part of its focus on online Walmart had closed 150 U.S. stores in 2015. Exhibit 4 provides a summary of Walmart capital expenditures for 2016â2019.focusing on the SUPPLY CHAIN Walmart remained focused on improving its supply chain capabilities. In addition to implementing zero-based budgeting the company was evaluating more than 300 technology-enabled initiatives to improve efficiency and to reduce costs. Some recent initiatives included warehouse unloading equipment shelf-scanning robots electronic shelf-edge labels and development of new apps. Specifically senior management had identified two broad areas where supply chain initiatives were critical to support corporate strategy: integrating retail stores and e-commerce to enhance the omnichannel experience of customers and increasing the use of technology to assist customers and to reduce costs.OmnichannelWalmart aimed to provide seamless omnichannel experience to customers integrating retail stores and e-commerce systems through services such as Walmart Pickup Pickup Today Grocery Pickup Grocery Delivery and Endless Aisle. Shoppers could order online select a pickup time and pick up their groceries at thousands of stores without leaving their cars. Marc Lore president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce commented on the opportunities at Walmart to integrate its store network with its e-commerce business:Wal-Mart has some really unique assets that no one else has. To date we havenât fully leveraged the scale of Wal-Mart specifically its 4600 stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the population. Fresh frozen over 100000 general-merchandise SKUs are in that proximity. That product gets there in full truckloadsânot cases and palletsâand those 4600 warehouses are profitable. Theyâre already covering their entire fixed expense. So each marginal dollar that ships out of there comes out at an incredible profit.Walmartâs foray into grocery pickup and delivery began in 2014 when it introduced curbside pickup. Meanwhile the U.S. online grocery market was growing rapidlyâForrester Analytics estimated that by 2022 the online grocery market would be valued at $36.5 billion up from $26.7 billion in 2018. In 2019 Walmart had more than 2100 grocery pickup locations and nearly 800 grocery delivery locations.Walmart was hoping that customers would come to the stores for the best deals on inexpensive items and place larger orders online. Speaking to an investor conference Marc Lore observed that â. . . thereâs no cheaper way to get these products to consumers than have them come in the store and pick it off the shelf themselves.âIn April 2019 Walmart announced it had hired 40000 store workers to pick groceries for online orders. The company was installing 900 pickup towersâeach 16-feet high and located in the store parking lotsâthat would allow customers to pick up online orders without speaking to a store associate. Customers placed orders online at Walmart.com or on the smartphone app and then received a barcode. When the order was ready customers could go to a pickup tower in the Walmart parking lot enter a barcode and then wait for their products to be brought to them via conveyor belts. In a test in Nashville and New Orleans in September 2018 Walmart worked with Spark Delivery a crowd-sourced delivery platform that matched independent drivers with Walmart delivery orders. Once orders were placed Walmartâs personal shoppers would pick up the merchandise and hand the orders off to independent delivery drivers managed by Delivery Drivers Inc. a logistics service provider. In September 2018 Walmart purchased Cornershop for $225 million. Cornershop was a crowdsourced delivery platform for supermarkets pharmacies and food retailers in Mexico and Chile. Walmart announced partnerships in January 2019 with Point Pickup Skipcart AxleHire and Roadie aimed at providing home delivery services to customers. On June 7 2019 Walmart announced the launch of a service Walmart InHome which would see employees deliver groceries directly to a customerâs fridge. The service would be available in three cities: Kansas City (Missouri) Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) and Vero Beach (Florida) and employees would wear body cameras for security purposes and enter residences equipped with smart locks that could be remotely unlocked.However not all of Walmartâs omnichannel experiments had been successful. In August 2017 Walmart had partnered with Google Express to make Walmart products available on Googleâs online marketplace. But Google confirmed via Twitter on January 22 2019 that Walmart products had been withdrawn from its online shelves.In January 2017 Walmart abandoned its effort to create a rival to Amazon Prime. The program ShippingPass had been introduced in 2015 and offered free two-day shipping for customers who paid a $49 membership fee. The program was replaced by free shipping for all orders greater than $35.An attempt by Walmart to turn its U.S. associates into an after-hours delivery workforce was scrapped in July 2018. A report in the industry magazine Chain Store Age noted that â. . . the initiative failed to gain traction in New Jersey specifically due to employees being required to use their own cars and insurance policies during deliveries. Many also had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.âTechnologyIn 2019 Walmart was engaged in a number of technology-related initiatives aimed at improving the customer experience and reducing costs. In September 2018 Walmart announced that some food suppliers would need to implement blockchain technology as part of a food traceability program. The objective was to track leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach from farm to store to improve food safety and quality. In April 2019 Walmart introduced robots in 300 U.S. stores to scan shelf inventory and boxes as they were unloaded from trucks. Robotic floor scrubbers were deployed in 1500 stores after having been tested in stores in 2018. Walmart was also running an experiment with a shelf-scanning robot that travelled up and down store aisles verifying shelf labels and looking for gaps in shelves signalling that product was out-of-stock. Another robot picked refrigerated and frozen products to assist in filling grocery pickup orders.The company was also actively developing new apps for customers and store associates. The My Productivity app was designed to improve inventory management in stores. Associates could access the app on their smartphone and review real-time data and sales trends. It allowed associates to reorder specific items and respond to customer questions if needed. The company also launched Dotcom Store an app that allowed associates to place orders for customers on Walmart.com if products were not available or if they were out-of-stock. Walmart also launched a detailed mobile store map for customers looking to navigate a particular store and âCheck Out with Meââan app that allowed customers to pay for their purchases while they were shopping.WALMARTâS QUIET TRANSFORMATIONIn 2019 Walmart was transforming itselfâleveraging its store network and investing heavily in e-commerceâas part of a new strategy. The company had sold its Brazilian operations while a proposed sale of its Asda chain to Sainsbury had been blocked by Britainâs Competition and Marketâs Authority. As it positioned itself to attract higher income customers online and invest in labour-saving technology there was one part of the market that Walmart seemed to have vacated: the small-town rural markets where it had started in the 1960s. Meanwhile a new competitor Dollar General had built a strategy of opening its small stores in â. . . damaged inner-city neighbourhoods with basic goods at basic prices.âWalmartâs supply chain had grown more complex over time (see Exhibit 3). The company had saturated the United States with stores within minutes of 90 per cent of the countryâs population while simultaneously improving supply chain operations. Traditional customers still visited Walmart stores to stock up on food and merchandise at low prices. But now the worldâs largest retailer was in the middle of a transformation in the face of threat from a new class of competitorsâonline retailers led by firms such as Amazonâwho were winning over customers with a wider variety of goods and the convenience of home delivery. While Amazon offered free shipping and other online services such as streaming music and video with its $119 annual Prime membership Walmart provided free two-day shipping for orders over $35 to all customers. On April 26 2019 Amazon rattled the industry by announcing that Prime members would be getting free one-day delivery. Walmart responded in a tweet: âOne-day free shipping . . . without a membership fee. Now THAT would be groundbreaking. Stay tuned.âAs Walmartâs business model continued to evolve a key challenge facing Doug McMillon was determining how Walmartâs supply chain strategy would need to change to meet the challenges facing the company.Exhibit 1: U.S. RETAIL CATEGORIES (PARTIAL LIST) (in US$ billions)Source: âAdvance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services December 2018â United States Census Bureau February 14 2019 accessed March 8 2019 www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf.Exhibit 2: Key Financial Information for Amazon Walmart and Target*

It was March and neglecting the bright spring day outside Kelly Shawn director of marketing sat in her office but could not concentrate. Client Jamie Croce’s words lingered in Shawn’s ear: “The Bristol project needs to be launched by Thanksgiving Day. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects we plan to develop. Please make sure everything is on schedule.” However according to the current original equipment manufacturer (OEM) project-development model both the project schedule and the project’s quality were at risk of not meeting Croce’s request. Shawn stepped away from the laptop and looked out the window at the palm trees moving gently in the breeze. She took a deep breath. It was time to rethink the next step in the plan.COLIN CORPORATECOLIN CORPORATE (COLIN) was founded in 1946 after the end of the Second World War—a critical period for the U.S. economy. The business started out manufacturing electronic dry irons. Its original corporate owner Chris Martin paid significant attention to product quality and customer service. Soon after COLIN was founded its dry iron products gained wide recognition. For 70 years COLIN had been recognized as the number-one brand of garment care products including dry irons steam irons and garment steamers. The garment steamer was a new product category having been developed only in the past 20 years. With improvements in people’s living standards the garment steamer became more and more popular because it was convenient simple to use and could remove wrinkles from fabrics without touching the clothing which eliminated the risk of scorching. The garment steamer product accounted for 30 per cent of COLIN’s total sales and 50 per cent of the company’s total profit (see Exhibit 1).COLIN had a flat organizational structure. The interdepartmental relationships ran in parallel. Under the general manager of the company were seven senior vice-president positions: sales marketing finance research and development (R&D) operations supply chain and quality. These senior vice-presidents led their respective teams to perform their functions (see Exhibit 2).COLIN had its own industrial design and R&D group and had 20 years’ experience in garment steamer product development; however COLIN did not manufacture the products it developed. The garment steamer manufacturing was outsourced to OEM suppliers in mainland China. Each year COLIN developed approximately 10 new garment steamer products. The product development lead time for a new product with a medium degree of complexity was approximately 10 months: two months for the design quotation supplier selection and design finalization; two months for tooling fabrication; two months for production of the first component article product qualification tests and certification; two months for the component and assembly pilot and production; and a final two months for product shipment to the distribution centre and to retail stores. During the entire development period the COLIN project team at the U.S. headquarters were in intensive communication with both the OEM suppliers and COLIN’s subsidiary corporation project team in Zhongshan Guangdong Province China. The OEM suppliers COLIN selected and co-operated with had vertical manufacturing ability which meant they could complete the entire manufacturing process in house from the manufacturing of the component parts to the assembly of the finished goods. In this way the product quality could be controlled to the highest degree. When a new product needed to be developed COLIN’s R&D team created the design internally then the sourcing leader sent the design drawings to the OEM suppliers for their production price quotation. In general COLIN selected the supplier based on factors such as cost quality speed of delivery and service.COLIN also developed some original design manufacturer (ODM) projects sometimes working with existing OEM suppliers and sometimes with other finished-goods suppliers. When a customer needed a new product but COLIN’s internal design resources were occupied or the product was targeted at an open price point (OPP) internal development did not provide any cost advantage and COLIN would then move into ODM development model. Annually COLIN’s work was made up of approximately 70 per cent OEM projects and 30 per cent ODM projects (see Exhibit 3).The Bristol projectAccording to Shawn the Bristol project was one of COLIN’s most promising projects. It could finally resolve the most common customer complaint about garment steamer products: steam did not last long under low temperatures. With the currently available garment steamer products when the set-up temperature was low steam would begin to drip after one minute; when the set-up temperature was high there was a potential risk that the hot steam could damage clothing. The Bristol product was designed to use dual heater plates but a single heater system which avoided incurring a large cost and maintained a constant steam under low temperatures. COLIN had a patent on this new technology.The Bristol was targeted at a unit price of US$109 which made it a mid-priced product although its function would be superior to similarly priced products offered by COLIN’s competitors. If the Bristol could be launched according to plan in fiscal year 2017 it would lead to estimated sales of $20 million which was very high for the first year of a product’s launch.Shawn led COLIN’s retail market team and knew that consumers always wanted to see different and special products. She had been employed at COLIN for eight years; she worked the first two years in the sales department and then moved to the marketing department. In an attempt to meet customers’ changing needs garment steamer brands were constantly innovating—offering new functions new materials new technologies or a new appearance. Retailers such as Kmart and Costco annually reviewed the new products available. Any underperforming products were replaced by new products that offered better sales potential. Shawn commented that “If our company cannot deliver new product on time and the [currently available] product doesn’t perform well then our display shelf will be distributed to our competitors. We can see severe competition and how important it is to develop the new product on time.”Kmart was one of COLIN’S major retail customers. Purchasing manager Jamie Croce from Kmart was a very meticulous person: We plan to test sales in 500 stores. According to the test sales result we will determine whether to promote this product nationwide—in 2500 stores. We will leave the aisle shelf available to Bristol. The company’s website will introduce Bristol one month ahead of its in-store availability. We will also use Twitter Facebook to recommend this product. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects for us this year; anything going wrong will not be accepted.Achieving the development agreement with Kmart on the Bristol project was a milestone but Shawn had no time to celebrate. She felt that a tough journey had just started. One of her major concerns was the project timeline. Customers she communicated with about the Bristol project raised some critical-to-quality (CTQ) product factors such as steam volume and temperature which had all been revised. Kmart’s new-product internal review procedure was also very slow. Shawn had spent six months following the Bristol project’s progress which had recently been moving forward according to schedule.For the Bristol products to enter the market quickly Kmart required a one-month shorter launch time than for other OEM projects. Reducing the timelines by one month was a big problem as product development included many tasks: product design supplier selection component confirmation qualification and certification and mass production of the components and finished goods. In the end a shorter production development time would also affect product quality. If COLIN abandoned the Bristol project the discussion and collaboration with Kmart over the past six months would be lost and would become meaningless. Furthermore losing the project would affect the subsequent year’s total sales. However continuing with the project meant that the product might not be delivered on time which could lead both COLIN and Kmart to lose their reputations with customers. COLIN would also be penalized. “It is really a difficult choice” said Shawn.Shawn considered all the possible solutions such as seeking a supplier to complete the design so that COLIN could omit the first component article. Using the ODM supplier which was usually very fast could save time compared to going through the OEM project-development procedure. Alternatively could she identify opportunities to save time in the current OEM procedure? Could any tasks be worked on in parallel? Shawn felt she could not resolve this situation by herself; she decided to hold a Bristol project meeting and to consider the comments of other department leaders regarding how to complete this project on time.Current OEM project execution at COLINCOLIN currently had no dedicated project manager in new-project development. The Bristol project was being managed by a product manager from the marketing department (see Exhibit 4). Shawn’s team had four product managers: Sally Daniel Christa and Robert. Sally and Daniel had been with the company for 10 years and they worked well on project management. Christa and Robert had been with the company for three years and one year respectively and they were not as professional in their project management work. For example Shawn had attended a project meeting held by Christa and one of the engineers Kevin had argued with Christa. Kevin had doubted Christa’s project timeline and said he was too busy to complete Christa’s project design on time. Robert had also complained in front of Shawn about the project team he was leading. Sometimes the quality engineer and the design engineer differed on an issue and they were quick to argue with each other during project meetings. Their conflicts slowed the decision-making processes and affected the projects’ timelines.Under the current organizational structure product managers needed to spend much of their time doing product introductions maintaining customer relationships conducting market research and supporting the sales functions. They did not have enough time to perform their project management role. Delays in COLIN’s new-product development had become common. In the previous year COLIN had developed 12 projects and seven projects had been delayed. Some projects had been delayed due to the product manager’s overcommitment to a customer and some were delayed due to technical issues. The project timeline tracker had also not been developed very well. Sometimes when a project was developed to the middle stage someone suddenly discovered a task that needed to be done but had not been listed in the project’s timeline tracker. These problems led the project’s development time to exceed the time estimated in the original plan. In addition due to time zone differences when OEM suppliers in China encountered problems and their queries needed a response from the U.S. team they could not always receive a timely response and this led to more delays.COLIN’S OEM project management lacked a common set of expectations regarding processes (for example using weekly meetings or email communication to manage projects); instead the management format for each project depended on the project manager’s personal style. Some project managers were very proactive providing comments and suggestions and following the progress of projects’ development closely; but some project managers relied on other team members to allocate their time to work on projects and exhibited a weaker influence on project execution. Project timelines did not have buy-in from all team members and did not represent the progress of projects accurately.The quality of OEM products also varied. Among the engineering team some engineers had worked with the company for more than 20 years. The products they designed had fewer problems and their projects progressed relatively smoothly when moving to mass production. Some of the younger engineers however lacked design experience. The products they designed typically encountered more problems during the development stage which led to more customer complaints after the products were sold.Shawn and the R&D director Frank Pennings were both aware of these issues and they considered making changes to the current project management and product design processes; however other tasks always seemed to occupy their attention and they had not yet had sufficient time to think deeply about the next steps for improving the processes.COLIN’s suppliers and customersALICE CORPORATION (ALICE) one of COLIN’s major suppliers was located in Xiamen City Fujian Province China. Besides providing OEM and ODM garment steamer products to COLIN ALICE was also proactive in developing co-operative opportunities with other major garment care brands such as Koninklijke Philips NV (Philips) and the Bosch Group (Bosch)—the two leading brands in Europe and Mexico respectively—and Akai—the leading brand in the United States. These brands were COLIN’s direct competitors in the garment care business.COLIN also had a business segment that provided private-label products to large retail customers who had their own brands. For example Kmart had its own brand Natural which included clothing small home appliances and other household products. Kmart had no design team or manufacturing factory. Instead its private-label products were all supplied by business partners or ODM suppliers. The private-label business represented 5 per cent of COLIN’s business. COLIN purchased ODM products from its own suppliers and then supplied these private-label products to supermarkets or big retailers.Shawn had recently heard that representatives from Kmart and ALICE had been meeting to explore the possibility of Kmart purchasing its private-label products directly from ALICE; however Shawn was not overly concerned. In the past another of COLIN’s customers had gone to COLIN’s supplier to buy private-label products directly; however two years later the same customer had returned to COLIN. Shawn was confident that COLIN could provide customers with a one-stop solution because of its comprehensive capabilities in R&D project management supply chain management and customer service. Customers that worked with COLIN needed only to clearly communicate what they wanted and COLIN would take care of everything. However customers that went directly to the ODM suppliers needed to spend much time discussing product specifications and CTQ requirements following up on the product development progress performing quality audits for each shipment from suppliers and dealing with customer service and complaints regarding product quality. If customers compared only the unit cost then going directly to the manufacturer plants would lead to savings; however if they considered the total cost and service efficiency COLIN was the more reasonable choice for private-label products. BUREY CORPORATION (BUREY) another supplier that had long co-operated with COLIN was located in Zhongshan City Guangzhou Province China. BUREY had a world-class operating facility and could provide large quantities of high-quality products within a short time. During its long co-operation with COLIN BUREY had always maintained a high service level. Since it had a substantial manufacturing capacity and consistent high-quality performance BUREY also provided private-label products to Kmart. However these private-label products were basic models only not innovative products. Compared with ALICE BUREY was weaker at R&D. It lacked core patents and competitively innovative products. BUREY mainly completed the manufacturing process in accordance with the customer’s design.The Executive MeetingShawn held a two-hour meeting to discuss the Bristol project and invited her colleagues from R&D sourcing quality and marketing. She began by reviewing the background of the Bristol project the customers’ CTQ factors the expected launch time and the current difficulties. She then asked the team to provide their comments.The R&D director Frank Pennings was the first speaker: We need to consider the Bristol project very carefully. We should make sure we have enough time and resources to complete this project. If we just speed through this project and push the timing even skipping some necessary steps it will be very risky for product quality. In recent years our NPI [new product introduction] timing has been getting shorter and shorter meanwhile product quality is becoming more unsteady. Use Orono as an example. Usually a garment steamer new-product development needs around 10 months. But Orono only took eight and a half months under pressure from the customer. Although we launched that project on time we received a complaint about a dripping issue soon after it launched. In order to resolve this issue we had to improve the design rework the finished goods and compensate the consumer. Our spending has exceeded US$500000 for this quality issue. We cannot develop a project  similar to Orono at whatever condition. The Orono project Pennings mentioned was developed in 2014; in order to meet a customer’s timeline request the project was rushed to market. At the beginning the marketing department had a very positive forecast for this project and the sales potential was good but almost within a day Orono encountered customer complaints. Sales marketing sourcing quality and engineering—all departments—were pulled in to this emergency. Even today the customer service team continued to receive complaints from end users about the Orono product dripping issue. “Let’s think about whether  we move ahead or put a hold on the Bristol project” Pennings emphasized. Shawn responded to Pennings’ opinions promptly:Although the Orono project was not developed successfully we have held several meetings to talk about it and summarized its failure reasons such as lacking customer CTQ [elements] lacking a full qualification test; communication with suppliers was not clear. Now if we develop the Bristol project we can just refer to the lessons we learned on the Orono project. This year our new projects’ quantities are not so high. If we give up the Bristol project now the new product contribution to sales will be below our target. In addition our competitor Akai has already posted advertisements on what they will launch—a new garment steamer with constant steam. As far as I know it is similar to our Bristol project. If we don’t launch Bristol this year some end users who want to buy our brand will move to Akai. This will be harmful for our brand and our sales. COLIN has been a market leader for a long time. We don’t want to be a follower.Sally voiced her concerns: “If we decide to move on the Bristol project how can we select the proper supplier? Are we going to use OEM or ODM for this project? Can we meet the launch deadline?” Shawn found that the meeting was filled with questions and she tried to steer the discussion to resolving the deeper issues.Simon Suffert the senior sourcing manager spoke up:Could we ask ALICE and BUREY to quote on the Bristol project? Let’s see their proposed timeline then make a final decision. BUREY has done some private-label business with Kmart; ALICE has also developed many ODM projects with us before. Their capability is trustworthy. We can rely on them to do ODM design and our engineer can take responsibility for the qualification and certification. If that works I have full confidence that ALICE and BUREY can meet the project timeline. The Newport project was developed in that model and the timeline was shortened by about one month. Pennings reminded Suffert The Newport project was quite simple; the steam volume was not adjustable. That product didn’t need to move. It was an OPP [opening price point] product. Bristol is an MPP [medium price point] product. It has four wheels and is the first product that can supply constant steam under low temperatures. If we choose to go with ODM we cannot control the detail design and the risk of quality problems will increase.Sally commented:Supplier selection needs to be considered together with the project development model. If we decide to go with ODM and shorten the lead time we may go with ALICE. They already had a product with a constant steamer feature on sale in the U.S. market for a year. The product connects with power and achieves a pre-set temperature and the steam brush will release constant steam. Our patented feature is that our product has a button to control the steam on and off. Regarding the operational experience COLIN’s patent will be superior to ALICE’s patent. But ALICE’s product is also acceptable as we learned during market research.Shawn who was sensitive to the project’s timeline responded:If ALICE has already had a similar product for sale and has a patent to shorten the Bristol timeline and meet our sales target why don’t we just leverage their patent? Our patent hasn’t been applied on a physical product yet. Wouldn’t doing so just represent a higher risk? If ALICE could just change the product appearance to Bristol and share the existing components from their current products wouldn’t that be a good way to speed up the time to market?Pennings who was reluctant to choose the ODM option commented: If we go with ALICE’s patent in order to share the service part we would have to change our design direction for the next round of new products and still use ALICE’s patent for our constant steam product series. If this happens we will be in a very passive position. If ALICE choses to implement a price increase next year we would be forced to accept. And if we go with ODM but give ALICE our patent there is no doubt that we will grow our competitor. But if we insist on using our own patent with the OEM option we can easily move to other OEM suppliers if ALICE has any cost or service issues.Although COLIN’s dual heating plate patent had not yet been applied on a physical product the application of the new technology would still take time. Based on his technical experience Pennings was confident that COLIN could realize this process on the Bristol project in the standard 10 months’ development time. Luis Almanza from the quality department had his own view:In the past we have only run the ODM option with the OPP product and the sales were relative small. According to the sales forecast Bristol’s annual sales will be over 200000 units. We should pay high attention to the quality risk. As I heard although ALICE’s product has been selling for a year they sold only about 2000 units. This small quantity cannot prove any product quality reliability.Final DecisionListening to the heated discussion Shawn fell quiet. In what direction should the project go? She needed to come to a decision as soon as possible. The meeting had lasted almost two hours and still no agreement had been made. How should COLIN move to the next step? Shawn looked out the window of the meeting room at the bright spring day outside. She took another deep breath.Exhibit 1: COLIN CORPORaTE’s Income Statements 2015–2016 (in US$ million)Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: COLIN corporate’s Company structureNote: VP = vice-presidentSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: COLIN Brand garment steamerSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: COLIN corporate’s Project teamNote: R&D = research and development; QE = quality engineer.Source: Company files.

This note provides a guide to options trading for entry-level traders and represents a logical next stage to the note An Introduction to the Pricing of Options. The note reviews characteristics of options and the factors affecting their valuation and outlines several trading mechanisms that new options traders might use as they seek their most effective strategies. These mechanisms include long call short put bull call spread short call long put bear put spread short straddle short strangle long butterfly long straddle and long strangle. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION Options are financial products that derive their value from an underlying asset. They are leveraged financial instruments that allow traders to make a higher return on a smaller outlay than they might make by investing directly in the underlying asset. Options give traders increased exposure to changes in the value of the underlying asset; that is traders can profit and lose more with an option than with the underlying asset itself.Options are bought and sold. A buyer is said to take an option and is thus referred to as a taker. A seller is said to write the option and is thus referred to as the writer.There are two types of options: call options (calls) and put options (puts). Calls give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) before or at the expiration date of the option. Puts on the other hand give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date. Both calls and puts share the same uniform characteristics: premiums maturity strike price an underlying asset and option style.OPTION CHARACTERISTICSPremiumA premium is the amount a buyer pays to receive the option; that amount changes on a daily basis. When a trader buys an option (takes a long position) the trader pays the premium. When a seller writes an option (takes a short position) the seller receives the premium. The premium compensates the option seller for taking on the risks associated with writing the option.The premium for an option is the sum of the option’s intrinsic and time values. The intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. The time value represents the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the possibility that the market will move before the option expires. As the amount of time available decreases the opportunity to become profitable declines; this decline in value is referred to as time decay. Time value is influenced by several factors: market volatility time to expiry future dividends and interest rates.Maturity Maturity is the time remaining between the date the option is purchased and the date the option expires. The majority of options bought and sold have a maturity of a month. However the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) list both options that expire in a month and those that expire in a week providing traders with a choice of maturity. When deciding on a trading strategy traders need to consider when and over how much time (the time period) their predicted event or movement will occur. As the needed amount of time increases (the maturity gets longer) the associated premium increases because the option writer takes on a greater risk. Strike PriceStrike price is the predetermined price a buyer will pay if exercising the option to purchase the underlying asset. The strike price is locked in with the options contract. For instance on August 19 2016 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) stock was trading at A$73.12. Assume a trader believed the share price was going to rise so took a long position in a call option—that is took an option to purchase the underlying asset—with a strike price of $73.00. The trader would have the right to buy CBA shares at $73.00 regardless of the market price up to the option’s expiry date.Underlying AssetEach option derives its value from an underlying asset. Options on both the ASX and the CBOE derive their value from either equities or indexes. The CBA example discussed above under “Strike Price” would be classified as an equity option because the option value is derived from an individual company’s stock. In contrast the value of an index option is derived from the underlying index (e.g. S&P500). Options less frequently use commodities as the underlying asset; commodities traders prefer trading with other derivative instruments such as futures and forwards. Option StyleThere are two option styles available on the ASX: American and European. An American style option allows the option holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiry date; European style options in contrast can only be exercised at maturity. Index options are all European style while equity options can be either style based on trader preferences. CBOE equity options are all American style. American and European style options are the most frequently used styles; however there are numerous other styles. The styles vary mainly in terms of the rights to exercise the options; for example a Canary option allows the option holder to exercise the option at quarterly dates but not before a set period of time has elapsed. Another a Bermudan option gives the holder the right to exercise the option a set number of times prior to maturity. Contract SizeAll single stock options traded on the ASX have an initial standardized contract size of 100 underlying shares. On rare occasions the contract size may be adjusted to compensate for corporate actions on the underlying asset such as issuing new shares. In general a standardized contract size means a trader who has purchased a call option on CBA stock would have the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 CBA shares at the predetermined price any time up to the option’s maturity. Index options (e.g. XJO) are usually standardized at an index multiplier of $10 per index point movement.Equity options traded on CBOE also have a standard contract size of 100 shares; however their index options have varying amounts for the index multiplier dependent on the underlying index. Factors Influencing Option Price and ValueThere are several factors that affect the value and price of an option. When investing directly in an equity the trader’s only concern is price movement: did the share increase or decrease in price? The value of an option however depends on several factors: volatility intrinsic value movement of the underlying asset price expiry date interest rate changes and dividends.Volatility Volatility captures the variation in price expected in the underlying equity or in the case of index options the variation in the underlying index. The variation is measured by the standard deviation of returns; that is how much the price or index deviates from the mean. When an underlying equity asset is highly volatile the share price fluctuates widely increasing the chances that the anticipated price of the shares will be reached. The premium paid for the option is thus greater. When the implied volatility is low the price for the underlying equity is predicted to be reasonably constant and the premium paid for the option will be less. As implied volatility increases the value of both calls and puts increases and as implied volatility decreases option values decrease accordingly. The ASX and CBOE each have real-time volatility indices (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The ASX has the A-VIX which reflects expectations about volatility in Australia’s equity index the S&P/ASX 200 VIX. The CBOE tracks the Volatility Index (VIX) which is based on the S&P 500 Index. Both the A-VIX and the VIX provide insight to expectations of market volatility and the sentiment of futures traders. The A-VIX has a strong negative correlation (inverse relationship) with the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index (see Exhibit 3) and is therefore a useful tool for assessing the market trend and anticipated changes in volatility.Intrinsic Value The intrinsic value of an option is largely dependent on the strike price set in the option.If on August 19 2016 when the market price of CBA was $73.50 a trader took a long call position on CBA stock with a strike price of $65.00 the intrinsic value of the option would have been $8.50 (the difference between the market and strike prices). When a share price on the market is greater than the strike price in a call option (as in this example) the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). Option buyers pay a high premium for this valuable option.If on the same day another trader took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $73.50 the current market price and the strike price would be the same. This call option would be considered to be “at the money” (ATM). ATM options have no intrinsic value but because the market price is almost certainly going to change over time ATM options have the greatest time value. A premium for an ATM option is usually less than the premium for an ITM option. In the final scenario if yet another a trader on the same day took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $75.00 the current market price would be less than the strike price. When the strike price is higher than the market price the call option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). OTM options have no intrinsic value and have a smaller chance of success than ITM or ATM options. OTM options require the most price movement in the underlying asset to be ITM. The premium on an OTM option is significantly less than the premiums for ITM and ATM options. Therefore the advantage to buying an OTM option is the potential even if small for a significant return on a very low premium. Movement of the Underlying Asset PriceThe price movements of the underlying asset play a key role in determining the value of an option. If the price of the underlying asset is increasing the value of a call option (the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a fixed lower price) increases and the value of a put option (the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a below market price) decreases. When the price of an underlying asset is decreasing the opposite is true: the value of call options decreases and the value of put options increases.Expiry DateThe more time there is before an option expires the greater the chance the option will end ITM. Time decay (decline in the opportunity to become profitable) has the greatest negative impact on the value of an option. Typically an option loses one-third of its time value in the first half of its life and the remaining two-thirds of time value in its second half. An OTM option approaching expiry will suffer the greatest drop in value. Interest Rate Changes Interest rate changes have a small but measurable impact on option prices. When interest rates increase call premiums increase and put premiums decrease. This occurs because call buyers have the right to purchase the underlying asset at any time up to expiry; until they decide to exercise their option (or not) call buyers can invest their funds at higher yielding risk-free rates. Call buyers in this case are earning income while holding the option. Put prices decrease because put buyers have the right to sell the underlying asset any time up to maturity. They are holding the underlying asset so do not have the ability to invest their funds at higher risk-free rates. Traders in this case have the benefit of purchasing put options at a lower premium.DividendsOption prices are affected by anticipated dividends to be paid on the underlying asset within the option’s term (i.e. before expiry). The general consensus is that when a dividend is paid out on a stock the share price will drop in proportion to the dividend paid. Therefore if a dividend of an underlying asset increases during the term of the option the value of the underlying asset will likely decrease before the option expires. This affects the option’s premium: call premiums decrease and put premiums increase. (When assessing the impact of dividends it is important to remember that a share’s ex-dividend date—the date when a declared dividend belongs to the holder of the stock—is usually earlier than the date the dividend payment will be made.)Option Value Sensitivity MeasuresDelta is a sensitivity measure comparing the change in an option’s price to the change in the price of the underlying asset. We can estimate the likely change in an option’s price by multiplying the underlying asset price change by the option’s delta. Delta also infers the intrinsic value of an option and constantly changes with price movements in the underlying asset.All call options have a delta range of zero to one. A delta below 0.5 implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly 0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta above 0.5 implies the option is ITM.All put options have a delta range of zero to negative one. A delta above −0.5 (approaching zero) implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly −0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta below −0.5 (approaching negative one) implies the option is ITM.Vega is also a sensitivity measure. It measures the impact of changes in the underlying asset’s volatility on the option’s price. The vega of an option represents the amount that an option’s contract changes in relation to a 1 per cent change in the underlying asset’s volatility.Besides delta and vega there are other “Greeks” measuring option sensitivities. For example theta measures the change in an option’s price as the number of days until expiration decreases; theta is usually measured by one day. Rho measures an option’s change in premium if interest rates move by a specified percentage. Gamma measures the option’s delta change if the underlying asset moves by a specified percentage. (Further information on options Greeks is available on ASX’s website.)Options at ExpirationWhen an option expires—which for monthly single stock contracts listed on the ASX is every Thursday before the last Friday of the month and on the CBOE is the third Friday of the month—the option holder faces three alternatives: exercise the option sell the option or roll the option into another option if the held option is ATM or ITM. If the held option is OTM at expiration the option expires worthless. Tree diagrams demonstrate the call and put option holder’s choices at expiration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Market Participants Options market participants include hedgers speculators arbitrageurs and market makers. Hedgers use options to reduce the risks associated with market uncertainty. Speculators use options to leverage into a position to capture gains based on the direction they believe a market is going. Arbitrageurs exploit imperfections and inefficiencies in the market often at very high speeds to make money. Market makers trade volatility (vega) as opposed to market movements (delta). Traders normally fall into the categories of hedgers or speculators. Brokers and dealers represent investors and place orders on their behalf for execution on the exchange (central market).There are four types of trades that an options market participant can make:Buy a call.Sell a call.Buy a put.Sell a put.Option holders called buyers or takers can choose whether or not to exercise the option. These participants could be hedging their current shareholdings from price risk or they could be investing in these leveraged derivatives to get greater exposure to the predicted price movement in their underlying asset. Losses for option holders are limited to the premium paid for the option (if the option expires OTM); however option holders have the potential to earn unlimited profits if the option expires ITM.Option providers called sellers or writers provide option holders with the right to exercise the option. That means that option providers are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder decides to exercise the option. Thus option providers limit their profit to the premium received for providing the option; however they have potentially unlimited losses if the option expires ITM (with the market price higher than the strike price). For this reason option sellers are required to lodge a margin to ensure they can meet their obligations if an undesirable outcome occurs. Exhibits 6 7 8 and 9 provide profit and payoff diagrams of the four options trades. The four trade types when combined in different ways create different strategies for trading options.ANALYSESAn options trader needs to be able to make a market prediction and set an investment goal before selecting a trading strategy.Market Prediction: What do you think will occur in the future?An options trader must first predict what will happen to an underlying asset over a given period. Most traders will use some type of analysis whether it be fundamental or technical to determine what they believe will happen to an underlying asset whether a stock or an index. The analysis should consider when and over what period of time the underlying asset is expected to move. For example a trader’s prediction may be linked to a type of planned market announcement such as company results or to a piece of economic news such as a change to the reserve bank cash rate.Once the investment period and expected price movement are calculated traders need to add their own (or their investors’) risk profiles to the decision to decide what strike price and maturity to use within an options strategy. It is fair to say that the more a trader risks the more a strategy will return.Investment Goal: What are you trying to accomplish using options?Knowing what is wanted from an investment will reduce the number of option strategies to those appropriate for reaching the desired goal. An investor may want to protect the value of held shares in the event the market goes down or an investor may want to earn extra income from held stocks while markets are flat. To illustrate these goals assume the market analysis indicates stock XYZ will rise 2 per cent in the next four months (the prediction) and the investor wants to earn extra income (the goal). A trader could sell a 102 per cent strike call option with a maturity of four months meaning the option holder can purchase the investor’s shares at 102 per cent of their value at any point during or at the end of the four months. The prediction is that the investor will not have to sell the shares (because the market and strike price are the same) and the investor earns the premium paid by the option buyer. However if the analysis is slightly out—say for example the investor’s stock goes up 2.5 per cent—the option holder will exercise the option to purchase the shares and the investor will need to deliver them meaning the investor will have sold the stock at a loss. If the trader was writing a call option to gain income on a stock position this would not be the desired result. To reduce the risk of the option being exercised (also called “assigned”) and keep the underlying stock the trader may want to consider writing a call option with a shorter maturity date (three months) or a higher strike price (103 per cent) or possibly both. In either case the option premium would be less.Tools for AnalysisTraders now have multiple tools they can use to analyze option strategies and choose which are the best to use under certain conditions. An example of one of these tools is the ASX/TradeFloor options trading simulator which was developed to help first-time options traders understand how options work. Within this application traders can review stocks they are interested in build different option strategies based on their views of where an underlying asset may trade in the future and manage their portfolios. The application allows traders to investigate the payoffs and risk profiles of using different strategies while also allowing the trader to see how a particular risk profile of a given strategy changes when using different strike prices and maturities.Fundamental AnalysisFundamental analysis involves evaluating the intrinsic value of a company. It involves the use of balance sheets financial reports cash flow statements public announcements earnings reports and all publicly available information to establish an opinion about the direction and outlook of the company. There are numerous methods for determining a fair share value; that value can then be compared to the current market price which in turn signals the direction of price movement. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) provides information about the earnings attributable to each outstanding share. This ratio is easily calculated by dividing a company’s net profit after tax by its total number of shares outstanding. Traders prefer an EPS to be growing at a consistent rate which suggests a bullish outlook while a decreasing ratio implies a bearish outlook. Price to Earnings RatioThe price to earnings (P/E) ratio provides information about a company’s growth prospects and indicates whether the company’s shares are currently over under or fairly priced. The ratio is calculated by dividing the share’s current market price by its EPS. In isolation the P/E ratio is meaningless; for meaningful information a company’s P/E ratio needs to be compared to that of a similar company. The P/E growth (PEG) ratio further aids in determining whether an equity is under- or overpriced. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected rate of growth in EPS. A PEG ratio close to 2 suggests that the stock is overpriced and a PEG ratio of 1 suggests the stock may be fair value. DividendsWhen analyzing a company the trader must determine whether the company pays a regular dividend on the equity. A dividend that is maintained or increased from the previous year signals to the market that the company is in good financial health. A dividend that is reduced signals that the company does not have sufficient profits each year to pay its shareholders. To calculate a dividend per share ratio divide the sum set aside for dividends by the number of shares outstanding.Dividend yield is a good method for comparing dividends paid out from companies in similar industries. To calculate dividend yield divide the dividend payout per share by the current share price. Companies with growing dividend yields suggest a bullish outlook and companies with decreasing yields suggest a bearish outlook. Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) provides information about how well a company is using shareholders’ funds. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s after-tax profit by the shareholders’ equity. A high ROE suggests that management is making good use of shareholders’ funds while a low ROE suggests the contrary.Earnings ReportsIt is essential to know when companies are due to release any earnings reports or announcements. These releases can have a profound effect on share price. If a company were to report mass losses for a quarter the information could initiate a massive sell-off in the market which would cause a large drop in share price. Alternatively the company could publish profits higher than expected which would cause an increased demand for the company’s shares and hence a rise in share price. Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis consists of studying past market data specifically the price and volume to predict future price direction. There are a vast number of technical indicators that traders use to forecast price movements. In this note we will focus on the use of trend lines Bollinger bands moving average convergence divergence and relative strength indicators to evaluate a company.Trend Lines Trend lines are highly suggestive of the direction a stock price will move. Support and resistance lines are established for the desired period of time: the support line illustrates the lowest price traders believe the share will fall to and the resistance line indicates the highest share price traders believe the share will earn. Technical analysts believe that a share will trade between the two lines and that the price is unlikely to fall below a support line or rise above the resistance line. Analysts believe that if a resistance or support line is broken once it is broken the share price will continue in the direction of the breakout requiring a new resistance or support line to be established (see Exhibit 10).There are numerous patterns that technical analysts seek with trend lines (see Exhibits 11 and 12 for uptrend and downtrend respectively). An ascending triangle occurs when an up-trending support line approaches a flat resistance line. This suggests the share may well make a sharp move upward for an explosive breakout. A descending triangle where the down-trending resistance line approaches a flat support line signals the opposite—a large price drop (see Exhibit 13 for a descending trend line). Bollinger Bands Bollinger bands are used to establish a share’s short-term prices. The indicator is created by plotting the average predetermined number of prices. Two trading bands are then added representing the standard deviation of the share price one band above (the highest price) and the other below (the lowest price) the centre line. Simply adding and subtracting one standard deviation from the moving average creates the outer bands. Under normal market conditions the price of a security will trade within the bands. The bands will expand as the share price becomes more volatile and contract as volatility decreases.Bollinger bands help establish common trends. Periods of high volatility (expansion) tend to follow periods of low volatility (contraction). When the price of a share crosses the upper Bollinger band analysts believe the share is overbought and the price is due for a correction with a drop (a pullback). When the price crosses the lower band analysts believe the security is oversold and a price correction back up to its true value (rally back) is imminent (see Exhibit 14).Moving Average Convergence DivergenceMoving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that analysts use to establish a buy or sell signal. MACD illustrates the relationship between two moving price averages. The MACD is the result of subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD termed a signal line is then plotted on top of the MACD. When the MACD falls below the signal line it is a bearish signal. When the MACD rises above the signal line it is a bullish signal (see Exhibit 15). Relative Strength IndicatorA relative strength indicator (RSI) is also a momentum indicator; it compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to gauge the speed and change of a share’s price movements. RSI is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. If RSI values cross above 70 it is believed that the security is overbought and due for a pullback in price. If the RSI values cross below 30 the share is believed to be oversold and a price increase is due (see Exhibit 16).Option StrategiesThere are many option strategies available for varying market conditions. We will analyze a select few strategies for bullish bearish neutral and event-driven situations. It is important to understand the risks involved with trading options. Buying an option with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset will increase limits the buyer’s potential loss to the premium paid for the option. Providing or writing an option however exposes the trader to the potential of unlimited losses; for that reason the provider must have a margin account containing collateral. To analyze the selected strategies we will focus on the construction margin requirement market outlook and profit and loss of the strategies. For the purpose of explanation a hypothetical strike prices has been added for the following strategies. Bullish ViewBullish strategies do better in a rising market. They usually involve buying call options and selling put options to benefit from increasing asset prices.Long Call (see Exhibit 6)When a trader expects the price of the underlying stock to rise the bought call can provide leveraged exposure to the price increase. Buying a call also locks in a maximum purchase price for the life of the option.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will rise above A; volatility increasing.Profit: Unlimited profit potential if share price continues to rise (see Exhibit 6). Loss: Limited to premium paid.Break-even: Share price = strike price + premium paid.Intuition: Share price will rise above A; the call option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Effect of time decay works against the buyer of the call. If the expected rise in share price does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will erode the value of the option. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the cost of the option against the rise in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest rise in share price. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the best balance of risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for the share price to rise and will be more expensive than a shorter-term option. The trader needs to decide when and over what period of time the share price is expected to move. If the rise in share price takes place as expected the option buyer must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not rise as expected it is often advisable to exercise the option (“close out the position”) and recover some time value on the investment. If the option is ITM when it expires the trader must choose whether to sell the option or exercise it. The choice will be determined by whether the trader wants to own the underlying shares.Bull Call SpreadIf the trader is not bullish enough to buy a call outright but expects the share price to rise moderately the bull spread is a lower-cost way to gain exposure to such a market movement. The strategy consists of the simultaneous purchase of a call option (“long leg of the spread”) and sale of a call option with a higher strike price (“short leg of the spread”) but with the same expiration date.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A and sell a call at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish; market price to rise; volatility steady to rising.Profit: Limited to the difference between A and B (spread) less the premium paid for the spread.Loss: Limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = lower strike price + cost of spread.Intuition: Bought call A will be ATM (hence costly); therefore sell an OTM call with higher strike price B to receive a premium that reduces the overall cost of the strategy.Other points of consideration:The bull spread has limited risk and limited reward. It is a cheaper strategy than simply buying a call option. As a result the profit potential is reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is worth the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting will be greater for this strategy than when buying a call outright.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the option will cost money; however if the stock is trading around the higher strike price the option will make money.If the stock unexpectedly rises sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the upper strike price is reached. Although time value is helpful around the strike price of the short call unwinding the strategy early removes the risk that the short call will be exercised. If the stock price falls suddenly the spread may be unwound before the long call loses too much time value.Consider the bull spread when expecting a limited rise in the price of the stock. Do not enter the call options separately (“leg in” to the strategy). Enter the trade as a spread and unwind it as a spread. Bearish ViewBearish strategies work best in falling markets. Bearish strategies generally rely on buying put options to lock in selling prices as asset prices decrease.Long Put (see Exhibit 8)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to fall the bought put provides leveraged exposure to the price fall. Buying a put option is one of the few ways traders can speculate on a falling share price. Put options may also be used to protect an investor’s holding in the underlying stock.Construction: Buy one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to fall below A; volatility rising.Profit: Limited to strike price less premium paid for the option (see Exhibit 8).Loss: Limited to premium paid for the option.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium paid.Intuition: Share price will drop below strike price A; the put option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Time decay works against the buyer of the put. If the expected share price fall does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option. When setting the strike price the trader must balance the cost of the option against the fall in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest fall in share price. If the trader is buying a put to protect a shareholding the cost of the option must be weighed against the required protection. The ITM option locks in the highest sale price for the underlying shares but is also the most expensive option.If the fall in share price takes place as expected the put option taker must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not fall as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to recover some time value.At expiry the holder of an ITM put option will usually close out rather than exercise the position (unless the holder owns the underlying shares). If the put has been bought to protect a shareholding the trader must decide whether to continue holding the stock in which case the put would be sold or sell the shares in which case the option would be exercised.Short Call (see Exhibit 9)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to go down the sold call can provide leveraged exposure to the price reduction. Selling a call does not limit the trader’s potential loss so it carries a greater risk profile than purchasing a put.Construction: Sell one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bearish; share price will go below strike price A; volatility neutral to reducing.Profit: Maximum profit is premium received for providing the option (see Exhibit 9).Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received. Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed.Other points of consideration:Time decay works for the seller of the call. If the expected share price reduction does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option to the seller’s advantage. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the premium received on the option against the reduction in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will obtain the lowest premium but also carries the lowest chance of loss. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the highest risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for a reduction in the share price to take place. It will generate a higher premium but it carries a greater risk of the market moving against the trader. The trader needs to identify the time period over which the share price movement is expected to take place. If the share price reduction takes place as expected the call option taker will normally not exercise the option. However if the stock price is ATM or ITM and the taker exercises the option the writer must deliver the stock.If the share price does not reduce as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to remove the risk of assignment if not already holding the underlying shares. This is called a “naked” position since you hold an option on shares you do not own and would have to acquire these shares if the option were exercised. Assignment risk brings the uncertainty associated with the pricing and timing of acquiring the shares before you can sell them.  Bear Put SpreadThe bear spread can be considered when the trader expects a moderate fall in the market but is not prepared to take a put position outright. The strategy consists of the purchase of a put option (“long leg”) and the sale of a put option with a lower strike price (“short leg”).Construction: Sell one put at strike price A and buy one put at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to expire below strike price A; volatility steady to increasing.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the difference between A and B (the spread) less the premium paid.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = upper strike − cost of spread.Intuition: Purchased put B will be ATM—hence fairly costly. Therefore sell an OTM put with a lower strike price A to receive a premium which decreases the total net cash outlay. Once the share price drops below strike price A the profit is capped. (A short position creates a loss; however this is counterbalanced by the purchased put being deep ITM.)Other points of consideration:The bear spread has limited risk and limited reward. It costs less to place than an outright purchase of a put option. As a result the potential for profit is also reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is justified by the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting can significantly reduce profitability.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the impact of time decay will be positive and you will make money due to the strategy; if the stock is trading around the higher strike it will cost money to hold the strategy.If the stock unexpectedly falls sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the lower strike price is reached. Time decay will benefit the spread around the lower strike price; however the trader will usually be more concerned with avoiding exercise on the short leg.If the stock price rises suddenly the spread may be unwound before the taken put loses too much time value.Use the bear spread when you are expecting a limited fall in the underlying stock. Do not leg in to this strategy; rather trade both options at the same time. Neutral ViewNeutral strategies work best in stagnant markets. They often involve balancing the purchase and sale of both call and put options to take advantage of any changes in underlying asset prices.Short Put (see Exhibit 7)The written put can provide the trader with extra income in flat to rising markets. It can also be used as a way to buy stock cheaply. This strategy is generally used when the trader expects the share price to remain steady or increase slightly over the life of the option.Construction: Sell one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will expire above A; volatility falling.Profit: Limited to premium received (see Exhibit 7).Loss: Maximum loss equals strike price A less premium received.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received.Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed. Other points of consideration:Many traders write put options as a way of buying stock cheaply. If the share price falls and the option is exercised the purchase price is effectively the strike price of the option less the premium received which is less than the price of the stock at the time of writing the option. If the share price at expiry is above the strike price the option will expire worthless. The trader does not get to buy the stock but has benefited from the receipt of the premium. Time decay works in favour of the put writer. If the stock price stays steady the ATM option will deliver the most profit to the put writer because this is the option with the most time value. The put writer must be wary of exercising the option too early. Generally a put option is more likely than a call option to be exercised early. This strategy can result in heavy losses if the share price falls significantly. Puts should only be written if the seller has the financial capacity to buy the underlying shares should the option be exercised. Monitor the position closely. An ITM option will need to be closed to avoid exercise. Short StraddleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short straddle may be considered. This strategy has a higher potential profit than the short strangle; however it offers less protection since the share price remains within a tighter price range in order to profit. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Sell one call at A and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Neutral; share price will expire around A; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit limited to combined premium received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium received.Intuition: The break-even point for the sold call A is the strike price plus the premium received. For the sold put A the break-even point is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader expects the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option to expire worthless and the premiums received to be pocketed. Other points of consideration:The straddle yields higher potential profit than the strangle because of the higher premiums received for writing ATM options. However the strategy provides less protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price does not have to move as much before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. The short straddle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. There is high risk of early exercise on one of the written options making up the straddle because both the call and the put have the same exercise price. Unless the stock price closes at the strike level set in the options one of the options will be ITM and more than likely be exercised.The options trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down (by increasing or decreasing the strike prices in one of the options) thereby creating a strangle.Because the potential is for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. Do not choose distant expiry months. Short StrangleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short strangle may be considered. This strategy has a lower potential profit than the short straddle; however it offers greater protection because the share price must move further to cause a loss. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Sell one call at B and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: The option will expire between strike prices A and B; volatility falling.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the combined premiums received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium received; Share price = lower strike − premium received.Intuition: The intuition for the short straddle also applies here. The difference is that with the short strangle both options have distinctive strike prices. This extends the spread (bounds) within which the trader expects the share price to remain. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while the short straddle is better in a less volatile environment. Other points of consideration:The strangle yields lower potential profit than the straddle because the premiums are lower for writing OTM options. However the strategy provides better protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price has to move further before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. As with the short straddle the short strangle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options there is a lower risk of early exercise than for the straddle. However a dramatic change in the share price can bring one of the options ITM thereby introducing the risk of exercise. The option trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. By taking protection the short strangle is transformed into another strategy known as a “long condor.” If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down thereby maintaining the strangle. The trader should always be aware that although the short strangle is a more defensive strategy than the short straddle a sudden and extreme change in volatility can be very damaging.Because of the potential for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. A trader should use the short strangle over the short straddle if there are any doubts about the market’s neutrality. Do not choose expiry months that are too distant. Long ButterflyThe long butterfly can be used to generate extra income when the trader believes the market is stagnating but does not want to be exposed to an unexpected rise or fall. The strategy consists of buying one ITM and one OTM call and writing two ATM calls.Construction: Buy one call at A sell one call and one put at B and buy one put at C.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Neutral; market price will expire around B; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit will occur at strike price B.Break-even: Share price = lowest strike price (A) + the cost of strategy; Share price = central strike price (B) − the cost of strategy.Loss: The maximum loss is limited to the premiums paid for the strategy.Other points of consideration:The maximum profit from the long butterfly will be earned if the market finishes at the middle strike price when the options expire. In this case only the lower strike price call will finish ITM. Accordingly the trader will profit on the difference between the middle and lower strike prices less the cost of the spread. Most of this profit will develop in the last month as time decay accelerates. The most the trader can lose is the cost of the spread which will occur if the market finishes out past either “wing” of the long butterfly.The presence of short options in the strategy means that an increase in the market price above the central strike price introduces the risk of exercise. The long butterfly can be difficult to place in all but the most liquid stocks. The ATM options that are required on both sides are often thinly traded (exchanged in low volumes with limited interested traders) making the strategy difficult and sometimes costly to set up and trade out. In these circumstances the reward may not justify the effort of entering the position. If the share price remains steady the position may be left until close to expiry since the profit develops almost entirely in the last month.If the share price moves sharply up the trader may consider liquidating the position in order to avoid exercise. If the share price moves sharply down the trader may close out in order to salvage some time value from the taken options in the strategy.Be sure the rewards are sufficient to justify establishing the strategy in the first place. Do not use this strategy on thinly traded stocks. Enter the position with at least a month until expiry.Event Driven (Price Break Out)Long StraddleWhen the trader expects a sharp movement in the share price but is unsure of the direction the movement will take the long straddle may be appropriate. The strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Buy one call at A and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside; on the downside the maximum profit is limited to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium paid.Intuition: The break-even point for the bought call A is the strike price plus the premium received. The break-even for the bought put A is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader does not expect the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option value to increase. Other points of consideration:The bought straddle consists of two long positions. As a result time decay works strongly against the strategy. The longer the straddle is left in place the greater the loss due to time decay. The position must therefore be closely monitored and may need to be closed out well before expiry. The trader must balance the cost of the strategy against the time needed to give it the best chance of success. Distant expiry months will provide the strategy with more time; however longer-dated options will be more expensive than those with shorter dates. The taker of a straddle expects volatility in the market to increase. Only rarely will this strategy be held to expiry. If the trader’s market view proves correct the straddle should be unwound to crystallize the profits. The position can be liquidated on both sides simultaneously or if the OTM option has little value it could be left open in the event the market were to reverse.If volatility does not increase as expected the strategy should be unwound well ahead of expiry before time decay damages the position.Choose options over shares if the market is expected to remain or become volatile. Select an expiry month that gives the strategy time to work. Monitor the position closely and be prepared to unwind it well before expiry. Long StrangleWhen implied volatility is relatively low but the trader expects the stock price to make an explosive move buying a strangle may be appropriate. The strangle is cheaper than the straddle; however a larger move in the share price is required for the strangle to be profitable. The strategy consists of buying a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Buy one call at B and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium; Share price = lower strike − premium.Intuition: The intuition for the long straddle also applies to the long strangle. The difference is that both options have distinctive strike prices which broadens the spread (bounds) that the trader expects the share price to exceed. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while long straddle is more beneficial in a less volatile environment.Other points of consideration:As with the long straddle the long strangle is exposed to time decay. Since both options are OTM they consist entirely of time value. As expiry approaches time decay accelerates. For this reason the strangle is generally unwound well before expiry. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options it costs less than the straddle. The disadvantage is that the share price must move further for the strategy to be profitable. The trader must be expecting a significant move for the long strangle to be considered. If the expected increase in volatility or change in share price is not achieved both options will expire worthless.The strangle should not be held too close to expiry. If the expected move in the share price has taken place the position can usually be unwound at a profit well before expiry. If the stock’s direction becomes clear it may be appropriate to close out the option that is losing its value and continue to hold the profitable option.If the expected increase in volatility does not take place it may be advisable to close the position out before time decay starts to damage the strategy.Choose options over shares when the share price is expected to move strongly in either direction. Always be aware of the effects of time decay and do not hold the position too close to expiry. Choose expiry months that allow enough time for the underlying shares to move. ALTERNATIVES TO TRADING OPTIONSThere are a number of alternative products that can be used by traders to obtain a leveraged investment profile similar to that of options. These products include warrants futures and contracts for difference (CFDs).In order to compare the appropriateness of using an option instead of an alternative product the trader needs to consider the following questions:What is the delta exposure of the product and does this change?Can I write (short) the product?Is margin charged and if so to whom?Is the product traded on exchange or over the counter (OTC)?Who issues the product?How is the market price determined?WarrantsWarrants are very similar to options in that they have rights but not obligations to purchase or sell an underlying product at a given date. Warrants can also have varying degrees of delta just like options. However warrants are issued by companies either on exchange or OTC as opposed to exchange-traded options (ETOs) which are listed by the exchange. Traders cannot write warrants like they can options. Warrants normally have longer expiries than options. The issuer (or appointed market maker) of the warrant product is the only one allowed to write meaning the issuer dictates the price. Options allow all participants to buy and sell creating a more efficient market. Because warrants can only be purchased they do not require a margin to be lodged. ETOs also do not require a margin to be lodged if purchasing but they do require a margin if selling. FuturesFutures are highly leveraged products that give users the ability to hedge or speculate on price movements of an underlying product. The primary difference between options and futures is that an options contract contains the right to buy or sell the underlying asset; equity futures on the other hand are traditionally cash settled at expiry. Futures are a delta one product whereas options have a delta range of between minus one and one. Margins are required to be lodged against futures positions for both the long and short holder of the contract and this can change daily. For options only the seller is required to post a margin. Both futures and options are listed on exchanges and the market users set the prices. However in Australia retail access to trade futures is limited to available brokers as compared to traders’ access to options.CFDsA CFD is a varied futures style product that gives the holder delta one exposure to the underlying asset. The contract normally settles a cash amount between the buyer and seller daily based on the change to the value of the underlying asset over the day. This is separate from a daily change in margin. CFDs are traditionally highly leveraged and require margins to be posted. CFDs are traditionally traded on an OTC market where the market price is ultimately determined by the CFD provider. This can on occasion lead to variations in price from the true underlying market price. The cost for trading CFDs is normally less than for options and futures listed on a traditional exchange. A trader should be mindful though that CFDs are not suitable for a buy-and-hold strategy due to the daily interest changes being applied to the trader’s account based on the notional exposure. It is also important to note that the risks associated with CFDs are higher due to the less stringent regulatory framework in which CFD product providers operate.Considering the above options provide traders with greater flexibility than competing products. Options not only allow traders the ability to trade underlying movement (delta) but also volatility (vega). What this equates to is a marketplace where the buyer and seller can both benefit from a trade. In addition the strategies discussed earlier in the note can only be achieved using different combinations of options and this ultimately enables traders to achieve a better risk–return profile and a closer match to their goals for investment. EVALUATIONBefore implementing any strategy traders must determine what they think the market is going to do over a given period of time. Once the prediction is established traders can implement a corresponding strategy based on the market outlook for the respective equity (or index) to exploit the expected condition. Understanding how the respective market index is calculated and making use of the tools outlined above greatly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. In Australia the companies listed on S&P/ASX 200 are ranked based on market capitalization. The top 20 listed companies will affect the movement of the S&P/ASX 200 index more than the other companies. As previously noted the A-VIX is inversely correlated to the S&P/ASX 200. The A-VIX exhibits mean reversion (i.e. oscillates around a long-term average); hence a trader can try to predict where the market is heading and further anticipate the general direction of the top 20 equities that will cause the most likely trend. When implementing investment strategies traders must choose the strike price spread size and maturity month for the options. Strike prices are set according to the desired outcome; their intrinsic value is a key determinant in the premium paid. On a spread trade (where several calls and puts are employed) the respective option strike price creates the boundaries in which a trader expects the underlying asset to remain (or exceed). The majority of options are traded in the short term with outlooks of a month or two primarily because there is more certainty over the short term about an anticipated underlying trend. There are numerous online calculators that check the risk and potential profitability of an option’s position. The calculators make use of a simple Monte Carlo simulator that allows the trader to enter the current underlying asset market price the target price days remaining to expiry and the annual volatility percentage (from the respective volatility index). The results provide traders with information about the probability of the underlying asset being above or below the target price.Prior to implementing any strategy traders need to outline and understand the associated costs risks potential profit potential losses and potential impact of time decay on the strategy. The long call long put bull call spread bear put spread long straddle and long strangle are low-cost strategies that require no margin are easy to implement and provide the desired leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. The short call short put short strangle long butterfly and short straddle all require margin accounts because the risk involved with these strategies is higher. CONCLUSIONOptions trading strategies can result in great returns and can achieve a much better tailored risk profile than alternative products. An entry-level trader can use strategies that do not include margins are low cost and are relatively easy to implement. In order to be successful and achieve the best outcome traders must do the required pre-investment analysis and understand the factors that affect the value of the options.EXHIBIT 1: INDEX PRICES FOR S&P/ASX 200 VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 2: INDEX PRICES FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: INDEX PRICES FOR THE S&P/ASX 200 INDEX VERSUS A-VIXSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 4: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING CALL OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 5: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING PUT OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.

He had been in the library consulting Google for information about growth options for his newly developed social enterprise and he wondered how he was going to scale—to continue to make a difference in his community while ensuring the sustainability of the business. It was January 11 2014 and he could not believe that after coming so far he would find himself stuck without a clear way forward.BACKGROUNDNomjana did not belong at the University of Cape Town: he was not a staff member or registered student. His home was Khayelitsha 26 kilometres (km) from where he was standing. Khayelitsha was an informal township settlement on the large sandy plain known as the Cape Flats outside the city of Cape Town. Khayelitsha an isiXhosa word meaning “our new home” was a possibly ironic reference to the township’s establishment following forced removals during apartheid in the 1950s. Khayelitsha was the second-largest township in South Africa.According to the 2011 census Khayelitsha was home to over 390000 people; it occupied a densely populated area next to a main highway that ran east from Cape Town. It was a predominantly residential area mainly occupied by low-income Africans many of whom had come from the Eastern Cape more than 500 km away in search of work and a better life. Over half (54.5 per cent) lived in informal houses or shacks and 41.7 per cent were unemployed. Most of the inhabitants lived in abject poverty and had little access to Cape Town’s wealthy economy.Khayelitsha had been referred to as a “food desert”—an area in which the people faced high levels of food insecurity and low levels of diversity in their dietary options. Quite simply most households in the area struggled every day to get access to enough healthy food and water to live comfortably. It was in this context that Nomjana spent his teenage years always looking for a way to put food on the table in the shack that he shared with his aunt and two younger cousins.EARLY YEARSNomjana was born in Butterworth in Eastern Cape. When he was 13 his father passed away and because his mother was not working the family began to struggle financially. For the first time he was forced to look for ways to survive. His mother had worked for a catering company so she would make meals and Nomjana would sell the food in town. He felt forced to become an entrepreneur. Nomjana remembered “I could see how my mother was suffering and I chose then to make sure that I took the initiative.” Every morning he would go to school and in the afternoon still wearing his uniform he went out to sell his mother’s food.Later Nomjana moved to Cape Town to live with his aunt and focus on his school work—only to be faced with a similar situation because his aunt was also poor and self-employed sewing clothes for others and selling them from her shack. Soon Nomjana was selling the clothes door to door after school. He said “It was a tough situation. I would come back and would have to catch up with my homework and assignments and stuff.” But he began to enjoy it because “it was training for me to do it. I had the passion for selling and dealing with people.”He finished high school and then went to work for Edgars a national retail clothing chain.  He came from a clothing background so he liked fashion. After working at the retail company he thought of starting his own business. Since Nomjana worked in the stockroom he knew the factory that was supplying clothes to the retail store.EARLY ENTREPRENEURIAL EXPERIENCEWhile still working at Edgars Nomjana went to the factory bought some clothes and began selling them door to door after work and during the weekends until he came to a point where he could leave his corporate job and could carry on with his business. However he quickly became aware that his business had a fatal flaw. The neighbourhood he was selling in was a profoundly poor one which meant that successful sales could only take place if he offered his impoverished customers credit rather than selling for cash. But they did not always pay what they had promised. He explained: “Cash: I needed cash to get clothes and then if I get my money in 30 days or 60 days there was no cash flow.” Within a year this first business had failed.Undeterred Nomjana looked for other opportunities in the community and he noticed that people liked to have their pictures taken so he started a photographic business. He took pictures of people drinking in taverns and going to churches. It was 2010 and smartphones had not really penetrated the townships. He recalled how he started the photographic business: I borrowed a small machine an instant photo machine. It was like a Polaroid and in the township it was a new thing. I would take a picture of someone show it to them then ask “Do you like it? Do you know you can get it now?” Then I would give them a price and charge them for the picture. But I was spending everything I earned. So it didn’t take long for this second business to fail as well. At that point Nomjana began to lose heart because he realized he had been doing his own thing for some time and it had not worked. “I just told myself ‘I am not an entrepreneur’” he remembered. He began to think that maybe he should be working for someone else while he tried to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. TURNING TOWARD SOCIAL ENTERPRISEThe failures he experienced allowed him to learn: “I started to understand that I needed to give what I had in order to receive what I did not have. Crazy but that was what changed my life.” He did not have anything in terms of material assets or anything tangible that he could imagine but the idea persisted in his head. “I kept saying to myself ‘Give your time to someone help someone and the business ideas will come.’ That came true.”One day he noticed a garden—a green space in the centre of the ramshackle houses. He discovered that the garden was owned by elderly women in the community and that the garden represented a memory of a rural past for them. The women were too frail to do the hard physical labour of gardening and there was no irrigation. Actually the garden served a much more social than commercial purpose. The women ate most of the produce they grew and although they were willing to sell to people who came to inquire the sales were not generating much income. He thought “Maybe if I join them I can transform the garden from 70 per cent social to 70 per cent commercial by selling the produce door to door.” He approached the women and promised to do the hard labour of planting creating compost and harvesting in exchange for gardening lessons. He observed that “there was wisdom in that garden.” He told the women he could transform the garden within three months and that if he did not manage to transform it they could keep the harvest. The plan worked. He was planting harvesting and selling door to door every day.All of the money that came from door-to-door sales went back in to fund the operation of the garden: to buy seedlings and equipment and to transform the garden into a viable commercial operation. He was living alone in a back yard and paying himself a small stipend of ZAR250.00 (US$17) per month which was enough to rent his shack. With only vegetables to live on Nomjana became a vegetarian. His hard work began to bear fruit as the garden became more commercial and sustainable every month. He also planted fallow spaces adjacent to the original garden expanding the size until eventually he was employing six other young people to work there while he sold the produce. DEVELOPING A PASSIONThe more he learned about gardening the more Nomjana began to see that what counted was finding the vegetable that could deliver maximum nutrition quickly and cheaply. During the learning process something happened: “I fell in love with spinach. For me it was miraculous—without understanding anything in terms of agriculture or nutrition. Every day when I come into the garden spinach was just there.” Nomjana started to research spinach using the computers in the local library and he soon discovered that spinach was a “superfood:”It is loaded with tons of nutrients in a low-calorie package. Dark leafy greens like spinach are important for skin hair and bone health. They also provide protein iron vitamins and minerals. The possible health benefits of consuming spinach include improving blood glucose control in people with diabetes lowering the risk of cancer and improving bone health as well as supplying minerals and vitamins that can support a range of different nutritional needs.From his research Nomjana was convinced that spinach could make a difference in the lives of the people of Khayelitsha. Everywhere he went he told community members about the benefits of spinach and encouraged them to eat it. The community began to call him the Spinach King or at times the Popeye of Khayelitsha. FINDING THE OPPORTUNITYNomjana began to seek out the people who could benefit most from the spinach miracle. Once again the wisdom of the old ladies in the garden provided an answer. They said “Do you know all of us are chronics? That is why we grow the vegetables.” Chronic disease was an epidemic in South Africa. Two out of three women and two out of five men in South Africa were overweight. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as Type 2 diabetes stroke and cardiovascular diseases were the cause of more than half (57.4 per cent) of all deaths in the country according to a study conducted by Statistics South Africa in 2016. NCDs were known to result from poor diets and inadequate exercise. Nomjana did not know that people could get chronic diseases from what they ate. He went to volunteer at the local clinic telling the sister in charge of the clinic that he wanted to promote vegetable consumption among the patients. He worked with the dietitian and one of his duties was to translate the menu—the recommendations and diet plans for the people who were suffering from chronic diseases. Nomjana learned from the patients and from the dietician about nutrition and about the country’s food-based dietary guidelines for healthy living which recommended daily intakes of nutrients and provided guidance about substances such as salts types of fats and sugars. He realized that people in Khayelitsha who were poor and unemployed had little interest in lengthy meal preparation and preferred to eat cheap government-subsidized white bread and convenience food. Nomjana recognized an opportunity to incorporate spinach into products that people were already consuming on a daily basis with the aim of creating a healthier community. “If people are eating bread I will make spinach bread. If they are consuming muffins I will make spinach muffins. If they are consuming rusks I will make spinach rusks” he said. After conceptualizing the idea Nomjana began to look for someone to fund it.He approached banks and went to the government as well as several angel investors but no one showed any enthusiasm for the project. As Nomjana learned “In South Africa you don’t go to a bank when you need money. You go to a bank when you already have money.” The investors he was meeting also said no unconvinced that there would be a demand for so-called spinach bread and unimpressed by his lack of a revenue stream or even a prototype. Nomjana’s experience was not unique in the South African context. While the country had a relatively strong banking system and well-developed financial markets start-ups and micro-businesses continued to be under-served. Some reports indicated that this sector represented the largest funding gap—between funding available for the sector and funding needed by the sector—which was estimated at between ZAR86 billion (US$6 billion) and ZAR346 billion (US$24 billion). Many early stage small micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs) struggled to meet the traditional credit risk assessment requirements making them unattractive to most financial resource holders in the country. This situation was made worse by the low levels of education of many owners of small enterprises in South Africa which made their battle to expand even more challenging. The low levels of financial literacy and weak financial planning and management skills made matters more difficult: many SMMEs did not know who to approach for funding or of how to apply. This generally made the search for funding time consuming and inefficient and it rarely resulted in successful applications. However Nomjana did not give up because by then he had developed a burning desire to start a business which he continued to believe could make a difference to the lives of the people of Khayelitsha. He realized that he was “wasting time because the capital that I was looking for outside was within me. The intellectual capital that I had was sufficient on its own. It formed about 90 per cent of what I needed to start the business.”EARLY EXPERIMENTATION AND GROWING PAINSReturning to the garden he had built he asked for four bunches of spinach. Then he used the ZAR100 (US$7) in his pocket to buy some bread ingredients. He found a recipe by consulting his “old friend” Google and asked his neighbour if he could use her oven. He felt those resources were sufficient to start. In the beginning he used the neighbour’s ovens without paying for the electricity. “I started by baking four loaves. Then I sold them and used the money to bake more: four to eight eight to 16 16 to 24. By the time I was baking 16 every day I started to pay for electricity.” At this point Nomjana was selling each loaf for ZAR10 (US$0.70) making about ZAR1 (US$0.07) profit per loaf and slowly inching his way toward bigger volumes. He admitted that in the beginning his customers did not really like the spinach bread because it contained no salt or sugar—just spinach. Later the products tasted good as well as looked good; but at first they ate them because of the health benefits extolled by Nomjana as he sold them: “I was passionate about educating people about the importance of health the importance of eating healthy the importance of consuming vegetables to eradicate the chance of chronic disease. For each and every loaf I sold there was education at the back of that sale.” Within three months Nomjana was facing the problem of high demand and low capacity. The neighbour’s oven could no longer keep up. “People were wanting what I produced but I couldn’t offer it to them” he said. He went back to the innovation drawing board: “I was just forcing my mind to think creatively and innovatively.” Nomjana popped into a local Spar a national chain of franchised “mom and pop”-style grocery retailers. He asked the manager of the Spar if he could use the spare capacity in the on-site bakery in the Khayelitsha store. The manager asked Nomjana if he had the money to rent the ovens. “I said ‘No! I might pay rent later.’” The manager advised him that he needed a capital infusion into the business so that he could pay rent and make this product and told him he could “come back to us when you are ready. Then we can give you a shelf to sell the bread.” But Nomjana argued: “I want to bake here when you are baking. When you make your brown bread and your white bread I will put my spinach bread in between. That is the deal.” The Spar manager laughed because Nomjana was a very different kind of young man but he could see the benefits to the community so they shook hands on the deal.After a week of using the ovens at Spar Nomjana realized he had underestimated the rate at which the outlet produced bread. Suddenly he had to sell 120 loaves a day—a lot more than the 50 loaves he was expecting. He could barely cope walking up to 25 km a day just selling. He needed help and fast. He wanted to employ five people with five bicycles so that he could distribute the bread more effectively and he needed money for that: he would have to consult either a bank or an investor but his previous experience had left a bad taste in his mouth. “I didn’t want to waste more time. I was a bit arrogant” he said.FINDING A FUNDING CROWDBy googling “easiest funding alternatives” Nomjana found information on crowdfunding—specifically a site called Thundafund South Africa’s leading online crowdfunding marketplace for creatives and innovators. Thundafund’s Nicholas Dilley explained how crowdfunding platforms worked:Crowdfunding is the new bank loan without the pressures of repayments. Crowdfunding is an online method of fundraising that allows people all over the world to put their ideas or pitches onto a digital platform. These pitches are then available for people worldwide to see and to decide whether or not they would like to support the campaign. There are four main types of crowdfunding: Rewards-based donation-based equity-based and debt-based each with its own unique purpose.Nomjana started documenting everything he was doing on a Blackberry smart phone. He took videos and pictures of himself walking along the streets of Khayelitsha to sell and deliver bread and telling people why he needed the five bicycles. The business concept was an innovative idea presented by a young enthusiastic person from an impoverished township near Cape Town.Over one and a half months Nomjana’s videos went viral and he achieved almost 1 million views of his posts on the Thundafund website. His campaign goal had been to raise ZAR10500 (US$732) for the bicycles but by the time the campaign closed he had raised over ZAR20000 (US$1393).Nomjana went looking for unemployed youths to employ. He trained them on how to sell the spinach bread and rode the bicycles with them—he also continued to sell the bread. Although the five workers were earning only commissions he told them “Guys I am teaching you business here and I am actually giving you training on how to be entrepreneurs yourselves.” Nomjana added proudly “All of them have businesses today.”He knew that Spinach King was going to be big because there was great demand for his products and he knew that his products were healthy and that the formula was perfect. His vision was much bigger than the community itself.A DREAM TO GROWBy December 2013 after a year of using the Spar ovens Nomjana had saved ZAR50000 (US$3484) by keeping his costs low and paying neither rent nor salaries. Spar was happy to continue to host the business—especially because the products were being sold in the store. Spar’s regular customers were not part of Nomjana’s original target market and they were prepared to buy Spinach King products at higher prices than those in the townships. Nomjana explained “People don’t have a problem paying more because we tell them they are actually giving an opportunity to poor people to also buy and get nutritious stuff.” Nomjana had begun to understand that he was running a social enterprise and that he had to find a way to be sustainable so that he could continue to assist others. Nomjana added “If the business is 100 per cent social then it is not sustainable. If it is at least 50:50 then it is balancing. That is how we want to be.” He felt ready to take the next step on the journey to sustainability—to develop a replicable model of a bakery that could take healthy eating to impoverished communities everywhere. He knew exactly what he wanted: a containerized express bakery. He had developed a plan for the production floor based on everything he had learned about operations and production while he had been using the ovens at Spar. Nomjana envisioned a bakery that used the same processes as the bakery at Spar but on a smaller scale. He had worked out that his team could make the bread and muffins on one side of the container and sell the merchandise on the other side. He believed that such a bakery was a key component in his plans to grow and scale Spinach King.However Nomjana also knew that ZAR50000 (US$3484) was not enough to build his dream bakery. He needed more money—three times as much in fact. This seemed like an impossible amount for a 23 year old from Khayelitsha to raise. On the other hand the crowdfunding campaign had generated a significant amount of publicity for the Spinach King. “I was in Forbes Africa as an upcoming innovative concept in Africa. I was on CNN and SABC. I don’t know how many times people were writing about the Spinach King.”But Nomjana had no idea how he could leverage this positive publicity. As he gazed at the gorgeous city of Cape Town he wondered what the options might be for scaling his social enterprise and how he could raise the money he needed for his dream bakery. What other options were available for expansion? He wanted to continue to make a difference by improving the health of people in impoverished communities but the question was how? This time Google did not have an answer for him.

According to Fast Company magazine OYO was the 10th most innovative company from India in 2018. In September 2018 the company was valued at US$5 billion. In April 2019 within six years of its inception OYO was present in 11 countries including India China the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom. Ritesh Agarwal founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of OYO wanted to make the company the world�s largest global hotel chain. He stated �We want to convert broken unbranded assets around the globe into better-quality living spaces.� Globally budget hotel space was largely unorganized. OYO investors including venture capitalists like UK-based SoftBank Vision Fund (SoftBank) and US-based Greenoaks Capital believed that OYO could become a large player in several geographies. Satish Meena senior forecast analyst of Forrester India stated �There is an absolute merit in OYO�s back-to-back entry into foreign countries. The size of opportunity seems to have driven investors to value OYO that much.� Nevertheless as the company prepared itself for global expansion problems occurred in its home country India. According to YouGov a UK-based online market research firm the customer satisfaction index for OYO fell from 21 to 15 between July and September 2018 especially among female customers owing to safety issues. In addition in December 2018 some budget and mid-market hoteliers from India decided to file a lawsuit against OYO over breach of contract between OYO and these hoteliers. Jai Vardhan an expert on Indian start-ups considered OYO�s global ambitions lofty and believed that a $5 billion valuation of the company was based on the optimism of its investors regarding OYO�s international expansion potential and not on OYO�s actual performance in its home country. Tim Culpan an award-winning technology journalist also believed that OYO should focus on quality rather than international expansion. He stated �If quality plays second fiddle to expansion OYO�risks becoming�a brand name that�s of little value to anyone.� Agarwal wondered if the company could succeed in international markets or if he needed to reconsider his strategy of focusing on international markets instead of the domestic market. Could legal issues in OYO�s home country create impediments to his growth plan in foreign countries? If so how should Agarwal deal with these issues?BACKGROUNDOYO was founded by Agarwal in 2012 when he was just 19 years old. Prior to starting his venture Agarwal juggled different roles such as a hotel housekeeper and a call centre employee. Agarwal started the OYO journey by first taking a lease on 11 rooms from a hotel located in Gurugram in the north of India. He followed an aggregation model. Whenever hotel owners signed an agreement with OYO OYO upgraded the hotel�s belongings including linen toiletries and bathroom fittings to OYO�s quality specifications. The hotel staff was trained by the company and supplies across hotels were standardized. After a hotel was upgraded OYO listed the hotel on its website with room prices starting from $25 per night. OYO charged a 25 per cent commission to the hotel. For Indian budget travellers who were used to dirty washrooms broken taps and soiled bed linen the standard amenities that OYO provided were like wish fulfillment. This entire service was under the brand name OYO Rooms with OYO standing for �on your own.� Later in 2016 in a move to reduce excessive spending and negative cash flow OYO stopped giving a minimum occupancy guarantee (i.e. an assurance where OYO would pay the hotel if a minimum number of bookings was not received by the hotel) to hoteliers and switched to a revenue-sharing model. Then in 2017 the company shifted from being an aggregator to a franchising model for faster expansion in different geographical markets. By January 2018 90 per cent of OYO�s revenue came from hotels operating under the franchising model wherein OYO leased the hotels from their owners. Agarwal aimed to reach 100 per cent by 2019. Under the franchising agreement OYO spent between $0.14 million and $0.21 million on leasing renovating hiring and deposits for hotel management. The franchising model was also popularly known as a �manachised model� as it had features of both management contracts and franchising. In 2017 OYO expanded the portfolio of its services and launched OYO Home and OYO Townhouse. OYO Home was similar to the Airbnb Inc. (Airbnb) short-term rental marketplace. Under the OYO Home brand OYO provided long-term self-service independent homes managed by OYO. OYO Townhouse on the other hand operated as a 25 per cent hotel 25 per cent home 25 per cent cafe and 25 per cent store. By the end of 2018 OYO had more than 125000 rooms in India and was present in more than 350 cities across nine countries. Despite being in the hotel industry technology was at the heart of OYO�s business model. OYO employed approximately 700 software engineers out of its total workforce of 8500. The engineering team released an average of 20 software developments every day which included new and updated versions of existing mobile applications (apps). For instance one of OYO�s most effective apps ORBIS instantly calculated a hotel�s projected occupancy rate and potential revenues if the hotel joined OYO�s network. ORBIS did this by analyzing �hundreds of thousands of items of data in that particular local lodging market.�INTERNATIONAL MARKET EXPANSIONGlobally the hotels and resorts industry experienced strong growth between 2015 and 2018 mainly due to the rise in global travel and tourism (see Exhibit 1). Among the different hotel segments in 2018 medium-end hotel accommodations had the maximum market share (see Exhibit 2). Globally the majority of travellers staying in hotel accommodations were domestic travellers contributing approximately 55.6 per cent to the industry. By 2018 42.2 per cent of global tourism occurred in Europe followed by North America (see Exhibit 3). However between 2018 and 2024 the annual growth in hotel revenue was expected to remain stagnant at 3 per cent (see Exhibit 1). OYO in the People�s Republic of ChinaOYO started its international expansion in 2016 with Malaysia being its first market. In 2017 it expanded to Nepal and then in November 2017 to China. Despite being fragmented China�s hotel industry was worth $150 billion in 2018. China had a strong influx of both domestic and international tourists. With the economic boom more than 500 million Chinese locals wanted good accommodation at reasonable prices. Agarwal stated that �OYO�s platform of��predictability standardization quality�and affordability� will help attract both guests and investors.� It aimed to add 30000 rooms per month in China to its portfolio. As in India OYO followed the manachised model in China. OYO also launched six OYO Skill Institutes in China; by November 2018 it had trained 924 staff across 76 cities in China. China was also expected to become the leading tourist destination globally by 2030 (see Exhibit 3). In 2018 OYO formed an alliance and signed a five-year memorandum of understanding with Shanghai-based Huazhu Group Ltd. (Huazhu) which was in the business of developing and operating manachised and franchised hotels in China. OYO believed that Huazhu�s experience and expertise in managing large properties could accelerate the growth plans of OYO in China. OYO also signed an agreement with China Lodging Group a hotel operator in China. According to this agreement China Lodging Group invested $10 million in OYO in return for 1 per cent equity in the company. OYO and China Lodging Group were also expected to jointly develop knowledge- and technology-sharing projects related to the field of hospitality. These projects included an exchange program for employees apart from sharing intellectual property. OYO stated �The partnership is also expected to leverage benefits for economies of scale not limited to sourcing and procurement and joint loyalty programs.�OYO scaled up from only a handful of properties in November 2017 to 87000 rooms across 171 cities in China within 10 months of its entry into the country. Within one year of OYO�s expansion into China it became one of China�s top five�hotel chains. Agarwal stated �Our secret to success in China is the way we�ve built our business in the country. We didn�t approach the market like an Indian start-up setting shop in China but like a Chinese player building and localizing the OYO business model to make it work in the Chinese market.� Local managers in China had significant decision-making autonomy to manage the complexities of Chinese markets. Agarwal stated �We operate like a Chinese company not a global company operating in China.� He added �If you go to one of our hotel owners in China and ask them [sic] where OYO is from they�ll say it�s Chinese.� OYO intended to spend approximately $600 million in the Chinese hotel industry. In fact by November 2018 OYO was growing faster in China than in its home market (i.e. India).In February 2019 China�s ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. (Didi Chuxing) also made a $100 million investment in OYO which brought OYO�s $1 billion financing round to a close. OYO and Didi Chuxing�s partnership was not new. In 2017 when OYO entered China it partnered with Didi Chuxing to announce its entry into China�s market. In fact its tag line was �Ride comfortably with Didi Stay comfortably with OYO.�OYO in Middle Eastern CountriesIn October 2018 OYO entered Dubai with an inventory of 1100 rooms. Commenting on the choice of market Manu Midha regional head of Middle East OYO Hotels & Homes stated the �UAE one of the world�s leading MICE [meetings incentives conferencing and events] capital[s] of the world then becomes a highly strategic location for us [OYO].� By 2020 the company was expected to reach 12000 rooms across 150 hotels. In January 2019 OYO also launched OYO Home brand of service in Dubai with 40 homes. The company aimed to increase this to 200 homes by August 2019. Elaborating on OYO Home in the UAE Kavikrut the chief growth officer of OYO stated What we are attempting with OYO Home guarantees [a] unique experience for our guests and higher yields for homeowners. There is significant market opportunity especially as people have invested in second homes in top holiday destinations across the UAE. GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] and international travelers today are open to choosing the comforts of a fully managed holiday home for short stays. OYO in UAE adopted the same manachised model across two- three- and four-star hotels. Commenting on the success of this model Midha stated Since our recent launch we have been inundated with requests from several hotel owners in the UAE to migrate onto OYO�s [manachise] business model. We are on track at the moment and our vision is to support the large number of business travelers that are expected to arrive by the time UAE opens [the] door to its billion-dollar EXPO 2020 with 190 country pavilions. In February 2019 OYO launched operations in Saudi Arabia after signing deals with 50 hotels offering more than 3000 rooms across seven cities. Agarwal said that OYO would completely support Saudi Arabia�s blossoming hospitality ecosystem while creating infrastructure for asset owners so that a high quality of service standards would be ensured. He stated �We are honoured and delighted to support the Saudi government's Vision 2030 for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are committed to continuing investing in the multi-billion dollar opportunity in the hospitality industry in the country.� OYO intended to create over 5000 jobs for Saudi citizens by 2020. The company also intended to launch two OYO Skill Institutes one in Riyadh and another in Jeddah the two major cities of Saudi Arabia to provide hotel management training to Saudi graduates. OYO in the United Kingdom and the United StatesOYO ventured into the United Kingdom in September 2018. According to Agarwal the United Kingdom represented a multi-billion dollar opportunity for OYO. He stated �The UK has been the topmost international travel destination for several years and last year hosted over 19 million tourists from around the world.� He further added that with OYO independent hoteliers of the United Kingdom would be empowered with technology and operational expertise that would help them enhance the customer experience and thus increase sustainable incomes. The United Kingdom was OYO�s first expansion outside Asia. The company planned to invest $53 million to launch its services across 10 British cities. OYO wanted to select hotels from Britain�s 35000 to 40000 independent operators and help them compete by offering design services property management and marketing support. To begin OYO was present in Manchester Birmingham Glasgow and Edinburgh in addition to four properties in London that offered about 80 rooms. Under its Townhouse brand OYO partnered with small-scale hotels through its manachised model. OYO intended to increase its presence in the United Kingdom to more than 5000 rooms by 2020. In the United Kingdom the company also intended to expand its OYO Townhouse hotel brand to between 400 and 500 accommodations by mid-2019. In February 2019 OYO entered the budget hotel market in the United States. It opened an office in Dallas and tested properties in both Austin and Dallas. In December 2018 Marcus Higgins was appointed head of OYO�s US operations. Furthermore several business development managers and sales executives were also hired in cities including Dallas Austin San Antonio Miami Orlando Denver and Charlotte. Commenting on OYO�s US expansion a company spokesperson stated We see great opportunity in this market but also appreciate the competitive nature of franchising and [the] uniqueness of the United States. We will bring learnings from building similar markets like the UK and constantly learn and modify our strategy to suit the needs of the US market like we did to succeed in the UK In 2019 OYO intended to add approximately 2000 hotels in different US states. The company stated that it was in the ��early stages� of expanding in the US market� Commenting on the likelihood of OYO�s success in the United States Robert Cole founder of the hospitality consulting firm RockCheetah stated �The US hotel market isn't clamoring for it but the business model will be very attractive to a lot of small hotel owners who are not being well served by the lower tier hotel franchise brands.� Commenting on the differences between the franchising model of OYO and a typical franchise hotel chain in the United States Cole stated that in a typical franchise model hotels focused only on branding. In contrast OYO had complete control over the technology operations and distribution. According to Cole this difference should have made the OYO model work in the United States. To begin with OYO first partnered with manager-owners which was a soft-brand arrangement (i.e. imposing minimum standards for independent hotels to adhere to as well as providing a marketing platform) later it wholly leased and franchised its budget hotel properties. In the United States with this model OYO was particularly aiming to compete with budget chains such as Best Western Hotels & Resorts Super 8 Worldwide and Choice Hotels International Inc.OYO in JapanIn April 2019 OYO entered the Japanese market in a joint venture with Yahoo! Japan which was considered Japan�s most popular Internet platform. OYOs� presence was made available at Yahoo! Japan�s search engine homepage travel portal and real estate site. Yahoo! Japan had in-depth local knowledge expertise and extensive reach to help OYO have better access to people and inform them about OYO Life which was OYO�s rental housing services. Yahoo! Japan was largely owned by UK-based SoftBank the same venture capitalist firm that had invested in OYO. The joint venture was named OYO Technology and Hospitality Japan (OYO Japan). Hiro Katsuse a Japanese entrepreneur and former Japanese market leader for Handy Japan Co. and Booking.com was appointed CEO for OYO Japan. OYO entered Japan with its rented furnished apartments and townhouses which did not require residents to pay a security deposit or introduction fees. At the time of its official launch in Japan OYO Japan had more than 11000 preregistrations and an occupancy of 114 per cent. The company felt that such a response was because of its immense popularity among students and young professionals. LAVISH FUNDING FROM VENTURE CAPITALISTSSince 2013 OYO had participated in 11 rounds of funding resulting in $1.8 billion in funds. OYO�s latest funding round was in February 2019 for a total value of $100 million (see Exhibit 4). OYO had 18 venture funding partners including SoftBank�Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Critics however believed that OYO was simply burning cash due to its lavish funding. Sarah Tavel partner at the US-based venture capital firm Benchmark stated There�s a lot of strength and value to having a lot of capital but as you know there�s a lot of damage that having a lot of capital can do to a company.... It can diffuse focus it can cover up things that aren�t working inside it and it can stop the leadership from understanding the mechanics of its own business. For instance China was already an oversupplied market in terms of hotels. OYO not only forayed into that market but also offered guarantees of minimum business and pay to hotels if the requisite number of customers did not arrive. According to critics during a recession this could become a dangerous situation for OYO threatening the sustainability of its business. It was also feared that low prices might result in price wars as more competitors entered the market. However lead investor SoftBank insisted that at least OYO�s India hotel business had �unit-level profitability.� This profitability arose because of low customer acquisition costs since most customers of OYO were repeat customers. Furthermore 90 per cent of its customers booked OYO directly online rather than through online searches which required a heavy digital marketing investment. Overall however OYO was facing losses (see Exhibit 5).GLOBAL COMPETITIONBased in Shanghai China Jin Jiang International Holdings Co. Ltd. (Jin Jiang) which owned the world�s fifth-largest hotel chain was a major competitor of OYO in Asia. Jin Jiang had a total of 6932 hotels across 54 countries covering more than 50 brands. The brands included Royal Tulip Golden Tulip Sarovar Hotels Kyriad and Tulip Inn which were operational in India as well. Jin Jiang commented that if it felt threatened by OYO in any country it would compete by bringing its own brand in the aggregator segment where OYO primarily operated. According to unofficial estimates there were more than 4 million unbranded rooms in India out of which OYO covered approximately 1 million. The branded space in India such as Taj Group ITC Hotels and Marriott International Inc. accounted for 100000 upscale rooms. Marriott the world�s largest hotel operator had a global room inventory of 1.28 million as of June 2018. At that time OYO�s room inventory globally stood at 270000. OYO added approximately 140000 rooms to its global portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. Marriott added approximately 20000 rooms in the second quarter of 2018. Agarwal explained that traditional hotel chains took approximately 10 to 11 months for signing a franchise or management-contract deal with a property owner. At any major chain a negotiator would first call his city boss who then called the country boss who called the regional boss and so on. At OYO according to Agarwal �ORBIS on his mobile phone is the boss.� The ORBIS app helped Agarwal and his team calculate risks associated with a deal and arrive at a decision quickly. Agarwal stated that by leveraging data science OYO was able to sign a deal within 10 days of meeting with a property owner. Two other start-ups�namely Treebo Hotels and FabHotel�also ventured into the Indian hotel industry following a model similar to OYO�s. Due to lack of funds these two brands could not expand internationally the way OYO could. Specifically commenting on the threat from OYO to branded hotel chains in the United States Cole stated �OYO won't kill the major hotel brands in the US but if they execute well they can have a successful business that will present the major hotel brands with some challenges similar to the way Airbnb is creating issues.� In March 2019 Agarwal even changed his name for the Chinese market and was known as Li Taixi not Ritesh Agarwal to suit Chinese consumers. He also did not lose focus on the domestic market as he considered borrowing more funds for the expansion of Townhouse in OYO�s home country.PROBLEMS IN THE HOME COUNTRYUnhappy PartnersBudget and mid-market hotels in India suffered due to deep discounting high commissions and contract changes made by OYO. A member of one of the many hotel and restaurant associations of north India commented that once OYO had agreements with a substantial number of hotels across major cities and acquired a reasonable customer base the company started offering deep discounts and forced the partner hotels to abandon the minimum guarantee agreements that they signed with the company. Budget hoteliers jointly considered taking legal action against OYO. Ashraf Ali president of the Budget Hotel Association of Mumbai India stated �Rooms that we used to sell for Rs 2000�2500 [$28.21�$35.26] are now being sold for Rs 800�900 [$11.28�$12.69]. Because of funding they are able to sell rooms at much lower rates. The minimum guarantee fee is also not coming so we are not left with a choice.� In December 2018 the Hotel and Banquet Hall Association of Bareilly a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh India issued a notice to hoteliers emphasizing the suffering of several hoteliers in the city. The notice stated that after paying 25 per cent commission charges to OYO and expenses toward staff salaries electricity and general upkeep small budget hoteliers saw no profits. The notice further stated �A real business partner cares about the partner also but OYO is just concerned about itself at the expense of its partners. They play one up against the other. Beware as giving your hotel to OYO will lead to total loss of goodwill.� After this 15 to 18 hotels in Bareilly ceased partnering with OYO. Hoteliers appealed to the Competition Commission of India about the contractual issue and urged them to investigate the matter. However Ayush Mathur head of supplies at OYO refuted the claims made by hoteliers. He stated This is absolutely incorrect. We have on the contrary invested over thousands of crores in capex [capital expenditure] appointed hundreds of general managers to oversee operations and customer experience and introduced technology-driven innovations in the hospitality sector that [have] greatly transformed the standard of service delivered by a once unbranded hotel now part of the OYO chain. He claimed that since the room rates were decided by OYO the question of discounts did not arise. Mathur further said We have been engaging with the FHRAI [Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India] the apex body that represents all hoteliers and its respected executives and are open to creating a platform for potential discussions and invite all other hotel chains in the country who operate leased or franchised assets to participate in the same. Consumer ComplaintsAs OYO�s scale increased it was frequently criticized for deteriorating quality control. In September 2018 a female customer sharing her experience of staying in an OYO hotel in India claimed the staff attempted to make sexually suggestive calls to her. Subsequently OYO cancelled the franchise agreement of that hotel. A survey by YouGov indicated that the overall brand health of OYO based on parameters such as impression quality value reputation satisfaction and recommendation scores had declined. The �Buzz� score (which calculated whether someone had heard anything positive or negative about the brand) fell from 24.4 in July 2018 to a low of 19.5 in mid-September. Among female customers OYO�s �Buzz� score fell from 20.8 to 12.2 during the same time. The YouGov survey also found that �Likelihood to Recommend� (whether a customer would recommend the brand to a friend or colleague) and �Purchase Intent� for OYO fell among females in September 2018.However a survey conducted by KalaGato an India-based analytic start-up rated OYO�s �Net Promoter Score� (a customer satisfaction measure) as 0.58 in India in 2018. For other operators in India like Agoda Airbnb Hotels.com and Trivago the score ranged from 0.50 and 0.63.OYO believed that leveraging technology allowed its employees to monitor quality. The company claimed that customer problems were rectified within minutes of registration of complaints. OYO believed that it was only because of quality service that it was able to scale in international markets at such a fast rate.THE ROAD AHEADOYO was expected to be India�s first budget travel brand to become global. Commenting on balancing the growth in home and international markets an OYO spokesperson said �We plan to rapidly scale our business in these countries while continuing to invest further in technology and talent.� The company said it would continue its focus on global expansion while customer experience would remain its priority and management would take appropriate steps to ensure quality service and the safety of its customers. According to Agarwal growth not profit was the company�s priority. In a note to OYO employees he stated �With a strong balance sheet we today can go more places than ever introduce new categories invest in our assets while maintaining our high-quality standards without raising any further capital.� The number of �stayed room nights� for OYO increased globally from 6 million in 2016 to�75 million in 2018. As OYO diversified into the home and townhouse sector targeting midscale millennials it reported 90 per cent occupancy in townhouses and planned to enter the luxury space. However a market research analyst warned that at OYO�s pace of growth �their organization can easily be overstretched which may drag facility and service quality down and damage their brand.� Critics have also raised suspicion about the profitability of OYO�s franchising model as it operated at low prices. Commenting on profitability Agarwal mentioned: �Remember for hotels the return is based on two multipliers price and occupancy. Even if you keep the price 10 per cent lower and increase the occupancy three times the return is still roughly 2.8 times. Not bad!� OYO came under scrutiny from the FHRAI which accused the company of large-scale breaches of contract with hotel operators and violation of laws. An OYO spokesperson stated that �allegations were misguided and misplaced and reflected cartelization� by certain groups of hotels that were not even OYO franchisees but had vested personal interests. Would Agarwal reconsider his decision of aggressively expanding internationally? Were legal issues in India likely to hamper growth of his venture abroad? How would he manage quality service and growth simultaneously?EXHIBIT 1: REVENUE GROWTH 2006�2024 (%)�HOTELS AND RESORTS INDUSTRY (GLOBALLY)Note: E = expected revenue growth.Source: �Global Hotels & Resorts Industry�Market Research Report (Industry Performance)� IBISWorld May 2018 updated July 2019 accessed June 29 2019 www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/global-industry-reports/hotels-restaurants/hotels-resorts.html.EXHIBIT 2: MARKET SHARE OF DIFFERENT HOTEL SEGMENTS 2018 (%) Source: �Global Hotels & Resorts Industry�Market Research Report (Products and Markets)� IBISWorld May 2018 updated July 2019 accessed June 29 2019 www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/global-industry-reports/hotels-restaurants/hotels-resorts.html.EXHIBIT 3: TOP 5 TOURIST DESTINATIONS worldwide BY NUMBER OF VISITIORS (IN millions)Source: Eric Rosen �New Rankings Of The World's Fastest-Growing Tourism Destinations� Forbes September 6 2018 accessed January 10 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/2018/09/06/new-rankings-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-tourism-destinations/#16e7df7c57ea; �Leading Country Destination Worldwide in 2016 By Number of Visitors (In Millions)� Statista September 18 2017 accessed January 10 2019 www.statista.com/statistics/750800/ranking-tourist-destination-worldwide-number-of-visitors/; Kate Whiting �Why China Will Soon Be the World's Top Destination for Tourists� World Economic Forum November 13 2018 accessed January 12 2019 www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/china-will-be-the-world-s-top-tourist-destination-by-2030/.EXHIBIT 4: OYO�FUNDING ROUNDS AND VALUATION ($ millionS)Note: *For details on the objective of different funding rounds (for a start-up and the funding venture capitalists) refer to Alejandro Cremades �How Funding Rounds Work For Startups� Forbes December 26 2018 accessed February 12 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2018/12/26/how-funding-rounds-work-for-startups/#63c78c6d7386.Source: �OYO: Funding Rounds� Crunchbase accessed March 10 2019 www.crunchbase.com/organization/oyo-rooms#section-funding-rounds.

The Regina Saskatchewan office of 190 employees had held its office Christmas party the previous Saturday and Foster smiled thinking about the evening as her computer came to life. �A lot has happened since the last Christmas party that�s for sure� she thought. �I doubt anyone at last year�s party would have believed what the company would look like one year later.�Her computer chirped as the day�s calendar loaded and displayed on the screen. �Let�s see� Foster quietly said to herself. �Holacracy circle tactical meetings at 9 a.m. 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Meeting at 3:30 p.m. with Scott McGillivray to review the Holacracy implementation status. Going to need a few minutes to get those notes together.� McGillivray iQmetrix�s chief strategy officer had returned from an annual planning weekend where the senior executives typically discussed the coming year�s priorities and expected milestones for the next 12 months. Foster knew that information about the success of the Holacracy implementation that she was leading would have been a major topic of discussion for the five senior executives running the company. �What do I need to say?� Foster reflected on this question for a moment. �They�re going to want to hear that the implementation is done and that we can move on to the next thing. And McGillivray�s going to want to know what that next thing is.� Foster turned and looked out the window at the downtown Regina landscape in the still-dark pre-dawn of the Canadian winter. �What is the next thing?�Foster began to think through her status report: �A year ago I defined the implementation process as ending when all departments and teams had completed Holacracy training key roles had all been assigned within each Holacracy circle and every circle had completed at least one tactical meeting.� A grin spread across Foster�s face reflected in the window. �Funny how that made so much sense a year ago. Are we implemented? If implementation means everyone is aware of what has happened and everyone understands what the basic process rules for Holacracy are then yes we are done and we can move on to other areas of focus. But is that the right way to think about it?�Foster mentally listed the concerns she had about stating that the implementation was complete and that the company could move on. Key areas such as compensation and employee evaluation were still being done as they had been done in the past and were not yet fully Holacratized. During implementation some situations had come up�so-called cracks in the road to Holacracy�that Foster knew she would need to fix at some point. Was the implementation actually over? That was perhaps the real question. �Well� Foster thought �I�ve got a couple hours before I need to put this all into words that make sense.�HolacracyHolacracy was an organizational design that emphasized roles and processes over people. In Holacracy the work of an organization was divided into roles that were accountable for performing explicit tasks and the roles themselves were meant to evolve freely by following explicit processes for change. According to the process rules of Holacracy all people in the organization from the chief executive officer (CEO) to the employee on the front line assumed their roles and once assumed were free to make all the decisions associated with their role and to propose changes to that role as they saw fit. In the language of Holacracy the philosophy was centred on roles not souls and self-management meant there were no manager roles.Holacracy was originally conceptualized by Brian Robertson a software entrepreneur who had started and sold three of his own companies but each time been unsatisfied with how his company had become less efficient as it grew. Robertson spent considerable time experimenting with different forms of traditional organizational designs before realizing that what he was searching for�a way to maintain autonomy flexibility and decision speed in start-up organizations as they grew larger�did not yet exist. Robertson was heavily influenced by the work of philosopher Bertrand Russell and organizational theorist Elliott Jaques. Robertson recognized that Russell who wrote that �everything is vague to a degree you do not realize until you have tried to make it precise� and Jaques who wrote that a tension always exists between the formal organizational chart structure of an organization as it might appear on paper and the structure that actually exists. Robertson�s experience with his own new ventures was that the solution to scaling the start-up culture to a larger mature organization was to create an organizational design based on simple rules for recognizing articulating and creating the tasks that needed to be accomplished and then giving people the authority to adapt their professional roles to do these tasks. This approach made the work to be done explicit and shaped people�s responsibilities to the actual needs of the organization rather than to a preconceived (and likely outdated) vision of what the organization did.Holacracy implementation at iqmetrixImplementing Holacracy at iQmetrix had begun almost a year earlier in the second week of January 2017 and had followed a phased rollout strategy whereby the circles to be included in each phase were selected according to Foster�s opinion about which areas would be most open to and willing to work through a significant change. Exhibit 1 shows the circles that were on-boarded in each of the five phases�the first phase starting in January 2017 and the last phase beginning in October 2017. With each wave Foster had hoped to learn as much as possible in the least intrusive way to iterate and improve on the Holacracy design as it unfolded and to become progressively more effective and efficient in leading employees through the implementation.In hindsight Foster recognized that this strategy was in some ways naive. The concept of changing to a new organizational form�one that was not well documented except in a book by Holacracy�s founder�was not originally expected to be intimidating or ambiguous; in fact many executive members at the time thought the company was already following several Holacratic principles. With this optimism in place Foster originally thought that implementation would be complete once the last circle was holding weekly tactical meetings. However this naive optimism proved misplaced. Shortcomings in the �let�s try this on our own we read the book� approach did not take long to surface. It took longer than anticipated for roles to be created and the circles that ended up being created tended to mimic the organizational structure that had existed prior to Holacracy implementation. As a result Foster had started looking for an implementation consultant in mid-February to assist in the process.After three weeks of searching for and screening potential consultants Foster decided on Karim Bishay an experienced Holacracy coach based just outside San Jose California. Bishay helped to plan the rollout process and participated in it thereby helping to reboot the first phase rollout and set the stage for the second phase that began in March. Each phase of rollout progressed in a similar way. Exhibit 2 shows the three-part launch process for each circle. In the first step pre-launch a survey was sent to each employee asking about their satisfaction with and attitudes toward work; the responses were intended to be used later to evaluate progress. Pre-launch training then began and consisted of a question-and-answer session with an executive and Bishay the master coach and a Holacracy 101 overview conducted in three-hour live sessions in each office�Vancouver British Columbia Regina Saskatchewan Winnipeg Manitoba and Charlotte North Carolina. Training ended with a tutorial for the online system GlassFrog which was used as the project management system for employees to track their work their roles and the work and roles of others under Holacracy. Employees who occupied lead link roles were further expected to watch a training video that outlined the specifics of their roles. In Holacracy lead links were responsible for the administrative tasks of managing each circle. In this role lead links assigned employees to particular roles; allocated resources across various projects in a circle; and established the strategies metrics and priorities for the circle. As such the lead link role was responsible for many of the administrative tasks of a manager in a typical organization.Once the pre-launch activities were complete the actual practice of Holacracy began. For almost all iQmetrix employees (iQers) their first explicit exposure to Holacracy was their first tactical meeting. Most if not all groups in the company already had regular status or progress meetings of some type so for many the tactical meetings were initially familiar at least in form. However tactical meetings in Holacracy had a specific process to follow and required people to become comfortable with learning that new process. It was not immediately comfortable for all people. Once the first meeting was complete and the next one was scheduled each circle was considered launched and check-ins between the lead links and Holacracy coaches with the master coach continued for the next three to four weeks. One month after the first tactical meeting each circle earned a check mark in Foster�s implementation schedule as having entered Holacracy. Each wave of the implementation built on the knowledge of the preceding waves to the point that by November Foster had become confident in her ability to move new circles through the process relatively smoothly compared with seven months earlier. Survey results showed that employee satisfaction satisfaction with Holacracy and beliefs that Holacracy improved the ability to get work done had gradually increased from spring to late fall. One survey question asked whether employees thought that engaging in office politics was important for getting work done; the responses indicated that iQers were becoming more political in their interactions at work. This finding was in some ways unsettling but remained one of the few negative indicators from the survey.Foster noted that what she saw as most predictive of how successful a circle would be in becoming Holacratized lay firmly in the behaviour of the people placed in lead link roles. Foster saw that when the lead link bought into Holacratic practices the implementation was much more successful. Circles that had what Foster considered to be successful implementations tended to have lead links who remained silent leaving space for others to resolve their own tensions in tactical meetings even when obvious comments or answers were apparent. Lead links displaying these behaviours tended to have been with the company for a shorter time compared with those who were more likely to speak over others during a meeting. Newer employees in the lead link role were also more likely to be excited by the prospect and potential of Holacracy leading Foster to conclude that part of the reason for implementation success was attributable to the enthusiasm shown by these lead links. Close to the end of the fourth wave Foster sought out Bishay�s opinion of how well iQmetrix was doing in the rollout. The master coach�s response aligned with her opinion of the overall status and gave her confidence that the process was working and that the others with important coach facilitating and support roles for the Holacracy implementation were getting the job done well. Bishay wrote to FosterIn my opinion this is one of the most successful implementations at this point in the process that I�ve seen. There�s little outright mutiny there�s a very solid Holacracy circle and tactical meetings are running well. There�s also a culture shift happening and people are picking up some aspects really quickly. Also on the middle and lower levels very strong circles and structures have formed that are encouraging and growing leadership on that level. I give it an A�so far and am very confident in iQ�s success with it.By mid-December the last of the circles had completed the launch process and according to Foster�s initial criteria the implementation process was over and the company did not seem to have experienced any cataclysmic repercussions. Employee turnover that year had not significantly changed from the year before. The company had 430 employees spread across 91 circles. The executive team had devolved from being one group of guys (and they were all guys) at the top of the company to having their roles distributed across multiple circles. Each employee had an average of seven individual roles such as client manager database administrator lead link software developer and product architect. Holacracy implementation looked to be complete. Or was it?evaluating the Holacracy implementationAs Foster looked back over the past year she recognized at least three potential problems in the implementation journey. Deciding whether those problems needed to be fixed and how to fix them was occupying a lot of her time. Foster understood that one of the key differences between traditional management and self-management was decision-making autonomy. Holacracy was designed to keep much of the structure of an organization but to eliminate command-and-control activities. �I wonder if it�s an unwillingness to step into the discomfort of actualized autonomy a fear about �what if I make a mistake?�� Two of the problems Foster was observing seemed related to exactly this concern. The first potential problem was apparent confusion among some in the lead link role about their true accountabilities. As described earlier the lead link was the administrator of a circle who set out the circle�s roles accountabilities strategies and metrics. However a lead link role was not accountable for the leadership and decision-making responsibilities that most people naturally associated with the role of a boss or a manager. In a typical company managers provided oversight and employees often deferred decisions upward; however in Holacracy the lead link role was not above the other roles in a circle but rather was a peer with accountabilities only for circle administration. Decisions needed to be made by the employees whose roles and accountabilities were associated with the work. Autonomy and self-management meant that employees made their own decisions and prioritized their own work using their own best judgment.In hindsight Foster came to realize that taking people who had held management positions prior to Holacracy implementation and putting them into lead link roles did not always work as planned. Some of these people turned out to be good at administration and could leave the oversight and decision-making roles to those to whom they belonged. But others had difficulty with this process instead wanting to continue making decisions in areas for which they no longer had responsibility. Two particular forms of misalignment in the lead link role had become apparent. In one the lead link took over the circle�s decision making while in the other circle members abrogated their responsibilities to a willing lead link.In the first former managers acted as though the lead link role was that of a traditional decision-making manager and not that of a circle administrator. It became common in some circles for the lead link to interrupt others in the process of presenting a problem and to begin solving what they thought the problem was. Orders from the lead link typically followed such as �What you�re describing has been an issue for a while what I want you to do is this . . . � which clearly took away the autonomy of the other circle members to present and fix their own problems. While this behaviour would not necessarily stand out in a non-Holacratic company actively managing other people and making their decisions was not a feature of Holacracy.The second type of misaligned behaviour had acquired its own name among those involved with the implementation process. So-called �mom� lead links were lead links who behaved as the active caretaker of the circle. Such administrators wanted to both administer the circle and help circle members with any and all problems they faced. Moms applied pressure to others in the circle to come to them with their problems rather than work through them on their own. Foster did not believe the motivations were necessarily malicious; in many cases the lead link felt badly about how circle members were now struggling with the additional pressure of working autonomously. Moms for example would take notes about others� problems in a meeting and then approach the person afterward to offer to help solve the problem thereby leaving the person feeling that they handled the issue well. Regardless of whether this behaviour was driven by a fundamental belief that other people would not be able to handle problems on their own or not the moms-as-lead-links contradicted the self-management philosophy of Holacracy.The third problem Foster recognized first began appearing in circles that she knew were having difficulty with the transition to Holacracy according to the post-implementation surveys and informal follow-up conversations with people throughout the company. When asking others how the Holacracy transition was going Foster heard variations of a story where some part of the company would be facing a big issue such as massive unplanned service outages or a large customer was found to have talked to a competitor. In some such cases an individual or small group would try to come up with a big overarching solution for the problem. In the past this style of hero management where people swooped in to save the day had been common at iQmetrix and had often been rewarded with promotion for those involved. What was now happening in some Holacracy circles was that in the event of a service outage for example someone would come up with a list of the top 15 reasons why an outage happened and then attempt to design a solution that addressed all 15 reasons. The next step was presenting this comprehensive solution to large groups of people. At this point the situation immediately got out of hand when it became obvious that the big solution impinged on the accountabilities of several different circles and roles in the company most of which had not been involved in creating the plan. Instead under Holacracy people with problems were expected to make small iterative changes by comparing the difference between their desired state known as the ideal state with what they were faced with at any given time and explicitly conceptualizing that gap as a tension. Tensions were then dealt with one at a time until all facets of a problem were clearly defined and addressed. In contrast hero management sought to solve problems by going straight to designing one overarching solution. Foster had already seen for herself that the all-in-one solutions tended to be so broad in scope that they left many individual tensions with compromise solutions. Moreover the people with roles directly affected by the solution would have had neither the opportunity for nor the satisfaction of solving their own part of the larger problem.Senior and influential iQers and executives were slow to stop this type of activity however and this process left many employees both confused and disillusioned about Holacracy. Most employees understood that Holacratic principles were meant to produce iterative change at the local circle level and move away from hero-managed all-encompassing solutions. However reality was not converging with this ideal in some parts of the company. A by-product of the executive practice of condoning hero behaviour was that it reinforced the beliefs of skeptics who felt Holacracy was just the next new thing that would eventually just go away. Thinking about this third problem in this way reminded Foster of the advice a former CEO had given her at a Holacracy conference in Amsterdam the previous May: to have a successful adoption of Holacracy �some people would need to be told to slow down and some would need to be told to speed up.� In other words some people would need to stop making decisions while others would need to start. Foster thought if she could get people out of the mindset of having to create overarching �super solutions� and learn instead to embrace small iterative changes as the way to solve problems then maybe she could consider the implementation period as complete.Foster had increasingly noted something interesting in her meetings with the Holacracy Implementation circle members�people who had roles as Holacracy coaches and meeting facilitators. Starting in the summer of 2017 the meeting facilitators began reporting that employees throughout the company were beginning to say things in their meetings that were supportive of the change comments such as how the Holacracy tactical meetings were actually more efficient than what they had been prior to Holacracy and that it was becoming less uncomfortable speaking up in a meeting. Foster had initially considered these reports to be encouraging and a sign that the implementation was progressing; however in the past month she had begun to have doubts. Finally as Foster started putting her notes together to report on the implementation status she initially intended to say that a positive attitude toward Holacracy was gaining momentum. What she noticed however was that all the examples she had for demonstrating progress were predominantly from tactical meetings. She had few meaningful examples of employees actually using the Holacracy philosophy and demonstrating advanced Holacratic practices in the context of everyday work. Foster�s first thought was that having examples only from meetings was because the people she had talked to were all involved in facilitating those meetings so that was where the observations would naturally be. That explanation did not last long however when she recognized that the people facilitating meetings were also in coaching roles that put them in the front lines of the organization�s circles on a daily or weekly basis. She also thought that it was perhaps a maturity issue and that people would become comfortable with the formal group processes such the tactical meetings and gradually diffuse Holacracy philosophies into the rest of their workday. Perhaps she thought but if that is the case then she would have expected to see examples of this diffusion from the first wave of implementation which had been almost a year ago and she had not. Whatever the cause it was clear that what had looked potentially promising for adopting Holacracy might actually be only a surface adoption. Foster wondered to herself: �Do people think that if they do the one-hour weekly meetings well they are doing Holacracy well? Do they think the meetings are Holacracy? Are people just going through the motions even with good intent?� The recent organizational change had been a significant shift but certainly not the only major change in the young company�s history. �Being in the tech industry means you signed up for an unpredictable environment that changes quickly� she continued �and the typical iQer is pretty resilient to all this so let�s assume that people want to go along but something is getting in the way. What could that be?�next stepsLater that day at 12:32 p.m. Foster took off her headset and locked her laptop; her 11:30 a.m. tactical meeting had completed on time. �Come on Bartlett let�s get some lunch� she called out to iQmetrix�s marketing director Tara Bartlett in the next office. �How was your morning?� Bartlett asked on the way to the elevator. �Pretty amazing actually� Foster responded. �Three hours of tactical meetings and I didn�t once feel like anyone was lost in the process. How was your morning?� �Pretty amazing too. I had a bunch of one-on-ones with the marketing managers to discuss their campaign strategies for the coming year. Lots of questions about if those were the right problems to be concerned with if other campaigns might be more important how they would know if they were done and what they needed in order to move on to the next thing� Bartlett responded. As Foster pushed the elevator button she absently thought �So interesting. McGillivray�s going to ask me those same questions in a couple of hours.�Exhibit 1: IQMETRIX�S Rollout Schedule including Circles per WaveNote: APIs = Application Programming Interface; iQer = iQmetrix employee; GC = General Company; Wireless Ops = Wireless Operations; Wireless Dev Ops = Wireless Development Operations; RQ = Product Name; IT = Information Technology; BI = Business Intelligence; DevOps = Development Operations; HUB = Product Name; PMO UAT = Project Management Office User Acceptance Training; CorpDev M&A = Corporate Development Mergers and Acquisitions.

One year later as the COVID-19 pandemic raged demand had fallen to half of its previous level and airlines faced tough challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic was a new and severe crisis. The responses of airlines and their alliances depended on the fundamental economics and structure of the industry. To devise new strategies for their futures global airlines had to consider the economics and market structure of their industry. Would the fundamental economics of the airline industry be forever affected? Would the industry return to a �new normal� at some point? The GLOBAL AIRLINE INDUSTRYThe global airline business had historically been highly regulated and safeguarded by domestic governments who saw airlines as national entities. In the 1970s and 1980s a wave of deregulation paved the way for increased consolidation and the formation of airline alliances known in the industry as �constellations.� Three such alliances connected their members across the globe: Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam. Member airlines of these constellations shared passengers with each other when making connections across different countries. This connection was part of a hub-and-spoke system in which major airports served as hubs connecting the localities around them.Economics of AirlinesThe profitability of an airline typically depended upon a small number of key cost and revenue drivers which the industry used specific formulas to track (see Exhibit 1). The key revenue drivers were capacity load factor and passenger yield. The unit of analysis for measuring capacity of a given flight was referred to as seat kilometres which calculated the number of seats multiplied by the distance flown. Available seat kilometres (ASK) on a flight represented the number of total seats. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) represented seats filled with paying passengers. The ratio of RPK over ASK determined the load factor of the flight which referred to the capacity use for a particular flight. When aggregated over time and across the flights of an airline these measurements allowed industry analysts to calculate the overall size and load of an airline company�s business. A high load factor in an airline�s traffic performance was usually correlated with higher operating margins and returns on sales (see Exhibit 2).Airlines had to balance capacity and load factor in the deployment of their fleet and pricing of their flights. In 2018 American Airlines Inc. (American) flew 454 billion ASKs. In comparison Delta Air Lines Inc. (Delta) flew only 424 billion ASKs. However Delta had a load factor of 86 per cent compared to American�s load factor of only 82 per cent. Therefore Delta recorded a net profit of $3.9 billion compared to American�s net profit of only $1.4 billion. To maintain a high load factor Delta often decreased capacity. In 2012 Delta�s chief executive officer declared that �capacity discipline is our key lever.� That year Delta cut capacity by 7 per cent on its North Atlantic routes. As a result its load factor improved and its unit revenues increased by 9 per cent. The final main driver of revenue for an airline was passenger yield. This yield was measured as the revenue per passenger per kilometre. Passenger yield was strongly determined by the route being flown. Airlines competed heavily for the most profitable routes most notably flights between Western Europe and North America which were popular with business travellers.In addition each route had varying levels of competition which would affect pricing. In 2019 the airline constellation Oneworld controlled 71 per cent of the flights from London�s Heathrow Airport to New York�s John F. Kennedy International Airport mainly due to British Airways controlling many of the slots available for flights to and from London. Similarly the airline constellation SkyTeam had a large market share in the airline route from Paris France to New York United States whereas Star Alliance controlled the route from Frankfurt Germany to New York United States. In each case these routes served as cross-Atlantic pipelines that funneled traffic from destinations that lay behind or beyond one of the hubs.The key cost drivers for airlines were labour fuel and advertising. The largest cost that airlines typically faced was labour which accounted for approximately 40 per cent of total costs in 2018. In years where prices were particularly high fuel could overtake labour cost as the largest unit expense. In 2018 fuel accounted for 24 per cent of total costs. The volatility of fuel prices led to large differences year-to-year in overall cost structures (see Exhibit 3). Ticketing and promotion also represented a large share of costs. Major airlines were dedicated to reducing marketing costs by cutting commissions introducing online booking and establishing their own online reservation systems. With widespread use of the Internet for booking air travel airlines were devoting larger amounts to advertising online in an attempt to increase their load factor. One notable example of a global airline�s financial information was United Airlines�the largest member airline in the Star Alliance constellation. In 2018 the airline earned over $2 billion in net income (see Exhibit 4) and recorded over $44 billion in total assets (see Exhibit 5). Mileage Loyalty ProgramsTo promote customer loyalty and develop future business airlines used mileage programs in which passengers could accumulate points toward future travel. Over time the airlines began selling some of their mileage points to credit card companies which in turn offered them as promotion to their customers. Consumers could earn travel miles by using the credit cards and use them toward the purchase of flight tickets. Recurring customers and business travellers could benefit from their loyalty status by receiving lounge access and free upgrades. Each airline had its own type of frequent flyer program. Within an alliance use of these programs was often shared by the member airlines who would accept each other�s travel miles.The economic benefit of mileage loyalty programs depended on two key factors. First loyalty programs provided airlines with a way to connect with and retain their most loyal customer base. Second loyalty programs provided a source of liquidity that could be used during times of uncertainty. Each credit card company paid the airlines for the miles accumulated by customers using their card. In return airlines accumulated liabilities in the form of unclaimed miles. Most accumulated travel miles were claimed within two years but redemption was largely unpredictable which added a layer of risk to loyalty programs.The form and operation of loyalty programs varied considerably. However the traditional form was best exemplified by the partnership between the airline Delta and the American Express credit card. The partnership began in 1996 and was extended for 11 years in 2019. The main benefit of the partnership was renewed investment in Delta�s SkyMiles credit card. In 2018 Delta estimated the annual benefit from its partnership with American Express at $3.4 billion. With the new deal this annual benefit was expected to increase to approximately $7 billion by 2023. In contrast to the traditional partnership of Delta and American Express Air Canada took a novel approach by spinning off its loyalty program Aeroplan into a separate corporation. The newly independent company went public in 2005 under the name Groupe Aeroplan. In 2008 the company was renamed Aimia and began investing in the loyalty programs of other airlines including Aerov�as de M�xico S.A. de C.V. (commonly known as Aerom�xico) and AirAsia Berhad. However after 13 years of separation from its own loyalty program Air Canada decided to repurchase the Aeroplan business from the independent company Aimia in 2018 (see Exhibit 6).Regulated Competition in the Global Airline Industry Air travel was a huge industry operating on a global scale. In 2019 the 290 member airlines in the International Air Transport Association together transported over 4.5 billion passengers and had total operating revenues of $838 billion. At that time revenues had been growing at 3.2 per cent per year and projections were for more of the same. Company performance in the airline industry was cyclical based on changing consumer demand and the price of inputs particularly labour and fuel.Soaring fuel prices in the early 1990s during the Gulf War caused many airline companies to suffer considerable losses. Overall the industry lost $16 billion from 1990 to 1993. However the next five years were profitable. Similarly the industry experienced a downturn after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center but consolidation and higher passenger yields again led to robust profitability by the 2010s. Airlines introduced a slew of fees for services and often made millions of dollars in profit on just ticket change fees. Another industry boon in the late 2010s was a decline in fuel prices. By 2019 the future of the global airline industry seemed strong although a down cycle was looming as the economic expansion that was evident in those years began to slow. Regulation and DeregulationSince its birth in the mid-20th century the commercial airline industry had been regulated by national governments in a multitude of ways. For the most part routes had to be approved and licensed by government agencies prices were set by negotiation between governments and by national authorities foreign ownership was restricted in national airlines and airlines were restricted to flying only to and from their home countries. International rules such as cabotage restricted airlines from operating domestic flights in countries other than their home base. In other words a German airliner was allowed to fly from Germany to the United States and back picking up passengers at each end-point but was not allowed to fly passengers between two cities in the United States.Starting in the United States in 1978 and spreading to the European Union (EU) in 1993 a wave of deregulation and liberalization loosened restrictions on pricing and routes. With the creation of a single European aviation market EU airlines were permitted to fly to and from all international destinations within the EU region. However travel to and from non-EU countries was still subject to bilateral negotiations between individual European countries and the non-EU country. The rules of cabotage remained in effect for the important trans-Atlantic and Asian routes.Beginning in 1992 the governments of the United States and the Netherlands signed an Open Skies bilateral air treaty that allowed US airlines to fly without restrictions to Dutch cities and the reverse. The treaty also granted KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest Airlines Corp. full antitrust immunity to pursue an alliance although they were not allowed to merge ownership. By 2016 the United States had made similar agreements with 120 other countries. Among the benefits that countries received in signing an agreement with the United States was permission for US national airlines to set their own routes and pricing between countries.But US airlines still could not fly within the EU or within any other countries. An Open Skies agreement still did not grant US carriers the right to cabotage in the foreign country�s domestic market. However by forming an alliance with a domestic partner in the EU or any country a US carrier could connect more effectively to the domestic route structure operated by the foreign airline.National Ownership and Antitrust The traditional form of alliance in the industry had been one of loose ties between two partners with no equity cross-participation. There were a few exceptions such as British Airways and Delta which were likely to take an equity interest in their partners. One of the important features of these alliances was that they enabled the partners to overcome some of the restrictions imposed by national regulations.Although many industries had seen the decline or elimination of so-called �national champions� in the 1980s and 1990s this did not happen to the same extent with airlines. In many countries national airline companies were either state-owned or protected by the government. In Europe even after the creation of the single European market in 1992 the rule was generally that no foreign investor was allowed to own more than 49.9 per cent of the capital in a national airline. In the United States the threshold was even lower�no more than 25 per cent foreign participation. Airlines were widely regarded as national assets.Starting in the 1990s pairs or small groups of airlines were able to form joint ventures (JV) which differed from typical JVs in other industries that involved joint equity ownership. In an airline JV the partners would be given antitrust immunity by the two governments allowing them to coordinate prices and capacity on a specific route and share profits. The structure thus acted like a typical JV but was purely a contractual arrangement with the all-important antitrust immunity at its root. Outside of those JVs the partners were still expected and required to compete with each other.The three major global airline constellations�Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam�did not implement this degree of coordination and therefore did not need formal antitrust immunity. However the alliance members were careful to follow antitrust regulations. On major routes the alliance groups could conceivably be anti-competitive and would then be subject to being blocked by antitrust authorities. For example in 2019 the partnership of Delta and Air France controlled 93 per cent of the Paris France to New York United States routes; the partnership of Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Singapore Airlines controlled 83 per cent of the flights from Frankfurt Germany to New York United States. Even without directly seeking antitrust immunity like other airline JVs the three major alliances still had to deal with many regulatory barriers. For example Oneworld had to satisfy the US Federal Aviation Administration before formalizing the alliance between American and British Airways. Originally the two airlines were forced to keep their mileage programs separate for North Atlantic routes. Additionally the authorities demanded that the partners give up 267 of their slots at congested Heathrow Airport a condition which they were not ready to accept.On routes requiring a connection alliances appeared more likely to be pro-competitive. Alliances had the potential to offer more frequent flights and shorter connections for secondary destinations at a reasonable price. A study conducted in 2000 by the University of Chicago concluded that average fares on international routes on non-aligned airlines were 25 per cent higher than fares on airlines that were allied. A more recent study by the International Air Transport Association in 2012 also confirmed the price advantages of increased airline co-operation for consumers on certain routes. Rising Competition from the Middle EastIn the 2010s several state-supported airlines based in the Middle East emerged in the industry. Etihad Airways (based in Abu Dhabi) Emirates (based in Dubai) and Qatar Airways Company (based in Doha) soon became competitors to the major global airlines. State subsidies allowed the Middle Eastern airlines to purchase planes and increase capacity at an unprecedented rate. These carriers also had access to cheap fuel and their home base was strategically located between the United States Europe and Asia. They specialized in long flights between the regions with a stop in the Middle East. Personnel stationed in these home countries benefitted from low personal income taxes. Etihad Airways and Emirates were two of the fastest-growing network airlines in the world. In 2011 Emirates passed United Airlines as the largest global airline based on capacity. Qatar Airways Company and Etihad Airways were ranked 10th and 13th in size respectively in the world in 2014.Other than Qatar Airways Company which joined the Oneworld constellation in 2013 none of the major Middle Eastern airlines were members of alliances. Etihad Airways and Emirates did form other types of partnerships�they made minority investments in various airlines to create their own constellation. By 2015 Etihad Airways Partners included six airlines: Etihad Airways Alitalia SpA Air Berlin PLC Air Serbia Air Seychelles Jet Airways Ltd and Darwin Airline SA. In theory these investment partnerships could include airlines that were already members of the alliance constellations. However Star Alliance regulated this feature through change-of-control clauses in its governance policies which did not permit members to become part of an investment partnership.The Future of the Airline IndustryIndustry ConsolidationDespite a complex web of regulations the global airline industry had steadily moved toward long-term consolidation. In the 2000s and early 2010s consolidation was apparent both in Europe and in North America. In the United States Delta merged with Northwest Airlines Corp. United Airlines merged with Continental Airlines and US Airways merged with American. In Europe British Airways merged with Iberia Air France merged with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Deutsche Lufthansa AG acquired controlling shares in Swiss International Air Lines AG Austrian Airlines AG and Brussels Airlines. Sometimes these mergers affected the membership of their respective alliances. For example Continental Airlines left the SkyTeam constellation and joined Star Alliance after the merger between Delta and Northwest Airlines Corp. while Continental Airlines completed its own merger with United Airlines.Airline constellations also continued expansion by adding members to their alliances. As additional airlines joined existing constellations overlap increased in route structures of members which affected how incumbent members perceived the application of new members to their alliance. For example when Singapore Airlines entered Star Alliance the financial consultants of Thai Airways International Public Co. Ltd. wondered about the effect of its current role as the Star Alliance airline that connected European hubs with Southeast Asia. The consultants estimated that Singapore Airlines being added to the group could cost their airline $10 million annually in lost revenues from code sharing in flights with Deutsche Lufthansa AG. In addition Singapore Airlines was the most powerful regional rival in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless the membership was approved by the group and the rival airlines continued to operate as partners.Entry and exit from airline constellations was governed by terms of their membership. For example to be accepted for entry in Star Alliance an airline had to demonstrate its ability to meet the alliance�s standards. Existing members voted on new memberships just like they did on other major strategic issues. Originally Star Alliance had operated under a one-airline one-vote rule; however as membership grew the organization introduced tiered voting. In 2019 voting shares of members in Star Alliance depended on the size of their business. By 2020 the structure of the airline industry had stabilized after decades of reorganization. Star Alliance had become a mature alliance organization with a stable membership and a well-developed set of rules and processes and was the largest of the three major airline constellations which followed similar strategies and comparable structures. The market shares of these groups were similar and mergers between domestic airliners seemed to have reached a point beyond which further consolidation would be barred by antitrust regulations.Potential Changes in the Hub-and-Spoke ModelSince its inception Star Alliance had made it its main focus to optimize the hub-and-spoke network of the airline industry which it saw as a key benefit. However beginning in 2015 point-to-point flights became increasingly popular especially ultra long-haul flights (LHFs). By definition ultra LHFs referred to flights that travelled over 14.5 hours without connections. These point-to-point flights reduced total travel time significantly compared to the hub-and-spoke system but they also resulted in cost savings for both travellers and airlines. Due to their higher ticket prices LHFs were less attractive to personal passengers but more popular for corporate travel. By 2019 Qantas Airways Limited�s flight from Perth Australia to London United Kingdom claimed an average load factor above 90 per cent.With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the advantages of LHFs became increasingly evident for two reasons. First unlike with the hub-and-spoke system point-to-point networks allowed airlines the choice of flying only the most economically viable routes without health and safety concerns from layovers. This had been the strategy of low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines Co in domestic markets. Internationally however a trip to the other side of the globe required a stop to refuel. Intermediate stops were also hubs and flights could connect with other incoming flights at those hubs. Second by the late 2010s new planes were being developed for non-stop ultra LHFs. For example the Boeing 787-9 and the Airbus A350-900 aircraft were particularly fuel efficient and therefore made LHFs more commercially viable than ever before.However despite these advantages LHFs still had two major limitations. First due to the long-distance nature of their routes the profitability for airlines was even more vulnerable to extreme fuel prices fluctuations. Second fatigue posed a serious health threat to passengers flight crews and pilots on these routes. Challenges AheadBy 2020 the global airline industry was at a pivotal point in its history. The rise of powerful airline constellations created a dominant hub-and-spoke system that connected member airlines across the world. However as the world was hit by the novel COVID-19 virus these very connections were being threatened and the industry was once again forced to adapt. Would the airline business return to normal after a few years? Would LHFs replace the hub-and-spoke system? How large would the business travel segment be in the future? Would industry consolidation continue to take place or would national governments take back more control over their domestic airline carriers? Many of these questions were heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic which was expected to decrease revenue by 50 per cent and net profits by $84 billion in 2020 (see Exhibit 7). By the end of 2020 the airline industry was in a critical juncture in its short history. An industry once dominated by heavy regulation and complex global constellations was now scrambling to readjust to rapidly changing consumer demand.Exhibit 1: Formulas for Analyzing Airline EconomicsNote: ASK = available seat kilometres (calculated as flight kilometres _ number of total seats); RPK = revenue passenger kilometres (calculated as flight kilometres _ number of occupied seats); load factor = ratio of RPK to ASK; PASK = passenger revenue per ASK; CASK = unit cost per ASK; unit operating income = operating income per ASK; unit net income = unit operating income minus taxes and interest.Source: Tom Stalnaker Khalid Usman Aaron Taylor and Grant Alport Airline Economic Analysis: 2017�2018 Edition Oliver Wyman: Marsh & McLennan Companies 2018 accessed December 14 2020 www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2018/January/Airline_Economic_Analysis_AEA_2017-18_web_FF.pdf.Exhibit 2: Load Factor Return on Sales and Capacity of Global Airlines 2018Note: ASK = available seat kilometres; return on sales measured as operating income � revenue.Source: Prepared by the case authors with data from �World Airline Rankings 2018� Flight Airline Business 2018 accessed December 14 2020 www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/World-airline-rankings-2018.pdf.Exhibit 3: Cost Structure of Major Global Airlines (in US$)Average Costs per FlightAverage Pricing per Flight for Select RoutesNote: ASK = available seat kilometres; km = kilometres.Source: Steve Saxon and Mathieu Weber �A Better Approach to Airline Costs� McKinsey & Company July 13 2017 accessed December 14 2020 www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/a-better-approach-to-airline-costs#; Flight Airline Business World Airline Rankings 2018 2018 accessed July 14 2020 www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/World-airline-rankings-2018.pdf; prepared by case authors searching with the �Origins and Destinations� function for final data on routing shown on tickets for flights from Jan 1 2019 to Dec 31 2019 between JFK and CDG GRA and LHR from the �Market Intelligence� Sabre accessed July 14 2020 www.sabre.com/search/origins+and+destinations/.

Before changing its name to Aimia in 2008 the company was known as Groupe Aeroplan which was a spinoff from Air Canada created on May 5 2005. The initial public offering raised approximately CAD$250 million for Air Canada and relieved the airline of all mileage liabilities. However it also separated the company from its most loyal customers.This was the first major instance of an airline separating itself from its loyalty program and few companies have ever chosen to follow this model. From its inception Aimia branded itself as a �loyalty and travel consolidator.� Although Air Canada�s loyalty program constituted a large portion of the company�s business it did partner with and provide loyalty services to various other airlines. These airlines included Aerov�as de M�xico S.A. de C.V. (Aerom�xico) and AirAsia Berhad. The services Aimia provided included loyalty program strategy design and operations consulting. These services were an attempt by the company to expand outside of simply being a holding company for Air Canada�s loyalty program Aeroplan.The strategy generally resulted in poor financial returns. Aimia�s median annual return on equity from 2005-2018 was �3.8 per cent. After 13 years of separation from its loyalty program Air Canada decided to repurchase Aeroplan from Aimia in 2018.The terms of the deal were complicated and involved several different parties. First Air Canada agreed to pay Aimia CA$450 million in cash which was used by Aimia mainly to repay outstanding debts. In return by taking back its loyalty program Air Canada assumed roughly CAD$1.9 billion in miles liability. Second Air Canada received two payments amounting to CAD$1.2 billion from Toronto Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. This money came in two forms: CAD$822 million was paid directly as cash and CAD$400 million was structured as pre-payments for future monthly miles payments. Third Air Canada received an undisclosed payment from Visa Inc. along with a partnership commitment until 2030. In December 2018 Air Canada�s acquisition passed regulatory barriers and the airline was reunited with its loyalty program. In April 2020 following the sale of its Aeroplan business Aimia underwent a corporate transformation rebranding itself as an investment holding company. In July 2020 several years after Air Canada�s acquisition of Aeroplan Aimia remained a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company had a market capitalization of approximately CAD$300 million and 95 million shares outstanding. The company�s main assets comprised a 49 per cent stake in the loyalty program consulting service Kognitiv a 49 per cent stake in Aerom�xico�s loyalty program and a 20 per cent stake in AirAsia Berhad�s loyalty program. In April 2020 Aimia was also considering the acquisition of Mittleman Brothers LLC a mutual fund with US$317 million in assets under management. Well into 2020 the corporate strategy of Aimia and the future of its 450 employees remained uncertain.

Founded in India in August 2012 as a casual wear apparel brand TDC had grown rapidly. The company featured three main business lines: electronic dance music (EDM) fashion apparel and accessories sports gear and affordable fashion wear. Singh had adopted a house of brands strategy for the companyâs three brands: TDC Fieldgear and Koolho. After six years one of the three brands had started generating profits but none had achieved recognition outside a niche circle. However confident that the various brands were aligned with TDCâs vision and encouraged by the companyâs success Singh was considering expanding into international markets. Because of limited access to funds synergy among the companyâs house brands and the impact of macro-environmental factors on his growth plans Singh had to choose the best branding strategy for the companyâs future. TIKTAULI DE CORPSGenesis and GrowthFounded as a casual wear apparel brand in 2012 TDC had grown rapidly into multiple product categories. Its unique identity was derived from music influences such as hip hop and EDM and from subculture genres such as swag rap dope rave noir and techno. TDC was unapologetic about its image proudly proclaiming on its website âWe sell Music inspired Trend setting Fashion â¦ and âNo Shit.ââ By mid-July 2018 the brandâs Facebook page had 52813 likes and 52625 followers. TDCâs vision was to develop 360-degree retail with a global online business foundation. Similarly the companyâs mission statement outlined a drive for profitability market hold and customer delight through multiple business verticals. Singh was striving to achieve his vision directly through the companyâs brands and indirectly through business-to-business (B2B) supplies. In the near future he planned to target the markets of Brazil Russia India and China (known as the BRIC countries) and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The company had set a deadline of 2021 to make the brand global. Singh planned to achieve this goal by setting up and building multiple independent brands simultaneously.TDC started its journey as an aggregator and supplier of apparel and footwear brands to the giant e-commerce platforms Flipkart and Amazon.com. The company then started an online marketing campaign for its range of apparel and accessories inspired by the hip hop and EDM genres. It also began supplying athletic apparel under the Fieldgear brand name to become an official outfitter for various national sports leagues in India. Singh also had plans for a new online music channel called Tiktauli Air with nearly 50 EDM disk jockeys (DJs) from around the world streaming EDM on the website. With TDCâs head office established in Nevada United States Singh planned to expand into the United States as well as entering Brazil Iran Kazakhstan Nigeria Romania Belarus and the United Kingdom within the next three years. His foreign market expansion strategy was to follow the same path he had taken in India: penetrate popular fashion e-retailing portals and then leverage their reach. This meant introducing TDC products in these foreign markets through popular e-commerce websites such as Zalora to reach the Asian countries of Malaysia Singapore and Indonesia; Next Brazil to enter the Brazil market; and Wildberries.kz to reach Kazakhstan.Core Businesses TDCâs core businesses comprised of two business verticals: B2B fulfillment and company owned brands. The company had already realized some success in the first segment as Singh confirmed:B2B was kind of unorganized earlier wherein e-commerce companies did not have any direct relationships with brands. TDC forged excellent relationships with several brands after those initial years of learning and had signed agreements with brands like Fila Adidas and Reebok in India. B2B fulfillment had been the major bread-and-butter vertical for the past four years at the group.TDC had three currently active company owned brands: TDC which marketed apparel footwear and accessories; Fieldgear which sold sports apparel and equipment; and Koolho which provided affordable premium quality apparel (see Exhibits 1 and 2). A fourth brandâthe soon-to-be-launched Tiktauli Air online music channelâwas still in a conceptual stage. Although its launch was still more than a year away the music channel formed an integral part of Singhâs music-apparel vision. TDCâs StrengthsFrom the beginning Singh had hired talented designers from design schools in the United States and the United Kingdom as well as from Indiaâs own premier National Institute of Fashion Technologyâs apparel design and production school. TDCâs policy to hire from the best schools created excellent design and product development strength for the companyâs brands. With his own background in product marketing and fashion Singh had the necessary expertise to manage the brands successfully. Singh also instilled and nurtured a close-knit culture in his organization. Despite the companyâs fast growth in both revenue turnover and size employees rarely left the organization. In the six years the company had been in operation only two employees had left the firmâboth of whom later returned to TDC though one could not be suitably re-accommodated in the organization (see Exhibit 3). The TDC PhilosophyFrom a brand positioning perspective Singh believed in forging his own path rather than following others. âWhen others were trying to make cool fashion we craved for something known as âmy way.ââ This philosophy led TDC into its own brand vision and mission. The company designed everything with âswagâ in mind. Accordingly TDC purveyed products that aimed to build stylish confidence in its target audience while efficiently developing and maintaining strong ethical stakeholder relationships especially with suppliers.Business ModelTDCâs business model revolved around four key activities: operating a successful online apparel business identifying and exploiting two major revenue sources identifying three target customer bases and tightly managing finances. TDC generated revenues from B2B fulfillment for big-brand e-commerce retailers like Amazon.com Flipkart Jabong and Myntra. TDCâs focus on financial management always aimed for positive results in revenue and profit from the companyâs brands as Singh explained:From the beginning our B2B business was profitable and we were able to support company owned brands with low-hanging revenues from the B2B fulfillment business. In 2012 the share of company owned brands in the total business had been approximately 10 per cent only. By 2018â2019 we plan to increase that share in the total turnover of the company to 45 per cent and by 2020 move it up to 50 per cent or more. Company owned brands will fetch more profit and bring more consistency since for B2B brands at the end of the day . . . you are dependent on others . . . and as I believe in 360-degree vision I would prefer to mitigate the business risk and invest more in company owned brands in the future.Supply ChainHaving started in 2012 TDCâs B2B fulfillment vertical had become successful by 2013. At first e-commerce platforms did not have a relationship with individual brands and found it challenging to work with them. The portals wanted to buy low numbers of items at infrequent rates whereas the major brands required high-number purchases (e.g. half a million pairs or pieces of apparel) and signed agreements to buy more products throughout the year. The portals realized that they needed help in procuring products from major brands. As Singh explained:They approached us [to see] if we could help them connect with brands. Thatâs how the supply chain side started. We converted unorganized into organized supply systems. At first I used to procure from distributors and others and supplied to the e-commerce platforms. Later I started procuring products directly from the company as an affiliated business partner and started supplying to these e-commerce platforms as their authorized agent. TDC signed business supply agreements with multinational corporations like Fila Inc. Adidas Inc. and Reebok International. TDCâs supply side agreement required the first deal to always be in cash. TDC also invested heavily in the supply chain system of these operationsâup to â¹40 million or even â¹60 million at a time. TDCâs supply chain operated a global network sourcing and manufacturing products from around the world. The company considered its supply chain partners important collaborators. Therefore TDC focused on building strong and respectful long-term relationships with both major brands and e-commerce portals. Singh believed that these relationships were critical to the companyâs continued success.TDC established several international franchises and so-called âshop-in-shopsâ with a presence in multi-brand outlets in the Middle East West Africa South Africa Europe and South Asia. TDC successfully managed its relationships with back-end suppliers while promoting a front-end point-of-sale network across the globe making it possible for customers to easily access its products.  MUSIC INSPIRED CONSUMER BRANDSHip Hop and EDMHip hop music originated in the 1970s in the poorest inner-city African-American neighbourhoods of New York City. Youth unemployment was high when rapping deejaying breakdancing graffiti art and hip hop music were discovered and new deejaying techniques such as using two turntables and a mixer to play music non-stop developed. This was the beginning of rap music. EDM was the base for TDCâs range of products. EDM was a percussion-based range of music genres created specifically for festivals raves and nightclubs. These music styles were mixed seamlessly from various album tracks by DJs. Throughout the 1980s and up to the mid-1990s mainstream media distanced itself from this genre of music because of its association with illegal drugs. The events were often a target of law enforcement agencies across North America and continental Europe. In the early 2010s the American music industry embarked on a rebranding of the rave culture. Despite attempts to create a specific music genre EDM continued to be an umbrella term for different music styles such as house techno trance drum and bass dubstep and respective subgenres of these styles.  According to Singh âHip-hop is macroâlike a continentâwhile EDM is microâlike a country. Hip-hop is not just about dance but about a lifestyleâthe way you walk what you wear what you listen to including your hairstyle . . . it is a bigger domain.âApparel and FootwearFor its fans EDM was more than musicâit was a way of life and EDM apparel was a must-have because it accentuated and embellished the unique EDM musical experience. EDM apparel ranged from âeveryday wearables to unique festival fits.â Many EDM brands called the apparel wearable art claiming that EDM fansâ bodies were a canvas for expression. Globally EDM had a history of high-profile apparel brands that included Hous Billionaires Apparel Shrapnel Streetwear Neffmau5 JoJoElectro CLVB Life Bassdrop NGHTBRND and LBD (Little Black Diamond). Most of these brands were endorsed by popular DJs. For example CLVB Life was endorsed by Tiesto JoJo Electro by DJ Dan and Neffmau5 by Deadmau5. These brands produced music-inspired products such as shirts hats slogan T-shirts backpacks cell phone cases necklaces caps and shorts with the premise to give âraversâ everything they needed to âkeep calm and rave on.â Typing the phrase âEDM apparel brands in Indiaâ into Googleâs search box would return âTiktauli De. Corps. Hip Hop EDM Swag Rap Dope Rave Noir and . . .â as the top search result. Other EDM apparel brands such as Acid Apparels United Colours of Benetton Pepe Jack & Jones Fighting Fame and SFYNX were available in India on online platforms such as Myntra Koovs and uBuy. However Singh believed âThey do not have the same presence as TDC.âRave Culture: Socio-political Milieu in IndiaIn 2014 Indiaâs thriving EDM scene was identified as a global EDM hot spot with the arrival of EDM stalwarts like Steve Aoki Diplo Major Lazer Carl Cox Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buren. Mumbai and Delhi were popular spots but it was the Indian state of Goa that took centre stage with its Goa Trance music parties that had originated in the 1990s. Later the popular festival Sunburn which had started in 2007 evolved into a three-day musical extravaganza with 150000 attendees and 120 artists. It was billed as one of the biggest EDM events in South Asia winning numerous accolades including 2017 BW Applause awards for Best Music Event (gold) and Best Social Media Amplification (silver). The EDM music genre started fully blossoming in India from 2007 when DJ Nikhil Chinappa from the American MTV music channel collaborated with Percept Companyâs Shailendra Singh to launch the Sunburn festival in the laid-back state of Goa a favourite destination for Indian and foreign tourists. The movement quickly grew with the meteoric rise of the Internet and burgeoning smart phone sales. From 2012 to 2015 more than 60 of the worldâs top 100 DJs performed to sold-out crowds in India which boasted a growing middle class with disposable income and where Bollywood (the Indian film industry) was extremely successful. The new post-1991 economy and booming night life of metropolitan cities helped EDMâs spectacular rise in a culturally-conscious country like India despite occasional brushes with the law. EDMâs popularity in India was not without strong voices of dissent which considered it an attack on Indian religion culture and values. Various right-wing parties and organizations opposed the EDM music wave which they associated with propagating promiscuousness drugs and a hedonistic lifestyle among Indiaâs youth. In 2016 the popular Sunburn Festival had to be moved out of Goa for the first time in the 10 years since its inception because of police raids and the seizure of banned drugs such as ketamine. When the festival was shifted to Pune local protests demanded that it be stopped for reasons including ecological harm sound pollution drug abuse and vulgarity. MARKETING AT TDCTDC spent â¹296.64 million on marketing activities with major expenses on sales force digital marketing event sponsorship and DJ sponsorship (see Exhibit 4). In October 2016 Singh and his team surveyed 75 TDC customers on the perception of its brands (see case Exhibit 5). The company then produced a basic mapping study using price and quality as the two parameters.  Brands and Product PortfolioAccording to Singh âThe various company owned brands of TDC are all well aligned with the companyâs vision of 360-degree retail . . . you will see our brands everywhere we find TDC deep into music dance and movies.â The TDC clothing fashion brand offered a wide range of apparel including T-shirts vests shirts joggers sweatshirts shorts long capes hoodies sweatpants sneakers and light-emitting diode (LED) shoes. It was positioned as a super-premium brand categorized as party wear lounge wear or simply relaxed wear but definitely not âstreet wear.â TDC footwear included high ankle shoes gold lace shoes LED shoes studded shoes joggers and classic gold shoes among other dance music inspired footwear. Priced between â¹1999 and â¹3999 TDC footwear truly captured the spirit of hip hop and EDM with its colour schemes design elements and material type. Singh often claimed âIf itâs the EDM spirit you want to feel youâve got to slip into TDC shoes and turn up the music to âare-you-crazy?â levels!â Under the Fieldgear brand name there were four product categories: apparel footwear equipment and accessories. According to Singh the Fieldgear brand was positioned as âfair price technical sports performance wear.â The equipment category featured helmets gloves cricket bats treadmills and gym cycles. The site was launched in April 2017. Fieldgear had entered the sports apparel business in India by becoming the official kit supplier to many sports federations and leagues in India including the Pro Kabaddi League the Hockey India League and the Premier Futsal league. Koolho was a brand conceived by Singh to offer an ambitiously good quality product âas good as a Louis Philippe but at unbeatably amazing prices.â He proposed to do this by selling Koolho products at a pricing multiple far lower than what the big brands employed (usually four to five times the cost of goods sold). The driving value proposition for Koolho as stated by Singh was captured by the Indian phrase âisse sasta aur achcha kahan?â (where can you get it cheaper and better?). Singhâs goal was to offer âgood quality products at very good prices.â Tiktauli Air the music channel was Singhâs brand pinnacle where it would âall come together.â The apparel the footwear the Fieldgear products and the music would make a heady mix. The interactive music radio channel would connect millions of TDCâs followers with 50 EDM DJs across the world each of whom endorsed the Tiktauli brand. The business arrangement was simple: Tiktauli would sponsor the DJsâ apparel footwear and accessories. In return the enrolled DJs would endorse the brand and provide music content for airing on Tiktauli Air which would become the worldâs first EDM Top 20 DJs ranking platform. It also planned to sell EDM concert tickets worldwide. Tiktauli Air would be a âplug and playâ EDM music listening post for customers. By 2020 Tiktauli Air would organize electronic music festivals on a larger scale than the Sunburn Festival and the Electric Daisy Carnival.  The Role of Digital Marketing TDC had been aggressively leveraging digital marketing for its brands. Facebook campaigns had been the mainstay for marketing company owned brands although Twitter Instagram and Pinterest were also used. The marketing campaigns promoted new product launches product previews cross-selling special discounts countdowns to launches EDM events and ensemble creations. The two TDC team members responsible for digital marketing activities were Akhil Sharma and Puneet Chauhan. Singh used social media platforms regularly to keep in touch with customers and ensure that product and service grievances were expeditiously addressed. Effective use of search engine marketing and search engine optimization ensured that TDCâs web pages loaded in less than three seconds to reduce the bounce rate as much as possible. Separate search engine optimization strategies were created for desktops and mobile devices. The entire team provided input for content creation which was the most important factor for customer stickiness. All members of the TDC team were deeply committed to a digital thrust in their businessâs marketing strategy. Singh had decided to spend approximately 50 per cent of TDCâs digital marketing budget of â¹10 million on content marketing alone. Of this amount 60 per cent was spent on mobile video content. Convinced that digital services on mobile devices were the way of the future Singh concentrated TDCâs efforts on marketing activities such as experiential events and business-to-consumer activations. Despite the industry-wide lacklustre performance of influencer marketing on social media Singh was proud of the high level of customer engagement and business growth resulting from EDM DJsâ influence which extended beyond the launch and throughout the life of a product line. Singh claimed that almost 25 per cent of TDCâs incremental business flowed from influencer marketing.  Leveraging Events and SponsorshipsTo deepen the companyâs relationships with its target customers TDC had chosen to sponsor events involving celebrities college festivals and collaborations with DJs and choreographers. To strengthen the Fieldgear sports brand TDC pursued associations with league controlling bodies and participating teamsÂ managing to sign contracts with all teams of the Central Reserve Police Force as well as various leagues in sports such as kabaddi hockey table tennis and futsal. Sponsorships included a wheelchair cricket tournament in Bangalore the Chennai half marathon (Happy Runners) and the Pro Kabaddi League. Other agreements were planned with teams from Kenya and Iran and with American Kabaddi teams.CHANGES IN INDIAâS PAYMENT ECOSYSTEMOn November 8 2016 the government of India announced a demonetization policy and the Digital India initiative. Until this time almost 65 per cent of transacted business had been based on a cash-on-delivery system (COD). Therefore the new government initiatives dealt a severe blow to the e-commerce apparel industry including TDC to some extent as Singh explained:After the drop in business owing to government-curtailed cash transactions we decided that the business model needed to be changed immediately. Even if customers regained their confidence I as a manufacturer-marketer could not take a chance on what might happen again in the future. As a result of digitization of business transactions the Indian e-commerce space saw a shift away from COD as a payment option.Within five months re-monetization occurred and consumers resumed using cash which had the effect of considerably lowering the level of business confidence in the system. For TDC however the impact was less pronounced because almost 90 per cent of its offerings were purchased by customers using mobile phones who were already comfortable with online transactions. Most TDC mobile customers used Appleâs iOS operating system which was an indication of the companyâs high-end customer base. This fact further confirmed the relatively low effect of the demonetization initiative. Nevertheless TDC decided to move its brands entirely away from the COD system.    The companyâs shift away from cash-based transactions was expected to have negative results for the Koolho brand which was considered a value-for-money offering. Singh worried that the brandâs largely COD-friendly clientele might abandon the brand altogether but he managed to avoid negative effects: Here our strategy was very different as the prices that we offered were low. We did not offer a free-return pick-up facility for COD customers. If we did that we would have been at a loss since the volume for Koolho was very high and therefore returns were proportionately high too. Koolho customers were required to pay through any online mode of payment such as credit cards debit cards electronic payment wallets or net banking. However this did not mean that we wouldnât accept any returns. We have a very good return policy in effect. However our belief has been that when somebody receives a pre-paid shipment it resulted in an almost 90 per cent acceptance whereas with a COD facility there was a fiftyâfifty chance of the product being returned often on insufficient grounds. So we were not going to sell through COD. Our exciting prices and excellent quality were strong enough incentives for our customers to buy by paying up front.THE CUSTOMER PERSONATrue to its music-inspired philosophy TDC offered trend-setting fashion apparel footwear and accessories that catered to the unique requirements of its core consumer groups a niche group of music enthusiasts (particularly hip hop and EDM listeners) who believed in making a statement with their appearance. These consumers identified strongly with like-minded people and were motivated by a desire to belong to the community of so-called âswaggers.â Singh had a clear vision of his target customer (see Exhibit 6):[The target is] youth in the age group of 14â24 years. When you find someone wearing earphones and listening to some music constantly they usually listen to hip hop. You see them in tight brightly coloured clothes with matching accessories. They are our target. They could be anybody. Whatever they do after work or when they take a break they listen to music mainly hip hop. Certainly the young are our potential target even a boy of 13 years who listens to Justin Bieber Meghan Trainor or Kanye West.Globally EDM listeners had specific easily identifiable demographic characteristics. They could be almost equally male or female; were mostly white African-American or Hispanic; had high school and some college education; were between 14 and 24 years of age; and had an annual household income between US$25000 and US$74000. In India EDMâs explosive growth coincided with the rise of theÂ Indian middle class and one of the worldâs youngest populations.Singh had a non-traditional approach to determining customer needs. He believed market research was for those who did not understand their market. For business leaders who worked very closely with musicians music producers DJs apparel designers and customers on the streetâas he didâmarket research was an âunnecessary expense with doubtful usefulness.â He did not use big data or analytics to mine information or glean insights. He usually followed his instinct which had led to a turnover of â¹1.18 billion and had commanded a significant brand followership on Facebookâfor a niche brand. Target Customer BehaviourEDM fans had a great need for uniqueness a personality trait that valued being different from others and that was more accentuated among adolescents. The EDM genre differed from the music styles that were generally popular with Indian youth. The EDM fan base was a subset of the Indian youth that was willing to pay â¹4000 to â¹15000 for an EDM festival ticket and dress as if disinterested in the opinion of others wearing tight clothes LED shoes and âbling-infusedâ accessories. TDC remained cautious to ensure that design and pricing fit perfectly within this youth subsetâs zone of acceptance.       THE DILEMMATDC had been successful in 2016 and 2017 with sales figures matching Singhâs expectations and employees keen on getting work done. Singhâs informal and friendly leadership approach was well received by employees. However Singh could not help but worry that TDC might not improve by continuing to lead by instinct and without a plan despite his ability to remain knowledgeable of marketplace trends without formal market research. A bigger issue that bothered Singh was the question of what brand strategy to follow. He wondered if he should continue promoting a house of brands strategy or if he should instead switch to a branded house plan. What would be the implications in terms of funding one strategy versus the other? With TDC as the umbrella brand he also wondered if the Fieldgear brand should be renamed TDC Sports and if the Koolho brand should become TDC Lifestyle. What would be the long-term implications of any of these branding decisions?EXHIBIT 1: Tiktauli De Corps BRANDS SALES FIGURES (in â¹ million)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; â¹1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; TDC = Tiktauli De Corps; B2B = business-to-business; NA = not available.Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: Tiktauli De Corps BRAND and BUSINESS PROFITABLITY (in â¹ million)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; â¹1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; TDC = Tiktauli De Corps; B2B = business-to-business Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: Tiktauli De Corps ORGANIZATIONal CHARTSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 4: Tiktauli De Corps MARKETING SPEND ACROSS ALL CHANNELS (in â¹ million)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; â¹1 = US$0.02 on July 1 2018; DJ = disk jockeySource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 5: PERCEPTUAL MAP OF Tiktauli De Corps BRANDSNote: TDC = Tiktauli De CorpsSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 6: TARGET CUSTOMER PROFILESource: Company documents.ENDNOTES

(AREUFIT) assessed her company’s position in the evolving health services market. Stuart had grown AREUFIT from a sole proprietor start-up to its current position as the Philadelphia region’s award-winning provider of preventive health and biometric screenings corporate health and disease prevention programs and wellness services with annual revenues approaching US$1 million (see Exhibit 1).Stuart had spent the last three years working with an outside consultant in preparation for the next stage in the life cycle of her company. For any founding chief executive officer (CEO) having determined a new future strategic direction represented a personal and professional crossroads. As Stuart recounted “I love what I do and I love going to work. It’s not a burden right now and I don’t want to get to that point so this is the time for exploring options.” When a competitor approached her with an offer to buy AREUFIT Stuart knew she had to make some tough decisions while remaining true to her values and business practices. She wanted to preserve the company and culture she had built protect her key employees and ensure that the brand reputation of AREUFIT would endure.The personable high-energy Stuart understood that uncertainty in the health care industry was a constant factor driven by changing regulatory and economic conditions. However the emerging importance of big data analytics the escalating costs of technology investment the increased threat of competitors eyeing the regional market and a sense of having achieved key personal and professional milestones led Stuart to reflect on AREUFIT’s future and her role in the company. AREUFIT HEALTH SERVICES Inc. COMPANY HISTORYAREUFIT was a privately held corporate wellness services firm that helped employers in the Greater Philadelphia market develop and implement employee wellness programs. It had been providing preventive health screenings wellness services and health education programming since 1992 long before “wellness” became part of employee benefits packages. The company was especially proud of its ability to deliver high-quality customized service packages designed to help clients reach their short- and long-term preventive health and wellness goals. AREUFIT had won and retained contracts with a diverse portfolio of high-profile clients in the Philadelphia market. AREUFIT was a product of the volatile health services industry. Established as a sole proprietorship in 1992 and incorporated in 1996 AREUFIT started by accident. Having pursued a graduate degree in exercise physiology Stuart supported herself by managing an outpatient exercise program for a Philadelphia hospital. Unsure of the potential insurance impact from sweeping health care reforms proposed by Bill Clinton the US president at the time Stuart’s employer reacted with deep budget cuts and the corporate wellness program was abruptly eliminated. However companies had begun to value wellness services as meaningful employee benefits so Stuart began accepting contracts from her former clients. As she recounted “one gig led to another” and offered her a way to finance and complete her doctoral degree.Risk-taking and financial bootstrapping characterized AREUFIT’s start-up. Initial capitalization from friends and family including a $2500 loan from an uncle enabled AREUFIT to make its first significant equipment purchase. While Stuart was taking part at an event a health insurance executive saw how poorly the company’s mobile health van was being managed and offered Stuart a contract to take over the van in 90 days. Stuart accepted and told her small crew “we’re going to fake it until we make it.” As the wellness industry became more mainstream AREUFIT expanded its product line augmented its preventive health screenings with health education components and facilitated connections to technology partners.The 2008 financial crisis forced AREUFIT to get “lean and mean” to survive the decline in clients. Stuart reflected on this time and said “I would never have made these changes if the financial crisis hadn’t forced us to work differently and the fact is we’ve never gone back to the old ways.” Under this lean model AREUFIT employed six full-time lead staff and up to 40 part-time and contract workers brought on to address the seasonal fluctuations of the business (see Exhibit 2).AREUFIT’s LEADERSHIP: CEO Jeannine Stuart Stuart completed her undergraduate degree at Ursinus College and earned a master’s and doctoral degree in exercise physiology from Temple University. Lifelong interest in sports wellness and community engagement was evident in Stuart’s professional and personal life. A former marathon runner and avid supporter of Philadelphia pro football and baseball teams Stuart also formed partnerships with a wide variety of non-profit organizations that promoted health and wellness. She taught kinesiology for many years at West Chester University as an adjunct professor and had been active with community volunteers in Medicine.Stuart built a business that reflected her passions and her personality. She moved AREUFIT’s offices from an office complex in Malvern Chester County to a farmhouse in West Chester Pennsylvania restored to be a comfortable casual family-culture workplace. She built a culture of autonomy and incentives indicative of the role her lead staff and employees played as key company assets. In 2012 and again in 2016 AREUFIT won recognition from the American Psychological Association (APA) as a Pennsylvania Psychologically Healthy Workplace. APA recognized AREUFIT as a national Honoree in 2018. In addition Stuart was awarded the 2007 Small Business Development Center of PA Entrepreneurial Achievement Award. CORPORATE WELLNESS SERVICES INDUSTRY BACKGROUND The corporate wellness services industry was an outgrowth of changes in insurance economic demographic and socio-cultural trends. As a relatively new industry it experienced significant growth from 2013 to 2018 as many businesses purchased wellness programs to try to contain rising health care costs. To cite one factor in response to the obesity epidemic many businesses implemented biometric screening services. According to a 2017 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) 25 per cent of companies surveyed reported that they had increased their wellness program benefits in the previous year with this trend expected to continue through 2023.A wide variety of products and services that fell under the general category of corporate wellness included programs such as smoking cessation bundled measurements such as health risk assessments or education classes on nutrition exercise and stress management.RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE THE NEW NORMALAs the cost of health care continued to rise employers continued to view the preventive potential of corporate wellness programs as a possible solution to reducing company health care costs.According to the Center for Disease Control’s National Health Interview Survey “. . . the prevalence of obesity among US adults aged 20 and over increased from 19.4 per cent in 1997 to 31.4 per cent in January–September 2017.” With the rise in obesity the number of associated health consequences also increased. One way to facilitate health promotion was through employee health management programs (EHMPs) defined as “. . . ongoing organizational activities designed to promote the adoption of personal behaviours conducive to maintaining and/or improving employee health.” Specifically the growth of EMHPs resulted from various factors including increased health care costs enhanced performance among employees increased competition globally and domestically and modified technological processes toward more automation. Since the 1980s EHMPs (also known as workplace wellness programs) offered fitness health promotion and wellness campaigns.  The Society of Human Resource Management had recently conducted its annual survey of employee benefits among US employers. Of the companies surveyed “. . . three-quarters (75 per cent) of employers offer wellness resources and information and/or a general wellness program.” According to the survey only 62 per cent of these employers provided general wellness programs specific to their employees. The efficacy of industry services largely depended on employee participation rates. Particularly related to AREUFIT’s mission only 41 per cent of the surveyed companies offered annual health risk assessments and 30 per cent provided on-site health screening programs. Although this information was not region-specific this data showed that there was a growth opportunity to partner with organizations that provided risk assessments and on-site health screenings along with other preventive and educational programs.Profit was expected to rise as businesses expanded the scope of their corporate wellness programs and offered more services convenience and possibly even access to data of their employees. Advances in technology coupled with personal wearable fitness devices such as the Apple watch and Fitbit were emerging as possible disruptors. One method of counteracting their influence was the creation and implementation by wellness services providers of workplace healthy lifestyle programs that offered comprehensive educational organizational and environmental activities for employees and their families. TECHNOLOGY CHANGING DATA COLLECTION AND ACCESS Technology used to measure an individual’s wellness information independent of situations where they were patients or undergoing prescribed treatments was categorized as person-generated health data (PGHD). A 2017 survey of 2000 employers revealed that among their employees 35.0 per cent currently used wearables and 48.6 per cent were considering purchasing wearable devices for wellness within the next year. The survey also found that 60 per cent of users prioritized the usability of the mobile application as a deciding factor. Major criteria that promoted favourable adoption of wearables included connectivity with wellness vendors long battery life and an employer-facing dashboard with a view of usage and performance. However the survey concluded that PGHD at the time lacked “. . . a clear theoretical basis a set of data models and empirically derived strategies for integrating tools and data into existing clinical applications.” FROM NICHE TO NATIONAL: COMPETITORS SEEK EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIESAn IBISWorld industry report indicated a low to moderate level of market share concentration in the corporate wellness services industry. In 2018 the top four companies were expected to account for less than 25 per cent of industry revenue. Reflecting the diversity of products services and types of providers the industry was highly fragmented.  Commonly many corporate wellness companies targeted market niches such as non-profit or public-sector organizations. Beacon Health Options Inc. for example focused its effort on providing behavioural health and wellness services to active duty members retirees and their families through the United States Department of Defense’s TRICARE program.Among the national market most companies were comprehensive wellness providers who partnered with other organizations. Their services included health risk assessments health fairs health education programs and other wellness programs. Major industry players were national companies such as Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. and Mobile Health Management Services in the private sector. Similar to AREUFIT Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. provided consultative services to companies to develop their own wellness programs for their employees. Mobile Health Management Services Inc. was a nationwide provider of occupational health particularly for initial health employee screenings and drug test administration. Government funded agencies such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. and Pennsylvania’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) offered limited wellness services. Medical organizations such as CVS Pharmacy and Acme Markets Pharmacy were also active in the wellness industry. Various insurers also had a significant impact on the prospects for the wellness industry.AREUFIT’S FORMULA FOR REGIONAL DOMINANCEAREUFIT had a significant presence in Philadelphia and the surrounding five-county region as well as in the adjacent states of New Jersey and Delaware. As the fifth-largest US city Philadelphia offered an attractive expansion target for national companies looking to grow. As a small firm AREUFIT had been able to accommodate employers of all sizes. AREUFIT’s client list included Philadelphia-based organizations from small companies with 25 or fewer employees to large companies with 17000 employees. Another distinctive feature was AREUFIT’S practice of sending cross-trained and professionally certified employees not subcontractors to their client workplaces. Through investing in cross-training AREUFIT created a flexible staff that was able to fill needs in a variety of environments from a mobile vision screening lab to biometric screenings. AREUFIT pioneered mobile health screening vehicles in the Philadelphia marketplace. Since 1996 AREUFIT helped its clients identify vehicles for purchase vetted and oversaw vendors for the retrofitting process managed the maintenance of the vehicles and provided professional staff and management of vehicle operations. AREUFIT provided evidence-based health education tailored to meet specific client needs. The company offered face-to-face biometric reviews and health coaching health education displays and awareness campaigns and workplace seminars developed and delivered by a team of health educators. A sampling of educational services AREUFIT provided demonstrated the company’s wide range of audiences expertise and revenue sources. For example one service was teaching fifth graders about the dangers of smoking funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Chester County Health Department. Another service was providing cancer education to Chester County businesses funded by a Pennsylvania cancer education grant. Yet another service was providing vision care education to registered nurses and children in the Philadelphia school district.To augment its core competencies of preventive health screenings and education and provide the wellness “platform” employers increasingly required AREUFIT formed alliances with national data groups such as StayWell Health Management Active Health Management and WellWorks for You. AREUFIT provided essential data collection on cholesterol body mass index glucose and other areas and worked with its partners to analyze the data and create an information portal. If clients opted for additional tracking AREUFIT monitored their participation in preventive health actions such as mammograms health examinations and vision check-ups. Stuart believed that AREUFIT had a lock on the Philadelphia regional market. The CEO summed up the company’s strengths as follows: Preventive health screenings and education and the full-cycle management of the mobile health screening vehicles. What makes AREUFIT so good at what we do is we’re responsive we’re local. I think this space is very different from other parts of the country. Businesses in Philly really like to do business with other local companies.VOLATILITY IN THE WORLD OF WELLNESSSeveral key external forces that had significant impact on the wellness services industry included changes in insurance coverage uncertainty about regulations advancing technology and a lack of industry definition.Insurance in the Age of the Affordable Care ActIn the 1980s the health insurance industry shaped how corporate wellness programs were defined. More recently consolidation in the insurance industry concentrated the power insurers held. In the regional Philadelphia market three dominant companies—Independence Blue Cross (IBC) UnitedHealth Group and Aetna Inc.—replaced as many as eight previous insurers.  As AREUFIT’s CEO Stuart reflected on her years in the industry: The insurance companies are now out of the wellness business from a client marketing perspective. They claim the Affordable Care Act [ACA] put too much pressure on their profits. In response to perceived threats of the ACA they eliminated the service of helping their clients establish wellness programs. IBC as an example used to provide an account executive to help their subscribing companies identify a wellness services provider. When Independence Blue Cross cut the mobile van services and eliminated the wellness department as a cost-saving measure in 2016 their corporate clients were given a stipend to contract with wellness services providers on their own.This shift in decision-making and cost allocation disrupted the market for wellness providers. Human resources executives had another responsibility added to their already burdened departments. Competing wellness service providers had to strategically focus their services and their key differentiators to win contracts from individual companies. In addition it became more critical to attach a return on investment (ROI) figure to wellness programs. Self-insured companies with 1000 or more employees could often see a correlation between wellness dollars spent pharmacy claims improved employee productivity and lower absenteeism because they knew where their health care dollars were being spent. For small and mid-size employers even when C-suite executives may have felt that a wellness program was the right thing to do without a clear ROI figure it became increasingly difficult to justify the fee-for-services model of contracting with a wellness provider.Regulations and Tax RevisionsVarious government agencies—such as the United States Department of Labor US Department of Health & Human Services and US Department of the Treasury—provided guidance on the development and administration of wellness programs. Companies also had to comply with provisions from the ACA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 particularly those related to non-discrimination and privacy. The Internal Revenue Service issued a “Chief Counsel Memorandum clarifying that case rewards under a wellness program are always taxable as income and cash fringe benefits . . . are never excludable from income.” As Stuart summarized “There are so many regulations that you would have to just dedicate a team to making sure that you are always in the forefront” of regulatory requirements.Technology and DataBeyond the use of wearable technology web-based tracking and data collection were important factors within the wellness industry particularly since corporate partners sought an ROI for offering the programs to employees. Online platforms were difficult and costly to develop. As a result each company maintained proprietary control of the infrastructure. Even health insurance has gone more and more digital enabling subscribers to log on to their account to input an individual wellness survey.Lack of Industry DefinitionAlthough there were various forms of certification and professional training available and some regulation was in place Stuart expressed her frustration that “. . . anyone can call themselves a wellness provider” and provided the example of “. . . an individual who lost 30 pounds and wants to take you on their wellness journey.”  Stuart spent a great deal of time educating prospective clients about the genuine qualifications of her employees. Especially after cost surfaced as a key factor it was time consuming and difficult to convey the value underlying the higher price that a professional organization like AREUFIT charged. Another significant contributor to the difficulty of measuring ROI for employers was the lack of consistency in data collection measurement and analysis.THE DECISIONStuart had to make a decision: grow or exit. Ultimately her decision was shaped by her combined professional and personal tenets:I’m a firm believer in staying true to your core competencies because if you stray from them I believe that you lose your product. I have been working for the past 26 years to position my business. I've met some of my own personal goals and I feel like I kind of want to move on to the next thing though I’m not sure what it is. The climate today is what I based a succession plan on but the market is not now what it once was and I have no idea what it will be five years from now.EXHIBIT 1: FINANCIAL OVERVIEWNote: COGS= Cost of goods sold; All numbers are on a cash basis; *Expenses include: advertising automobile expense professional consulting dues/subscriptions educational expenses insurance (health WC auto GL) payroll expenses employee benefits printing postage subcontract office overhead travel/tolls entertainment wages and utilities.Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: ORGANIZATIONAL CHART FOR AREUFITThe professional AREUFIT staff consists of health educators exercise physiologists registered nurses certified paraoptometric technicians massage therapists health coaches medical technicians interns CPR/First Aid instructors and support staff.Six employees are salaried employees.

Suveer the 29-year-old chief executive officer of Sushma Industries Private Limited (SIPL) warmly welcomed 48-year-old G. Padmanabhan the head of human resources (HR) at SIPL. Suveer said to Padmanabhan:A lot of people questioned my wisdom and judgment in hiring you a year back but I knew that you would be able to pay back your cost multi-fold which you certainly have done. I needed strategic talent interventions to transform this two-and-a-half decades old organization shake it out of its somnolence and set it on the growth path that I had envisioned. I didn’t know if we had the right people in place for the right jobs and if we were paying them appropriately to motivate and retain them. We needed to revisit these things and build a culture of performance here. I know it has been an uphill task for you to change the way things have been done here for the last two decades but if we didn’t start the change a year back we would have perished!Padmanabhan had worked for multiple engineering and services organizations through the various domains of HR and had over 25 years of experience. Accustomed to professional systems and processes Padmanabhan had been challenged by the complete lack of structure within SIPL when he had joined the company in June 2015 but he had also been excited by the possibility of designing and implementing systems that could take the organization to the next level of growth. The problem appeared as complex as the Gordian knot and he had not been sure where to start unravelling the informal structures and processes that had become the norm for SIPL.ORGANIZATION AND INDUSTRY CONTEXT SIPL was started by Sadananda Murthy in 1986. After graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1971 Murthy worked for a few years with the National Aerospace Laboratory a government organization that supported the Indian aerospace industry. As he acquired experience Murthy realized a gap existed in Indian manufacturing for precision instruments that supported the work of quality functions within organizations. With quality systems and processes slowly creeping into the manufacturing ecosystem in the 1970s most companies at that time relied on expensive imported machines to support their fledgling quality practices. There was limited training offered and negligible post-sales support once the imported machines were installed. The reliability of these machines was contingent on regular calibration which was difficult to arrange and extremely costly. Murthy saw this undeveloped space as an opportunity to provide economical machines of high quality augmented by strong post-sales training and regular calibration services. Supported by his wife a science graduate who took on the responsibilities of administration and accounts Murthy started SIPL with three employees in a small shed in Peenya an industrial belt on the outskirts of Bangalore. The initial client base of three clients slowly expanded to cover manufacturing organizations across the breadth of India. Client acquisition happened more by word of mouth with considerable value being seen in the customized offering and in the strong calibration and after-sales services provided. With calibration services increasingly contributing to SIPL’s revenue stream Murthy decided to open a dedicated calibration centre in 1995 as a separate profit centre. The calibration centre was established as a world-class lab that met stringent national and international standards and provided services in the area of testing and measurements both for SIPL and other companies’ products. The calibration centre contributed nearly 35 per cent of the total revenues for SIPL.SIPL had started as a technology company and focused its product portfolio on the field of torque force and pressure sensors. The products it manufactured found application in all industries requiring testing measurement and calibration services which encompassed engineering automobile pharmaceutical and process manufacturing organizations as well as government and defence institutions. SIPL offered complete design development and manufacturing of standard products. Much of the business was generated by SIPL’s ability to create customized products tailor-made to a specific client’s needs. This customized work required a strong research and development (R&D) team that excelled in delivering customized solutions for force torque and pressure sensors; gauges and display units; spring testers crimp testers and torque tool testers; motor testing systems automotive component and performance testing systems and more. SIPL also offered standardized product ranges that included torque tool testers with its main competitors being Norbar Torque Tools Ltd. and Crane Electronics Ltd. from the United Kingdom and Tohnichi Mfg. Co. Ltd. from Japan. By 2010 SIPL’s market share in this product category was 30 per cent. For sensors and display units another standardized product SIPL held a market share of 5 per cent competing against Honeywell International Inc. (in the United States and India); Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik (HBM) GmbH of Germany; FUTEK Advanced Sensor Technology Inc. of the United States; and Syscon Instruments Pvt. Ltd. from India. For a newer standardized product offering of force testing systems SIPL held a market share of less than 1 per cent and competed against Instron Corporation MTS Systems Corporation and Zwick Roell Group all U.S.-based firms (see Exhibit 1).By 2000 with nearly 80 per cent of SIPL’s revenues coming from customized solutions the company had a strong need for a robust R&D team. The customized solutions also resulted in relatively longer product development and go-to-market times and comparatively less net profitability (see Exhibit 2). In 2014 the organization transitioned from being a proprietorship firm to a private limited company.SIPL’s INITIAL DECADES OF GROWTH: TALENT ACQUISITION COMPENSATION AND MERIT INCREASESIn the early days of SIPL’s growth during the late 1980s and through the 1990s talent was normally acquired through known references; the employees were hired based primarily on a contingency basis. Compensation decisions for new hires were done on an as needed basis by Murthy. Most of the talent recruited by SIPL were needy people without any work experience or with experience in non-relevant domains. Murthy made the hiring decision predominantly relying on intuition informed by the emotional connection the candidate established with Murthy and a combination of a candidate’s perceived attitude to life aspirational levels and expressed socio-economic needs. Until 2012 SIPL had done no competency-based role-based or needs-based recruitment.In 1986 Shiv a fresh diploma graduate from the Industrial Training Institute approached Murthy through a relative. The company did not have any active requirement for staff; however Murthy created a new position justifying his decision by saying “An extra pair of hands is always useful. He is a humble and needy person and comes across as a quick learner. We need people like him.”Shiv stayed in the same premises as Murthy and his family and worked late hours and all weekends. He gathered experience across all roles within the factory and in 2016 had risen to the level of production head of the factory. Speaking about his experience with Murthy Shiv said “I was in a shipwrecked situation and Murthy Sir threw me the lifeline. I owe him everything. Murthy Sir is the only god that I know; I would give my life for him.”Over the years Murthy rewarded Shiv’s loyalty through significant financial support for Shiv’s marriage by purchasing him a plot and by helping him build a house. Personal loans were offered at no interest to help Shiv achieve his financial milestones. Other employees had similar experiences and they remained staunchly loyal to Murthy. Attrition was negligible at SIPL during these years. A few of these employees developed the R&D skills required to support the frequent demand for customized products that SIPL supported until 2010.In a few instances people were hired at a salary lower than they had earned at their previous employment. The value proposition for these hires was the envisaged growth and learning opportunities available at SIPL which Murthy passionately believed in and promised to all prospective hires. In contrast to other emerging organizations in this space SIPL allowed its technicians to work the product cycle from end to end thereby increasing their exposure and learning opportunities. While SIPL recorded a growth in revenue from ₹0.11 million in 1986 to ₹67.2 million in 2016 (see Exhibit 2) annual merit increases were disbursed in a discretionary manner and not evenly for the entire organization. While a few employees were given increments ranging from 2 to 10 per cent some remained exempt from the process. A few of the exempted employees may have taken soft loans for asset building or for personal expenditures such as marriage; and they understood that they would receive no increment. A few were deprived of any increment due to perceived poor performance; because SIPL had no culture of dismissing non-performers the absence of a merit increase was quietly accepted. SIPL had no structured performance management system. Instead goals were tacitly understood and periodically changed due to business exigencies; Murthy subjectively evaluated employees’ performance against goals. Occasionally some employees expressed dissatisfaction with the compensation to Murthy who would arbitrarily revise the compensation. This correction could happen any time during the year usually only for a select few employees and without a formal process of revision. A few newcomers to the organization who had prior experience with structured performance management systems were silenced by the ethos of the organization and the odd few who could not adjust left within a year of joining.CHANGE OF GUARDIn 2010 Murthy transferred management of the business to his 23-year-old son Suveer an electronics and communication engineering graduate. Suveer was a relatively familiar figure at SIPL having spent summer holidays and free time within different departments where his presence was indulgently tolerated. An overlap period until 2012 allowed Suveer to learn the business engage with the employees and begin to assume Murthy’s position. Handing over the charge the boundaries of change were defined by Murthy:Don’t change the people philosophy and the people-centric approach which are the core of SIPL’s values. I would not like to see old-timers let go; there should not be any employee unrest and people should be kept happy. I would be happy to implement any other changes you may deem necessary so long as you don’t change this DNA.Suveer was a second-generation entrepreneur who had vision passion ambition and aspiration combined with a commitment to growth. He wanted to grow SIPL from a revenue of ₹36 million in 2012–2013 to ₹500 million by 2020 and firmly believed that putting in formal systems and processes was required to achieve this growth vision. He defined the revenue milestones that SIPL needed to achieve as ₹200 million by 2017 ₹350 million by 2018 and ₹500 million by 2020. The business strategy to support and enable this growth was to leverage the top 20 products of the 200-odd product portfolio expand into new industry sectors such as food and gain a stronger position in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Apart from these plans Suveer also wanted to establish a presence in international markets. Core business capabilities required to catalyze this vision were talent with strong sensor and machine designing skills enhanced overall domain knowledge among the workforce and a solution orientation for the sales teams to facilitate increased customer satisfaction. However Suveer faced multiple challenges on all fronts. In June 2015 to put the people processes in place Suveer took the unprecedented step of hiring a professional HR manager G. Padmanabhan. Padmanabhan was a respected professional and a veteran in the field with 25 years of experience. It was a relatively steep cost to put the company in order.Padmanabhan started by looking at the organization’s structure and reporting hierarchy. He found many overlapping responsibilities within the team with work allotment based on employees’ perceived capacities. When he assessed the capability of the existing workforce Padmanabhan found a clear gap in competencies and technical skills. For instance the sales teams were comfortable growing and maintaining existing client accounts but they neglected or did not understand business development as a specialized focus area. To help SIPL achieve its growth targets searching for new business was critical and Padmanabhan felt this strategy required the right talent and focus. Since replacing the employees was not an option the workforce would need to be augmented and clear non-conflicting responsibilities would need to be defined. Padmanabhan proposed a new organizational structure. The major changes included consolidating manufacturing operations under one head who would be responsible for cost inventory management and on-time deliveries. Purchasing would be consolidated under the finance function to ensure stronger controls on vendor selection and management. Sales teams were segregated into the “hunters” to bring in new business and “farmers” who retained and serviced existing customers. The key responsibility areas were sharply defined for each function and cascaded down the teams.COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS RESTRUCTURINGPadmanabhan knew that SIPL needed to adopt a structured approach to compensation and benefits (see Exhibit 3). He recognized that those organizations that had well-crafted compensation structures and reward philosophies were able to enhance trust loyalty and sense of fairness among their employees. To develop the total rewards philosophy for SIPL Padmanabhan looked at SIPL’s strategic positioning to propose a reward strategy that aligned with the industry dynamics which he combined with the organization’s focus. Padmanabhan defined and evaluated the jobs within SIPL which he believed was the first step toward establishing and evaluating internal equity in the organization. He felt that defining and evaluating the jobs would provide the required clarity both to the job holder and the organization and allow for the correct compensation decisions to be made. The erstwhile overlap of responsibilities resulted in 35 differentiated job roles for the small workforce of 54 employees. Over a couple of months for the key roles in the organization Padmanabhan developed job descriptions that encompassed the job purpose and its desired deliverables. The job descriptions also outlined the competencies and abilities required of the job holder to successfully deliver on the role (see Exhibit 4). In October 2015 to better define the pay elements and priorities to be given Padmanabhan conducted an employee survey to evaluate how the workforce felt about the existing compensation system (see Exhibit 5). The survey feedback indicated that employees felt the compensation and benefits were significantly below the market standards. Informal feedback also disclosed a perceived lack of parity among similar functioning roles. In 2012 the salary structure was on an ad hoc or as-needed basis (see Exhibit 6) and certain statutory compliances such as paying minimum wages not observed. Additionally components such as the production incentive had in fact become a guaranteed wage. While SIPL paid an annual bonus of one month’s salary around the festival period of Diwali (the festival in India that was culturally associated with financial windfall) variable compensation both for the production and sales staff was done on an ad hoc or as-needed basis.Reviewing the insurance benefit offered to SIPL employees Padmanabhan discovered that group medical insurance and term life insurance for the employees had not been renewed since 2012. The lapse appeared to have been inadvertent due to the absence of a dedicated HR person accountable for the benefits administration. Additionally a lack of claims from the employees did not alert the senior management to the problem. Padmanabhan reintroduced the insurance coverage but had to pay a penalty to the insurance provider to take advantage of the no-claims benefit. A similar concern emerged when SIPL was unable to make a gratuity payment to a tenured employee who left the company in October 2015. SIPL had entered into an agreement with a leading national insurance organization wherein the company made annual gratuity payments to the insurance company which in turn paid out the gratuity to eligible employees as required by the government statute. However SIPL had not made the gratuity payments to the insurance provider for 2014 and 2015. To renew the benefit the company would first need to pay both the pending gratuity amount and the accumulated interest. Padmanabhan realized that failing to adhere to the basic regulatory requirements was a compliance risk and would limit SIPL’s ability to attract new talent. It would also dilute the credibility of the organization with both internal and external stakeholders.Compensation disparity between old and new employees remained a point of contention. This difference was highlighted when some of the long-time SIPL staff interviewed some newcomers. The established managers were shocked to see the compensation that the professionally qualified newcomers were expecting—and attaining. Manjula a veteran of 21 years was deeply affronted by the changes she saw in the recent recruitments. She exclaimed “I am getting ₹28000 a month as the manager of the department and now have just made an offer to my new team member an executive hired at ₹22000 per month. I am double his age and this is the price of my loyalty?” Padmanabhan realized that he needed to quickly put in place a revised compensation structure with a supporting performance management system.DEVELOPING THE ROADMAP FOR CHANGE IN COMPENSATIONBy March 2016 Padmanabhan had designed the compensation revision process (see Exhibit 6). However multiple implementation challenges threatened to derail implementation of the revisions. While he had created the job evaluation and grading structure for SIPL he still needed to complete the external market benchmarking (see the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for students).The practice of equating compensation for the organization’s jobs to that paid by representative external comparator organizations was commonly adopted to review the competitiveness of rewards. This comparison helped to establish the market rate for comparable jobs or skill sets and served as critical input for the total rewards strategy. The normal practice involved obtaining salary analyses an industry study market pricing and job matching reports. These data reports were obtained from national and global compensation survey market leaders that invested in building the research and data with reliability and consistency. However these reports were expensive and Suveer was not convinced that this investment was merited at the current stage and for the present scale of operations. But without accurate benchmarking Padmanabhan ran the risks of having inaccurate market competitiveness data. He wondered how he could obtain accurate data at an economical cost without diluting the reliability of the data. As an economical step to evaluate the competitiveness of each job family Padmanabhan looked at sample sets of nearly 50 data points obtained from top job portals and reference points provided by his contacts in the HR fraternity to develop an estimate of the market positioning. Seeing SIPL’s disparity with the market rate Padmanabhan realized that a one-time correction would significantly strain the salary budget. An informal discussion with Suveer identified which key talent to retain. Padmanabhan proposed a three-year plan to revise compensations across the board with the first year’s corrections applicable only to the key talent.An estimate indicated that the proposed revisions in compensation were likely to increase the organization’s cost base by about 80 per cent. The proposed restructured compensation affected different employees in different ways. A few would see an increase in their statutory payments requiring that their salaries be increased to buffer their statutory deductions and protect their net pay. Re-aligning the variable compensation and linking it instead to the newly developed performance management system meant managing a huge change and educating the entire workforce which was accustomed to seeing variable compensation as a deferred but guaranteed pay.Padmanabhan had some sense of the resistance that would be forthcoming. Some small changes he had made in the HR policies and processes were creating a high level of discomfort. Padmanabhan had started formally documenting HR policies but he faced considerable resistance from the workforce even for the small changes to more basic policies such as leave attendance and reporting systems. Paradoxically while employee feedback indicated the absence of discipline was a concern the established employees objected to the introduction of formal working hours and the discipline of clocking attendance:In earlier days Murthy would come in with us by 8:30 a.m. and work with us till lights out. I used to come in early go home for lunch and worked till whatever hours were needed to get the job done. Now I am being asked to swipe my attendance and log my hours. So operation successful but patient dead!Padmanabhan introduced an attendance management program (Time Office Function) to limit people wandering around the building and outside of work premises unexplained during working hours and to increase accountability and availability for productive outcomes during working hours. Padmanabhan explained the concerns:There was no accountability of who was in the factory or office premises and where and why they were going. The informal environment allowed a lot of easy mingling but this was counterproductive to efficient working resulting in unnecessarily long hours. As I saw the need to adhere to Factory Act requirements I did not want to increase wage costs due to overtime charges which were actually not merited. I wanted the workforce to be efficient and productive during the regular hours go home at the stipulated time and maintain a healthy work–life balance.Making the changes to compensation would be a huge challenge. Padmanabhan needed to develop a talent strategy and establish a compensation structure that aligned with the financial viability and strategic direction of the organization and that appeased employee preferences. He might also need additional people processes to complement the salary restructuring for a more effective implementation and there was the additional challenge of communicating and gaining acceptance for the proposed changes. Was the organization even ready for this kind of change and when would be the correct time to make the changes? How would Padmanabhan unravel this knot and where should he start?EXHIBIT 1: Sushma Industries Private Limited’s PRODUCT MIX AND REVENUE SALIENCE 2015Source: Sushma Industries Private Limited.EXHIBIT 2: Sushma Industries Private Limited’s FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE selected years 1985–2016 Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹67.45 on July 1 2016; All financial years end March 31.Source: Sushma Industries Private Limited.EXHIBIT 3: DEVELOPING Sushma industries private limited’s COMPENSATION STRUCTURENote: SIPL = Sushma Industries Private Limited; Shaded boxes indicate steps completed by Padmanabhan.

SRF was a ₹38 billion multi-business entity. Having completed its third round of share buybacks at ₹380 per share SRF paid an interim and consistent dividend of ₹7 per share. The company had engaged in a series of share buybacks since 2006.In light of India’s falling economic growth and pessimistic global economic outlook Padma needed to analyze whether the company would be able to maintain its growth. Should the company go ahead with another round of share buybacks and increasing dividends? In order to conduct her analysis Padma gathered the company’s financial statements (see Exhibits 1A 1B and 1C) and relevant data on various important ratios (see Exhibit 2) on dividend and earnings per share (EPS) (see Exhibit 3) and on stock prices (see Exhibit 4). She also needed to know what the analysts’ opinions were about SRF but could find very few analyst reports. Based on these inputs and analyses she had to give her recommendation to her CFO.Company BackgroundIncorporated as Shri Ram Fibres in 1970 the company changed its name to SRF Limited in 1990 when it became a multi-business entity engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical-based industrial intermediates in India and internationally. SRF operated in three broad business segments (see Exhibit 5). The technical textile business (TTB) comprised 52 per cent of fiscal year (FY) 2012’s sale of products the chemicals and polymers business (CPB) comprised 29 per cent of FY 2012’s sale of products and the packaging films business (PFB) comprised 19 per cent of FY 2012’s sale of products. Through these segments SRF catered to various industries including automotive infrastructure consumer durables pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. SRF exported its products to nearly 60 countries across the globe. SRF was a global entity with operations in four countries: India Dubai South Africa and Thailand. The company had eight manufacturing facilities in India and one each in Dubai South Africa and Thailand. The South Africa and Thailand facilities had been acquired the most recently and were fully integrated into the company’s overall business.SRF was a market leader in India in technical textiles refrigerants engineering plastics and industrial yarns. The company was controlled by Arun Bharat Ram Group which consisted of various individuals and corporate bodies with promoters holding 49.95 per cent of equity in the company.Industry ProfileTechnical Textile BusinessThe TTB segment was mainly diversified into tire cord fabrics belting fabrics coated fabrics and industrial yarn. It accounted for the largest share of business for the company with a contribution to the sales of the firm in FY 2012 down from 48 per cent in FY 2011. In actual terms however sales of the TTB segment had increased during 2011–12 to over ₹16.7 billion from ₹14.5 billion in FY 2011–10 (see Exhibit 6).Revenue for the TTB segment was mainly driven by the sale of tires to the auto industry for trucks buses multi-utility vehicles and two-wheelers.Nylon Tire Cord Fabric and Polyester Tire Cord FabricNylon tire cord fabric and polyester tire cord fabric were SRF’s main products. These two products were used as a reinforcement material in the bias tires for all major categories from two-wheelers to light and heavy commercial vehicles. As the market leader in Asia SRF was the second-largest tire manufacturer of Nylon 6 tire cord and the fifth-largest tire cord producer in the world. SRF began its operational journey in 1974 with 2500 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and currently stood at 70000 MTPA after continuous periodical expansions and acquisitions. SRF was the only company with a fully integrated polyester tire cord plant with a capacity of 6000 MTPA and had become the only company in India to produce polyester tire cord fabric. Having set up India’s only polyester industrial yarn plant in 2009–10 SRF had been the country’s market leader in nylon tire cord fabric for decades. Demand for nylon tire cord fabric and polyester tire cord fabric depended on the growth of the auto industry and the demand for replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).According to industry estimates tire production was expected to grow by 9.3 per cent in 2012–13 and 13.4 per cent in 2013–14. The OEM demand for tires which consisted of 45 per cent of total tire sales was expected to increase by 10 to 14 per cent each year during 2012–14. However this demand depended on the growth in automobile production. Replacement parts demand was expected to rise by 7 to 11 per cent each year during 2012–14 due to the increase in vehicle sales in recent years. The demand for replacement tires was considered healthy. In March 2011 nearly 80 million automobiles had been sold in the previous six years. Exports were also expected to rise by 19.4 per cent during 2012–14.However raw material costs had been rising steadily especially the cost of natural rubber. In response tire manufacturers had raised their prices during 2011–12.Belting FabricBelting Fabric was used as reinforcement material for conveyor belts. SRF was the second-largest manufacturer of conveyer belting fabric in the world. It was also the market leader in several countries with a market share of 60 per cent in belting fabrics and had a presence in Europe Asia the United States and Latin America. The overseas market accounted for 55 per cent of SRF’s belting fabric business.This segment’s growth potential depended on growth in the domestic mining and infrastructure industry. However this business segment was adversely affected in the second half of 2011–12 due to the fall in mining activity in the country and a freeze on key infrastructure and power projects. During the previous five years SRF had increased its belting fabric business at a compound annual growth rate of about 11 per cent.Coated and Laminated Fabrics Coated and laminated fabrics had a wide range of applications including protective covers dynamic tarpaulins static covers auto canopies and awnings.As India experienced changing lifestyles urbanization and massive investments in infrastructure products such as signage awnings and hangar covers were expected to see double-digit growth. Increased use of tensile structures with fabrics as evidenced in stadiums homes and exhibition centres was also expected to mean double-digit growth for SRF’s high-end product sales.The company’s new state-of-the-art project was expected to produce 1.7 million square metres per year of coated fabric through a new coating line at its existing plant location in Gummidipoondi in Tamil Nadu state. With a total investment of approximately ₹1.43 billion work was progressing on schedule. Commercial production at the new plant had started in the second quarter of 2011–12. The new facility would offer a wide assortment of products including hangar covers auto canopies awnings lacquered tarpaulins and fabrics for tensile structures. Polyurethane-coated fabrics for various applications were also expected to be introduced.Industrial Yarn (Nylon and Polyester)Industrial yarn was used for conveyor belts transmission belts hoses ropes geo-textile applications fishing nets and stitching threads. SRF continued to enjoy a substantial market share in this segment.Chemicals and Polymers BusinessThe CPB segment included chloromethane pharmaceuticals certified emission reductions (CER) and allied products refrigerant gases and engineering plastics.During 2011–12 SRF posted record performance in this segment (including CER income) with sales growth of 61 per cent and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) growth of 106 per cent. The fluoro-specialties business had continued to grow at a brisk pace with sales growth of 48 per cent and earnings before interest depreciation and taxes growth of 99 per cent in this same period.Chemicals—Refrigerant/Chloromethane/Fluoro-SpecialtiesRefrigerant/chloromethane/fluoro-specialties were primarily used as a cooling medium (refrigerants) in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. The market for refrigerants was estimated to grow at about 20–25 per cent per year. SRF was the market leader in this area with about a 40 per cent share of the Indian domestic market. Exports accounted for 60 per cent of the volumes produced and were spread across 45 countries worldwide. In response to market concerns the company had focused on producing and delivering new-generation hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blends and HFCs in place of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons. During 2012–13 the company planned to increase the production capacity of HFC-134a an ozone-friendly refrigerant and set up new production facilities for multi-purpose chemicals at Dahej in Gujarat state. New projects were planned every year for the fluoro-specialties business.Polymers—Engineering PlasticsEngineering plastics were used widely in the automotive and electrical industries. Performance in this area was mainly driven by those industries which consisted of the user segments of engineering plastics.Packaging FilmsDuring 2011–12 the packaging films industry saw a drop in the domestic market of around 30 per cent. The drop in business was partly due to a ban on plastic laminates that were used in the packaging of gutka an extremely harmful mixture of tobacco and other substances that was found to cause cancer. The ban was issued by the Supreme Court of India. SRF’s packaging films segment saw a decline of 92.91 per cent in EBIT from almost ₹3.5 billion in 2010–11 to ₹245 million in 2011–12 (see Exhibit 6). SRF responded to this challenge by venturing into value-added product variants and two international projects at Thailand and South Africa to be commissioned in 2013–14.SRF competed against several companies in major business segments (see Exhibit 7).CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: GROWTH EXPANSION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTDuring 2006–2012 the company embarked on a journey of growth and expansion of its production facilities and market both in India and overseas through various organic and inorganic opportunities. In 2008–09 SRF acquired Thai Baroda Industries Limited a Thailand-based tire cord company which enabled SRF to emerge as the third-largest tire cord fabric manufacturer in Asia and fifth-largest in the world. In 2008–09 SRF acquired the belting fabrics business of Industex Technical Textiles (Pty) Limited in South Africa. The company was then renamed SRF Industex Belting (Pty) Ltd. The acquisition’s price was ₹200 million. In 2009–10 SRF set up the first and only producer plant of polyester industrial yarn in technological collaboration with Toray Industries Japan. It would serve the growing segment of polyester tire cord fabric used for radial tires for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles—a one-stop-shop for all kinds of fabric for tire manufacturers. It would also provide backward integration with the company’s belting fabric and coated fabric businesses.In 2008–09 SRF purchased two businesses—an engineering plastics business and an industrial yarn business—from the holding company SRF Polymers Limited.Two international packaging films projects were started at plants in Thailand and South Africa. The plant at South Africa was expected to have a production capacity of 25000 in biaxially oriented polypropylene film with an investment of ₹2.5 billion. The African plant would begin its production in July 2013. Both units were scheduled to be commissioned during 2013–14. In October 2010 SRF’s board approved an 80:20 joint venture with Nitol-Niloy to establish a plant in Bangladesh for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate a polyester film used for its high tensile strength. The plant had a capacity of 28500 MTPA with an estimated cost of ₹3.2 billion. The project was commissioned in 2012.By the fourth quarter of 2011–12 production began at the multi-purpose chemical complex in Dahej Gujarat state for flourine-based specialty chemicals and hydrofluorocarbons to be used as intermediates in the manufacture of drugs and pesticides for customers in Japan Europe and the United States. During 2012–13 this plant was expected to increase its production capacity of HFC-134a. SRF would have invested over ₹2 billion by that time. The commissioning of a state-of-the-art coating line plant was expected at an existing site in Gummidipoondi with a total investment of approximately ₹1.4 billion. The plant had the capacity to produce 17 million square metres per year of coated fabric starting in the second quarter of FY 2011–12.SRF had also actively invested in research and development centres at Chennai and Bhiwadi for chemicals and at Manali for TTB (see Exhibit 8). The company planned to spend another ₹1.4 billion for acquisition new projects research and development facilities and upgrading existing facilities.Carbon Emission ReductionsSRF’s income also included receipts from the transfer of CER also referred to as carbon credits which were added to capital reserves (see Exhibits 9 and 10).The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change an international environmental treaty for stabilizing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere to prevent the deterioration of the earth’s ozone layer provided SRF with approval in principle for 3833566 CERs per year. However income from CERs would be generated only until June 2014 and the amount would depend on CER value which had seen a fall in price.Dividend History—Buyback of SharesOn June 24 2006 the SRF board of directors decided to buy back the company’s equity shares from the open market through stock exchanges. During FY 2006–07 the company purchased 16084 equity shares at an average price of ₹194.29 resulting in the disbursement of ₹3124934 to its shareholders (see Exhibit 11).On April 25 2008 the company again decided to buy back its equity shares from the open market through stock exchanges. The buyback started on July 2 2008 and ended on April 16 2009. During this period the company was able to purchase a total of 7381425 equity shares at an average market price of ₹94.83 per share. This buyback of shares cost the company nearly ₹700 million reaching the maximum allowed buyback amount of shares for that time.On July 28 2009 the SRF board of directors announced another buyback of fully paid-up equity shares for an amount not exceeding ₹650 million at a maximum price of ₹160 per share from the open market through stock exchanges. However the company was not eligible to make a second buyback offer before the completion of 365 days from the date of the preceding offer of buyback according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s Buyback of Shares Act. Consequently SRF withdrew its buyback offer.On February 26 2011 SRF announced a buyback of fully paid-up equity shares for an amount not exceeding ₹900 million at a maximum price of ₹380 per share from the open market through stock exchanges. The buyback started on April 6 2011 and remained open until February 25 2012. A total of 3083080 equity shares at an average market price of ₹291.89 per share were bought back for a total amount of approximately ₹900 million by February 10 2012. SRF’s share buyback history included several different buyback events from 2008 to 2012 (see Exhibits 12A and 12B).SRF in 2012During FY 2011–12 the company was affected by a multitude of factors and combined effects including an adverse demand–supply situation higher energy costs and higher input costs which resulted in a decline of 36 per cent in its net profit after tax of ₹870 million compared to ₹1.36 billion the previous year. SRF’s net sales also declined from ₹8.46 billion to ₹8.22 billion during the same period.Unlike the CPB segment both the TTP and PFB segments showed a decline in profitability. The company’s performance in light of the global economic crisis European economic problems the falling index of industrial production data and falling gross domestic product figures (see Exhibits 13a and 13b) raised many questions. With healthy cash balance reserves a consistent dividend payment history and many capital expenditure projects in the pipeline could SRF maintain robust growth in the coming years? What was the strategy behind the past three buybacks of shares? Would the firm engage in such an endeavour again in the future? With SRF’s zero share premium amount left in the reserves Padma also had to determine if the company could reward its shareholders by paying a higher dividend in the coming years (see Exhibits 14 and 15) and understand why there were so few reports from analysts about the company. Based on her analyses what should her recommendation be to the CFO for the next two years?Exhibit 1a: Balance Sheet (in ₹10 million)Source: Prepared by the authors with information from the Capitaline Database accessed July 8 2015 www.capitaline.com.Exhibit 1b: Income Statement (in ₹10 million)Source: Prepared by the authors with information from the Capitaline Database accessed July 8 2015 www.capitaline.com.Exhibit 1c: Cash Flow Statement (in ₹10 million)Exhibit 1c (continued)Note: P/L = profit/loss;

During the subsequent mass-murder investigation the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to recover the Apple iPhone 5c that had been issued to Farook by his employer; the phone was running iOS 9�the ninth version of Apple Inc.�s (Apple�s) mobile operating system (iOS). However Farook had secured the iPhone with a passcode and anyone who tried to guess it by entering a random code would risk having the phone auto-delete its data after 10 failed attempts.With no known method to access Farook�s iPhone the FBI and the U.S. Attorney�s Office for the Central District of California drafted a court order under the All Writs Act (AWA) to compel Apple�s technical assistance. The AWA was a legal instrument dating back to 1789 that allowed courts to compel the assistance of a third party when there was no other means to obtain the necessary assistance. Under U.S. law the FBI needed the consent of a federal judge to require Apple to comply with its AWA request. The court signed the FBI�s order on February 16 2016 and Apple immediately contested the order. Although Apple similar to most technology companies had a policy of co-operating with court orders Apple argued that the software the government was requesting was a �master key� that could unlock millions of users� iPhones through a �backdoor.� Using the software would set a dangerous precedent for user privacy going forward.Tim Cook Apple�s chief executive officer (CEO) faced numerous challenges. In terms of the FBI order no matter who won the legal challenge the loser would appeal and therefore senior management would likely remain focused on the incident for several years. Beyond this issue however Cook needed to determine Apple�s policies regarding security systems in its products and what Apple�s overall relationship was or should be with the U.S. government. How much after all did customers care about the security of their smartphone data? Could protecting privacy at all costs have public relations implications? Resisting the order meant that Apple could be branded at best as unpatriotic and at worst as complicit in terrorist acts against the United States. Would an agreement reached with the U.S. government set a precedent for Apple�s products in overseas markets? And how would Apple�s stance on this issue influence government attempts to pass legislation that might require Apple�s partnership in criminal investigations? These issues needed to be addressed in the context of rapidly evolving technology which included alternatives to password protection. Apple�s Security EnvironmentApple had been systematically improving the security of its iOS which ran on devices such as the iPhone and iPad. Apple had evolved its iOS security to the point where the company could no longer routinely circumvent a device�s security for law enforcement for devices running on iOS 8 or later versions. While Apple had clear justified interests in developing secure devices for its customers law enforcement also faced growing difficulties in accessing digital evidence in the interest of criminal investigations public safety and national security. The FBI referred to this problem as �Going Dark� and it had been the subject of FBI testimony before U.S. Congress.The AWA order requested that Apple develop a piece of software�a modified version of its iOS�that would give the government the ability to test passcodes on Farook�s iPhone 5c to find the correct code without risking destruction of the data on the device. The custom software would achieve three functions: (1) allow electronic testing of passcodes instead of having to enter the passcodes by hand; (2) eliminate any software-induced time delay between passcode attempts; and (3) disable or bypass the feature in iOS 9 that wiped data from the device after 10 unsuccessful passcode attempts. To make the AWA order more acceptable to Apple the software was to be written incorporating identifiers unique to Farook�s iPhone and thus built to function on only that specific device. The writ further stipulated that if Apple desired Apple could apply the new software to Farook�s iPhone in an Apple facility rather than Apple providing the software to the government.DIGITAL DEVICE SECURITY EncryptionNumerous components were involved in creating and preserving digital device security including for example restricting physical access to the device. In the context of the Apple and FBI case the fundamental security issue was that of encryption. Digital encryption was the process of using a computer code to convert digital data so that it could no longer be seen in its original format without entering the code to digitally decrypt it or convert it back. The ones and zeros that represented information (e.g. text images and videos) were converted into a different series of ones and zeros that appeared to no longer represented the original information. Encryption was done on a computer by inputting the original data into an algorithm that transformed the original input (i.e. �plaintext�) into the converted output (i.e. �ciphertext�). Of course encryption was sensible only when the algorithm was reversible�that is when the ciphertext could be decrypted back to its original form. Such an algorithm had value as a security measure only when access to the decryption step could be limited to the owner of the data. Such algorithms required the use of an input (i.e. �a key�) known only to the owner of the data plus anyone with whom the owner wished to share the key. Good encryption systems made discovery of the key nearly impossible through the use of so-called �brute force methods��methods that simply repeatedly made guesses at the key until stumbling upon the one that worked. In a password system such as that on the iPhone the actual encryption key was generated by a key derivation function�an algorithm that built a complex encryption key from a simpler user-supplied password. The weakest link in the overall system was users who chose passwords that were too easy to guess.Modern encryption was done with the use of computers and cryptographic science had evolved such that very good encryption could be done on easy-to-acquire consumer devices such as personal computers and smartphones. For example a cryptosystem developed in 1978 relied on a one-way algorithm involving the product of two very large prime numbers. Such an algorithm was mathematically highly resistant to brute force attempts to decrypt the data. The widespread availability of powerful encryption technology created a dilemma for law enforcement because criminals could use these tools to encrypt their digital data and law enforcement without knowing the key was effectively prevented from reading the data.Apple iPhone SecurityThe phone the FBI wanted to access with its AWA order was an iPhone 5c running iOS 9. The phone was owned by the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health which had provided the phone to Farook the suspect to use for work. Farook created a password to lock his iPhone which posed three barriers for law enforcement: (1) the passcode needed to be entered by hand on the phone itself; (2) the iOS forced a delay after each passcode attempt; and (3) the iOS allowed users to enable an extra security measure that completely deleted the user�s data on the device after 10 incorrect passcode attempts.Similar to many modern security systems the Apple operating system combined two pieces of data to prevent unauthorized access. The first was a unique 256-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) secret key that was embedded in the phone when it was manufactured. The second piece of data was a user-chosen password. Since passwords were typically short Apple protected the device against random guesses by including an optional feature that limited the number of attempts to enter the password. When this limit was exceeded the correct passcode key was erased which made the data on the phone permanently inaccessible.As a part of the process of limiting the number of guesses for a password the device required approximately 80 milliseconds to process each password attempt. Although this delay would not be noticeable for humans it effectively prevented computer-generated guessing. Computer security expert Dan Guido noted that �In terms of cracking passwords you usually want to crack or attempt to crack hundreds or thousands of them per second. And with 80 milliseconds you really can only crack eight or nine per second. That�s incredibly slow.� A four-digit passcode (i.e. from 0000�9999) had a maximum of 10000 unique passwords; random attempts to guess the code would require trying about half of those possibilities. Increasing the passcode to six digits would lead to 1 million combinations. The number of possible combinations could be greatly increased by including letters in addition to digits. Apple estimated that without safeguards in place an all-numeric passcode could be defeated in a few days whereas a password that accommodated letters could take more than five years. The operating system in the San Bernardino iPhones was set to default to a six-digit passcode although a user could change this default to an easier to remember (but less secure) four-digit passcode or to a more secure six-character password.THE FBI�S REQUESTThe FBI�s request provided as a signed court order required that Apple �assist� by providing the FBI with a signed loadable iPhone software image file. The software required to work on only the single specific iPhone in question needed to bypass or disable the auto-erase function allow the FBI to submit passcodes electronically and remove the delay between passcode entries.There was no requirement that the software or iPhone needed to leave Apple�s facilities and Apple was to advise the government of the reasonable cost of performing these actions.Early reports created some confusion which led to the public believing that the court had ordered Apple to unlock the phone. Instead the FBI wanted to try guessing the password without the risk that the operating system would make the data unreadable and to be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time. In other words the FBI wanted to be able to bypass the touch screen so that the password guesses could be generated and entered electronically. To enable this functionality Apple would need to create a so-called �crippled� version of its operating system that would be less secure and then install this special software on Farook�s iPhone.Apple as a software vendor required the ability to update software on user phones by delivering a download of new copies of the software when improved versions became available. To prevent malicious parties from installing malware on their customers� phones Apple signed its software with a combination of the device�s unique device identifier (UDID) and Apple�s secret private key which the phone used to recognize a legitimate upgrade. If a malicious party were to attempt to modify Apple�s software the key signing procedure would fail without Apple�s private key to sign the software update and the software would not install on the iPhone. From the FBI�s perspective the secret key-signing feature of Apple�s software updates combined with Apple�s ability to code the UDID from Farook�s phone into the modified version of the iOS would ensure that the crippled version of Apple�s operating system could not be modified to function on any device other than Farook�s phone without Apple�s explicit co-operation.The FBI also believed that the software it was requesting did not represent a simple �backdoor� into the system because even if Apple did everything asked of them the FBI�s attempts to randomly guess the password might not work. In particular if Farook had not accepted the default four-digit passcode and instead had protected the phone with the optional six-digit passcode or more securely a password containing both letters and numbers the FBI would likely be unable to access the data in any reasonable amount of time even with Apple�s accommodations.APPLE�S RESPONSEApple�s corporate policy which was typical for technology companies was to comply with all legal orders to provide information. However in response to the AWA order Cook published a �Message to Our Customers� which started by establishing Apple customers� need for encryption:Smartphones led by iPhone have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information from our private conversations to our photos our music our notes our calendars and contacts our financial information and health data even where we have been and where we are going. . . . Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.Cook then described the government�s request as mandated hacking:The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers�including tens of millions of American citizens�from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would ironically be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.Cook concluded by describing the government�s approach as �a dangerous precedent�:Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority. The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by �brute force� trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.The implications of the government�s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone it would have the power to reach into anyone�s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages access your health records or financial data track your location or even access your phone�s microphone or camera without your knowledge.LEGAL ISSUES In a rare display of unity among otherwise competing technology firms a brief to Judge Pym in support of Apple�s position was jointly authored by Amazon Box Cisco Systems Dropbox Evernote Facebook Google Microsoft Mozilla Nest Pinterest Slack Snapchat WhatsApp and Yahoo. The brief made three main arguments: (1) The U.S. federal government was inappropriately overreliant on the AWA and did not have the legal authority to make the requests it had presented to Apple; (2) The request was to defeat security safeguards and was far beyond �non-burdensome technical assistance;� and (3) Construction of software code was enforced speech which was prohibited by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The brief also elaborated a set of dangers for a firm such as Apple if it complied with the court order. In addition to the immediate dangers of lost sales to customers who believed the resulting product was inferior in terms of its security features if the backdoor key were to fall into the wrong hands the firm could experience fallout in the future from possible lawsuits lost customers and damaged reputation. The firms signing the brief tended to have business models based on the collection of large amounts of customer data. Therefore they found themselves on the same side as Apple�normally a competitor�given concerns over any growth in government access to their customers� data.Statutory ArgumentsThe AWA stated �The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.� As such the AWA applied only to situations that Congress had not specifically addressed. Apple argued that Congress had passed the specific Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) whose purpose was to ensure that telecommunications firms could intercept communications when presented with a lawful order to do so. But the CALEA also stated that the government could not mandate the design of telecommunications systems and could not require telecommunications companies to decrypt user data.A relevant case cited by both parties was a 1977 Supreme Court case involving New York Telephone Co. The court found that the telephone company could be compelled by the government to install a �pen register� to record the phone numbers that were called from a particular phone. Three factors were central to this decision: (1) The government could not compel a third party far removed from the underlying controversy; (2) The company could not be unduly burdened to provide the assistance; and (3) The government must have a necessity to obtain the assistance.Constitutional ArgumentsApple and the other technology firms that had submitted the brief to Judge Pym then invoked their First Amendment protection to not write the software required to comply with the court order. It had previously been established that being compelled to speak violated the First Amendment�s protection of the freedom of speech; thus for example school students could not be required to recite the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance. Other cases had established that computer code (i.e. software) was considered to have the same protections as speech.OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO APPLE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY FIRMSApple had a variety of technical options available to it going forward. Newer versions of the iPhone (e.g. post-Farook�s 5c model) had a separate computer inside the phone enclosure called the �secure enclave� which managed security (see Appendix). Security expert Guido described the options to Wired magazine:There are changes that Apple can make to the secure enclave to further secure their phones. . . . For instance they may be able to require some kind of user confirmation before that firmware gets updated by entering their PIN code . . . or they could burn the secure enclave into the chip as read-only memory and lose the ability to update it [entirely]. . . .There�s a couple of different options that they have; I think all of them though are going to require either a new major version of iOS or new chips on the actual phones. . . . But for the moment what you have to fall back on is that it takes 80 milliseconds to try every single password guess. And if you have a complex enough password then you�re safe.The technical world had already changed to accommodate non-password security technologies. And ironically smartphones themselves were now being used as the second factor in two-factor authentication log-in schemes. Thus smartphones had become even more important securing not just the data that was on the mobile device itself but also data stored with other Internet-based services. Increasingly biometrics such as Apple�s Touch ID fingerprint reader and its Face ID facial recognition system�primarily used to unlock the phone�were being used to access applications (apps) or make point-of-sale payments. If a mobile device were limited to biometric access then no password entry scheme would be feasible whether brute force or not.Apple and other technology firms also needed to consider their relationships with foreign governments not just with the United States. For example Apple generated approximately 20 per cent of its sales in China where its App Store brought in more revenue than its U.S. store. Given the importance of this market Apple had removed virtual private network (VPN) software from its App Store in China at the request of the Chinese government. Apple also agreed to store its keys for the Chinese version of its iCloud software in China which critics argued would make it easier for the Chinese government to access data stored there. Other technology firms chose a different route abroad from the route that Apple took when confronted with the FBI�s court order in the United States. For example BlackBerry Limited (formerly Research in Motion Limited or RIM) provided the Government of India with BlackBerry�s encryptions keys when ordered to do so. BlackBerry chose to comply with the request despite the report that �Super-secure corporate emails called BlackBerry Enterprise Services had traditionally been RIM�s main attraction for companies and corporate executives.�FUTURE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENTGiven the increasing importance of digital devices it was not surprising that forensic evidence such as that obtained from cellphones tablets and other personal electronics had been increasingly used by law enforcement at all levels not just in high-profile national cases such as those prosecuted by the FBI (see Exhibit 1). Law enforcement agencies had labs to examine the contents of phones to discover for example where the owners were what they were doing and whom they were calling or texting immediately before they were the victims or perpetrators of a crime.But as security on devices and the use of that security for illegal purposes increased law enforcement found it increasingly difficult to access data. Further data access issues were not limited to encrypted personal devices. For example Microsoft refused to provide the contents of email messages that were located outside of the United States on a server in Ireland. A New York court upheld Microsoft�s right to not provide the contents�a decision that the Justice Department appealed.Industry observers criticized U.S. government efforts to pass new legislation that would enhance government access to encrypted data. For example the proposed Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016 would have required any data encrypted by private companies to be decrypted upon request. Experts argued that this requirement would make end-to-end encryption impossible and would weaken the security of America�s technology infrastructure including how data were transmitted over the Internet. In addition some noted that the government had the option to acquire data before it was encrypted or could collect metadata which had been shown to be useful. Finally some argued that the larger problem might be that law enforcement had not demonstrated that it knew what to do with the data they had previously acquired.The CALEA was enacted in 1994 and technology had changed significantly in the meantime. Previous FBI director James Comey stated as early as October 2014 that Apple�s new operating system default meant that �the companies themselves won�t be able to unlock phones laptops and tablets to reveal photos documents e-mail and recordings stored within.�The government�s position had largely remained the same since the FBI had sought its court order against Apple. The U.S. Justice Department�s deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein gave a speech in October 2017 reiterating the position taken by the previous administration: Companies seemed to have no reason to create encryption that could be breached for a search warrant and the public bore the consequences. Rosenstein contrasted the companies� stance on encryption with their other behaviours including collecting detailed data on their customers and acceding to the requests of foreign governments to remove protections that shielded the data of their citizens from those governments.COOK�S CHALLENGESApple and similar technology firms faced a public relations dilemma: It could be said that if you were not against terrorists and child molesters then you must be for them. And law enforcement was aware of the power of these arguments. Wired magazine reported:Robert S. Litt general counsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence predicted as much in an email sent to colleagues three months ago [circa August 2015]. In that missive obtained by the Washington Post Litt argued that although �the legislative environment [for passing a law that forces decryption and backdoors] is very hostile today it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. In the story about that email another U.S. official explained to the Post that the government had not yet succeeded in persuading the public that encryption is a problem because �[w]e do not have the perfect example where you have the dead child or a terrorist act to point to and that�s what people seem to claim you have to have.�Even without an event as dramatic as the shooting in San Bernardino Apple faced numerous practical issues at the confluence of technology and public policy. Co-operating with the government would allow Apple both to manage the public relations issues and to be perceived as being on the right side of helping to defend the country against terrorism. However compliance could set a precedent for future FBI requests many or most of which could be expected to be less dramatic and might even entangle Apple in disputes between competing government political factions such as the FBI�s involvement with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In addition Apple�s co-operation with the U.S. government could have a chilling effect on worldwide iPhone sales especially if Apple�s main competitor Google with its Android phones was seen as less susceptible to such requests. However thinking longer term co-operating in this specific case could forestall momentum for new legislation that would require technology companies to design their systems in such a way as to be able to provide the government with whatever data they requested. Such legislation would likely constrain the design space for future devices and therefore potentially limit innovation and future sales. Weighing all these factors made Cook�s choice of the next steps difficult and certain to be criticized.APPENDIX: Security through Cryptography Cryptography or literally �hidden writing� was a practice going back hundreds of years whose purpose was to represent information in a way that only selected readers could read.1 It was typically described as �scrambling� ordinary text (also referred to as plaintext or cleartext) into ciphertext. This scrambling was referred to as encryption and the process of converting it back into ordinary text was decryption.Although cryptography existed long before the invention of the computer the addition of computing resources made the tasks of both encryption and decryption easier and more powerful. In addition with computers themselves becoming a standard storehouse of information the desire to limit access to this information led to the creation of barriers by using cryptography. Access to computer systems was commonly limited by passwords that were known only to the owner of the data and potentially to system administrators.The design of such systems inevitably involved trade-offs among characteristics such as ease of use versus vulnerability to unintended access. For example passwords that were shorter or easier to remember also tended to be easier for others to observe or to guess. Changing passwords on a frequent basis could improve their security but made legitimate access more difficult. In addition systems could be designed to allow other trusted parties to access the system even when they were not the owner of the data.Modern encryption systems were based on what were referred to as �public key� systems. Earlier systems used what were termed symmetrical keys meaning that the secret input to encrypt the information was the same secret input required to decrypt it. This functionality created a security problem: how to ensure parties who legitimately required the key had access to it while at the same time keeping the key out of the hands of those not entitled to have it.With public key systems the key to encrypt the data differed from the key to decrypt it. Therefore the owner of the information could distribute the encryption key widely (the �public key�) so long as the decryption key was kept �private.� The mathematics behind these systems was based on prime numbers whereby owners choose two large prime numbers as their private keys multiplied them together and published only the product of multiplying the two numbers as their public key. Even with modern computing power the process of attempting to discover the multiplicand and the multiplier of a very large product of two prime numbers (e.g. a number on the order of 10308) was not solvable in a practical time period.2Systems such as the iPhone had trade-offs. Users primarily wanted to restrict access to their phones so they protected their phones with an access method known or possessed only by the user such as a password. But users also had an interest in allowing Apple to access their individual phones to for example update the phone�s software or operating system with new releases. For this access to work Apple needed to possess a key that would allow it access to all iPhones without needing to know anyone�s individual password.Apple described the security steps it took to provide software updates to its users� phones using this key:Each step of the startup process contains components that are cryptographically signed by Apple to ensure integrity and that proceed only after verifying the chain of trust. This includes the bootloaders kernel kernel extensions and baseband firmware. When an iOS device is turned on its application processor immediately executes code from read-only memory known as the Boot ROM [read-only memory]. This immutable code known as the hardware root of trust is laid down during chip fabrication and is implicitly trusted. The Boot ROM code contains the Apple Root CA [certification authority] public key which is used to verify that the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB) is signed by Apple before allowing it to load. This is the first step in the chain of trust where each step ensures that the next is signed by Apple. When the LLB finishes its tasks it verifies and runs the next-stage bootloader iBoot which in turn verifies and runs the iOS kernel. This secure boot chain helps ensure that the lowest levels of software are not tampered with and allows iOS to run only on validated Apple devices.3Appendix (continued)Ongoing technological advances have continued to advance the nature of securing data on a mobile device. Newer iPhones sold after Farook�s model 5c were equipped with what was called a �secure enclave� a feature described as �a separate computer inside the iPhone that broker[ed] access to encryption keys� and thus improved the security of the keys.4 The feature created longer delays between password guesses and increased those delays after each failed attempt. The delay before the last guess was one hour. The FBI included this information in its application to the court; however Farook�s phone was an earlier model that did not have the secure enclave software delay.5 Simon Singh The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography (New York NY: Random House Anchor Books 1999).2 Ibid.3 Apple Inc. iOS Security: iOS 9.3 or Later May 2016 accessed August 1 2018 www.apple.com/ca/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf.4 Ibid.5 Kim Zetter �Apple�s FBI Battle Is Complicated.

(Amazon) one of the largest global online retailers decided to enter the offline retail industry in December 2016 by launching its first Amazon Go store in Seattle offering a technologically innovative way of shopping that allowed customers to make purchases without a cashier. The launch was the first time that Amazon really entered the traditional retail industry. Earlier in May 2016 the company had entered food diaper and housekeeping product manufacturing with its Amazon Elements brand. Nevertheless these products were only available online for American Prime Members. Founded in 1994 as an online bookstore the company had become an e-commerce giant leading digital sales of books and electronic products. It revolutionized the way consumers purchased products while also becoming a trusted source of product information for potential buyers. However the company was not profitable until 2001 while it was still experiencing some financial difficulties. As of the third quarter of 2016 it was the fourth most valuable public company in the United States. In 2015 it surpassed Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (Walmart) as the most valuable online retail company in the United States. Could Amazon reproduce its online success in the traditional offline retail segment? Could its current competitive advantages be replicated in offline retailing? Did this diversification make sense considering Amazon�s existing key resources and capabilities the presence of established traditional retailers like Walmart and the market trend that was increasingly moving toward online stores?HISTORYThe Beginnings: 1994�1997On July 5 1994 Jeff Bezos a 30-year-old engineer graduating from Princeton University left his job as vice-president at D.E. Shaw & Co. a global investment firm based in New York to create an online bookstore based in Seattle. He saw the future of selling products online and thus first sold books videos computer hardware and software and compact discs. He chose to sell books because of the high worldwide demand low price per piece and high number of titles. His aim was to provide more varieties of books online than were available in a physical store. Amazon�s main competitors were Barnes & Noble Booksellers Inc. the largest retail bookseller and other local booksellers in the United States. The company was named Amazon.com in the year after it was created. Through a partnership with Ingram Book Group LLC Amazon could access books at wholesale prices and sell them online at cheaper prices than physical bookstores. Within its first two months Amazon�s online sales covered more than 45 countries with sales revenue of US$20000 per week. In June 1997 it went public and entered the Nasdaq stock exchange at an initial price of $18 per share raising $54 million.Global Expansion and Laborious Financial Results: 1998�2004In 1998 Amazon began to expand internationally first by entering the United Kingdom and Germany and then moving to Europe and Asia including France Japan and China. The company included different languages on its websites to serve these international markets. Bezos was not expecting to make any profits during the first four or five years of the business. Shareholders were not satisfied with the company because it was not profitable and not growing fast enough. However this business model with slow but efficient growth saved Amazon from suffering too much from the 2001 dot-com bubble and the company realized its first profits in 2001. Nevertheless its profit was only $5 million from revenues of over $1 billion. Since 2001 the company had significantly diversified its products from books to computers electronics clothes and beauty products. Diversification Early Steps in the Service Industry and Own-Brand Products: 2005�2010Amazon continued to extend its services through AmazonFresh a grocery service and Amazon Music an online music store. The company increased its product offerings through the Fulfilment by Amazon program where products were stored in Amazon�s fulfilment centres and then quickly picked packed and shipped to customers. It also created Amazon Prime to provide a two-day shipping service in the United States for only $79 a year. It launched Amazon Web Services Inc. which offered inexpensive reliable and scalable cloud computing services including Amazon Mechanical Turk a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that enabled individuals and businesses to coordinate the use of human intelligence. This period also marked the beginning of Amazon�s own-brand products including the 2007 launch of the Amazon Kindle one of the very first e-books readers three years before the launch of Apple Inc�s iBooks. Innovating and Diversifying at a Faster Pace: 2011�2017The company kept innovating to improve its products and services. It launched Amazon Locker a parcel delivery service that allowed buyers to pick up purchases at secure self-service kiosks and Amazon Prime Air a cargo airline and drone-based delivery system. In February 2017 the company announced that it would invest $1.5 billion to build an air cargo hub to support the increasing size of its fleet. Amazon also entered new segments with its Kindle Fire and Fire HD which competed with Apple�s iPad.Amazon acquired several companies including GoodReads an online social networking site for sharing books and reviews and LoveFilm a DVD-by-mail and streaming video-on-demand provider that competed with Netflix in Europe. It acquired Kiva Systems to develop robots that efficiently moved products in warehouses thereby shortening delivery times. The company launched Amazon Video Direct to compete with YouTube and it also developed and operated Amazon Video an Internet video-on-demand service where customers could buy rent and instantly watch digital movies and TV shows. Amazon opened its first physical bookstore Amazon Books in Seattle selling products at the same prices as those available in the online stores. These strategic moves allowed Amazon to become a global online retail giant. By 2015 its market capitalization surpassed that of Walmart.AMAZON�S DEVELOPMENTHeadquartered in Seattle Amazon was one of the big four global digital companies: Google Apple Inc. Facebook Inc. and Amazon. It had worldwide operations with websites serving markets in 14 countries in North America Europe and Asia and shipping services in 75 countries. Its business was expanding rapidly. The number of full-time and part-time Amazon employees increased 47 per cent in one year to reach 268900 in 2016. This was 23 times more employees than its online competitor EBay and twice as many as Apple but it was less than 12 per cent of the employees of its offline competitor Walmart. Amazon announced a plan to hire 100000 full-time employees in the United States from January 2017 to mid-2018 potentially becoming one of the largest technology employers in the country.Amazon offered a wide range of products on its website including books apparel and even food. As of February 2017 Amazon.com had 48 categories of products�both new and used�that were created and sold both by Amazon itself and by other companies. Most products were in the digital and multimedia sectors. The company had diversified a lot over the years but mainly within online businesses. The company�s revenues from online retail sales largely surpassed those of its competitors: in 2015 its online retail sales were 5.5 times greater than those of Walmart making it the leader in the online retail market (see Exhibit 1). Amazon made $71.84 billion in online retail sales between November 2014 and November 2015. This was more than the combined online sales of Apple Walmart Sears Roebuck & company The Gap Inc. Costco Wholesale Coporation Target Corporation The Kohl�s Corporation Best Buy Co. and The Home Depot Inc. In the second quarter of 2016 Amazon hit a record profit for the third straight quarter�$857 million ($1.78 per share) on revenue of $30.4 billion. This record far surpassed analysts� estimates of profits per share of $1.11 and revenues of $29.5 billion. In 2016 its online retail sales accounted for half of all online retail sales in the United States. According to Amazon�s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky these positive financial figures were a result of �working very hard on efficiency� and �benefits of operating at scale.�For years as Amazon�s online retail sales and profits increased continually the company kept on investing in research and development (R&D) to improve its offers and to develop new market sectors. In 2016 Amazon decided to enter food and consumable goods manufacturing through Amazon Elements available only online for American Prime Members and offline retailing through Amazon Go in Seattle the first brick-and-mortar convenience food store that employed mobile e-commerce machine learning and computer vision to allow customers to make purchases without a cashier. However Amazon�s performance in the third quarter of 2016 especially in terms of profits was lower than expected and this caused its stock price to decrease by 7 per cent. While its revenues were as expected at $32.7 billion its profits were $252 million which was much lower than in the second quarter. Earnings per share were only $0.52�below the estimated $0.78. Still as of the third quarter of 2016 Amazon was the fourth most valuable public company in the United States. This poorer performance resulted largely from increased investments in improving existing offers and developing new offers. Such investments were expected to increase as Amazon entered offline retail segments which required at least buying physical stores. As Olsavsky said �We are in a period of advancing up our investments in the second half of 2016 even more so than in prior years.� In May 2016 to raise more capital Bezos sold over one million of his shares�the largest amount he had ever made�for $671 million. In August 2016 he sold another record one million shares for $756.7 million reducing his shares in Amazon to 16.9 per cent (see Exhibit 2).AMAZON�S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGESAmazon�s success was not only due to its first-mover advantage but also came from a combination of competitive advantages related to marketing supply chain innovation and customer-centricity.Brand Awareness and Innovative MarketingAmazon�s marketing strategy relied on its strong brand awareness. As Bezos said �Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.� In another interview he noted the importance of communicating the story of Amazon�s brand: �You can have the best technology you can have the best business model but if the storytelling isn�t amazing it won�t matter . . . Nobody will watch.� The company implemented innovative marketing to receive free press coverage and to increase good customer perception of its products and services. Its community banana stands gave away about 4500 free bananas daily to Seattle inhabitants to create more links with customers and improve its brand image. Since bananas were also the most popular item sold by Amazon�s rival Walmart some analysts thought this campaign could be seen as a way of attacking Walmart by showing that Amazon also sold good-quality fresh items.Amazon chose to advertise its first unexpected offline retail venture Amazon Go through video teasing which successfully created a buzz among the general public. Amazon did not really need to spend a lot of money to advertise this brand-new offline offer as media outlets were already talking about this innovative retail marketing approach. Amazon�s competitors also started to react to the resulting widespread public awareness by creating their own videos which generated even more visibility for Amazon Go.In 2015 Amazon spent $2.8 billion on digital marketing an increase of 40 per cent from the year before. The company also established partnerships with digital celebrities to promote its products. However these marketing activities were not the only reason for Amazon�s success and Amazon focused less on offline advertising than digital brands like Apple and Samsung. As Bezos said �In the old world you devoted 30 per cent of your time to building a great service and 70 per cent of your time to shouting about it. In the new world that inverts.� Efficient Supply Chain Management to Create a Convenient Shopping ExperienceAs an online retailer Amazon revolutionized the way customers shopped for products through its efficient supply chain management which made a wider range of products available and delivered those products faster than its competitors. The company�s global presence and available worldwide shipments allowed customers to easily buy almost anything from any country from Amazon. Unlike Walmart Amazon did not need a physical shop; it just needed a warehouse to store products. It also had products delivered directly from the producer to the customer. Its fast delivery came from the strategic location of its warehouses the high levels of available product inventory its fast order management and its partnerships with delivery companies. For example in Japan Amazon partnered with Yamato Holdings Co. Ltd. allowing buyers to receive products within a day of their orders. This very efficient delivery also came from its investments in robotics. From the beginning of its business Amazon sold many products at highly competitive prices usually cheaper than those of offline competitors. Bezos even said �There are two kinds of companies those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second.� This ability to reduce prices came from the high economies of scale Amazon could generate on some products because of their high turnover. Unlike offline retailers Amazon did not pay expensive rent for physical shops but efficiently managed warehouses at strategic locations to maximize its inventory turnover. Its strategy to sell more at a low price meant the company�s margins were usually lower than those of competitors and this was one reason why it was not profitable for many years.Customer-Centricity and InnovationBezos�s strategy had always been to focus on customer needs. He said �We�ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we�ve stuck with for 18 years and they�re the reason we�re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.� Since the beginning of online business Amazon kept innovating to create the best possible user experience. The company emphasized the ease of use of its websites. It also reduced product delivery time proposing even same-day deliveries in some cities. This customer-centric approach allowed the company to be more innovative. As Bezos said �If you�re competitor-focused you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.� The company increased the number of products it offered over the years to satisfy customer needs particularly through partnerships with prominent players such as retailer Toys �R� Us Inc. AMAZON�S PRIVATE LABELS AND OFFLINE RETAIL OFFERSAmazon had already launched a bookstore in a university in Seattle which offered over 6000 book titles and it planned to open a second one in San Diego. Although Amazon did not have much experience in the traditional manufacturing and retail business it decided in 2016 to enter grocery product manufacturing and brick-and-mortar food retailing. This decision went against the general trend of business models followed by many competitors which were increasingly moving from offline physical stores to online stores. However Bezos did not see this decision as a risk. Instead he saw it as a normal evolution of business and said �What�s dangerous is not to evolve.�New BrandsAfter developing many electronic devices under its own brand Amazon decided to enter the higher-margin grocery and household goods sectors. In May 2016 the company announced the launch of three brands available for purchase online on its websites: Happy Belly (which offered grocery products including milk coffee cereals and pasta) Wickedly Prime (which offered ready-to-eat prepared foods) and Mama Bear (which offered baby products including baby food cleaning wipes and diapers). Amazon thus not only sold grocery and household products online but also produced them through private labels allowing the company to have potentially higher margins. On its websites the company explained that this move was driven by its customer-centric capabilities. According to Amazon the product offerings would be improved based on the clients� feedback. It wanted to create and promote brands that would be seen by customers as more trustworthy than others.While Amazon Elements products had been available only in the United States and only to Amazon Prime members a small segment of Amazon�s entire customer base Amazon contracted with multiple manufacturers to produce this new range of products. These manufacturers included TreeHouse Foods Inc. which was also manufacturing similar goods for other retailers. This development could be seen as an attempt by Amazon to catch up and compete even more with other retailers such as Walmart and Target which had had their own product brands for years. Because Amazon�s brand awareness was so high it could develop these new offers easily without having to spend millions of dollars on advertising and other marketing activities. Amazon could adapt its product offers to meet consumer demands by utilizing its enormous customer databases. However as Amazon had not been a traditional retailer before this strategic move might be seen as risky. Indeed this was not the first time that Amazon had tried to produce baby products. In 2014 the company had launched its own diapers on its websites but removed them from Amazon.com only few weeks after the launch due to manufacturing defects and negative customer feedback. Nevertheless Bezos was not the kind to give up easily after one failure. He said �If you�re not stubborn you�ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you�re not flexible you�ll pound your head against the wall and you won�t see a different solution to a problem you�re trying to solve.�These new Amazon-branded products could also create tensions with suppliers who were currently presenting their products on Amazon.com potentially putting Amazon in an even tougher position to negotiate with them. Should Amazon�s own brands be showcased on its websites while the company aimed to be a leader in the sale of its own-brand products? Should these own-brand products be marketed the same way as products available from other suppliers? Was the launch of its own-brand products considered unfair competition?Amazon GoAmazon�s business model was designed under the assumption that retail businesses were all growing and moving toward the online environment. However with Amazon Go the company clearly revised its business model to combine online and offline retailing. The company opened its first brick-and-mortar food store on December 5 2016 near its headquarters in Seattle. It announced this new initiative only by posting a video about the Amazon Go concept that day. Immediately after the post media outlets around the world wrote about it. The store was accessible only to the company�s employees for beta testing while a public opening was planned for early 2017.It seemed that Amazon might be planning to extend Amazon Go to the United Kingdom. According to the Guardian the company had registered a British trademark for the store concept in December 2016 on the same day it opened the Seattle store. The company refused to comment to the newspaper about this potential U.K. expansion. However such an expansion would not be surprising given that the company had often before used the United Kingdom as its first non-U.S. market to test new offers. These strategic moves implied that Amazon might be thinking of developing the Amazon Go concept globally.The Amazon Go store which sold staple foods was 1800 square feet (over 160 square metres) in area. Its uniqueness was its fast and convenient electronic payment system. Customers just entered the store picked up the products they wanted and left the store without having to queue to process payments. When customers took products from the store sensors would concurrently transmit information about the purchases to its online processing system which would debit the price of those products directly from the customers� Amazon Prime accounts before the customers left the store. Amazon Go and Amazon.com had the same aim: to revolutionize the way people consumed in their everyday life and to offer the best possible customer experience. According to the company this shopping technology was really not a new concept as Amazon�s teams had already been working on it for four years.The automated grocery store raised significant concerns among Amazon�s employees due to the potential job cuts in Amazon stores. It was estimated that through this technology Amazon�s grocery stores might eliminate thousands of jobs in the long term.Competition in THE OFFLINE retail MARKETAmazon Go and Amazon�s private labels including Amazon Elements targeted markets that were quite similar to those of its major grocery retail competitors Walmart and Target. Over the years Amazon had surpassed these large retailers in terms of online sales but would the company be able to reproduce this online success in the offline markets? Though it might generate greater profit margins the offline retail market was extremely competitive requiring much larger investments. Importantly Amazon had no solid experience in managing physical chain stores. Many competitors particularly established grocery retailers viewed such announcements with humour. Amazon was clearly a latecomer without sufficient knowledge of brick-and-mortar retail markets while efficient delivery systems allowed more customers to shop for products online. Monoprix S.A. a major French retail chain located in key areas in city centres made a parody of Amazon Go�s video saying that Amazon should have better served its customers� needs. This reaction was similar to the response to Amazon�s entrance into the online food market in which it became a big player. By 2016 the Amazon Prime service had over 63 million users; these users could be potential users of Amazon Go and Amazon Elements as well.Amazon�s biggest competitor in the online retail market was Walmart an American retailer operating in both offline and online markets through its own brick-and-mortar stores and websites. It was the largest offline retailer in the United States and the second online retailer after Amazon. Amazon and Walmart had been competing in the online market for years. Walmart had even sued Amazon in 1998 for hiring former Walmart executives and thus stealing its trade secrets. Doug McMillon the president and chief executive officer of Walmart commented that Walmart�s high number of stores gave it a competitive edge over purely online stores such as Amazon and that by being in both offline and online markets the company could do �quick last minute delivery that is free cheaper pushes cutoff shopping during holidays and . . . brings people into stores.� The opening of Amazon Go stores and the development of Amazon�s own-brand grocery products could thus become a serious threat to Walmart.CONCLUSIONThe launch of Amazon Go and Amazon Elements as well as other private labels clearly demonstrated Amazon�s intention to move from being online only to becoming a mixed offline and online retail and manufacturing company. Amazon Go and Amazon Elements had several similarities: they were offline were reserved only for Amazon Prime members were in the grocery segment and had the same competitors. These initiatives which were seen as good opportunities for Amazon to generate higher profits meanwhile put the company into a riskier position due to its lack of experience in traditional retailing. In online retail sales Amazon�s performance had surpassed its mixed online and offline retail competitors over the years demonstrating its strengths in marketing supply chain and customer-centricity in online segments. Could Amazon replicate the competitive advantage that contributed to its online success in the offline retail markets? Could the company leverage its existing online assets and capabilities in the offline segments? Given this diversification how could Amazon manage the efficiency of its operations and the quality of its products in the long term? Did the company have capabilities to do so? Would Amazon Go change the way people bought and consumed as Amazon.com had done so successfully before? Would the company be able to go against the trend of grocery shopping which was increasingly moving toward online markets? Could the company develop these offline retail offers globally? Could competitors easily imitate this innovative shopping technology? Finally given potential job cuts would Amazon face resistance from store employees and unions?EXHIBIT 1: DIGITAL SALES WORLDWIDE by retailer (IN $MILLIONs)Source: Phil Wahba �This Chart Shows Just How Dominant Amazon Is� Fortune November 6 2015 accessed April 16 2017 http://fortune.com/2015/11/06/amazon-retailers-ecommerce/.EXHIBIT 2: AMAZON�S YEAR EnD FINANCIAL RESULTSSource: �Amazon.com Inc.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-05-20On February 11 2021 Cailyn Isaac was looking at Bitcoin�s price chart. Amazed by the high volatility of this recent currency she was trying to find a trading strategy that would allow her to make a profit from the Bitcoin price movement. Her goal was to identify a bullish or bearish Bitcoin market so that she could decide whether to buy or sell. After much research Isaac decided to use the moving average strategy a popular technical analysis tool among traders.bLockChain and Bitcoin: A BRIEF HISTORYInitiated in 2008 by an unknown entity called Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency. In this decentralized system transactions between two parties were conducted and verified across the network and then recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. This blockchain technology was a self-sustaining distributed and decentralized ledger. The blockchain had no central entity and all data were recorded and verified by an integrated set of computers. Each block in the blockchain resembled a page in the ledger. The header of each new block referred to the footer of the previous block thereby forming a chain of blocks. Blocks were connected using a cryptographic function called a �hash function� which was related to the content of the block. Hash functions converted a large amount of data into a fixed-length number (i.e. a hash). Since the hash of the previous block was incorporated into the description of the block that followed blockchains were immutable. Changing the content in any way required rebuilding all of the links that connected the blocks which was virtually impossible. This design made the technology extremely secure.In addition because Bitcoins were owned by �Bitcoin addresses� which were numeric identifiers users remained pseudonymous during transactions. In this way Bitcoin ensured better protection of users� privacy. Bitcoin also reduced transaction costs since the decentralized blockchain allowed users to transfer money directly without the need for financial institutions. While there was a risk that fraudulent users could double-spend their Bitcoins as transactions were not controlled by a central authority Bitcoin blockchain avoided this problem by providing a timestamp for each group of transactions and distributing it to all the nodes in the Bitcoin network. Since each timestamp included the previous timestamp in its hash all users needed to agree on a single history for each Bitcoin. Thus the immutability of blockchain data made Bitcoin highly resilient against predators and hackers.At the same time Bitcoin did have some disadvantages including its high energy cost. Bitcoin creation (or �mining�) was power-hungry and involved heavy computer calculations. The process of creating a block in the Bitcoin blockchain included providing �proof of work� which referred to finding a specific number called the �nonce� such that the block content and nonce created a hash with some pre-specified restrictions. The first miner that could successfully find the nonce was awarded a certain number of Bitcoins. As of May 2020 the reward stood at 6.25 Bitcoins but in an effort to retain the value of the currency this reward was halved roughly every four years (known as a Bitcoin-halving event). The nonce could be found only by trial and error�a process so computationally expensive that the central processing units of personal computers were insufficient. Instead special electronic chips called �application-specific integrated circuits� were required and computers ran almost constantly during the process. Moreover miners usually formed Bitcoin mining pools to increase the likelihood of successfully mining the nonce. Reports suggested that China controlled 65 per cent of all Bitcoin mining in the world. The amount of electricity that Bitcoin mining consumed was staggering: it was estimated that Bitcoin used more electricity annually than the entire country of Argentina. The price of Bitcoin had fluctuated significantly since its initiation. Notably in 2017 Bitcoin blockchain was divided into Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCC). BTC used upgraded blockchain technology with an increased rate of transactions while BCC used the original slower version of the technology. On March 7 2021 BTC�s price was US$52246.52 and BCC�s price was $516.17. In May 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10000 Bitcoins for two pizzas worth approximately $25. In February 2021 10000 BTC were worth more than $300 million. Over the course of 2017 alone BTC�s price increased from $1290 to $13800�before dropping to $3300 in 2018. On February 8 2021 the price of Bitcoin hit its all-time high after Tesla�s chief executive officer Elon Musk announced that the company was investing in Bitcoin (a decision that was heavily criticized as being contrary to Tesla�s environmental stance). These fluctuations made Bitcoin an interesting investment opportunity and one that many investment banks were eager to capitalize on. For instance Goldman Sachs opened a cryptocurrency desk to trade cryptocurrencies in 2021. Although Bitcoin was the pioneer and most popular cryptocurrency many other cryptocurrencies had gradually emerged including Ethereum and Ripple. Facebook also planned to create its own cryptocurrency Diem in 2021. The MOVING AVERAGE STRATEGYIsaac�s decision to use the moving average strategy was a common one: this strategy was widely used in the trading world to confirm any upward or downward trends once they had been established. A simple moving average was the mean of  previous prices and it filtered out the day-to-day price fluctuations. The strategy used one short-term moving average and one long-term moving average. A shift of momentum occurred when the short-term average crossed through the long-term average. In particular when the short-term average crossed above the long-term average (known as a �golden cross�) it signalled an upward trend and thus triggered a �buy� signal. Conversely a downward trend was established when the long-term average crossed above the short-term average (known as a �death cross�) generating a �sell� signal.The industry standard was to use a five-day 10-day or 20-day moving average as the short-term moving average and a 50-day 100-day or 200-day moving average as the long-term moving average. However consider the following example (illustrated in Exhibits 1 and 2) where a two-day moving average (was used as the short-term average and a five-day moving average () was used as the long-term trend. For instance on day 5  and . A buy signal was generated on day 8 because the short-term moving average crossed above the long-term moving average while a sell signal was generated on day 10 because the long-term moving average crossed above the short-term moving average.MAKING A DECISIONIsaac knew that she could use the moving average strategy to determine the general trend of the price of Bitcoin. She wanted to ascertain two things: (1) how effective the simple moving average strategy was in this situation and (2) the optimal number of days in the short- and long-term moving averages of Bitcoin�s price. She retrieved Bitcoin�s price history for the previous year (see Exhibit 3) from Yahoo! Finance and began to analyze the data.EXHIBIT 1: comparing bitcoin�s two-day and five-day moving averages over a 10-Day period (IN US$)Note: BTC = Bitcoin; USD = US$; MA2 = two-day moving average; MA5 = five-day moving averageSource: Created by the case authors.EXHIBIT 2: graphical comparison of bitcoin�s two-day and five-day moving averages over a 10-day period (IN US$)Note: BTC = Bitcoin; USD = US$; MA2 = two-day moving average; MA5 = five-day moving averageSource: Created by the case authors.EXHIBIT 3: Bitcoin prices on selected dates in 2020 and 2021 (IN US$)Note: BTC = Bitcoin; USD = US$Source: Created by the case authors.

In September 2015 Pascal RÃ©ty vice-president of sales for Logset Oy (Logset)âa privately held specialized forest machine manufacturing firm in Koivulahti Finlandâwas reviewing the latest sales estimates for the year. The forecast for 2015 was â¬30 million. Sales had plummeted in 2009 but since then they had been steadily increasing year over year and were now almost back to where they had been in 2007. With sales on the rebound RÃ©ty wondered if it was time for Logset to rethink its strategy for Canada an undeniably appealing market with 42 per cent of its land mass covered by forest. Nordic manufacturers such as Logset had been struggling to establish themselves in North America since the 1980s with mixed results. While other manufacturers chose to focus on the much larger American market Logset had focused its efforts on the Canadian market. Quebec and Ontario represented about 10 per cent of Logsetâs annual turnover; however despite 15 yearsâ effort there had been no appreciable increase in company sales or significant interest among potential customers in Atlantic or Western Canada. The need to push forward into new markets was important to Logset as it had been in a break-even and/or slightly profitable position for over 10 years. For Logset profitability depended not only on remaining competitive but also on staying ahead of the competition with innovative product developments. For a small firm maintaining this position was a challenge. Despite low profitability Logset had managed to as RÃ©ty put it âStay on top of its class with the full product range.â Logset had registered as an exhibitor for the upcoming Canadian Woodlands Forum in Maple Ridge British Columbia. This event could be the opportunity the firm needed to make inroads into the Western Canadian market for specialized forestry equipment. Company BackgroundLogset was founded in 1992 by Gustav FrantzÃ©n Seppo Koskinen and Kristian StÃ©n who acquired the forest machine business assets of Oy Norcar Ab (Norcar) when the estate of Norcar was forced into receivership. The sales agreement gave Logset access to Norcarâs spare part and trade-in machine inventory allowing Logset to maintain the distribution network with refurbished machines and spare parts. To become a manufacturer rather than just a re-seller Logset needed functional harvester technology. In 1996 the firm entered into a cooperative agreement with Jukka Kivipelto and Kari MikkilÃ¤ at Oy Fomac International FI Ltd. (Fomac) to develop both a new line of forwarders (F Series) and its first harvester (the Logset 8H Titan clear-cut harvester). In 2002 Logset formally merged with Fomac. In 2005 Logsetâs owners sold 70 per cent of the company to a group of Finnish investors represented by Primaca Partners. In 2006 Logset became part of the PiloMac group and in 2012 the two firms merged under the name Logset Oy.By 2015 Logsetâs product line included seven forwarders six harvesters and seven harvester heads (seeÂ Exhibit 1). Its distribution network covered 20 countries and Logset machines were operating in more than 25 countries. COMPANY approach to InternationalizingLogsetâs mission was to provide logging professionals with forest machines that were reliable productive and functional. It had adopted a functional organizational structure. The sales department was divided into two geographic units: Finland Area and International (see Exhibit 2). From its Finnish location Logset provided equipment and spare parts as well as direct customer support to customers in Europe and to dealers elsewhere. The firmâs strengths were its build-to-order business model dealer network and highly personalized customer service. Logsetâs approach to internationalizing was to establish one exclusive importer/distributor arrangement per market (see Exhibit 3). The importers/distributors were typically independent agents who bought the machines outright and then resold them to the end customer. The firm provided training and after-sales product/technical service support to both dealers and customers. In the 1990s Logset began to internationalize with exports to Russia. Although Russia remained an important market for the firm sanctions imposed by the European Union on the sale of logging equipment to Russia in 2015 temporarily halted exports. Along with Russia Germany became an important focus for Logset and had a 10 per cent market shareâin a market where the top three brands held more than 50 per cent. Entry into France followed in 1995. Sales were slow in the beginning but by 2015 France was Logsetâs largest market outside of Finland. In spite of Norcarâs long-standing relationships with its Swedish dealers it was not until 2005 that Logset was able to deliver its first machine to a Swedish customer. In 2010 Logset began expanding into South America with sales to Chile Brazil and French Guyana. In 2015 a customer in Australia received the largest forwarder ever made by the firm a Logset 12F with a 20-tonne capacity. By 2015 international sales represented 80 per cent of total revenue (see Exhibit 4). The challenges Logset faced differed by region. In Europe where the comfort of the operator was the principal concern the firm mostly sold replacement machines. In North America where safety was the main concern the firmâs machines were too small to safely remove large trees. In Brazil and Russia where timber was still being felled by hand and hauled out by horses persuading operators to mechanize was the biggest hurdle.Forestry in CanadaCanadaâs forestry industry like many other industries was undergoing structural change due to (a) changing consumer preferences particularly for print materials; (b) new markets in Asia for forest products; and (c) technologies that reduced carbon emissions and energy use. In 2013 Canada held 9 per cent of the worldâs total forest resources and 24 per cent of the worldâs total boreal forest. Forty-five per cent of Canadaâs land mass (417.6 million hectares) was forested 56 per cent was considered commercial forest (234.5 million hectares) and less than 0.5 per cent was harvested each year. The forested areas managed for timber production were 94 per cent publicly owned and primarily located in the Boreal Shield Atlantic Maritime Montane Cordillera and Pacific Maritime ecozones. Canadaâs forest resources were expected to remain stable as losses to deforestation were at 0.02 per cent. At the same time climate change was affecting Canadaâs forests: the northern tree line was moving further north and aspen were being lost along the southern edge of the boreal forest.The annual allowable cut was regulated by the governments in the provinces with commercial forest resources but the amount harvested was often less than the allowable cut. The amount harvested had been declining since 2006 due to reduced demand for newsprint reduced demand for lumber in the U.S. housing market and the global economic downturn. In 2012 148 million cubic metresâout of an allowable annual cut of 277 million cubic metresâwere harvested. In addition all areas harvested on provincial lands had to be regenerated by re-planting and/or seeding.The principal harvesting methods used in the forestry industry were clearcut or shelterwood for stands of trees of roughly the same age and single-tree selection for uneven-aged stands of trees. The trees could be sectioned in one of five ways: cut-to-length tree length full length whole tree or complete tree (see ExhibitÂ 5). Of these methods tree length was historically the preferred method; however as the cut areas became smaller and more distributed the cut-to-length method was attracting increased attention. The tree-felling methods were typically separated into three categories: (a) hand felling with a chainsaw and a cable skidder; (b) a feller buncher with a grapple skidder delimber and slasher; and (c) a cut-to-length harvester with a forwarder. Hand felling was best suited for large-diameter trees or precision logging. Feller buncher logging which made use of a mechanized harvester head was well suited for harvesting large volumes of low-grade wood for pulp or chip markets. Finally the harvester used in cut-to-length logging did the work of three machines (feller buncher delimber and slasher); coupled with a forwarder it caused less environmental damage and could operate on softer ground which extended the logging season.THE Forestry Equipment IndustryWorld demand for forestry equipment was expected to increase 4.5 per cent annually to US$9.3 billion in 2019 but primarily in developing countries. In the developed markets where Canada and the United States accounted for almost one-third of global demand growth was expected to be more modest (2â3 per cent annually) be driven by improving economic conditions and have a continuing focus on using technology to reduce operating costs and increase outputs. Technological improvements to ground-based logging systems (rendering them suitable for steep terrain) and the development of autonomous machines were two key equipment trends. Other trends included the use of wireless communications and global positioning systems to monitor and manage equipment. Forestry equipment was a sub-classification of the âconstruction and forestry machineryâ industry classification as equipment suitable for the construction industry (i.e. road-building equipment) was often used in forestry operations and certain types of construction equipment could be modified to serve specific forestry operations; for example a harvester head could be attached to an excavator thereby extending the utility of the base equipment. Not surprisingly the top five global construction equipment manufacturers (Caterpillar Inc. Komatsu Limited Hitachi Ltd. Volvo Construction Equipment and Terex Corporation) offered a full range of standardized equipment for road building along with specialized machinery for harvesting extracting and loading operations. Hence they were formidable competitors for firms focused only on harvesting equipment. Equipment designed solely for harvesting extracting and loading operations was developed initially in Sweden and Finland and the leading manufacturers of such equipment were still the Nordic firmsâPonsse OYJ (Ponsee) Rottne Industri AB Eco Log Sweden AB Gremo AB and Logset. Of these Ponsse was the largest with sales of over 700 specialized machines per year (see ExhibitÂ 6). There was little to differentiate the products of one manufacturer from another although the Nordic equipment was preferred because the machines were technologically more advanced lighter and more economical to operate. Nonetheless all of the manufacturers tended to focus their design efforts on improving (a) reliability to reduce the number of breakdowns and the cost of maintenance (b) engine efficiency to reduce fuel consumption and (c) operator training to allow for troubleshooting in the forest. Two new developments were being pursued: equipment for mechanized re-seeding (scarifiers planting machines silviculture and biomass heads and felling heads) and tethered or winch-assisted logging systems for steep slope logging. Suppliers to the industry were numerous as most of the components were standard off-the shelf items (e.g. tires tracks diesel engines drives and control systems). However the installed computer system that handled all of the machine operations including management reporting was a custom application.Buyers had little control over price but they did have choices. Buyer considerations included increasing production reducing fuel consumption durability and ease of operation. Ease of operation was a consideration because of a shortage of skilled operators. In support of this need for skilled operators all of the major manufacturers had developed forest machine simulators for enhanced operator training on harvesters and forwarders. For Canadian buyers two other considerations were import duties and safety. With the exception of machines purchased from Tigercat International Inc. (Tigercat)âthe only Canadian manufacturer of harvester equipmentâall other machine purchases were subject to import duties. The CanadaâUnited States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 eliminated import duties on machines imported into Canada from the United States and it was hoped that the implementation of the 2014 CanadaâEuropean Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement would do the same for machines imported from the European Union. Removing the import duties on forestry equipment from Europe would make Nordic equipment more attractive to buyers in terms of price and would also improve the attractiveness of the industry for suppliers. Machines with remote control capability were of interest for safety reasons. Injury rates in the forestry industry were a concern because they were typically higher than in other industries. In British Columbia for example the injury rate in the forestry industry was almost double that of all other industries (in 2012 the injury rate per 100 workers was 5.0 compared to 2.3 for all other industries). Operators of feller bunchers and harvesters for example worked from the safety of an enclosed cab which reduced the chances of injury from falling trees or branches. The most common substitutes for specialized forestry equipment were in the form of modifications to standard construction equipment or used equipment (e.g. as noted attaching a harvester head to an excavator mechanized the tree-felling process and turned an excavator into a dual-purpose machine). Used machines were often used as trade-ins on the purchase of a new machine creating a ready supply of previously owned equipment. An inventory check of a major North American used equipment supplier over a four-month period showed the stability of this market (see Exhibit 7). Logsetâs Canadian PresenceLogset began investigating the potential of the Canadian market in 2000. The firm signed an agreement with Wajax Equipment (Wajax) a heavy equipment supplier to the mining industry to provide forwarders in Eastern Canada. Corporate changes at Wajax ended this relationship within a year or two of signing. In 2015 Logset had one Canadian dealer who was responsible for the Quebec market and had been with the firm since 2009. Five agents had been added to the dealer network since 2009 to service the Ontario and New Brunswick markets. Some 15 machines a year were sold by the dealer/agent network of which 80 per cent of these were new. Forwarders typically cost CA$450000 to $650000 and wheel-based harvesters cost CA$800000 to $1000000 including delivery. The Canadian customer base represented 150 to 200 operators many of which were small contractors with one to three machines. The most cost-effective solution for small operators was to mount a harvester head on an excavator rather than purchasing a full machine. The excavator could be used for other purposes such as road building or snow plowing. The nature of the harvester head was such that it could fit on a harvester provided by Tigercat or TimberPro Inc. the two biggest competitors to Logset in the Canadian market. Customers would typically trade in their machines at the five-year mark thereby creating a supply of used machines. RÃ©ty believed customers sought out Logset machines because they were reliable and economical to operate and they provided a comfortable ergonomic working environment for the operator. In addition the relationship between Logset the dealer and the end user was one of trust that had been built over a number of years. Logset employees prided themselves on recognizing their customersâ faces. To ensure the firmâs equipment met the continuing needs of its customers 12 employees were working with suppliers on a variety of research and development initiatives.  The firmâs latest addition to its product portfolio the 12H GTE Hybrid Harvester (a combination of a diesel engine plus a generator/electric motor) was the only one of its kind. Logset wanted to increase its sales by an additional five to ten machines each year; the principal impediment to this goal was the lack of a dealer for Western Canada. The ideal dealer was difficult to source especially from a distance as this dealer would need good connections within the logging industry and a commitment to the Logset product line along with significant financial assets. Canadian dealers had to have at least four new and one or more used machines on site as well as â¬300000 worth of spare parts in order to service the local market. (Delivery time on a new machine was upwards of four months so dealers would sell from inventory. Spare parts could be delivered within four to five days out of Finland.) Dealer relationships were further challenged by the lack of direct contact with end customers (although personnel from Logset made regular visits to customer sites whenever they were in Canada) and the limited control Logset had over customer buying decisions particularly as dealers could carry competing products. Recognizing that the lack of a dealer for Western Canada was an important problem for Logset RÃ©ty was planning to attend the next Canadian Woodlands Forum. He hoped that by participating in this event he might be able to recruit a Western Canada dealer from among the visitors and/or other exhibitors. Failure to recruit a dealer would probably mean the firm would need to look elsewhere for its next opportunity.

But some health care issues could not be addressed by doctors so she often considered public office. The idea seemed crazy until a 2010 encounter with former Canadian prime minister Paul Martin; he convinced Philpott that idealism had a place in politics if someone was lucky enough to pick the right party obtain a riding nomination win an election and garner influence in a ruling government. Five years later after joining the Liberal party and being elected as the federal member of parliament (MP) for the Markham–Stouffville riding in Ontario Philpott was sworn in as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s minister of health making history as a member of Canada’s first gender-equal cabinet. As one of Trudeau’s most trusted ministers Philpott was able to influence public policy to a degree beyond what she might have imagined when entering politics—which is why when she tendered her resignation in March 2019 she openly acknowledged that it was a difficult decision to quit her latest prestigious post supervising the nation’s fiscal operations as President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government: “[It] grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate.”For almost four years Philpott and her female cabinet colleagues had personified Trudeau’s self-proclaimed feminist values. But on February 12 2019 Jody Wilson-Raybould a fellow cabinet minister resigned as Minister of Veterans Affairs and a member of cabinet after Trudeau used Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence on his team to deflate an explosive allegation published in the media. According to a Globe and Mail report Trudeau’s office had pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC-Lavalin) a Montreal-based engineering and construction firm avoid a criminal trial related to alleged corrupt business dealings in Libya. After she resigned from cabinet Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee that she had been moved from the prestigious position of justice minister to her position as Minister of Veterans Affairs after she fought what she called a “consistent and sustained effort” to influence the SNC-Lavalin file. According to Wilson-Raybould she had been pressed by “many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in [her] role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.” Those pressing Wilson-Raybould were worried they said about how a criminal conviction in the SNC-Lavalin case could impact jobs and the government’s chances of re-election in 2019.Philpott considered it an “enormous privilege” to serve Canadians as a member of cabinet. But like Wilson-Raybould she saw “solemn principles at stake . . . the independence and integrity of our justice system.” And as her resignation letter to Trudeau stated “I must abide by my core values my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.” Submitting her resignation letter had to have been difficult for Philpott. Prudence alone dictated remaining in cabinet and using her influence to effect positive change from within. When campaigning for office Philpott had told voters “For me a seat in the House of Commons is not a target it’s a tool. It’s the tool that you and I will use to make this community better—to make this country better.” As a cabinet minister she could use that tool with surgical precision. Her influence would be significantly less outside cabinet. Did she make the right decision to resign over principles?THE RISE OF INFLUENCEA person of faith and conviction Philpott was born on November 23 1960. The oldest of four sisters with religious parents—Audrey Little an elementary schoolteacher and Wallace Little a Presbyterian minister—she was taught selflessness as a virtue. Her formal education started in her picturesque hometown of Cambridge Ontario where she attended Hillcrest Public School and Galt Collegiate Institute. After graduating high school as a provincial scholar in 1979 Philpott studied medicine at Western University (formerly known as the University of Western Ontario). She then completed a residency in family medicine at the University of Ottawa and a fellowship in tropical medicine in Toronto. In 1986 Philpott married Paul Eric Philpott whose father became a Presbyterian minister after retiring from a career as an accountant. Together Philpott and her husband made a commitment to missionary work by joining an interdenominational evangelical Christian group. In 1989 they travelled to the Republic of the Niger where Philpott practised medicine and developed a training program for village health workers. While the young couple worked in the West African countryside in 1991 Emily Katherine Philpott their two-year-old daughter and her baby sister Bethany Jane contracted serious bacterial infections. The family raced to the nearest hospital two hours away which proved to be too late for Emily. But the death of their daughter did not weaken the couple’s passion for helping others. Following Bethany Jane’s full recovery they continued their missionary work. “Even though it was obviously very difficult for me at the time” Philpott later explained “what came out of that was an understanding that African mothers lose their babies by the thousands every day. And so as hard as it was for me why should an African mother expect that 25 per cent of her children won’t live to the age of five?” After almost a decade working abroad Philpott and her family returned to Canada where she joined the Markham Stouffville Hospital and after completing a master’s degree in health became an associate professor at the University of Toronto. In 2004 Philpott challenged her hospital colleagues to contribute a day’s pay to help fight the AIDS pandemic raising CA$33000. The following year when Philpott temporarily returned to Africa to help during a food crisis the Give a Day initiative to recognize World AIDS Day raised almost $100000 from across eight hospitals. By 2006 after the campaign was expanded to teachers lawyers flight attendants unions and businesses it was raising more than half a million dollars annually. Despite serving the community as a doctor and educator the busy mother now of four could not help wondering if she should try to gain influence over how Canada addressed the big-picture systemic issues that affected health and wellness. In 2010 Philpott met with Paul Martin over coffee then in 2011 when the Conservative government secured a majority government Philpott decided to join the Liberal Party of Canada. In September 2013 she announced her plans to step down as the chief of family medicine at the Markham Stouffville Hospital to enter federal politics. On April 9 2014 she became the Liberal candidate for the Ontario riding of Markham–Stouffville. On October 19 2015 she was elected as a federal member of a new Parliament with a Liberal majority. Shortly after Philpott was sworn in as Canada’s first health minister in 80 years to have a medical background.As a member of cabinet Philpott played a leading role in several of the Liberal Party’s initiatives. Some of the initiatives were direct extensions of Philpott’s role as a physician and Minister of Health: for example legislating a balanced approach to medical assistance in dying and negotiating an accord with new resources for mental health and home care. Other initiatives such as reforming child welfare to reduce the over-apprehension of Indigenous children and improving infrastructure for First Nations to provide clean water on reserves reflected Philpott’s commitments to social health. Philpott was also actively involved in the Liberal Party’s efforts to bring Syrian refugees to Canada.The political party Philpott joined was supposed to be above self-serving power plays. As Vanity Fair noted in 2017 Trudeau was elected because he was widely seen as a champion of good governance and gender equality one capable of “providing hope and delight” in dark times. But the attempt to influence Wilson-Raybould’s decision making as attorney general called into question this commitment. THE SNC-LAVALIN AFFAIRThe SNC-Lavalin affair was widely seen as the straw that broke the back of Trudeau’s much-hyped brand. As Don Martin host of CTV’s daily political program Power Play put it “The unicorn-mounted prince lies bleeding on the rainbow surrounded by dark and stormy clouds.” The crisis was triggered in September 2018 when Kathleen Roussel Canada’s director of public prosecutions informed the Attorney General that SNC-Lavalin would not be invited to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. Instead Roussel would be proceeding to trial charging SNC-Lavalin with the criminal offences of corruption and fraud in relation to business dealings in Libya. At the time SNC-Lavalin was Canada’s largest engineering and construction firm by revenue with over 50000 employees operating in more than 150 countries worldwide. But the company had faced an uncertain future since 2015 when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police the Canadian national police service and an agency of the Ministry of Public Safety Canada filed criminal charges alleging SNC-Lavalin had paid about $50 million in bribes to influence government decisions in Libya between 2001 and 2011. SNC-Lavalin and two of its subsidiaries were also charged with defrauding Libyan organizations of about $130 million. If convicted in a criminal trial the company could lose the ability to bid on federal government business for 10 years potentially costing the company billions in forgone revenue. The loss could weaken SNC-Lavalin’s case for remaining a Canadian company along with its global competitiveness. To mitigate this risk SNC-Lavalin had cleaned house—senior executives had departed and an aggressive campaign to improve ethics and compliance at all levels of the company had been initiated—and it lobbied Ottawa to introduce out-of-court settlements known as deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) into the Canadian legal system. Critics of DPAs insisted they were akin to “get out of jail free cards.” Proponents like former Canadian finance minister John Manley saw DPAs as an alternative means of “punishing the guilty without hurting others who have done nothing wrong.” A remediated settlement would not release the accused company from penalty: if the company qualified for and was granted a DPA the company would have to accept responsibility for the wrong demonstrate that it had taken efforts to ensure the same offences would not be committed again relinquish any benefit gained from the wrong pay a significant financial penalty and if appropriate and possible make reparation to the initial victims of the bribery or fraud.  In SNC-Lavalin’s case the company’s new management team positioned an out-of-court settlement to be in the public interest because it would allow the company to survive and continue to contribute to the Canadian economy while making amends for the misdeeds of former executives without further victimizing innocent employees and other stakeholders including suppliers and pensioners. In its brief to federal officials the company argued “It is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods.” Fair or not according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) almost 80 per cent of corruption cases concluded under its anti-bribery convention worldwide had been settled out of court. DPAs were widely considered “a pragmatic and efficient way to resolve cases that would otherwise require tremendous time and resources to investigate and prosecute before reaching a court.”Following public consultations with many stakeholders (e.g. industry associations current and potential suppliers to the Government of Canada professional organizations civil society organizations non-governmental organizations justice sector stakeholders and provinces and territories) the federal government introduced DPAs to Canada as a small part of the government’s larger 2018 budget legislation. The DPA was to be used at the discretion of prosecutors who would consider a number of factors to determine whether a company was eligible for a DPA such as whether the company impeded or attempted to avoid an investigation or self-disclosed the offence; the nature and gravity of the offence and its impact on the victim (bodily harm or a threat to national security automatically disqualified a company); and how involved senior officers had been and whether the company had taken disciplinary action and attempted remediation.After overhauling its management board and compliance procedures SNC-Lavalin was widely expected to become the first Canadian company to negotiate a settlement under the new legal regime. However Roussel had determined that SNC-Lavalin did not meet the requirements for an out-of-court settlement and instead would remain where it started with the charges in 2015—on the path to a criminal trial. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) was concerned that SNC-Lavalin was being forced to face a trial that could according to the Prime Minister put the jobs of 9000 Canadian employees at risk. They wanted to know why the DPA was not being used and they wanted to be sure that all relevant information had been considered in making that decision. Wilson-Raybould as attorney general was the only person in the Trudeau administration with the authority to question prosecutorial decisions. PMO staff other ministers and their staff and senior public servants started pressing Wilson-Raybould to use expert external council to review the SNC-Lavalin case and determine whether a negotiated settlement would be lawful and in the public interest. Wilson-Raybould declined to do this making it clear that she had decided not to interfere with Roussel’s office and that requests that she do so because elections were approaching amounted to inappropriate political interference. She explained that the legal service of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada was supposed to be above politics and economics. Wilson-Raybould’s position eventually led Michael Wernick Clerk of the Privy Council the most senior civil servant to warn Wilson-Raybould that she was on a collision course with Trudeau: So the [prime minister] wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within [a] legitimate toolbox to try to head [SNC leaving Canada] off. So he is quite determined quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that. According to members of the opposition—who called for Trudeau’s resignation—the government clearly committed a criminal act by trying to obstruct justice. But according to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony she was not asked to abandon the prosecution just to review the matter and determine whether a negotiated settlement could be pursued. These requests in her expert legal opinion were not criminal but were inappropriate due to the political motivations behind them. The generally accepted relationship between an attorney general and other cabinet members was described by Sir Hartley Shawcross in 1951 when the former attorney general of England statedI think the true doctrine is that it is the duty of an Attorney-General in deciding whether or not to authorize the prosecution to acquaint himself with all the relevant facts including for instance the effect which the prosecution successful or unsuccessful as the case may be would have upon public morale and order and with any other considerations affecting public policy.In order so to inform himself he may although I do not think he is obliged to consult with any of his colleagues in the Government; and indeed as Lord Simon once said he would in some cases be a fool if he did not. On the other hand the assistance of his colleagues is confined to informing him of particular considerations which might affect his own decision and does not consist and must not consist in telling him what that decision ought to be. The responsibility for the eventual decision rests with the Attorney-General and he is not to be put and is not put under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.Known as the Shawcross principle this doctrine was used by observers both to support Wilson-Raybould’s position and to attack her for refusing to be open to accepting external advice. Wilson-Raybould did “the standard practice of undertaking further internal work and due diligence in relation to the [prosecutor’s] decision” a practice she had employed for other similar situations. She had also spoken with a former justice minister Kim Campbell who had faced a similar situation during her tenure as attorney general. Nevertheless government officials came to her on several occasions and expressed concern over the economic impact of a criminal trial and a possible conviction. But as far as Wilson-Raybould was concerned the issue was simple: as justice minister and attorney general she had decided to respect the independence of Roussel’s office and concluded that a review of the file was not warranted. Wilson-Raybould alleged that she was removed from her position as justice minister and placed in the portfolio of veterans affairs after resisting political attempts to change her mind—attempts that she felt threatened the independence and integrity of the justice system because they were being made by people within the government seeking “to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.” DECISION TIMEPhilpott was not directly involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair but she was a member of cabinet and therefore considered a member of Trudeau’s team. Still few people would attack Philpott if she had decided to remain in cabinet. After all in the United States at the time the Trump administration was full of honourable individuals who were biting their tongues in public in order to serve the public good as insiders with influence countering their leader’s questionable decisions. Outside Canada the SNC-Lavalin scandal was labelled as almost trivial especially when compared to allegations faced at the time by US president Donald Trump. “There’s no money no sex and nothing illegal happened. This is what passes for a scandal in Canada” pointed out an Associated Press report. Even within Canada many people had a hard time seeing a major scandal because as lawyer Brian Greenspan put it “the prosecutorial function does not operate in a vacuum in isolation and immune from debate discussion and indeed persuasion.”“Maybe I am just jaded” said Scott Reid. That was the disclaimer the former senior advisor to Paul Martin offered after he noted that the SNC-Lavalin affair was just “a political controversy as opposed to a criminal/legal matter.” In Reid’s view the issue was less serious in terms of alleged transgressions than the scandal endured by the previous Conservative government when Senator Mike Duffy was charged with fraud breach of trust and bribery following a scandal over his expense claims. And the SNC-Lavalin affair was “not even close to the sponsorship scandal” that had helped end the Liberal Party’s previous hold on power. But Philpott was not a veteran of old-school politics so her litmus test for wrongdoing did not require a criminal act. And she had not given up her medical career to help Trudeau sell a false promise to be different. “Unfortunately the evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me” Philpott wrote in her resignation letter.The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system. It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. Sadly I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.Philpott was not raised to be a quitter. A profile following her induction into her high school’s roll of distinguished alumni noted that Philpott did not avoid a challenge just because it appeared too big to defeat. When fighting the seeming intractability of Africa’s problems as a missionary Philpott urged others not to give up by quoting a West African proverb: “The river may be wide but it can be crossed.” However remaining on Trudeau’s team would signal to Canadians that she supported the government’s actions. In fact the constitutional convention of cabinet solidarity would have her duty bound to speak in support of the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair even if she disagreed with the government’s statements or thought they were false.When all was said and done Philpott concluded it was “untenable” for her to continue to serve as a cabinet minister after having “lost confidence” in how the government dealt with the SNC-Lavalin affair. But the price of standing on principle would be high. Resigning would not just cost her the very influence over public policy that Paul Martin had convinced her was worth pursuing. While she would remain a member of parliament her declaration would threaten her position in the Liberal government not to mention her chances of being re-elected. Her resignation would also add fuel to a scandal being exploited by the Conservative Party. In other words if Philpott decided to resign on principle the decision could help put in place a new government that didn’t share her Liberal values threatening the future of everyone remaining in the Liberal caucus including more than a dozen other female politicians who had made history along with Philpott and Wilson-Raybould when Trudeau appointed them to Canada’s first gender-equal cabinet.Was Philpott’s decision to resign over principles the right decision?Endnotes

Armour was a Canadian Red Cross-certified lifeguard who had been providing swimming lessons and lifeguarding services to families in her hometown of Burlington Ontario Canada for the past six years. Armour had been operating her business formally for the past two years under the SSA brand. She had recently graduated from the Management and Organizational Studies program at Brescia University College in London Ontario and she wanted to evaluate the possibility of expanding her business. She wondered if the business could provide her with an income comparable to what she would make if she pursued a career as an entry-level marketing professional. She was a passionate business owner and loved serving the needs of families in her community. To determine whether her compensation goal was attainable she wanted to assess geographic and service-delivery expansion options for SSA. Her profitability goal was CA$50000. Canadian Youth Sports IndustryAccording to a research report published by KidSport Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) 7 in 10 Canadians believed it was very or extremely important for children to participate in organized sport. Organized sport typically included team sports or structured physical recreational activities pre-scheduled at regular intervals where participants were required to pay a fee. Other findings from the report revealed that Canadians acknowledged the importance of organized sport to children’s overall well-being in addition to its health benefits; 84 per cent of respondents said sports participation was an essential part of a child’s social development and 80 per cent said it was an essential part of a child’s emotional development. Of those surveyed 91 per cent believed that sports participation taught children important life skills and 85 per cent agreed that sports participation built stronger communities.A report from the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute revealed that 75 per cent of 5- to 19-year-olds participated in organized physical activities and sports. In addition Canadian families spent an average of $953 annually for a child to play in organized sport and 79 per cent of parents reported contributing financially to their children’s physical activity through purchasing items such as equipment and membership fees. Sport participants were more likely to be found in higher household income categories than in lower household income categories. Soccer (38 per cent) was the most common sport played by children followed by swimming (22 per cent) and basketball (18 per cent). The organized sports in which parents most wanted their children to participate included soccer swimming and either baseball softball or T-ball. Swimming LessonsMany parents enrolled their children in swimming lessons because they viewed learning to swim as an essential life skill. Since children would find themselves in situations where they would be around water (for example on school and family trips) parents wanted their children to be confident and safe. Benefits of swimming lessons included: physical health improvements such as building strength stamina and flexibility without putting pressure on bones and joints; challenges and rewards that improved self-confidence; and personal growth and leadership opportunities. Another advantage of swimming lessons over most other sports was that children of any age or ability could participate.The most important factor for parents enrolling their children in lessons was time of day and the number one reason for ending lessons was that families were busy with other activities; this suggested that parents wanted as much flexibility as possible. When it came to cost most parents reported that swimming lessons were inexpensive compared to the other activities in which their children participated. Finally many parents believed that lesson regularity—that is taking lessons every day for two weeks in the summer season rather than once a week in other seasons—gave their children a significant learning advantage.COMPANY HISTORYArmour started teaching backyard swimming lessons to the children of three neighbours in the summer of 2011. Each year she gained more clients through word of mouth and referrals and her clients were satisfied with the quality of instruction she provided and the convenience of the service she offered. Armour decided to formally launch SSA in the summer of 2015 after creating a complete business plan as a requirement for a course she was taking as part of a degree in management and organizational studies. In 2015 Armour successfully secured a $2000 student opportunity grant from Brescia University College and a $3000 summer company program grant through the Halton Region Small Business Centre to formally launch the company. This money helped to support website design insurance coverage a business computer and start-up equipment.CURRENT OPERATIONSSSA was organized as a sole proprietorship and offered 2 core services: private swimming lessons and pool party lifeguarding services. Swimming lessons were offered in 5- and 10-lesson packages at a cost of $150 for 5 lessons and $250 for 10 lessons. Lifeguarding services for private pool parties were becoming a common request; SSA charged $25 per hour with a 2-hour minimum commitment.Swimming lesson registration began in March of each year and full payment for the lessons was collected as they were scheduled. Registration scheduling and pricing details were available on SSA’s website which was the company’s main communication tool. Armour had been extremely accommodating to clients over the past two years even if that meant that she or one of her instructors had to drive across the city to get from one lesson to the next. However she was considering a change to scheduling for 2017 so that she could have more flexibility to schedule efficiently based on instructor location. Clients would be asked to complete an availability form rather than request a specific time.The main drivers for client registrations and lifeguard-service bookings were referrals and word-of-mouth recommendations from local parents. Armour also advertised with the Halton Region Small Business Centre and in the Burlington Post and she had conducted a door-hanger flyer campaign in select residential areas of Burlington.In 2015 Armour had been the sole instructor; she had enjoyed being able to completely control service quality but by the end of the summer she realized she needed to make a change for the next season. Demand had outstripped supply. In addition to providing lessons or lifeguarding parties for 10 to 12 hours per day every day she put in additional hours managing communications scheduling and new bookings. She knew there was potential to grow the business and by the second year she had retained the services of 3 contract instructors at a cost of $20 per hour for both instruction and lifeguarding services. Armour continued to instruct and provide lifeguarding services herself and put in approximately 60 hours per week which left her more time to manage the day-to-day operations of the business. She was successful in securing a starter-company program grant of $5000 for the 2016 season which provided the company with much-needed funding and business support. In 2016 SSA served approximately 100 clients and had approximately 8 to 10 clients on the waiting list at any given time. Net income had grown by over 90 per cent from fiscal 2015 levels (see Exhibit 1). Since the business operated on a cash basis and had no outstanding receivables or payables at the end of the year the net income reported was equivalent to the cash generated and was available for Armour’s compensation.COMPETITIONSwimming lessons services were available through multiple providers in the city of Burlington. The city itself offered lessons at its 4 indoor and 2 outdoor pools starting with parent-and-tot programs and moving up to advanced leadership courses. The lesson sessions usually lasted 8 to 10 weeks and lessons started at various dates throughout the year. The ratio of teacher to students varied from 1:12 for parent-and-tot lessons to 1:6 for Red Cross levels 1through 6 and 1:8 for Red Cross levels 7 through 10. The cost for Red Cross lessons increased with the level: the highest cost for levels 7 through 10 was approximately $95 for 10 lessons. Although private and semi-private lessons were available through the city there was limited availability for these. For semi-private lessons parents had to find a child with similar ability who was available at the same time. Semi-private lessons cost $139 per child for a series of 5 lessons. City lesson registrations filled quickly and there were often waiting lists for popular times.The Ron Edwards Family YMCA location in Burlington had an indoor pool and offered swimming instruction for all ages. The YMCA did not offer the Red Cross program but had its own comparable program. The YMCA lessons were offered as “family” lessons where all children within a family could take their lessons at the same time regardless of their swim level. Once a family had registered for a specific time they could keep that time as the children progressed to new levels unless the family requested a switch. A YMCA membership was required to access swimming lessons: a family membership cost $438 per adult plus a $100 building fee annually and a membership for a child under 12 years old cost $282 annually under this family membership.AquaMobile Swim School (AquaMobile) had been in operation for over 10 years and provided the same at-home private swim lessons and lifeguarding services that SSA offered. It originally began offering services in the Greater Toronto Area and had since expanded to British Columbia and multiple states in the United States. Interested parents filled out an online form and were then connected to a local instructor who would set up backyard lesson times. Swimming instruction for children from 6 months to 3 years was priced at $48 per 40-minute lesson and 1-hour lessons for those aged 6 months to adult were priced from $65 per hour (this cost could be split between multiple students). Lifeguarding services were available for $60 per guard per hour. At this point Armour was not aware of an AquaMobile presence in Burlington but the city of Oakville and other cities west of Toronto were listed on its website.In addition to instruction through formal services and locations swimming lessons were also available through many instructors who operated independently serving neighbours and family friends as Armour had when she started. These service providers varied in terms of quality of instruction and pricing; however they offered parents the convenience of swimming lessons in their own backyard.2017 SEASONArmour planned to make a number of changes to operations in 2017 independent of any expansion decision. The prices for lessons would increase to $175 for 5 lessons $300 for 10 lessons and $500 for a 20 lessons. In addition lifeguarding rates would be $45 per hour with the same 2-hour minimum commitment. She did not plan any changes to instruction or lifeguarding compensation. Armour also wanted to require all clients to pay in advance using PayPal which charged a service fee of approximately 2.9 per cent.Regardless of any expansion plan Armour believed that swimming lesson and lifeguarding sales in Burlington for 2017 would increase by half the growth rate between fiscal years (FY) 2015 and 2016 and she was not expecting to apply for any grants in 2017. For projection purposes she wanted to estimate an average lesson-price increase of 15 per cent. She also planned to cap her instruction hours at 40 hours per week and she would hire out all lifeguarding bookings.EXPANSION OPTIONSArmour was anxious to investigate the feasibility of expanding SSA’s operations to increase both the number of clients served and the company’s bottom line. The two opportunities she was considering included expanding to neighbouring cities and running her business year-round by renting space at an indoor pool.Neighbouring City ExpansionSSA already had clients in the neighbouring city of Oakville and in the towns of Waterdown and Dundas so Armour was considering a formal expansion into one or more of those locations. From her business plan research Armour knew that there were approximately 6800 backyard pools in the city of Burlington out of a total of 71373 private dwellings. Although the city of Oakville was unwilling to provide her with their estimate of the number of backyard pools she did find that Oakville had a population of 193832 and 66269 private dwellings. Waterdown and Dundas were smaller communities with populations of approximately 111065 and 113024 respectively and 38111 and 44962 private dwellings respectively. Armour believed that the target expansion city and towns would have approximately the same percentage of pools per dwelling as Burlington and she estimated that SSA would be able to capture half the percentage of market share she held in Burlington in FY 2016. For projection purposes Armour felt it was appropriate to assume that most people would purchase 10-lesson packages; she also estimated that 20 per cent of her expansion-city clients would make one lifeguarding-party booking.If Armour were to expand into one or more of these areas she would see increases to advertising and promotion costs of approximately $500 per location and equipment costs of $250 per location. In addition she would need to cut back the hours she instructed to no more than 30 hours per week for the 10-week season to be able to manage the growth. She was pleasantly surprised to learn that her current insurance policy would cover this expansion plan.Year-Round OperationsMany clients asked Armour to offer indoor lessons in other seasons so that their children could maintain and continue to improve their skills. Armour had identified a facility at a private school in Oakville less than a 20-minute drive from Burlington which she could rent at a cost of $160 per hour. If Armour were to pursue this option she would consider renting the facility for 2 weeknights—from 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.—and Saturday mornings from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Given the size of the pool 4 different lessons with 4 different instructors could be held at the same time. Lessons would be 30 minutes in length and would take place over a 10-week session and prices would be consistent with those for the 2017 season. If Armour pursued this option she would communicate her plans to her existing client base so advertising costs would not change; however supplies and equipment costs would be $250. Again insurance costs would not increase; Armour’s insurance broker was able to quote the same premium for the additional indoor lesson coverage since Armour would be purchasing a full-year policy.CONCLUSIONTo reach a decision Armour knew she needed to assess the alternatives qualitatively and project income statements to determine the conditions under which she could reach her profitability goal of $50000. Since SSA primarily operated on a cash basis with no receivables or payables the net income was a good proxy for the cash generated which she could use to compensate herself and keep a small cash balance.

Whereas many popular statistical analyses (e.g. linear regression logistic regression and artificial neural networks) provide probabilities forecasts or predicted values survival analysis can provide not only the probability of an event of interest occurring but also the time at which the event is likely to occur. At its core survival analysis is concerned with the survival of a sample (e.g. patients machinery customers) past certain points in time.The ability to predict if and when an event will occur has profound implications for organizations and has proven to be useful in many settings. Not only does this field of statistics enable analysis of the expected duration of time until an event happens but also certain types of survival analysis enable the study of other factors that may contribute to the likelihood of event occurrence. For example parametric survival models can help answer the following questions:How do a banking customer�s credit score and account balance affect the probability of default?How does the amount of ambulation (i.e. walking about) and sleep affect a patient�s recovery time after a medical procedure?How do age and length of service affect voluntary employee attrition?Imagine being able to tell when customers are likely to cancel their services when an assembly line machine is likely to break down or when a patient is likely to experience a recurrence of a disease. Given this information one would likely take preventative measures to mitigate the risk of these events happening over both the short term and the long term. Consequently survival analysis has found applications in banking telecommunications health care hospitality and a multitude of other industries. The topic is referred to by different names when applied to different disciplines. For example it is known as event history analysis in sociology duration analysis in economics and reliability analysis in engineering.One distinct advantage of survival analysis is its ability to handle censoring�a problem that hampers the use of traditional statistical techniques such as linear regression. Censoring refers to the situation when the value of an observation is only partially known. For example it is not uncommon to encounter datasets that have missing values. Missing data can occur for various reasons including nonresponse or participant attrition prior to the conclusion of a study. With classical statistical analyses such as linear regression missing data are commonly addressed in two ways: deletion or imputation. Listwise deletion is an approach where an entire data record is excluded from analysis when any single data value is missing. Pairwise deletion involves excluding a record when it is missing a data value that is required for a specific type of analysis but including it in analyses for which all required variables are available. Imputation is the process of replacing missing data values with substituted values such as replacing a missing value with the last observed value or the mean of the variable. These methods while helpful are not always ideal as they can result in incomplete analyses and introduce bias particularly when the dataset is relatively small. By using survival analysis however it is possible to include censored observations and maintain the sample size.Consider for instance a study in which disease recurrence is being observed (see Exhibit 1). If a patient leaves the study prior to a time of interest t it cannot be determined whether the disease recurred in that patient and if it recurred when it did so. The only inference that can be made is that if the disease recurs it will happen at a time after the patient left the study. Also at time t the only conclusion that can be drawn for those patients in which the disease has not yet recurred is that if the disease recurs it will happen after time t. In Exhibit 1 patients 4 and 6 are censored at the time they leave the study and patients 1 2 and 7 are censored at time t. These five patients are examples of right-censoring when all that is known is that a data point (in this case time of disease recurrence) is greater than a certain value but the difference between the data point and the value is unknown. Left-censoring is when a data point is known to be less than a certain value but again the difference between the data point and the value is unknown. An example of left-censoring is the disease recurring in a patient between regular checkpoints (see Exhibit 2). The time of recurrence is known to be greater than one value and less than another value but the exact value of the data point is unknown.This note explores some different applications of survival analysis and introduces two popular modelling approaches: the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox proportional hazards model. Instructions are also provided on how to build these two survival models in Microsoft Excel without add-ins.Applications of Survival AnalysisThe term �survival analysis� was coined from initial studies on the subject matter in medicine wherein the event of interest was death. Researchers assessed the efficacy of medical treatments by monitoring the survival times of patients who had received the treatments.Today the scope of survival analysis has expanded and now encompasses a range of applications and analytical techniques. Outside of the medical context survival analysis is broadly applicable as it can be employed in any situation that involves time and an event of interest (e.g. structural or mechanical failure onset of disease or mortgage default). To date many organizations have used survival analysis to increase competitiveness improve operations and defend against market threats.Unicru an American software company founded in 1987 and acquired in 2006 by Kronos is one such company that has embraced analytical techniques to bolster its value proposition and transform its customers� internal processes. The company specializes in a line of human resources software that evaluates applicant suitability through personality tests. Unicru�s analytic research group has also developed techniques to estimate customers� future recruitment requirements. When employees are first hired it is generally unknown how long they will remain in that employment. Thus forecasting future hiring requirements to replace departing employees is difficult. However by analyzing variables embedded in its clients� payroll data Unicru can analyze the survival of its clients� hires providing clients with the ability to estimate their employee replacement rates.On the non-commercial side a year-long study of four U.S. hospital emergency departments examined the effects of crowding on treatment time and length of stay. The study employed discrete-time survival analysis in which time is not treated as a continuous variable but is divided into discrete units to describe the relationship between the response variable (i.e. the timeliness of emergency care) and the explanatory variables (i.e. the number of patients waiting the number being treated the number boarding and the inpatient occupancy rate). The study concluded that crowding has a deleterious effect on care delivery and patient outcomes delaying the care of high-acuity (i.e. high-risk) patients and substantially delaying patients� waiting times and boarding times.Researchers at the University of M�laga in Spain also conducted a study that employed survival analysis techniques. The study presented findings based on survival analysis of the Spanish hotel industry. Survival of hotels in Spain is particularly relevant given that the total contribution of tourism to Spain�s gross domestic product (GDP) is significant relative to other countries. For example in 2015 tourism comprised 14.2 per cent of Spanish GDP. By comparison tourism made up 2.6 per cent of 2015 GDP in the United Kingdom 9.1 per cent in France 8.0 per cent in the United States and 6.2 per cent in Canada. Parametric survival analysis was conducted to examine the influence of different variables on hotel survivability. The study concluded that hotel survival depends on the hotel�s location size management and whether the hotel was launched during a time of economic prosperity. Variables that were determined to be insignificant in predicting hotel survival included hotel type and configuration of financial and economic structures.Survival models provide data analysis practitioners with a host of tools to analyze the probability of the occurrence of an event of interest the time to the event occurrence and the influence of different parameters on outcomes. A particularly useful application of survival analysis is in the area of �customer churn��the loss of clients or customers. In the face of an increasingly globalized economy and intensifying competition customer churn rates have become a major issue in many businesses particularly in telecommunications and financial services. Between 2015 and 2016 49 per cent of Canadians switched to a different retailer bank or telecommunications provider after a poor customer experience. The following sections will explore two different approaches to using survival analysis in Microsoft Excel to examine customer churn: the Kaplan-Meier estimator (non-parametric) and the Cox proportional hazards model (parametric). the Kaplan-Meier Analysis: A Non-Parametric ApproachThe Kaplan-Meier analysis also known as the Kaplan-Meier estimator or product limit estimator is a non-parametric approach to estimating the survival function of a population. The survival function  is defined as the probability that an object of interest (e.g. a patient customer or product) will survive beyond a certain point in time . A survival function is in theory a smooth curve. With Kaplan-Meier analysis the survival function is approximated using a plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimator (see Exhibit 3) which given a large enough sample size approaches the true survival function of the population being modelled. The Kaplan-Meier plot for small samples is not smooth but rather step-like because it has insufficient data points to create a smooth curve. Instead the curve is approximated by straight-line segments using a step chart.Edward Kaplan and Paul Meier jointly developed this method as a technique to estimate patient survival rates while accounting for three outcomes: some patients will die during the clinical trial others will not complete the trial and some will survive beyond the end of the trial. This simple and efficient method was first presented in a 1958 article in the Journal of the American Statistical Association and has since been credited with providing �doctors a simple statistical way of judging which treatments work best . . . [saving] millions of lives.� Today the application of Kaplan-Meier analysis extends well beyond the field of medicine and has been used to study for example the length of unemployment after job loss.A key benefit to using the Kaplan-Meier estimator is its simplicity. As the goal is to estimate a population�s survival over time only two pieces of data are needed: the status of the last observation (i.e. whether the event of interest occurred or whether the record should be right-censored) and the time to the event or the censoring. If a comparison of survival between two or more groups is required then a third piece of data is needed: the group assignments of the various records.However the Kaplan-Meier analysis is limited in its ability to adjust survival estimates in the presence of predictive variables (i.e. covariates). Also the precision of the survival estimates is dependent on the number of observations. As the study proceeds and observations are excluded either because they are censored or the event of interest has occurred estimation precision declines.Once plotted a Kaplan-Meier curve allows estimation of the probability of survival over time.How to Build a Kaplan-Meier Survival Model in Microsoft ExcelThe steps enumerated below can be used in Microsoft Excel to produce an estimator of the survival function of any population provided the values in the dataset indicate whether the event of interest happened (or whether the observation should be censored) and if so when the event of interest happened. The steps will also provide instructions for producing a Kaplan-Meier plot.The figures below were created using a publicly available telecommunications customer churn dataset furnished by the Machine Learning Repository at the University of California Irvine.Open the dataset in Microsoft Excel and identify the columns that contain the time and survival data. In the dataset shown below the columns in question are labelled �Account Length� and �Churned?�In a new worksheet copy and paste the column containing time data (i.e. �Account Length�) into column A. Label this column with the heading �Period t.� To produce a data table that can be used to plot a Kaplan-Meier curve each row needs to represent a unique time period. In other words deduplication of the time data (i.e. the elimination of duplicated time data) is required. Click anywhere in column A and in the ribbon click on Data > Data Tools > Remove Duplicates.After the duplicates have been removed sort the data in ascending order (i.e. in the ribbon click on Home > Editing > Sort & Filter > Sort Smallest to Largest) and add a row for time 0 at the top of the column below the column label.Create in order the following columns next to the �Period t� column:# of Customers# Churned# Censored# of Remaining CustomersSurvival RateSurvival Function S(t)In cell B2 under �# of Customers� provide the total number of subjects in the study at time 0 by counting the number of rows in the original dataset. This task can be accomplished in Excel using the COUNTA function which counts the number of non-empty cells in the range of cells selected. In our example the unprocessed dataset is stored in a worksheet labelled �Data.� Using the function =COUNTA(Data!$A$2:$A$5001) results in a count of all non-empty cells in the �State� column of the dataset.In cell E2 type = $B2-$C2 to indicate that the number of remaining customers is the difference between the number of customers at the beginning of the period and the number of customers that have churned.In cell F2 type = $E2/$B2. The survival rate is the proportion of surviving customers at the end of the period to the number of customers at the beginning of the period.In cell G2 type = $F2.In cell B3 type = $E2-$D3 to represent that the number of customers at the beginning of the period is the number of customers at the end of the previous period less those customers that have been censored.In cell C3 count those customers that not only churned but churned in time period 1. Counting based on multiple criteria can be accomplished in Excel using the COUNTIFS function which allows the use of multiple criteria counting only those records for which all of the criteria evaluate as true. In cell C3 type = COUNTIFS(Data!$B$2:$B$5001$A3Data!$U$2:$U$5001""= yes""). This command counts the number of records in the dataset that have an �Account Length� value of 1 and churned in period 1 (which is denoted by a value of �yes� in the �Churned?� column).In cell D3 type = COUNTIFS(Data!$B$2:$B$5001$A3Data!$U$2:$U$5001""= no""). This command counts the number of records in the dataset that have an �Account Length� value of 1 and did not churn in period 1 (which is denoted by a value of �no� in the �Churned?� column).Copy and paste the formulas from cells E2 and F2 into cells E3 and F3 respectively to calculate the number of remaining customers and survival rate at time 1.In cell G3 type = $G2*$F3 since the probability of survival past time 1 is the product of the survival rates at all times less than or equal to 1. See Exhibit 4 for a summary of all Excel formulas used thus far.Click and drag to select cells B3 to G3. Copy the formulas through the rest of the table by double-clicking (when the cursor turns to a black + symbol) on the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the selected cells.The result is a table of the estimated survival function that can be used to plot a Kaplan-Meier survival curve.How to Plot a Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve in Microsoft ExcelTo create the step chart for the survival function values obtained in the preceding section some quick data manipulation is needed so that the data are in a format that can be easily charted by Excel.Copy and paste the �Period t� and �Survival Function S(t)� columns into columns I and J. Use Excel�s Paste Values feature to avoid copying the Excel formulas.In column K give each of the rows a numerical identifier starting with 1 in K2. Double-click on the fill handle to quickly populate each row. If all cells are populated with a value of 1 click on the Auto Fill Options at the bottom of the column and select Fill Series.Excluding time 0 copy all of the time periods in column I (range I3:I285 in the screenshot below). Append these values to the end of the column I.Excluding the last row copy the survival function values and the numerical identifiers (range J2:K284 in the screenshot below). Append these values to the end of columns J and K.Sort the resultant table in ascending order using the numerical identifiers (column K).Select the data in columns I and J. Create a step chart: in the ribbon click on Insert > Charts > Insert Scatter or Bubble Chart > Scatter with Straight Lines.The result is a plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimator (see Exhibit 3) for the survival of the study population over time. The information in this plot facilitates estimation of the probability of survival.The plot obtained can provide insights into the study population and facilitate decision-making. For example in the chart shown in Exhibit 3 it appears that approximately 70 per cent of customers remain with the firm beyond 200 weeks and approximately 50 per cent remain beyond 250 weeks. Using this information the firm can then formulate strategies for customer retention based on survival probabilities. Note that the chart ends abruptly at week 315 due to censoring (which was caused by the end of data collection).the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis: A Parametric ApproachThe Cox proportional hazards model (or Cox model) developed and published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 1972 is one of the most popular models for performing survival analysis. Its inventor British statistician Sir David Cox was subsequently awarded the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation�s 1990 Charles F. Kettering Prize for his application of the model in analyzing data from cancer clinical trials. The methodology based on the Cox model �allow[ed] medical investigators to assess and rank with critical accuracy the individual and combined effects of treatment and other factors on the results of clinical trials.� As with linear and logistic regression the Cox regression model is used to analyze the effects of predictive covariates on outcomes. However as previously mentioned use of traditional regression techniques is not suitable in the analysis of survival data due to the presence of censored data. In addition survival times are usually positive a constraint that might not be accounted for by classical linear regression without first transforming the data. Lastly the Cox model assumes a nonlinear relationship between covariates and the independent variable which linear regression is not equipped to do.The Cox regression is used to predict the value of the hazard function (or hazard rate) at time . The hazard function is a measure of the risk that the event of interest will occur at time  provided the object of interest has survived up to time .The Cox model assumes a hazard function for an object of interest  at time  . The overall function is the product of a baseline hazard function  and a function of the covariates . Thus the hazard function is given by:Hazard ratios are also helpful in survival analysis. The hazard ratio is a measure of relative risk and is the ratio of two hazard rates corresponding to two different observations. The hazard ratio quantifies how much more likely an object of interest is to experience the event of interest over another object at a particular time.Of particular importance is the hazard ratio comparing object  to the baseline hazard function as it simplifies to a function of the regression coefficients and the covariates:In other words the natural log of the hazard ratio for object  is a linear equation.The concept of hazard ratios can be applied to churn analysis allowing analysts to determine which customers the business is most likely to lose. To rectify the situation and retain the identified customers proactive measures can then be taken in advance of the customers� cancellation.See Exhibit 5 for additional details on hazard ratios the hazard function and the survival function in the Cox model.How to Build a Cox Proportional Hazards Model in Microsoft ExcelUsing the customer churn dataset the steps below describe how to calculate Cox regression coefficients in Microsoft Excel. A method for computing the hazard ratios for all of the customers in the dataset is then provided allowing analysis and comparison of the relative risk of churn across the customer portfolio.To successfully execute the steps below it is necessary to load the Solver Add-in in Microsoft Excel. The Solver Add-in is a default component of a standard Microsoft Excel installation.Open the dataset in Microsoft Excel and determine the variables whose effects on churn you want to analyze. Note that data can be manipulated to create variables that you think may be suitable for analysis. In this example the total customer charges (i.e. total day charges total evening charges total night charges and total international charges) were summed into a single variable for analysis. Also the effect of the number of customer service calls is analyzed.Starting in column W create the following four columns beside the dataset:Account Length (t)Total Charges (x1)Customer Service Calls (x2)Churn IndicatorUnder �Account Length (t)� set the cell values to be equal to the age of the account (under the �Account Length� column). Under the �Total Charges (x1)� column sum all of the customer charges using the SUM function. Under �Customer Service Calls (x2)� set the cell values to be equal to the �Number Customer Service Calls� column. Under �Churn Indicator� set the cell values to 1 if the customer churned and 0 if otherwise using the IF function.Copy and paste these formulas so that each customer (row) has values for the age of the account the total charges the total number of customer service calls and a binary churn indicator.Copy the data and replace the formulas under columns W to Z with only the data values using Excel�s Paste Values feature.Sort the data from low to high using the �Account Length (t)� column.Beside the �Churn Indicator� column create the following three columns:_XEXP(_X)Log LikelihoodThe �_X� column is meant to represent the sum of the products of the regression coefficients and the explanatory variates i.e. . The �EXP(_X)� column is meant to represent  raised to the power of  or equivalently . As previously mentioned the latter calculation is equivalent to the hazard ratio comparing observation  with the baseline hazard function.Similar to logistic regression regression coefficients in the Cox model are calculated using maximum likelihood estimation. In the proportional hazards model a method known as partial likelihood is used. Here the log partial likelihood  of the model (represented by the �Log Likelihood� column above) iswhere time is divided into periods  with  representing the start of the study and  representing the time of the last observed event (see Exhibit 5). Note that the coefficients that maximize the partial likelihood function also maximize the log partial likelihood function.Create two cells labelled _1 and _2 to the right of the table to store the regression coefficients. For now fill these cells with 0.The exponent  is to be calculated in the �_X� column. Using Excel�s matrix multiplication formula MMULT you can efficiently multiply the  values (i.e. the �Total Charges (x1)� and �Customer Service Calls (x2)� columns) with the  coefficients in AF3 and AF4. This function is useful when you have many  values and  coefficients.In cell AA2 type =MMULT($X2:$Y2$AF$3:$AF$4) to calculate the exponent term. Equivalently you can also type =$X2*$AF$3+$Y2*$AF$4.In the �EXP(_X)� column it is now possible to calculate  raised to the exponent determined in step 9. In cell AB2 type =EXP(AA2) to obtain the value of .In cell AC2 type =IF(Z2=1AA2-LN(SUM(AB2:AB$5001))0) to effectively obtain the termPropagate these formulas to the rows below by highlighting the range AA2:AC2 and double-clicking on the fill handle.Type the summation formula = SUM($AC$2:$AC$5001) at the bottom of the �Log Likelihood� column to obtain the value of the full log partial likelihood term .As mentioned the goal is to estimate the regression coefficients by maximizing the log likelihood of the model which can be accomplished using Solver. Access Solver by navigating in the ribbon to Data > Analyze > Solver. Set the objective function to the cell containing the sum of the log likelihood terms in step 13. Maximize the objective function by allowing Solver to change the values of the regression coefficients in AF3:AF4. Uncheck the box labelled �Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative� and select �GRG Nonlinear� as the solving method. Click �Solve.�Solver will then change the values of the regression coefficients until it finds the values that maximize the log likelihood of the model. Once the solution is obtained you can see that the value for  has increased from �5284.47615 to �5098.40939. Note also that the regression coefficients are both positive indicating that higher bill amounts and a greater number of customer service calls increase the risk that a customer will churn. In addition the hazard ratios using the calculated coefficients are now available in the �EXP(_X)� column. Recall that the hazard ratio comparing any record  to the baseline hazard function isRecall that hazard ratios are a measure of relative risk and that those subjects with higher hazard ratios are on average more likely to experience the event of interest. Looking at the resultant table it is clear that in general customers that churned have higher hazard ratios which is no surprise. While only two explanatory variates were considered in the above model additional variables can be included in the analysis to further improve the predictive power of the Cox model.The information garnered from the Cox regression analysis can be used to improve decision-making allowing firms to identify and attempt to retain customers who may be on the verge of cancelling their services. Survival Analysis in Microsoft Excel with Add-InsAlthough this note is primarily concerned with the construction of survival models in Microsoft Excel without add-ins several tools can facilitate among other things survival analysis in Excel. These utilities help by accelerating model development automatically calculating pertinent test statistics performing sensitivity analysis and generating relevant plots and curves to visualize results. Below are two such toolkits that bear mentioning.XLSTATXLSTAT available for download at www.xlstat.com is a comprehensive statistical analysis add-in for Microsoft Excel.

The Real Statistics Resource Pack allows users to quickly construct survival models such as Cox regression models (see Exhibit 6) and Kaplan-Meier plots (see Exhibit 7).Exhibit 1: Right-Censoring in a prediction of Disease RecurrenceSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 2: Left-Censoring in a prediction of Disease RecurrenceSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: the Kaplan-Meier Survival PlotA plot of the Kaplan-Meier estimator resembles a set of horizontal steps that models the survival function of a population over time.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 4: Survival Table FormulasSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 5: Cox Proportional Hazards RegressionIn the Cox proportional hazards model the hazard function for object of interest  takes the following form:In this model  are explanatory variates for objects of interest  (e.g. the patient the customer and the machine)  are the coefficients that explain the effect the explanatory variates have on the hazard function and  is the baseline hazard function (the hazard function when all explanatory variables are zero i.e. ).Note that while the hazard function provides the risk that an event occurs specifically at time  it is useful to know the survival function�that is the probability that an object of interest will survive beyond time . The survival function for the proportional hazards model is given below where  is the baseline survival function. with Also helpful in this branch of analysis is the hazard ratio. The hazard ratio is a measure of relative risk and represents the ratio of two hazard rates corresponding to two different observations (i.e. sets of values for explanatory variates). It tells us how much more likely an object of interest is to experience the event of interest over another object at a particular time�the higher the hazard ratio the higher the risk of experiencing the event of interest. The term �proportional hazards� refers to the fact that the hazard of any object is a fixed proportion of any other object in the study. For example the hazard ratio comparing the second subject in a study  to the third subject in the same study  isNote that there is no time component in the hazard ratio above (as the baseline hazard functions in the numerator and denominator cancel out) which means that the objects that are most at risk at a certain point in time are still the objects most at risk at any other time.For example suppose that the observations in question involve the study of employees� voluntary attrition. If the hazard ratio evaluates to 1 then it means that both the second and third employees are equally likely to quit. If the hazard"

For Yu Wang the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Tantan however the day was anything but ordinary. Wang had much to be excited about. Since its introduction last September his nearly one-year-old mobile dating application (app) had attracted more than two million active users and was considered the Chinese equivalent to Tinder a dating app that had gained widespread use in North America. Tantan (literally translated from Mandarin as “scouting around”) had experienced unprecedented growth and had already achieved the milestone of being the second-most popular mobile dating app in China. Wang now had his sights firmly set on wresting first-place bragging rights from the market leader by the end of the following year. The app had gained such widespread popularity that a reality TV show entitled Meeting Your Match was under active consideration for the dating service featuring Mike Sui a famous Chinese actor who had volunteered to play the main role in the show.Yet for all its success (and perhaps because of it) Tantan faced ever-increasing competition from a growing number of competitors—smaller agile players with creative ideas and large acquisition-oriented multinational companies alike—all of whom were expected to make major inroads in the popular mobile dating market in China. The influx of competitive apps not only caused much concern to Wang and the Tantan senior management team it also raised several unnerving questions:Given the innate conservative nature of Chinese society how should Tantan continue to grow its customer base to retain and enhance its presence as a viable mobile dating solution?How could Tantan retain its prime position among the young adults seeking romance in China when its very success resulted in a significant drop or worse yet a cessation in usage?Perhaps most important how could Tantan make itself less vulnerable to the very disruption it had unleashed on the Chinese dating market?MEETING YOUR MATCH IN CHINAMarriage was deeply rooted in Chinese culture and was considered a rigid societal obligation. Traditionally marriage was considered critical for propagating the family lineage. Almost 70 per cent of the Chinese people who married did so between the ages of 25 and 29. The minimum legal marriageable age in China was 20 years for males and 22 for females. Consistent with worldwide trends those in rural areas tended to marry at an earlier age than their urban counterparts. Contemporary Chinese society demonstrated a remarkable schism with respect to gender issues and with the status of women in particular. On the one hand Chinese women were expected to be married by the time they approached their mid- to late 20s thanks to widely held antediluvian mores that they were “most tender like a steak” at that time. Past that point the pool of prospects rapidly shrunk and it became increasingly difficult to find a partner. In fact 90 per cent of women in China were married before reaching the age of 30. An unmarried female in her late 20s was branded as “leftover” and “undesirable” regarded incomplete and considered one of the biggest signs of disrespect to her family. Women who were still single at age 30 were accorded “spinster status.”On the other hand the gender imbalance in China served as a crucial demographic equalizer (see Exhibit 1). Attributed primarily to China’s multi-decade-long one-child policy and the traditional Chinese preference for sons there were 118 males for every 100 females in 2010. The result was a growing number of Chinese men having trouble finding brides. Of all unmarried Chinese people aged 35–39 years old 88 per cent were male whereas 99 per cent of all females aged 30–34 year old were married. By 2020 it was estimated that 30 million men of marrying age would be unable to find a wife allowing women to be more selective in their choice of a marriage or dating partner. Young Chinese adults typically met their significant other through mutual connections that included friends family close and distant relatives co-workers and previous classmates. It was also not uncommon for parents to post a brief description and sometimes even a picture of their son or daughter to publicly accessible bulletin boards and to meet other like-minded parents in public parks with the objective of arranging the nuptials of their adult children. Such “marriage markets” were very popular in China (see Exhibit 2). Evolving societal norms resulted in a greater preference for later marriage typically after reaching the age of 25. Although traditionally divorces had been considered taboo in China by 2014 the annual divorce rate had increased by 3.9 per cent to more than 3.63 million. Many people attributed this accelerated divorce rate to the well-entrenched and increasing adoption of social media across China. It was felt that venues such as Tantan Momo (another location-based dating app) and WeChat (China’s most popular social networking site) made it easier to reach out to people and to indulge in extramarital relationships. Chinese culture remained conservative and therefore it frowned upon casual relationships. This attitude was exemplified by the Ministry of Culture’s clampdown on Momo for allegedly encouraging prostitution. Although sex education in China was officially implemented in 2008 the curriculum was minimal with very little focus on reproductive health and even less on contraception. At least 13 million medical terminations of pregnancy were undertaken annually and 10 million “morning after” pills were sold each year. The impact of mass media on shaping the views around sex could not be understated. Television shows such as Girls and Masters of Sex had shifted previously conservative attitudes catering instead to an urban progressive stance. As the middle class in China continued to grow people in the younger generation were less reliant on their parents and had more buying power. In 1989 only an estimated 15 per cent of young Chinese adults had engaged in sex before marriage. However in 2016 that percentage was estimated to have grown to well above 70 per cent attributed to China’s burgeoning number of dating apps and its cultural transformation in the intervening years. China’s youth were now more likely than not to have engaged in both sex before marriage and casual sexual encounters (“one-night stands”) as premarital and extramarital sex became less taboo. As well a heightened awareness and overall acceptance of homosexuality and LGBT (lesbian gay bisexual and transgender) rights in major cities coupled with the rise of more gay-specific apps such as Grindr Blued and Aloha also resulted in the LGBT community’s greater participation in the online dating scene.The targeted market for online dating apps comprised young Chinese adults between the ages of 20 and 27. During this age range the vast majority of break-ups occurred as college graduates moved to different geographic regions to take up employment frequently leaving behind their established social circles. People born in 1995 entered an economy twice the size of the economy a decade earlier. With an estimated 905 million mobile Internet users and 532 million smartphones and a projected compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent estimated to prevail until 2020 the Chinese mobile app market was booming (see Exhibit 3). Online dating in China really achieved critical mass in 2010 and had continued to grow year-over-year since then. In 2016 online dating was expected to generate approximately ¥3.15 billion in annual revenues (nearly US$500 million; see Exhibit 4) having grown by nearly 20 per cent year-over-year (see Exhibit 5). An increased familiarity with technology and its promise had fostered greater demand and higher expectations from mobile applications. With an emphasis on “now rather than later” millennials—people born in the 1980s and 1990s—had developed into a generation of tech-savvy light-hearted individuals who identified more easily with pop culture and displayed increasing affinity with localization and its advantages.TANTAN’S LOVE LINEYu Wang the CEO and founder of Tantan was born in Beijing and at the age of seven moved with his family to Stockholm Sweden where he later studied computer science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). An avid gamer he excelled at the computer game QuakeWorld which he played nearly 12 hours a day to become one of the top 10 players in the world. Perhaps not surprisingly his academic performance suffered and he nearly failed his first year at KTH. Realizing his mistake Wang shifted his focus to his studies and graduated with dual degrees in computer science and industrial economics. Upon graduation he moved back to Beijing to start his first job at Ericsson as an engineer working on an open source telephony solution. The successful completion of this project saw Wang transitioning into mobile solutions at his supervisor’s own start-up where he developed a roaming solution that permitted users to keep their telephone number and pay lower local rates. For his efforts Wang was offered a 20 per cent stake in the company and the position of chief technology officer. However he longed to work with younger like-minded colleagues and in 2007 he left the company to start his own venture with his friend Pan Ying also known as Sophia whom he later married. The two entrepreneurs started a company called P1 which was an invitation-only fashion community platform. Local fashion photographers would with permission take pictures of people who displayed exceptional style and invite them to join P1 where members could access their own pictures as well as those of other trendsetters. Wang and Sophia ran the company for nearly nine years but found that its exclusive community presented a significant challenge to achieving adequate scale. In 2012 Wang added a function to the P1 community called Street Crush. This function permitted users to visit any profile and to track incoming visitors to their own profile. If two users visited each other’s profile they could start a conversation about their similar interests. An improved version of Street Crush featured the option of anonymity whereby visits could be hidden unless both users clicked Secret Crush on each other’s profile. The Secret Crush function was later removed to avoid distracting users from P1’s core purpose—to create a community based on a common interest. However the Secret Crush function eventually served as the precursor to Tantan. Tantan was established in September 2015 as an extension of P1’s Secret Crush. Tantan targeted both heterosexual and gay relationship seekers in mainland China. Available in both Mandarin and English versions the app could be accessed by anyone with a smartphone operating on an Android or IOS platform. The development of Tantan was heavily influenced by Wang’s previous work and his related life experience—in particular the extension of P1’s Secret Crush website function and prior to meeting Sophia Wang’s loneliness (which might have been alleviated by an app such as Tantan). While working at Ericsson surrounded by millions of people in the bustling metropolis of Beijing Wang had felt that given the conservative Chinese culture there was no culturally acceptable way for an “outsider” like him to reach out to a potential partner. He knew it was an opportune time to develop a dating app for mobile users because of the dearth of venues in China where young singles could meet and socialize with other like-minded individuals. Location-based dating apps such as Tinder were flourishing in the West but had not yet made an impact in China. Wang felt that the existing Chinese online alternatives were either too marriage-oriented or too sex-oriented. Females in particular were hesitant to use the sex-oriented solutions that were coupled with a format where anyone could message anyone else. Apps such as Momo (Tantan’s direct competitor) were heavily subject to spam and resulted in low response rates for males seeking increasingly elusive females. To bridge the gap and solve these issues Wang developed the Tantan dating app. Tantan had a tightly knit development team consisting mostly of Swedish and Chinese employees. On February 3 2015 Tantan raised $5 million in series A financing led by Bertelsmann Asia Investments. Bertelsmann had been an early investor in the digital media provider Audible which was later acquired by Amazon. An additional $32 million in series C financing—this time led by DST Global Vision Plus Capital and LB Investment—was obtained in May 2016. Tantan remained a private company.THE TANTAN APPThe Tantan app was a replica of the North American mobile dating app Tinder. It was very easy to download (see Exhibit 6) had nearly identical features to Tinder and offered the same user experience. Tantan allowed its users who needed to be at least 17 years of age to make friends and meet potential partners by swiping left for “no” or right for “yes” on a selected set of photographs on the user’s profile and then enabling a two-way chat for every mutual match. The app was available in both Mandarin and English and with users’ permission could leverage a user’s social network profile information and location to find people nearby. A special feature included filtering out people the user already knew (based on their contact list and mutual contacts) so that users met only new people.Tantan was not immune to mainland China’s Internet censorship which typically flagged politically charged terms such as “64” and “Bo Xilai” and considered sexual content to also be controversial. Certain sexually charged phrases such as “hook-up buddy” or “get a room” were flagged in chat rooms and received a pop-up warning message in the app’s selected language. Any offensive language would be flagged and the user was asked to think twice before sending it—one of Tantan’s differentiating factors. The app prioritized user experience especially for female users. The number one issue that concerned female users was the prospect of receiving unwelcome sexual overtures from men. Tantan aimed to develop into more of a social platform where people looked for friends and someone to chat with.Tantan remained free to users relying on advertising for its revenue. With nearly two million active users generating around 100 million daily swipes Tantan planned to charge a nominal fee of ¥5 per month for services once it reached 10 million users. The app enjoyed an active user rate of 80 per cent and a weekly retention rate between 55 and 60 per cent. Tantan’s promotional activity was primarily based on word of mouth fostered by trust through personal connections with first-hand user experience attesting to the app’s quality. Contrary to the popular promotional tactics of the time Tantan used very little social media promotion because of China’s ban on the major social network websites (e.g. Facebook Instagram YouTube and Twitter).TANTAN’S RIVALSTantan had many competitors in the online dating landscape (see Exhibit 7). Momo was Tantan’s biggest mobile dating competitor. Launched in July 2011 and led by Tang Yang Momo was a free location-based app with instant messaging available for all smartphone platforms and tablets. Momo was perceived as a flirty “hook-up” app comparable to Tantan. Both apps encouraged strangers with similar interests to connect and expand their social circles with other nearby strangers. Some features on Momo included the ability to find nearby users join groups engage in message boards and participate in nearby events. Moreover users had the ability to go beyond instant messaging and play both single and multi-player games. Contrary to Tantan’s simple profiles Momo’s users were encouraged to make Facebook-like profiles by providing more details about themselves in order for the app to identify more accurate matches with nearby strangers.Momo gained major traction in the Chinese market as a leader in the mobile dating landscape; the user growth rate was exponential. Momo reached half a million users in December 2011—only one month after the release of the app. Three months later the number of Momo users reached two million. One year later it had reached 10 million users and then surpassed the two milestones of 15 million users in October 2012 and 100 million users in February 2014. By June 2014 Momo claimed a total user base of 148 million with 52.4 million monthly active users (MAU).Given its unprecedented growth rate and popularity Momo had no problem attracting investors. The app filed for an initial public offering in the United States on November 7 2014 and raised $2.5 million in series A financing through Buttonwood Capital and Matrix Hong Kong. Momo completed its series B financing in October 2012 and series C financing a year later by which time it had raised nearly $40 million. In May 2014 Momo raised $211.8 million in series D financing. Momo earned revenue from three major areas: premium membership subscriptions mobile games and marketing. A premium membership costs approximately $2 per month or $17 per year. Benefits of the premium membership included VIP (very important person) logos advanced search options discounts in the emoticon store higher limits on the maximum number of users in a group and the ability for users to track recent visitors on their profiles. Additionally Momo integrated mobile games into its platform to monetize its large user base. Third parties developed games and the revenues were shared between Momo and its developer partners. Momo also launched Dao Dian Tong a marketing tool that enabled local businesses to build their own pages and allowed users to find them. Over time Momo anticipated connecting users to e-commerce companies as an additional source of revenue including the e-commerce giant Alibaba.After dominating the mobile dating landscape the Momo app diversified by adding check-ins for venues and local interest groups. Momo’s executive team worked diligently to shift the public perception of the app toward a social network and away from its tainted perception as a “hook-up” app. It promoted itself as a social network for millennials and its promotions contained little to no suggestion of dating (see Exhibit 8). These efforts appeared to be successful. In early 2015 Momo could boast 78.1 million MAUs 13 per cent higher than only a few months earlier and 83 per cent higher year over year. Momo reported net revenues of $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2015 383 per cent higher year over year. Perhaps most important the app earned a net income of $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with a loss of nearly $3 million at the end of 2014.TINDER IN CHINAIn addition to tracking homegrown Chinese competitors Wang also kept a wary eye on Tinder the U.S.-based app that was credited with being the pioneer of location-based mobile dating apps. Since its inception by founder and CEO Sean Rad in September 2012 Tinder spanned 15 countries and had achieved an impressive user base of 50 million active users including several celebrities. Tinder’s top foreign markets included Brazil and the United Kingdom both of which had millions of users and a daily growth rate of 2 per cent (approximately 20000 new users per day). Tinder had also been widely adopted in places as far as Dubai Turkey Egypt Morocco and South Africa and was estimated to be in use by nearly 4 per cent of the Norwegian population. The app’s promoters claimed that users found matches four million times a day and generated 350 million daily swipes equivalent to 4000 matches around the world every second. Rad claimed that Tinder app users made 10 million matches and 750 million swipes every day. On average users of the app checked their accounts 11 times per day and spent 90 minutes engaging with the app. Tinder was owned by the Match Group a division of Barry Diller’s IAC which owned other dating sites such as OkCupid and Match.com. In November 2015 Match Group was part of an initial public offering that raised about $400 million for an approximate valuation of $3 billion. Tinder played a pivotal role in Match Group’s appeal. In its prospectus notes filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the group reported Rad’s app as having “risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the dating category” and that it particularly appealed to young users. According to one estimate Tinder’s valuation as a freestanding operation could have been higher than $1 billion.Rad and Tinder were no strangers to controversy. Rad had been named as defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit and had even been fired from his own company only to be reinstated as CEO in August 2015. Tinder was striving hard to distance itself from the image of being a “glorified frat house” devoted solely to the promotion of casual sex. By some estimates this effort had been successful. A survey conducted in the closing months of 2015 reportedly found that 80 per cent of Tinder app users were seeking more than just a “one-night stand.” Rad had grand plans for Tinder. He was not limiting the app to user-data-informed advertising and subscription services or only applications for that matter. Rad explained his plans:We have the potential to grab a massive audience as big as Instagram’s or Snapchat’s but the value we’re giving is so much greater than any of these social apps. . . . The matches made on Tinder can change lives. The Snapchat photo from two hours ago—who gives a [expletive]? In March 2015 Tinder introduced Tinder Plus a paid service that allowed unlimited matches as opposed to the free version that limited the number of right swipes in a 12-hour period. Although many users were unhappy with the limited number of “likes” a free user could indicate and the company policy of charging different prices for different age groups (a Tinder Plus subscription was $19.99 per month for users over age 28 $9.99 per month for those 28 and under) at least some interested observers reported that Tinder’s swipe right limit was working.Rad had expressed keen interest in China and had even announced his intention to enter the Chinese market in 2013: “China is the market that I think about a lot. There are a lot of sensitivities around entering that market but we’ve definitely done a fair amount of due diligence and we do have plans to enter the Chinese market.” Despite his professed interest however Rad had to contend with at least one major stumbling block to his aspirations. Both Facebook and Instagram the venues Tinder relied on to authenticate individual user identity were banned in China thus necessitating a major change in Tinder’s user acquisition strategy there. As well most dating apps in China had been specifically tailored to the local market a feature missing from Tinder. Many large American companies had overlooked the differences in the Chinese market to their own peril. Most recently Uber had acknowledged its failure due to competition from Didi Chuxing a homegrown ride-sharing company. There had been claims that under the leadership of Xi Jinping the Chinese government’s preference for domestic service companies would exert even greater pressure on foreign competitors.TANTAN VersuS TINDERSimilar to Tinder Tantan relied on companion applications for users to further connect with each other. The company circumvented China’s ban on Facebook and Instagram by using the ubiquitous WeChat app and requiring users to provide their phone numbers to verify membership. Celebrity and public figure verification conducted so as to avoid impersonators was available on Tinder but not on Tantan. Additionally Tinder had far wider global reach relative to Tantan which allowed the app to provide its premium service Tinder Plus. The premium service effectively leveraged its vast worldwide user base to increase the chances of finding a soulmate beyond the confines of a single country or region.Tinder also implemented a new 500-swipe limit over a two-hour period for basic users in an effort to avoid spammers and web robots. The app also implemented a “super like” function restricting basic users to only two “super likes” within a 12-hour period. Lastly Tinder Plus included two new features that were unavailable in its free basic version: rewind and passport. Rewind allowed the user to return to the previous left-swiped profile in the event of a change of mind; passport gave users the ability to browse and chat with other users around the world and go beyond the default 100-mile (160-kilometre) radius. However Tinder remained an insignificant presence in China restricted by its reliance on the China-banned sites. And yet that issue had not dissuaded the firm from pursuing a premium-pricing approach there. In Beijing Tinder planned to charge its users $14.99 for the first month and $6.67 per month thereafter or $10 for a six-month subscription.TANTAN’S OTHER CHALLENGES The popularity of a dating app rested on its ability to claim a large number of users which also increased the probability of fake accounts and impersonators. Tantan was subject to this potential threat and reacted to this issue by announcing the impending introduction of video verification. New users would be required to use their phones to make available a brief video snippet of themselves uttering a few words (e.g. “hello Tantan”). Tantan personnel would then compare the snippet with the user’s profile for verification. Once verified by Tantan the user had full access to the app. Tantan hoped this practice would reduce the incidence of fake accounts.The problem of fake accounts and impersonations however paled in comparison with an even greater concern. In late November 2015 Larry Salibra (CEO of Pay4Bugs) discovered and publicly reported a significant security flaw in the Tantan app. In a damning repudiation of Tantan’s assurances with respect to its users’ privacy Salibra claimed that any marginally competent hacker could access usernames passwords phone numbers and even conversations occurring within the confines of the app. All information—user interests hobbies preferences regarding partner age and even sexual orientation—was being transmitted in clear text across the Internet devoid of any encryption whatsoever. To add to this concern individual users could easily be tracked using coordinates and basic geometry on Google maps. Luckily there had been no indication to date of a privacy breach. Tantan responded swiftly to this issue by making available an updated version of the app with improved encryption and a team dedicated to resolve all issues 24 hours a day seven days a week.CONCLUSIONAmid the promise of Tantan’s ever-increasing popularity Wang still had many important decisions to make as the first anniversary of his brainchild approached. Would Tantan live up to its hype? Or was it yet another brief success without a future?EXHIBIT 1: CHINA’S DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONPopulation growth rate:0.45 per cent (2015 estimate)Population growth compared to the rest of the world: 162Urbanization:Urban population: 55.6 per cent of total population (2015)Rate of urbanization: 3.05 per cent annual rate of change (2010–2015 estimate)Sex ratio:At birth: 1.15 males per 1 female0–14 years: 1.17 males per 1 female15–24 years: 1.13 males per 1 femaleTotal population: 1.06 males per 1 female (2015 estimate)Source: “The World Factbook: Population Growth Rate” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?; “The World Factbook: Rank Order” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2002rank.html#ch; “The World Factbook: Urbanization” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?; “The World Factbook: Sex Ratio” Central Intelligence Agency accessed August 27 2016 www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?EXHIBIT 2: MARRIAGE MARKET IN CHINASource: Photo used with permission; Cherry Flava “On the Marriage Market in China” May 12 2016 accessed April 15 2016 www.cherryflava.com/futures/on-the-rack-in-china/.EXHIBIT 3: GROWTH RATE OF SMARTPHONE USE IN CHINA (2014–2020)Note: Methodology: Estimates are based on the analysis of survey and traffic data from research firms and regulatory agencies historical trends and country-specific demographic and socioeconomic factors.

Since starting with no specific knowledge in November 2014 he had built Re-Matt Inc. (Re-Matt) into a one-of-its-kind enterprise in Alberta where municipalities both urban and rural had been categorizing mattresses as waste and sending them to landfills for disposal for decades. In December 2015 the City of Calgary had set a goal of diverting 70 per cent of waste from landfills towards environmentally friendly avenues by 2025. This agenda would affect how used mattresses in Calgary would be disposed of going forward.Re-Mattâs business was diverting used mattresses from landfills and recycling them by routing their individual components back into the economic streams and recovering value. The company had reached an annual revenue of CA$500000 in two years. Cable was now weighing his options with respect to scaling up Re-Mattâs operations. He was also trying to identify ways of differentiating Re-Matt from its potential competition which seemed imminent.WASTE GENERATION IN CANADA Canada was generating about 25 million tons of solid waste annuallyâthe highest tonnage among members countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (see Exhibit 1). The reason for this large amount of waste was that Canada unlike many other OECD members was a processor of natural resources. For example the countryâs oil industry was the largest producer of waste followed by mining livestock and solid municipal waste. A provincial ranking based on the index of waste generated per capita placed Nova Scotia at âA gradeâ (with 386 kilograms of waste per person) and Alberta at âD gradeâ (with 1007 kilograms per person). Overall Canada generated 720 kilograms of waste per capita in 2014. Managing waste was part of the core customer services that Canadian municipalities were responsible for providing to their residents. This waste management involved four priorities: reduce reuse recycle and recover. Reducing the quantity of waste generated at source was crucial to minimizing its impact on the environment. Reusing the end products of waste recycling them into secondary markets and recovering the end products to produce an altogether new output often involved the use of relevant technologies. Municipal waste was defined as âwaste from households including bulky waste similar waste from commerce and trade office buildings institutions and small businesses yard and garden waste street sweepings contents of litter containers and market cleansing waste.â In Canada 95 per cent of municipal waste was sent to designated facilities for disposal into landfills. Some was diverted to recycling facilities for recovery of value in terms of secondary materials while some was incinerated. Municipalities in general had two major limitations in managing municipal waste: lack of access to affordable diversion technologies and the absence of nearby markets for secondary materials.MATTRESS RECYCLINGMattresses were complex products from a sustainability perspective. Although their customer value proposition was clear as providers of rest relaxation and sleep there was ambiguity about their eco-friendliness beyond the productsâ end-of-life which averaged 10.8 years. Used mattresses were being disposed of in four ways: through reuse at landfills via incineration and via recycling. The most common channel for reuse was charitable institutions. Most municipalities in Canada aggregated mattresses at their solid waste disposal facilities to be buried in landfills or fed into incinerators both of which also had significant environmental impacts and operational problems.A mattress was less dense than other solid waste but larger in volume which was a disincentive for aggregators because the fees they charged for accepting waste (or âtipping feesâ) were based on weight rather than volume. In addition a mattress was bulky springy and had a compaction rate that was 400 per cent lower than regular waste. Each mattress occupied 0.6 to 1.1 cubic metres (23 to 40 cubic feet) of area in a landfill depleting valuable airspace. Moreover mattresses could take decades to decompose in landfills often popping out of the ground long after they were buried. A mattress was also difficult to incinerate because its springs or coils could be caught in the moving grates of an incinerator or shredding machine harming the equipment. In any case even after incineration 40 per cent of a mattress (by weight) had to be disposed of in a landfill anyway. A typical mattress was an assembly of steel polyurethane foam wood fibre and cotton (see Exhibit 2). There were markets for all of these components. Steel components like spring metal and box spring metal once separated could be scrapped and reconverted into steel. Polyurethane foam could be turned into carpet underpad. Wood could be chipped and used as animal bedding mulch or biomass fuel. Fibre could be recycled into industrial filters or padding materials. Cotton could be used in locomotive oil filters. Although 95 per cent of the components of a mattress were recyclable only 7 per cent of used mattresses were recycled in Canada; the rest ended up in landfills.Canadian municipalities had not taken any initiative to establish dedicated facilities for recycling mattresses because of issues related to investment in recycling machinery and plant/labour capacity utilization. Thus mattress recycling was left to private enterprise. The countryâs first mattress recycling operation was set up in Montreal in 2007. Since then independent recyclers had launched operations in select urban centres in British Columbia Alberta Manitoba Ontario and Quebec. Many of them had provisions for recycling products in other categories like soft furniture. These recyclers sourced used mattresses from locations that generated them in bulk (e.g. hotels hostels retailers and hospitals) and created drop-off points for individual residents.Some large mattress manufacturers and retailers collected used mattresses for recycling when they delivered new ones. They recovered the recycling fee from the buyer at the point of sale and paid it to the recycler. This system was characteristic of the strategy known as extended producer responsibility (EPR) which shifted the responsibility for waste management from a municipality to the individual manufacturer. EPR saved tax dollars and incentivized manufacturers to incorporate environmental considerations right from the stage of product design though it was voluntary for mattress manufacturers in Canada.In product categories where EPR was mandatory like electronics the strategy had led to increases in recycling rates. The corresponding legislation included performance goals and collection site convenience metrics. The growth in recycling had to be led by new entrepreneurs creating new markets. Regulatory actions like banning landfills could provide the groundwork for a future EPR program for mattresses. Metro Vancouver for example had implemented a mattress landfill ban in 2012. Calgary had set a goal of diverting 70 per cent of its waste (including mattresses) from landfills by 2025. The Province of Ontario had identified mattresses for future EPR programs as part of a drafted waste reduction strategy that it had prepared for its municipalities.RE-MATT Company Background Cable had founded Re-Matt in mid-2014. Before that point he had worked for three years on the supply chain operations of an oil sands company in Calgary where he had witnessed first-hand the negative impact that industry could have on the environment. As part of a skills upgrade program the oil sands company had sent him to attend a course in logistics at Mount Royal University in Calgary. The class was touring a local Sears distribution centre when Cable saw a pile of used mattresses at a warehouse. He learned from the warehouse supervisor that the mattresses were destined for a landfill because there was no mattress recycling facility in the province and that Sears was willing to provide a fee per mattress to anyone who could dispose of them in another way. Cable immediately spotted a business opportunity. He enlisted a friend with whom he had worked earlier at a national restaurant chain for over a decade as a partner. The two drove along alleys in Calgary found a few discarded mattresses took them to their garage and started taking them apart. It took 15 minutes for each of them to disassemble a mattress. The process seemed akin to peeling layers off of an onion.The two men spoke to other potential suppliers of used mattresses and put together a business plan (see Exhibit 3). One of the difficulties they faced was ascertaining sources of revenue. The recycling fee that some retailers were charging customers at the point of sale of a new mattress became a benchmark for determining the fee that their company now called Re-Matt could charge for recycling a used mattress. The duo set this fee at $13â$15 for non-residential sources and $15 for residential sources. However when they approached Canadaâs main banks for a working capital loan of $150000 they were turned away because they could not offer any collateral. Fortunately the Business Development Bank of Canada which focused on small and medium enterprises was willing to finance an idea that it recognized as novel in the province. The partners acquired a 10000-square-foot warehouse on a five-year lease and converted it into their businessâs shop floor (see Exhibit 4). Re-Matt was officially in business by November 2014. Cable and his partner initially learned through trial and error. They trained themselves and their new employees who joined the company on a part-time basis. The business had no entry barriers but those in related businesses including mattress manufacturers and retailers were reticent about revealing their knowledge of the industry tricks of the trade. One such âtrade secretâ was that the sale of secondary materials could be a source of revenue. Cable and his partner had identified the recycling fee as the main source of income in their business plan. It was only much later as they settled into the business that they recognized that the byproducts had a regular market of their own and that they raised the value of each mattress to $0.80 more than the partners had estimated in their business plan. Cable had been manager of a restaurant for seven years and general managerâresponsible for the profitability of regional units in the restaurant chainâfor five years. The work was paid hourly rather than daily or weekly and involved many different skill sets. He applied the lessons and skills gained from his restaurant experience to this new business. By early 2015 Re-Matt had five full-time and three part-time employees. Cable recognized that in order to break even the company needed to recycle one mattress every 10 minutes per employee. The need to reach out to part-time workers became a rough measure of how good (or bad) a week was for the business. Recycling seven mattresses an hour became the new performance metric.The business was not always even. The end of each year (when residents bought furniture for the holiday season) and spring (when many people cleaned out their homes) witnessed heavy inflows of used mattresses. During the summer months business was usually slow because people were out of town on vacation. Therefore Cable designated July and August as months when Re-Matt employees could take their leave. There was typically a spike in supplies whenever a large vendor announced a sale. As Cable soon realized recycling mattresses âwas not the most glamorous work in the worldâ but it required skills that could only be developed over timeâlike understanding what made each mattress unique identifying quality end products and getting a feel for the mattress parts by using sight and touch. For example different types of foam had different flashpoints and segmenting them on the shop floor was crucial to determining where a foam type could be used (e.g. punching bags carpet padding car seats or bus seats). In addition to dismantling mattresses the shop floor duties included unloading trucks as they came in operating forklifts and loading the recyclable materials when they were ready for dispatch. Cable immediately noticed that maintaining morale on the shop floor would be an issue and employee retention became a metric for him to monitor. The disassembly of each mattress was manual at Re-Matt. This process reduced wastage and maximized the quality of the recyclable materials but it was slower than the mechanized separation that was common in some places such as California. In mechanized facilities each mattress would be placed on a conveyor belt and specially designed saws would cut away soft materials on the top and bottom separating the polyurethane foam and cotton fibre. The metal pieces would be removed magnetically and the remaining fibre materials were then shredded and baled. The process took one individual three to four minutes per mattress. Scaling up Operations Ensuring steady sources of used mattresses (on the supply side) and finding established markets for recycled materials (on the demand side) were crucial to building scale for Re-Matt. These actions would enable automation ultimately driving down costs and in turn generating greater efficiencies. Scaling up the business would also ensure better commodity prices for end products. Together these two agendas would create a virtuous cycle. By 2016 the disposal fee had stabilized at an average of $12 for large sources and $15 for households. Cable had to work on two streams in enhancing procurement sources: developing new collection systems for large non-residential sources and providing multiple channels for small and independent residential sources. Some large retailers had their own reverse distribution systems to return used mattresses to their original manufacturers; it was important that Re-Matt integrate its procurement systems with these retailers. For residential customers Re-Mattâs options included setting up permanent drop-off sites and one-day collection events in neighbourhoods or regular curbside collection. Mattress quality was an issue with curbside collection because mattresses left outside for collection were quickly damaged by exposure to the elements. Re-Matt would be in a better position to access large volumes of mattresses if (1) a ban of mattresses from landfills was enacted and (2) a recycling fee at the point of sale of each mattress was collected.The original concern with byproducts was their disposal. The tipping fee was about $113 per ton. There were several materials that had to be sent to landfills. For example the top layer of a mattress was a combination of textile and foam sewn so closely together that separating the two components was a labour-intensive task; however without being separated the materials had no value and would have to be sent to a landfill. Similarly although pocket coils had a metal component traders in Calgary would not accept them unless the microfibre in which they were wrapped was taken out. Traders in provinces like Ontario however saw value in pocket coils. These differences meant that Re-Matt was facing a business location conflictâto scale up the supply side the company needed to go where the mattresses were; to scale up the demand side Re-Matt had to go where the end markets were. Re-Mattâs original business plan was predicated on a conservative income of $0.80 per mattress from the sale of recycled materials. Since then Cable had developed a better understanding of end markets. The monthly yield from the 4000 mattresses that Re-Matt recycled in 2016 was 20000 pounds of metal 20000 pounds of foam and 4800 pounds of cotton. Metal was sold at a price range of $0.17â$0.28 per pound foam at $0.25â$0.35 per pound and cotton at $0.10 per pound. The five-year lease for Re-Mattâs existing shop floor premises would end in 2019 when the company would need to look for larger premises and pursue increases in plant and staff capacities. Moving into Ontario and Quebec which had Canadaâs largest and the second-largest waste generation by weight respectively would scale up operations. Cable wondered whether diversifying beyond mattresses into other recycling-related products (e.g. soft furniture) would be another option for scaling up.DifferentiationRe-Matt had a first-mover advantage in Alberta as the first enterprise of its kind. By January 2017 it had diverted 1 million pounds of mattress waste from landfills. Sustaining this position was critical because new players would be drawn to the business in the absence of entry barriers. Re-Matt had to build a differentiation strategy that addressed both the supply and demand sides of the business.As part of building differentiation the company had started providing certificates of appreciation to its customers for their commitment to recycling. The certificate mentioned the quantity of waste that Re-Matt diverted in a year (see Exhibit 5). Further partnerships could be a way to erect entry barriers. Establishing long-term contracts with large companies (particularly manufacturers and retailers) would enable Re-Matt to lock in supply sources in Alberta. Even if the recycling fee were renegotiated large volumes would ensure the recovery of fixed costs. However Cable wondered how Re-Matt could avoid the risk of low-cost positioning. The risk was greater on the demand side where the end products were already commoditized. Building a sustainability proposition into its sale of end products would not only differentiate Re-Matt but generate higher prices as well. Re-Matt could also avoid the secondary markets and route the recycled materials directly to the mattress manufacturers. These companies could then pitch their products to eco-conscious consumers making an emotive appeal based on the recycled content of the product. Re-Matt had to rebuild its value proposition. While weighing the options available to him with regard to both scaling up and building differentiation Cable wondered what would be the best way forwardâboth for the novel business enterprise he had built and for him personally.

(Hengda) a Chinese company that produced anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion materials. As the new leader of the procurement department Gan decided to immerse himself in the departmentâs daily business routine before rushing into any transformation decisions. Soon after his appointment he met with all procurement department team members to gain a sense of the interactions that normally took place between his new department and the companyâs other internal functions and external groups (i.e. suppliers). Gan also decided to carefully review previous procurement records and all written procedures. Gan considered himself a very decisive person but he was having trouble understanding some aspects of his new teamâs operations. The procurement department seemed to have a complex relationship with other corporate and business functions (e.g. marketing manufacturing warehousing and inventory and finance). It seemed to routinely receive and fill rush orders which overwhelmed the department and negatively affected the teamâs motivation to provide value to the company. However Gan noticed that his team had lost any willingness to improve the situation and had become accustomed to the low-morale environment. Gan learned that his predecessors had tried to improve the situation in the department but they had failed. Even so Gan decided that he could not accept failure as an option and became intent on addressing the systemic issues in his department. He believed that the reason his predecessors were unable to find a solution was because they did not look beyond the surface to find the root causes. Staring at the purchasing data on the screen and reflecting on his staffâs complaints Gan wondered about the nature of the problems in his department. Where did the root causes lie? What would be the best strategy to address them?Jiangxi Hengda High-Tech Company Ltd.Hengda was established in 1993 as a chemical materials manufacturer. In the early years it focused on research and development manufacturing and sales of anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion painting products. The company obtained multiple patents for its research. Hengda went public in 2011 and was listed on the small and medium enterprise board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company was widely regarded as Chinaâs number one anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion stock. After becoming a public corporation Hengda began to diversify into other fields. By mid-2019 the company was involved in waste incinerator (for energy saving and environmental protection) and acoustic noise reduction services. Over the many years of its development Hengda had become an industry leader in China maintaining rapid growth in both revenue and net profits for several years.Unlike its early years when the company had operated within a narrow business scope and simple business processes Hengda currently operated using a functional department model with several business departments operating under the supervision of the general managerâs office. These departments included human resources procurement manufacturing warehousing and inventory finance and marketing (see Exhibit 1). Each department had its own mission and performance goals. The streamlined organizational structure allowed the company to increase its overall operational efficiency which led to consistently favourable net profits. However after Hengda became public and expanded its business lines the companyâs internal management structure became more complex reflecting a wider business range and corporate ecosystem.Increasingly the procurement department had to deal with a larger number of suppliers and greater volume of materials. The manufacturing department had to become more innovative and was designing different production processes for new types of products. The warehousing department was required to manage more categories of inventory while the finance department had to deal with complex payment requirements for raw materials. Even the marketing department which interacted with different customer groups was required to meet new volatility in demand. Therefore business processes and information exchange among the companyâs business departments became more entangled and complicated. Despite their individual silos structure the various departments had to interact more frequently and their previous work processes were no longer effective in supporting the companyâs growth. Internal collaboration was becoming a major challenge. Gan and the Procurement DepartmentBefore assuming his new role as manager of the procurement department Gan had worked for 20 years at a Hengda subsidiary that conducted research and development as well as sales of metal materials and chemicals. Having gained essential experience in procurement and management he was rewarded for his achievements by Hengdaâs chairman of the board Zhu Xinghe who helped Gan attain a position on the companyâs middle management team.After investigating the status of the procurement department Gan realized that the problems he identified in his department could be a company-wide issue. He might therefore face numerous hurdles in his attempts to resolve his own departmentâs problem. Nevertheless he was optimistic that he could overcome any hurdles and that career advancement opportunities could be his reward. If he could leverage his rapport with top executives and use his job experience to successfully resolve these problems his contribution to the overall company would be considerable. As a result he would likely gain more trust from his superiors and follow a path toward further career development. He felt pleased with this prospect.Under Hengdaâs structure the procurement department operated in parallel with the marketing manufacturing warehousing and finance departments. In addition to Gan as manager there were seven procurement officers in his department. The officers managed the purchasing of materials by category and based on production project requirements. The project cycle for the waste incinerator service was normally shortâusually completed within one weekâwhereas the anti-abrasion and anti-corrosion business generally included just-in-time on-the-spot installation. Therefore the company had to be very responsive to customer requirements. The job of a procurement officer included making purchase plans that included category batching and timing of each supply activity on the basis of internal orders market supply and inventory level. Thorough knowledge of market pricing of raw materials was necessary to perform cost analysis cost control and supplier selection and management as well as to sign contracts and coordinate just-in-time delivery. Key performance indicators for the procurement department included completion of purchasing plans completion of cost reduction targets and punctuality of procurement (see Exhibit 2).Gan knew that the companyâs management had been neglecting the value of the procurement department. The company held patents for most of its products and these products sold well because there were not many substitutes on the market. In addition suppliers usually offered favourable payment deferral terms to Hengda. Therefore the executives had not been focusing on enhancing procurement efficiency to reduce costs. Gan decided that if he could make senior management see the value of his department and if he could lead his staff to increase working efficiency there was a potential to considerably reduce costs for the entire company. However he sensed that the company was indifferent to the abilities of his department and of his team members. The general impression was that procurement officers simply placed orders and met production needs. Their responsibilities were considered easy and routine. Other departments assumed that procurement team members were not motivated to work effectively.Gan reviewed the qualifications of his staff. He consulted their resumes and work reports for previous years. He found that only three procurement officers held a bachelorâs degree. The level of competence and professional ability among his staff varied widely. For example they were instructed to simply follow directions without requirements to perform effective data analysis tasks or make sound decisions based on data input. Based on his departmentâs complaints Gan realized that it was understaffed and operated under considerable work and emotional pressure. He realized that the daily work of a procurement officer was not easy as others assumed but the lack of training and the nominal performance assessment may have been misinterpreted as proactivity. Based on employee feedback Gan found that there had been many complaints from his department to previous managers about considerable pressure from both internal and external sources.After careful thought Gan believed he had found the root issue of the problems in the procurement department. All Hengda functional departments operated at an equal structural level which meant that the procurement team interacted with internal clients (i.e. other functional departments) on a horizontal communication level. However procurement officers had to abide by key performance indicators such as procurement plan fulfillment rate procurement quality and just-in-time material supply for all the different internal customers which often caused friction among the various business units. That friction was reflected in the attitudes of Hengda workers when communicating with the procurement team which led to a lack of information sharing among departments. Procurement officers had to go back and forth between departments and business units to retrieve necessary information and coordinate resources which reduced the effectiveness of the department. The poor information sharing was further affected by an outdated internal communication system that was mostly paper-based. Tracing and retrieving essential data was an excessively time-consuming task.The procurement department purchased a large amount of materials from external suppliers and the selection and management processes for those suppliers involved considerable efforts. All supplier qualifications were evaluated using paperwork rather than on-site inspections. Abiding by the companyâs strict financial control the primary consideration for any procurement decision was price; therefore product quality punctual delivery service responsiveness and quality were largely ignored by a procurement department that was already fully extended. Supplier relationships were therefore based on short or single duration. There were no differentiated terms available to specific suppliers nor any attempt to maintain a favourable supplier relationship. The lack of internal information sharing and coordination meant that there was no comprehensive procurement plan. The procurement department was therefore unable to provide suppliers with a proposed shipping schedule in advance. Suppliers often complained about being unable to schedule their own production process based on Hengda orders and some refused to maintain a long-term partnership or offer co-operative service.Gan made a list of all the issues he had identified and glanced over the items which included low work efficiency lack of planning poor information sharing and inefficient supplier management. Gan added another term to the listâinvisible wallâand sat gazing at that key term for some time.Invisible WallGan decided that the root cause of his departmentâs low efficiency was the invisible walls between departments in the companyâs silos structure. Each department head was fully in charge of that particular department and had the power to make decisions and perform performance reviews for that departmentâs team members. Therefore before he could begin to transform the procurement department Gan would have to influence change across the entire company. The first step would be to understand the roles and work processes of Hengdaâs different departments but he would have to cross the invisible wall between departments to do so. With a clear goal in mind he began learning how the marketing production warehousing and finance departments operated. He would then try and determine how his staffâs feedback was manifested in the processes of these departments.Marketing DepartmentIn Hengdaâs early years the company simply catered to the anti-corrosion paint market. At that time the work of the marketing department was specific and well organized. In recent years however the company had extended its operations into multiple markets and product categories including noise reduction products and waste incinerator services. Therefore the companyâs customer base was expanding and its configuration becoming more complex.The procurement department and the marketing department represented two ends of the companyâs value chain. Gan knew that it was the procurement department that interfaced directly with manufacturing not the marketing department. However the marketing needs and information came from the marketing department and indirectly influenced production and purchasing plans. In recent years it had become harder to make precise market projections because the company had expanded into different fields with a wider ranging product catalogue. The manufacturing department forwarded its purchasing requirements to the procurement department according to market fluctuations. With large orders the marketing department promoted specific product lines and tried to accelerate production for those products. Therefore the procurement department had to place urgent orders to suppliers based on the marketing plan. Under this circumstance both Hengda and the suppliers had to bear a higher cost and the risk of not being able to fulfill the required orders. Gan wondered if his department could receive market information directly from the marketing team rather than relying on the manufacturing department to relay the information. Was it possible to enhance the entire chainâs market responsiveness? Manufacturing DepartmentBased on Ganâs observations the conflict between the manufacturing and procurement departments was the most evident issue in the companyâs internal process.Hengda was a manufacturing company. The primary responsibility of the procurement department was to ensure a smooth production process. Therefore the procurement department and the manufacturing department interacted most closely. These two functional departments shared the main goals of ensuring production and quality. However there were several differences in priorities. For example the procurement teamâs objectives included cost cutting and supplier management which meant that its goal was to retain a moderate inventory level. However the manufacturing department aimed to produce high-quality products in a timely manner which meant that its goal was to keep raw materials in full stock at all times.The companyâs silos structure created invisible walls that caused information sharing blocks and Hengda had made no efforts to correct this issue by implementing a proper information system. Specific production plans were not provided to the procurement department. Instead procurement officers executed purchasing orders based on paperwork provided by impatient manufacturing staff who were indifferent to purchasing plans or cycles. Procurement team members were therefore often blamed for production delays.Warehousing DepartmentThe warehousing department operated using a multi-level inventory model. In addition to common warehousing functions this department also collected data from company warehouses operating at different levels of the organization and coordinated logistics among them. The central warehouse held tier-1 inventory whereas the two workshop warehouses managed by the manufacturing department served all tier-2 inventory consisting of materials received from the central warehouse. In addition the sales department occasionally set up temporary warehouses at customer project sites. This model was designed to save logistics costs and improve efficiency.However the invisible walls had created an inadequate information sharing environment between the procurement and warehousing departments. Procurement officers could only obtain information about tier-1 inventory from the central warehouse. This issue made it difficult for the procurement team to operate effectively when placing orders with suppliers because they simply had no information on how much inventory was available at the companyâs workshop warehouses or at various temporary project warehouses. By considering only tier-1 inventory and being unaware of the companyâs other warehouses the procurement team could inadvertently create an over-supply or overstock situation. On the other hand if the department did not purchase enough supplies it would be blamed for causing a production delay.Finance DepartmentHengdaâs finance department was focused on improving the companyâs profitability and capital turnover rates. To improve the companyâs cash flow situation the finance department worked on delaying payment to suppliers and collecting payables as soon as possible. The department had also been closely monitoring purchasing costs based mainly on prices and payment deferral terms. However the procurement department was required to meet the specifications outlined by the manufacturing department which meant strategically selecting and supporting preferred suppliers.During the initial part of the procurement process the finance team did not directly intervene in procurement decisions. However the payment process for supplies soon became an important consideration for this department. For example questions were raised about reasonable pricing selection criteria for suppliers potential corruption in the selection of suppliers contracts and payments conforming to company policy potential risk to the finance department and whether suppliers were properly registered with the commercial administration. To fulfill urgent orders the procurement staff sometimes had to make quick decisions which were usually questioned by the finance department. Gan decided to meet with the manager of the finance department to ask about its scrutiny of the procurement team. Gan was informed that because the finance department was not directly involved in front-office business it had to act as a gatekeeper for the companyâs financial activities which required a thorough understanding of every detail of the companyâs purchases. Gan was informed that payment terms for example could have a great impact on the companyâs financial health.Suppliers In 2019 Hengdaâs total procurement expense increased sharply to Â¥269 million from Â¥187 million in 2018. This coincided with the companyâs expansion into the waste incinerator and acoustic noise reduction business lines. The impact of the expansion on the procurement team was working with a large variety of new materials and numerous new suppliers. Gan decided to meet with several suppliers and ask for their feedback but he received mainly negative comments about Hengdaâs procurement department. Not surprisingly suppliers complained mainly about two issues: returns and the lack of a long-term procurement plan.Suppliers claimed that they could not make appropriate production plans to fill Hengda orders without a proper long-term procurement plan. Urgent supply requirements were very costly to suppliers who had to use overtime work to fill the orders. Returned goods were also a major issue especially for goods with short expiry periods. Suppliers stated that returns from Hengda that had a long expiry date could be resold but goods returned with short expiry dates had to be heavily discounted recycled or destroyed. All of these measures caused the supplier to incur costs.Making Transformation PlansAfter completing a thorough investigation Gan realized that the problems manifested in the procurement department were actually deeply rooted in the lack of collaboration among departments. The companyâs diversification in recent years had exacerbated this problem and added strain to the company. These problems posed great challenges for Hengdaâs future development. Gan was concerned about the companyâs long-term future and was determined to make a difference. But he also knew that it took more than a procurement manager to affect such important organizational changes.He contacted Hengdaâs chairman Zhu to proudly present his findings but was disappointed by the chairmanâs lack of enthusiasm in Ganâs report. After regaining his composure Gan proceeded to carefully explain the situation. He informed Zhu about how the procurement departmentâs issues were related to the companyâs silos structure and was glad to see that his analysis was gradually earning Zhuâs approval. The chairman agreed that the silos structure had been a long-term issue but explained that there were three main reasons why the company chose to retain its current organizational format.The first reason had to do with corporate culture. Hengda had pursued a lean management structure to gain a competitive advantage in different markets. Corporate leaders had allowed great autonomy to sales departments to secure orders and sales teams tended to satisfy every requirement from demanding clients. Therefore other functional departments had to be highly responsive to the sales department who represented the customer.  The second reason had to do with performance reviews of department managers which emphasized departmental goals rather than the companyâs overall operation. With individual departments pursuing their own bottom line rather than being aligned across departments the company could promote a more competitive culture among departments which benefited the companyâs overall bottom line. The third reason was in response to Ganâs recommendation to improve information sharing and save costs by revising the companyâs organizational structure moving positions and investing in reengineered and improved information systems. Zhu stated that strengthening inter-departmental collaboration would require changing traditional and cultural practices. This would be very time-consuming and costly and did not necessarily guarantee business growth and increased revenue in a fiercely competitive market environment. The chairman then stated that there was another issue related to acting on Ganâs report: Even if he agreed to support Ganâs initiative who would be the right person to lead the transformation? Also how would this personâs achievement be evaluated?Gan was silently considering the chairmanâs response. He agreed with Zhu that the situation was a systematic challenge. From the chairmanâs viewpoint there were other important considerations beyond individual employee problems including maintaining a competitive edge growing the companyâs stock price and ensuring appropriate timing and priority for investments. But Gan was still convinced that internal collaboration cost-cutting and enhanced work efficiency were indispensable steps for the companyâs long-term future. Zhu and Gan did agree on this point. Therefore they decided that this direction of transformation for Hengda needed further contemplation and planning before it could be put into action. Gan returned to his office perplexed by the questions the chairman had raised and wondering what recommendations he would make in his next meeting with Zhu about the companyâs future.Exhibit 1: Organizational Chart of Jiangxi Hengda High-Tech Company Ltd.Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: Key Performance Indicators for the Procurement DepartmentSource: Company files.

She had spent the afternoon running an entrepreneurship workshop with high school learners for the organization she founded two and a half years earlier Beyond the Lemonade Stand. Beyond the Lemonade Stand focused on enabling teen entrepreneurs through advisory work access to markets and project execution. Mjo was exhausted and frustrated by the challenges of working in Johannesburgâs townships. For the last few years she had successfully run a number of projects but she questioned whether she and her organization could sustain themselves serving kids in these tough urban environments. The sky was blue and the sun was in her eyes as she turned for home reflecting on the organizational and personal implications of the immediate choice she faced. Mjo thought to herself âMaybe I should focus less on the poor townships and more on functional middle-class and private schools where there is a huge demand for my services and funds to support it.â This choice would cut deep into her value system though requiring her to reflect on what was most important going forward.An entrepreneurial childhoodMjo was born in 1983 in Ezibeleni outside Queenstown Eastern Cape South Africa. It was the height of apartheid a legal system of enforced racial segregation and oppression. It was a violent time across the country as the authoritarian white minority government suppressed democratic social movements and political parties. Black people had few rights: they could not own land their education was limited and they were denied the right to vote. Mjoâs father was an insurance broker her mother a nurse. From an early age Mjo watched her parents strive against the odds for a better future for themselves and their family despite the challenges in society. When Mjo was nine South Africa began to change politically and socially for the better. The walls of apartheid began to come down Nelson Mandela was released from prison and laws began to change. Mjo was among the first group of black children to enrol in a boarding school that had historically been exclusively for white students. When Mjo was a teenager the family moved to the small nearby village of Dordrechat and her mother relocated to Cape Town to study psychiatric nursing. Mjo was left at home with her father and two younger siblings. She had to take on greater responsibility for her younger sister and brother. She felt an internal impulse to step forward and do what needed to be done. Mjo was a good student and enjoyed studying. As far back as she could remember she always had an entrepreneurial streak. In high school she and a friend ran a small tuck shop (small convenience store) selling sweets and biscuits to other students. In the boarding hostel the students were only allowed to go shopping once a week but Mjo had such demand for her stock that she and her friend would change out of their school uniforms put on ordinary clothes and sneak into town. She recalled that âthe thrill of getting away with all of that and never getting caught was addictive.â And Mjo learned that sometimes rules needed to be broken in order to respond to the basic realities of people in need.With her good marks from high school Mjo was accepted to the University of Pretoria one of the continentâs leading universities to major in accounting. âWhen I matriculated my dad lost his job as an insurance broker. At the time my mom was a psych nurse. In order to pay for my varsity fees and put my 14-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother through school they decided my mom would move to Dublin Ireland to work as a nurse.â Mjoâs mother would be paid better in Ireland and could send money home. Mjo knew she needed to succeed so she could also help her younger siblings and family. She was not nervous about her ability to excel at varsity thinking âI cruised through high school; surely I can handle varsity.â But the reality was different: university was much more difficult. The move from a small town to the big city was difficult for Mjo to manage. Through most of her first year she was enthralled by the pull of parties on and around campus. She often skipped classes assuming she would be able to easily pull everything together at year-end but Mjo had a rude awakening when she failed her first year of accounting. âThere was my mom in Dublin working hard as a nurse to pay my university fees and I was pissing it all away.âEncounters with Social IssuesIn her second year Mjo changed course and decided to specialize in informatics which combined computer science and commercial subjects. She managed to pass her first year and found her study rhythm. She worked hard and graduated a few years later. Then she did her honours an optional fourth year of undergraduate study with a focus in finance. While completing her honours Mjo managed to start two new businesses with friends. The first was a clothing brand and the second was a cafÃ© and shop for an office block where Mjo interned during the holidays. Also during her honours year Mjo encountered Crossroads Kids Shelter a non-profit organization working with street kids. The head of the project mentioned that what the boys needed most was someone to spend time with them. âI didnât have money and I had no boysâ clothes to donate but I had a lot of time so I started volunteeringâ Mjo recalled. âInitially my idea was to just go and hang out on Saturdaysâ she said. âThe shelterâs intention was rehabilitation and [sending] the boys back to school but I soon realized that the schools were not set up to deal with the complexities of boys who had lived and worked on the street for many years. Some boys were 17 and simply chucked into a regular grade 11 class. So a lot of boys struggled.âSeeing an opportunity to help Mjo recruited retired teachers and peers from her church to start a tutoring program offering basic numeracy and literacy skills. âIf you can survive on the streets you are very smartâ Mjo said. âSo a lot of the boys caught on very quickly. But they couldnât connect the importance of completing high school with their future career prospects. The only jobs they had seen first-hand were police and security guards and they were not interested in those jobs.âSo Mjo began an informal career guidance program asking young professionals to share their stories. â[N]ow the boys could see how applying themselves to their studies could help them become a graphic designer or marketer or whateverâ she said. The career guidance program grew expanding into other centres working with young people at risk such as girls who had been abandoned or abused. Over the next three years Mjo worked for the project as a part-time volunteer.From Finance to Youth DevelopmentIn January 2008 Mjo started her first formal employment working at the International Finance Group an asset management company in Pretoria. Mjo had never envisioned herself behind a desk in an office job in a large corporation so the International Finance Group appealed to her as a small company that did not have the trappings of corporate life. It was still a desk job but it offered more creativity than a large corporation could.In 2009 Mjo met Jonathan Cook a senior lecturer and director at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) and started volunteering with the GIBS high school leadership program Spirit of Youth. Cook then told Mjo about the social entrepreneurship program at GIBS a six month part-time course that inspired and equipped social change makers. Although the course could be studied part-time when Mjo reflected on her first career moves and the volunteer work that gave her life meaning she knew she wanted to quit her job and find full-time work in the social sector. She had already sent her resume to a number of organizations but without a positive response. The GIBS course provided Mjo with a way to justify leaving work without seeming irresponsible. She hoped the course would help her better structure her ideas for a youth empowerment initiative that would create a positive social impact.Mjo faced a turning point in her life and a dilemma. She had saved enough money to move to Johannesburg and pursue her new career dream but she wondered how she could tell her parents that she was leaving the security of her full-time office job without devastating them. Mjo had been sent to the best schoolsâwell beyond what her parents could afford. They had sacrificed everything to make it happen. She was set up to climb the corporate ladder. In South Africa at the time the pressure on a new generation of young black middle-class professionals was especially intense. They were expected to contribute financially toward a range of immediate and extended family commitments. Mjoâs employment provided her family with a way out of ongoing financial stress. If Mjo quit her job her mother would need to stay in Ireland longer to earn an income and support Mjoâs siblings.In late 2010 Mjo made the difficult call. She quit her job and enrolled in the GIBS social entrepreneurship program. She recalled thinking âI am going to find work in the youth development space. That is where I feel most alive. I know this from my time at Crossroads.â But when Mjo told her mother she was livid. âWhat are you doing!â her mother had exclaimed. Although her parents were upset Mjo pointed out to them âYou raised me to believe we are here to serve a purpose. I am practising what you taught me.â She recalled thinking âAm I going to make choices because I am afraid or because I have been called to pursue something bigger than myself? If you step out in faith God will come to meet you.âA short while later Mjo sat in the GIBS classroom on the first day of class in early 2011 with about 50 other new students. There were many new concepts being discussed. The first class focused on the concept of social entrepreneurship. There was some nervousness but generally it felt good. It felt right. âI felt like it was a clean start . . . a little bit exhilarating and an opportunity to pursue what I really enjoyed and what I was made forâ she recalled. As a student again Mjo could think properly about her next move without any pressure. She knew what she did not want for her life; now she could pursue what she wanted. Mjo was new to the idea of social entrepreneurship but something about it drew her in. She had only an idea of what was involved in the youth development field but she had some brief experience starting a number of small businesses. She had also mentored young people for a number of years. She wondered if she was in the right place and if she was how she might even begin to start a new social venture.Finding the pathThe course comforted and reassured Mjo. This was a recognized formal path of study and it gave Mjo time to think through her first steps in the social sector. The course also showed her that she was not alone and exposed her to a range of new ideas in social entrepreneurship and non-profit leadership. Mjo gave herself the year to find her direction but as the end of the year approached and the course finished she did not feel ready to launch her own venture. Therefore Mjo applied for a number of positions in the youth development field to gain more experience.None of the organizations she applied to replied. The end of the year came and went. Time passed. Then in early 2012 Mjo heard back from Junior Achievement a well-respected organization that ran entrepreneurship support programs for young people. Junior Achievement would employ Mjo on contract as a part-time facilitator. She could now buy groceries and basics. Then Mjo found other short-contract facilitation work. This was progress but she barely managed to pay the rent. Nothing was solid. But as another year passed Mjo learned a few things and was gaining some respect in the youth development field. She still believed she was on the right path and her faith guided her but she also still occasionally worried about letting down her parents who had invested so much in Mjoâs education.Then in 2013 Mjo got a break with the opportunity to run career guidance for the Maths Centre a well-known organization that ran high-quality support programs for mathematics and science education mostly in schools. Mjo loved this work and she found meaning and value in the workshops. It built on volunteering work she had done while in university. The students had so little exposure to different careers; they only knew about the people they saw around themânurses policemen and teachers. Mjo could make a real difference and significantly broaden the studentsâ horizons. One of the ways she did this was to organize a number of visits to diverse large companies to show students what the world of work was really about. But these did not always go well. On one visit to a top law firm the first 30 students hungrily took all the food that was intended for 100 students. Then a group of girls somehow blocked the toilets. A plumber had to be called. It was all very embarrassing for the learners and for Mjo. Mjo realized in moments like these that the broader situation students faced was dire. Their needs were extensive including food books transportation and help understanding the informal rules of the world of work. She would often react spontaneously to these needs taking the money she earned and spending it on supporting the poorest children. âThere were so many needs and I wanted to meet all of themâ she recalled. She was trying to be strategic about her impact but often found herself reacting to the immediate needs of her environment. As the end of 2013 approached Mjo realized she had spent three years in the social sector. In some ways she was still no closer to a clearly identified path but in another way she was learning about a range of challenges and possibilities for impact. When a number of the young learners came to her to say that they wanted to apply for further studies but did not have the money Mjo had an âaha moment.â She began to dream of an entrepreneurship program through which the young students could earn an income. This would help them to study further. Mjo had run her own successful tuck shop in high school and then run two businesses at university. She wanted to draw on this experience and provide a platform for others to learn to support themselves.Beyond the Lemonade StandIn early 2014 Mjo registered a non-profit company Beyond the Lemonade Stand. The name pointed to Mjoâs passion for using entrepreneurship projects to help students learn how to run a business and realize their true potential. This initiative was hugely needed in the country. Despite South Africaâs high unemployment rate the rate of entrepreneurial activity was very low. Entrepreneurial intentions in the African region were more than three times higher than in South Africa. Higher levels of entrepreneurship were seen as a way to create jobs and build the economy.The first program Mjo created was based in high schools. Participating learners would run a business and sell their products to the rest of the school. The businesses were prescribed by Mjo and included a gift shop stationary store and book store. âIn the first week 30 kids signed upâ she remembered. âAll the kids were initially excited but then in the second week they had to find clients and sell things. . . . [T]heir friends were not flooding the stalls anymore. And I lost half the group.â Many of the students who signed up were academically smart. The business was the first thing they had struggled with at school and it was a struggle on a very public stage in front of their peers. The students could not manage the embarrassment created when non-participating students harassed the participating learners and laughed at them. After a few weeks the participating learners would give excuses such as âI have to quit. My mom does not want me to do this.â But Mjo knew the learnersâ decisions had nothing to do with their parents; rather their decision was a result of peer pressure to conform and fear of public embarrassment.This feedback tested Mjoâs assumptions. She realized that âpeople donât care about an idea; it means nothing.â Mjo had to abandon her innovative ideas and begin to identify and focus on the real problems and how she could solve them. While thinking through her next steps Mjo continued with the career guidance work but this was proving less and less satisfying because her participating learners could not access the funds to study further. After four years along this new path Mjo realized that her passion and skills were truly in developing young entrepreneurs despite its challenges. A Revised Entrepreneurship ProgramIn 2015 Mjo started her second new schools-based program. This time students would be required to start their own newspaper secure advertising write the stories and demonstrate their ability to achieve something they could never have envisioned doing. The program gave under-resourced students experience in working together to achieve something extraordinary. It helped them build gritâa value associated with life success. The program also gave students digital experience and improved their English and writing skills. And because the newspaper was sustainably financed by advertising it was an example of how to start oneâs own business. Mjo started getting calls from the media and she was profiled by Lead SA a well-respected leadership initiative. This was an exciting time; the new program met many objectives and needs. But Mjo again faced many of the same hurdles associated with working in township schools. English proficiency was low and while improving it was a goal of the project non-participating students would buy the newspaper and ridicule any errors. An underlying culture existed that opposed success. Mjo was frustrated that âpeople believed it was better if we all stay[ed where we were and didnât] get better.âWhen the newspaper covered a story about the school teachers not doing what was required the school shut the newspaper and the program down. Mjo was devastated. By July 2015 she was finished. She had nothing left to give. For four and a half years she had pursued her dream of working in and facilitating youth development. She had made an impact through her facilitation and the first two programs of Beyond the Lemonade Stand. She had also learned a lot. She knew from experience that participating learners and young people had to pay for the service she provided. âIf they donât have skin in the game it is so easy for them to walk awayâ she said. She told people âYou do them [young people] no service by giving them things for free.âDespite her short-term success and learning there was nothing sustainable. Mjo felt like she had been ill-equipped for the challenges of the entrepreneurial journey she had chosen. She noted âThere is the assumption that because you are smart you are supposed to âget itâ and work things out faster. It is embarrassing to be struggling.â She knew she had to pick herself up and start again.Finding a sustainable business model Disheartened Mjo took a break to reconsider her options. She realized deep down that the development of young entrepreneurs was still her passion and her calling. She also realized that despite the challenges her programs were having impact. But the not-for-profit path had its problems. Mjo had learned that an organization could attract sympathy support but that this was not sustainable because âit creates a false sense of progress where you feel like you are getting somewhere. But it keeps you on the wrong track. You need to rather articulate how organizations can benefit from funding you.â Toward the end of 2015 Mjo abandoned the non-profit dream and re-registered Beyond the Lemonade Stand as a for-profit business. She hoped a stronger focus on financial sustainability would help her build a larger organization and have more impact. She re-positioned herself for new funding and support. In November 2015 during Global Entrepreneurship Week Mjo began reaching out to teenagers who were already running businesses. From her experience she knew the value of supporting those who were already helping themselves. She developed and ran Johannesburgâs first teen entrepreneurship festival. The festival was sponsored by the city government Red Bull GmbH Levi Strauss & Co. Enke (an aligned non-profit) Old Mutual plc (a large South African financial services company) and Wits Business School (one of the countryâs top graduate business schools). Mjo had over 40 teen business owners participate in the festival and she selected the top 20 to compete for cash prizes. It was a very successful and well-publicized initiative. In early 2016 Mjo settled on three core offerings that she would take to the market. These included advisory work in the youth entrepreneurship development field access to markets for teen and youth-led companies and project execution for sponsors interested in youth entrepreneurship. This focus helped her build new momentum. In July 2016 as Mjo focused on marketing and expanding her business she hired her first full-time employee. She had a number of key clients and a group of experienced part-time facilitators working across different projects. Beyond the Lemonade Stand was now in a strong position for growth.Strategic choicesAs Mjo left Alexandra that day in August 2016 she knew Beyond the Lemonade Stand was in a stronger position than a year earlier when the school newspaper project had closed. Although she had built an innovative social business with a strong reputation with funders communities and other stakeholders she could feel the personal and organizational tension around some strategic choices.Mjo was worn down and frustrated by the challenges of working in Johannesburgâs townships. These isolated neighbourhoods were where black South Africans had been forced to live during apartheid. Despite the democratic changes in the country these areas were still mostly poor. Youth unemployment averaged over 50 per cent. Alexandra was one of the very few historic urban areas where black South Africans could own property under the segregation of apartheid. Alexandrians were proud of their neighbourhood but it was a harsh place. Since the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy in 1994 and as the country normalized hundreds of thousands of poor immigrants from around South Africa and the region had made Alexandra their home. But Alexandra was small covering an area of only 6.9 square kilometres and many people lived crammed into shacks and the backrooms of established houses. The area was noisy vibrant and filled with a wide mix of cultures. Mjoâs day in Alexandra was particularly illustrative of the challenges of working in townships. Attendance at the workshop had been disappointing. Only a quarter of the 40 children who registered showed up and the teacher who had agreed to support the program was nowhere in sight. This typified Mjoâs extensive experience with many township schools. She wanted desperately to disrupt the status quo and make an impact on these studentsâ lives. They needed it most but she felt that the students did not appreciate what she had to offer and the peer pressure to âplay it coolâ subverted Mjoâs efforts. Working in such highly dysfunctional contexts made her consider alternatives. Over the last year better-functioning and private schools in middle-class areas had been phoning Mjo; they were willing to pay for her services and provide all the support she needed to be effective. In these environments nothing would get in the way of her having a real impact. In addition her work with established teen entrepreneurs offered Mjo an opportunity to leverage their success and take them to new levels.Now as she drove out of Alexandra Mjo wondered about shifting focus to better paying and potentially more impactful school groups. Just a few miles in front of Mjo as she drove out of Alexandra was Sandton the sanitized suburban home of almost all of the large corporate head offices for South Africa. It was known as the richest square mile on the African continent. South Africa had some of the highest rates of economic inequality in the world and the short drive that Mjo took that day starkly demonstrated this.The choice facing Mjo cut deep into her personal value system. She had left a high-potential corporate career in financial services to follow her calling. Sustaining that calling was crucial in the long term. Mjo wondered how best to sustain herself and use the organization to have the social impact she desired.

Machacek was the owner and managing director of SÄBU Holzbau GmbH (SÄBU) a construction company in Bavaria Germany with around 40 employees and €7.5 million in yearly turnover. SÄBU specialized in erecting public buildings using an innovative prefabricated module construction technology. Three key employees had just decided to leave the company. One of them had worked at SÄBU for 19 years.Machacek had been feeling lonely in her management position for a while. She had been making all the important decisions on her own because she feared incurring too much risk or spending too much money. The consequence was that she was caught in the operative business to such an extent that development projects in different parts of the company could not be implemented due to the number of issues that remained undecided. Moreover Machacek received a lot of negative feedback from customers because the company was unable to meet the agreed deadlines. As a consequence customers also began to question the invoices that they received and payment morale decreased considerably. Employees were also disgruntled complaining that they did not know what they were allowed to do and not do. One of the former employees succinctly summarized the situation at SÄBU in one word: “chaos—there was a constant loss of information people were getting loud in meetings and customers were sending furious e-mails.” Together with a colleague the former employee had tried to address the chaos in the distribution of tasks and in the internal communication several times but it was all in vain. Finally he did not feel able to cope with the situation anymore and resigned. After the third key employee left SÄBU Machacek knew that she urgently needed to find a way to lead the company out of its crisis situation.ABOUT SÄBU HOLZBAU GMBHIn 1924 Jakob Buchen founded the Buchen Sawmill (Sägewerk Buchen in German abbreviated as SÄBU) in Morsbach in the German state of North Rhine-Westfalia. Over the following decades the company restructured and extended its product portfolio several times. Product offerings included for example wooden storage boxes prefabricated wooden houses garden sheds and construction trailers. To extend market coverage a new plant was opened in Ebenhofen in Southern Germany in the 1960s. Wilhelma Klein the founder’s daughter took over leadership of the new plant which was soon legally and economically separated from the founding firm becoming SÄBU Holzbau GmbH. During the 1990s this company specialized in turnkey projects based on innovative timber construction systems used especially for public sector buildings such as schools childcare facilities and administrative offices. The company also constructed high quality log houses—a business area that was later abandoned.Machacek became managing director of the company in 1998. About the same time Friedrich Nagel joined SÄBU. He soon took over the role of an authorized officer for the company. Colleagues described the second member of SÄBU’s top management team as “a very creative and innovative person” and as “a tinkerer who always tries to find new technical solutions and improvements.” Nagel was one of the main driving forces behind the development of SÄBU’s innovative modular timber construction system. With the new system the company prefabricated walls ceilings and base elements. These elements could then be combined in the plant into complete building modules. This enabled SÄBU to realize larger projects in short construction periods—shorter even than those of competitors that worked with steel modules. SÄBU also made further leaps forward by developing construction systems based on innovative combinations of the building materials timber concrete and steel.INNOVATIVE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGYTimber construction systems hybrid construction and modular designs were the three main pillars of the innovative SÄBU building concept.In timber construction systems parts of the building were industrially prefabricated thus reducing costs and building time. A further advantage of this construction method was the ability to produce parts of the building independent of weather conditions under constant temperatures and under continuous quality control. It was also possible to integrate sanitary heating and electrical installations as well as windows and insulation layers directly in the plant. This enabled SÄBU to erect functional buildings in extremely short construction periods with low levels of emissions and noise exposure.SÄBU was a pioneer in the field of hybrid construction in which the excellent insulating properties and ecological advantages of timber were combined with the advantages of concrete and steel in strength fire protection and acoustic protection. The building shell consisted of timber elements while the ceilings were made out of concrete a building material that could bridge large spans and function as a heat reservoir. SÄBU’s hybrid construction method generated buildings that excelled in energy efficiency and met Germany’s high standards for passive houses (zero-energy buildings).The company’s modular designs used room modules that were made with a primary supporting framework of timber or steel. The modules could be flexibly combined facilitating rapid and cost-efficient construction of individually adapted functional buildings. There were however two major preconditions for the system to work effectively: precise planning and exact coordination of all production and assembly steps. The modular construction system was particularly suitable for extending buildings adding stories and dismantling and relocating buildings.ENVIRONMENTAL AND QUALITY MANAGEMENTAt SÄBU traditional craftsmanship was combined with modern manufacturing processes. The company generally used construction materials that were environmentally friendly and did not have harmful effects on health. For example all timber that was used came from sustainable PEFC-certified forestry sources. Other building materials also needed to meet high environmental standards by means of an environmental product declaration.SÄBU’s management was always striving to systematically ensure that the company’s products and processes conformed with high quality standards. Examples included comprehensive inspection of incoming goods and extensive supervision of the construction by a project manager at the building site. Twice a year the processed materials were checked in unannounced external quality controls that were conducted by an independent officially accredited testing institute. Assembly at the building site was also externally assessed on a voluntary basis. SÄBU had received an external quality assurance certification for industrialized building and pre-fabricated houses.WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERSSÄBU’s primary customers were in the public sector. The competitive tendering procedures were conducted based on legal regulations. Price was usually one of the main deciding criteria. With its innovative hybrid construction technology SÄBU was able to match the prices of much larger competitors at the same or even a higher quality level.The management of SÄBU closely monitored market trends. Tenders in the public sector were analyzed to understand customer requirements and trends. If it was possible to meet the requirements of a tender with the SÄBU hybrid construction system in a cost-efficient way the company would make a calculation and submit an offer.SÄBU offered fixed prices and completion dates. When the company made a submission for a tender it committed to consulting the customer in a clear and honest way. During this phase it was critically important to impress upon the customer that it would be working with a very competent partner if it chose to work with SÄBU. Therefore the company had a highly qualified sales team whose members considered themselves to be a technical complement to the customer’s organizational structures. From the very beginning when an order was received members of the planning team were included in the communication with the customer.SÄBU was almost exclusively working as a general contractor. The customers ordered turnkey buildings and SÄBU was a single source for all construction services. To complete the building in time and in the agreed quality a team of engineers technicians carpenters joiners and commercial employees needed to co-operate in a well-coordinated way. In addition SÄBU needed to closely co-operate with partner firms that were responsible for different construction services such as electrical and sanitary installations. The suppliers and subcontractors were selected not only on the basis of price but also on the basis of their reliability and quality. SÄBU preferred to work in long-term partnerships. “Thus the partners know what we are expecting of them and we know that we can rely on them” Machacek explained.“I CANNOT WORK LIKE THIS ANYMORE”After three key employees left the company SÄBU’s top management team realized that there was an urgent need for change. “I wanted to move forward and Christine Machacek said ‛yes’ but she did not do ‛yes’” said Nagel. “I sold too many products and that is how we overburdened the employees. They simply could not manage it anymore.” Nagel wanted innovation and growth while Machacek preferred to be on the safe side and avoid taking risks. He noted “I always wanted to accelerate and she was constantly on the brake.”The problems at work continued to haunt Machacek at night. One night she had a dream in which Nagel said to her “I have a new company car. Let us go for a drive.” He sped up into the mountains driving around dangerous curves. Machacek was terrified and indeed the car was too fast and eventually left the roadway. The car went down the slope but luckily it got stuck so that both were able to leave the car unharmed. After climbing back up to the road Nagel just said “Mrs. Machacek we have a meeting. We need a new car.”Nagel was astonished when Machacek told him about her dream. As it happened he also had a dream at the same time. In Nagel’s dream he was travelling to a business meeting in Stuttgart on a small motorbike. The motorbike first had a flat tire and then also ran out of fuel so that Nagel was unable to make it to the meeting on time. “My interpretation of this dream” said Nagel “is that the owner–manager was unable to provide me with the necessary resources to perform well in my job.”At that point in time Machacek realized that something needed to be fundamentally changed in the company. “I cannot work like this anymore” she thought. “All the decisions are piling up here with me—all the problems the overload.” Was there a way out? “I will never let consultants into my house” was one of Machacek’s maxims that the SÄBU team had heard over and over again. For the first time Machacek considered whether she should abandon her own precept.

Copyright Â© 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-28At the end of April 2015 Rui Zhang founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Chunyu Yisheng (Chunyu) was trying to decide how to create long-term business value and a loyal user base for his company. Chunyu which Zhang had founded in July 2011 was a Chinese mobile health application (app) that connected patients with doctors over the Internet. Its business model was based on providing a health care question-and-answer (Q&A) service by telephonic and online consultation with doctors. By the end of 2014 the Chunyu app had been downloaded 19.18 million times from four main Android app stores in China. However Zhang knew that he could not afford to be complacent with the appâs download volume because he was facing a series of issues that needed to be overcome. First the biggest challenge for Chunyu was to become profitable. Since its creation in 2011 Chunyu had been losing a significant amount of money each year. By the end of 2014 Chunyuâs loss for the year was expected to reach CNÂ¥10 million. Second insights gained by in-app data analytics over the previous three years indicated to Zhang and his team that usersâ engagement and retention rates were relatively low. Recognizing this low user loyalty they decided to move beyond just measuring application downloads and focus on building a sustained active user base for Chunyu. The third challenge was the increasing number of mobile health (m-health) apps which was rapidly increasing competition. A fiercely competitive market along with low revenues and high expenses was forcing Chunyu to create additional revenue streams to become profitable in the future. Zhang had much to worry about but the most significant concern was finding a cost-effective and long-term value-creation model. The question was should Chunyu rebuild its current online-consultancy-based model or move to an alternative business model?BACKGROUND The Global M-Health MarketThe Global Observatory of the World Health Organization defined m-health as âmedical and public health practices supported by mobile devices.â In recent years the global m-health market had increased rapidly. In 2010 the m-health market was valued at US$1.7 billion and was projected to reach more than $4.1 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent. With the increased adoption of smartphones as well as continued global venture investment into the digital health care market the number of m-health apps had grown steadily over the previous few years. As of June 2013 over 97000 health apps were available in the top app stores worldwide and this number was projected to grow approximately 23 per cent over the next five years. The Rise of Mobile Health in ChinaThe Chinese health care system despite its lengthy process of reforms still faced several critical issues. For instance doctors were overworked and underpaid and while urban community health centres and county hospitals were underdeveloped and inefficiently utilized general hospitals in big cities remained overcrowded. Patientâdoctor mistrust was widespread and unnecessary patient visits to well-known hospitals regardless of the severity of illness were common.In response to these emerging problems new technologies had evolved in the Chinese health care system over the previous decade. For example the smartphone app for patient health and fitness was one of the recent technologies influencing the Chinese health care industry. Mobile health apps enabled patients to access information about health care facilities communicate and schedule appointments with doctors remotely and order prescribed medications online. At the same time m-health apps provided doctors with real-time access to patientsâ medical records and facilitated monitoring patientsâ symptoms such as blood pressure heart rate and nutrition habits. Meanwhile the massive demand for online health care services in China attracted significant interest and investment from leading foreign enterprises. For example in April 2014 Virtual Radiologic (vRad) the largest telemedicine company in the US market signed a strategic partnership agreement with E-Techco Group a Chinese high-tech firm providing cloud-based personalized health management. In addition over the preceding few years leading Chinese tech giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. had invested millions of dollars in the Chinese online health care industry.According to a report by Research and Markets Chinaâs m-health market was worth Â¥ 2.21 billion in 2013 and was expected to reach Â¥19.05 billion by the end of 2018. Another report from the ChinaâBritain Business Council said China would be the worldâs second-largest m-health market by the end of 2017. Government support also could be credited for the rise of the m-health market. Over the preceding few years the Chinese government had intensified its efforts to promote online health care and telemedicine. For example in 2012 the National Health Commission (then the Ministry of Health) invested over $9.5Â billion to develop electronic medical records and advance hospital information systems. In the latter half of 2014 Chinaâs central government made a series of announcements to regulate telemedicine and online sales of pharmaceuticals. In July 2014 Beijingâs municipal government and Baidu Inc. a leading Chinese Internet company jointly launched a cloud-based health-management system to offer pre-diagnosis assessments for users. Government agencies such as China International Capital Corporation Ltd. China Venture Capital Association and the China Development Bank were also providing funding support to new start-ups in the m-health market.CHUNYU: THE COMPANY Zhang together with Boyi Zeng and Guanghui Li founded Chunyu. Zhang was a former director of the Beijing Times news centre and deputy editor-in-chief at NetEase. Moving from the Beijing Times to NetEase then to Chunyu Zhang precisely grasped the opportunities that the Internet revolution presented. He handled overall management of the company while his two co-founder friends handled other essential company matters. Li previously general manager of China Gamma Group Ltd. based in Hong Kong was more inclined toward supervising day-to-day operations while Zeng who had worked at NetEase preferred to manage the application-development team.Zhang banked on the Internet to fulfill his vision of âresolving health care problems with innovative models.â The vision was realized through a smartphone application that offered a free health care Q&A service and five value-added services at a premium including âquick callâ online consultation telephonic consultation personal doctor service and private consultation scheduling (see Exhibit 1). MAJOR PLAYERS IN the CHINESE M-HEALTH MARKET As a first mover in the Chinese m-health market Chunyu developed a basic business model for online health care services but faced powerful competitors such as Kuai Su Wen Yi Sheng Ping An Good Doctor HaoDF Online and DXY.Kuai Su Wen Yi ShengKuai Su Wen Yi Sheng was one of the top remote-consultation apps in the Chinese m-health market. Zhuhai Healthcare Cloud Technology Co. Ltd. launched the app in May 2012. The app provided three types of services: remote diagnosis medication guidance and appointments with doctors. Kuai Su Wen Yi Shengâs business model resembled that of Chunyu. By October 2014 Kuai Su Wen Yi Sheng had amassed 13 million registered users and 60000 qualified doctors handling an average of more than 10 million daily queries.Ping An Good Doctor Ping An Good Doctor another remote-consultation app was officially launched on April 21 2015 by the Ping An Insurance Company of China Ltd. which was the first integrated financial services conglomerate in China. Specifically Ping An Good Doctor followed Chunyuâs business model while it developed its own model. The Ping An app provided one-on-one consultations with doctors. The app was also equipped with an online drugstore providing details on medications and other health care products. HaoDF OnlineHaoDF Online was one of Chinaâs first disease management and post-surgery rehabilitation apps. Founded in 2006 HaoDF Online was also the first mobile application in China to provide free online medical advisory services appointments with doctors and follow-up services. Moreover HaoDF Online was credited with introducing Chinaâs first online hierarchical appointment and referral system to resolve problems with long queues in general hospitals. By using this hierarchical appointment and referral system the HaoDF platform classified patients based on the severity of their illnesses. Less sick patients were treated at community medical centres while those needing more serious care were sent to general hospitals. Importantly HaoDF Online equipped its patients with the power to vote for their favourite doctors based on the patientâs service experience. DXYDXY was one of the largest online health care service communities for health care professionals. Founded in 2000 by Li Tiantian the portal offered an extensive database of popular health and medical articles. DXY similar to Chunyu also offered online consultations with doctors and guidance on choosing hospitals. In addition to allowing users to check a drugâs authenticity and other detailed information DXY enabled users to locate nearby pharmacies providing accurate contact information and comprehensive data related to drug manufacturers. CHUNYUâS PATH TO GROWTH When Chunyu was founded no one on the management team except Zhang was familiar with the health care industry. Through frequent chats with his father a long-time doctor Zhang had learned about the difficulties that Chinese patients encountered as well as the general challenges facing the Chinese health care system. Chunyuâs strategy for growth remained consistent over the years whereas products and pricing schemes were being fine-tuned regularly. According to Li Chunyuâs chief operating officer Chunyu progressed through three distinct development phases: application development resource gathering and commercialization. Product Development and the Freemium ModelIn the first six months following Chunyuâs inception four critical advancements were made in funding product development and global recognition. A few months dragged on with financing problems then on November 1 2011 Chunyu raised $3 million in a Series A round of funding from BlueRun Ventures a US-based venture capital firm (see Exhibit 2). During that same month with great zeal and effort Chunyu completed development of its first mobile app and launched it for iOS (Apple) devices. Two months later Chunyu launched an Android version. Within six months of the appâs launch from November 2011 to April 2012 the app was downloaded approximately one million times. The Chunyu app was recognized in 2012 with a Microsoft BizSpark award a global support program for start-up companies engaged in software development and technical support.By August 2013 the number of users registered in Chunyu reached 12 million with 5000 registered doctors and 400000 active users. During that same year Chunyu was recognized as one of the top 50 most innovative Chinese business. The app itself was free for patients and doctors to download. After registration patients could access two free services. One service was for asking health care questions on the platform and the other provided one free 90-second phone consultation with a doctor daily. As time passed Zhang felt Chunyu could no longer afford to provide these free services. The challenge was that for the free services Chunyu was paying doctors about Â¥500000 each month on behalf of its users. For Chunyu this expense presented a significant barrier to becoming profitable. Zhang learned over time that while these payments that Chunyu made to its service providers provided immediate benefits to the company in the long run they proved to be challenging. Thus he wondered how he should address this issue. As a leader in the Chinese m-health market Zhang was well aware of the performance of other market players. HaoDF an online platform established five years earlier which allowed users to search for and book appointments with doctors faced a less severe profit challenge because it began charging its users for telephonic consultations in 2013.Another challenge that attracted Zhangâs attention was the small fraction of active users on the platform: by August 2013 the platform had only 400000 active users compared with 12 million registered users. Zhang recognized that it was still relatively common for users to download the Chunyu app use it once then remove it from their smartphone. Thus Zhang and his team were keenly interested in learning more about loyalty-building hurdles.Creativity and Innovation: Keys to Unlocking Value and ProfitabilityAs time passed Zhang began to get frustrated. He recognized that the companyâs existing services were not generating sufficient revenue to keep up with the growing expenses so he decided to be more creative in his thinking about developing paid services commercially viable products and a profitable business model. However the process of introducing paid services and creating commercially viable products was not an easy task for Zhang. He expressed his concerns in an interview with NetEase: âI fear that users would be annoyed if you actually charged them and then they would abandon you.â Thus Zhang postponed commercialization until the end of 2013 and strived to continue with the existing business model and services. After two-and-a-half years of exploration while suffering losses Chunyu finally took a step toward commercialization: in December 2013 it introduced monthly and annual subscriptions for users. In the updated version users could subscribe to the membership services which cost Â¥8 per month or Â¥88 per year. Unlike the free services membership enabled users to consult with doctors with no limitations on consultation frequency and the response time was guaranteed to be no more than 30 minutes. Chunyu did not publicize these features and incorporated them only in the latest version of the application. Besides generating additional revenues for Chunyu the membership system was expected to provide three additional benefits. First participating doctors could draw stable part-time income from Chunyuâs platform. Second users could acquire more reliable health care services. Finally the system would unlock commercial value for Chunyu. Later in May 2014 Chunyu updated its application with five value-added services: Quick Call (users paid Â¥15 to initiate a call request but could not request a specific doctor); Online Consultation (users could schedule an online consultation with a particular doctor); Telephonic Consultation (users could schedule a telephone consultation up to 15 minutes long with a specific doctor); Personal/Private Doctor Service (users were allowed unlimited online and telephone consultations with a particular doctor); and Personal Consultation Scheduling (users could schedule face-to-face services in hospitals). Meanwhile in August 2014 Chunyu announced the completion of a Series C funding round raising $50 million. Two months later Chunyu launched yet another updated version of its app and this one integrated with a patient remote monitoring device. It allowed physicians to access patientsâ electronic health records such as medical history treatment plans and laboratory test results. That same year Chunyu earned three top awardsâone identified Chunyu as a best start-up company another acknowledged Chunyu as having the best mobile medical app and the third recognized Chunyuâs contributions as an innovative health industry Internet company in China. Chunyu had an impressive strategy of providing free medical information additional medical services with a subscription and finally value-added services at a premium. However in addition to building a reasonable base of loyal users and doctors who could produce long-term value in the application more business models needed to be investigated to address the profitability challenge and make the application more commercial.The Decision to Appoint a Chief Marketing OfficerThe main challenge for Chunyu came from its business model. Zhang reflected âWe tried membership services and value-added services but all seemed to be less successful in capturing long-term value. They were unable to build a strong connection between the platform and its users.â The CEO wondered whether he had overlooked something that meant Chunyu was unable to achieve profitable growth.As Chunyu continued to grow Zhang recruited more experts. In October 2014 aiming to capture the desired commercial value for the application and to build a long-term connection between the platform and its users Zhang appointed Chengping Liu as chief marketing officer (CMO) responsible for commercialization. Liuâs approach was to use commercialization to build a long-term and robust connection between the platform and its users. After a detailed analysis of in-app data Liu noted: There was a weak connection between the platform and its users; therefore it would be impossible to capture commercial value. It was hard to commercialize Chunyuâs online inquiry services wherein the patients interact with different doctors every time leading to patient dissatisfaction. Premium services were also unsuccessful in capturing the desired commercial value due to patientâdoctor mistrust. The commercial value could only be created if patients trusted doctors and were willing to pay the long-term subscription fees.Under these circumstances Liu contributed by introducing a ranking system for doctors and users. The Chunyu system identified the top-rated doctors based on usersâ reviews and the top-ranked users who frequently used the application and were willing to pay for the services. The CMO used this system to work on the âbrand effectâ of individual doctors. In addition Liu developed a fee-determination mechanism enabling doctors to set charges for their services. THE ROAD AHEADThe fee-determination system became more widely accepted and the brand effect of affiliated doctors showed steady growth. By March 2015 Chunyu had amassed 45000 registered doctors addressing on average 60000 queries a day. Chunyu also was among the top players in the industry well on its way to realizing its vision of resolving health problems with innovative models. However Zhang knew that the road ahead would present him with more choices and challenges. As a first mover in the Chinese m-health market Chunyu developed a well-established market share and competitive advantages but Zhang wondered what the next step should be. How should Chunyu address the concerns that the CMO had raised? How could Chunyu sustain its revenue and reduce profitability pressures in a competitive market?EXHIBIT 1: CHUNYU consultation charges Note: Â¥ = CNÂ¥ = Chinese yuan renminbi; US$1 = Â¥6.206 as of December 31 2014.Source: âSpring Rain Allows Doctors to Set Own Pricesâ Marbridge Consulting April 29 2014 accessed March 27 2017 www.marbridgeconsulting.com/marbridgedaily/201430/article/74632/spring_rain_allows_doctors_to_set_own_prices.exhibit 2: CHunyu financial SupportNote: * In USD; US$1 = CNÂ¥6.206 as of December 31 2014.

The newly improved variant claimed that it �tastes more like Coke looks more like Coke.� The company�s aim was to encourage more cola fans to consume less sugar and choose the sugar-free version. To ensure that it received all the visibility it could afford Coca-Cola Great Britain (CCGB) backed the relaunch with a massive �10 million (US$12.9 million) marketing campaign. When Coca-Cola first launched Coke Zero in June 2005 it was the company�s most successful new-product launch since the launch of Diet Coke in 1982. But a 2016 consumer-research survey in the United Kingdom revealed that 50 per cent of the surveyed population was unaware of Coke Zero�s unique selling proposition�that it was sugar-free. In addition many also complained that its taste was not similar enough to the original Coca-Cola Classic. For a successful turnaround it became essential for the CCGB management to draft a new strategy based on the complete value management cycle encompassing the three challenging phases of value creation value communication and value capturing. The diligently crafted strategy could become the foundation for Coca-Cola to replicate the relaunch in other markets. However the company�s biggest ever marketing investment was accompanied by three major challenges�one at each of the three dimensions of the value-management cycle. It was necessary to develop a product�needs framework template for the relaunch of Coke Zero which could be used to identify the differentiating values. The template might then become a major point in the development of a new value communication strategy for Coke Zero. ABOUT COKE ZERO Coke Zero was added to Coca-Cola�s portfolio when the hunt began for a next-generation no-calorie drink that appealed to male consumers. Most men considered Diet Coke a woman�s drink so Coke Zero was launched mainly to target the young (19�34 years old) male demographic who wanted a zero-calorie cola with the same taste as Coca-Cola Classic. Katie Bayne Coca-Cola North America�s president and general manager of sparkling beverages admitted �there was a clear gap in what we were offering. No one was giving this younger male target what they wanted.� The new product was thus positioned and packaged specifically as a substitute for Coca-Cola Classic and aimed at men who wanted to take care of their bodies without being deprived of the pleasure of Coke. Coke Zero was launched in 2005 in white cans and bottles to occupy a distinct position on the retail shelf space. However its overall design theme was considered too �feminine� and incompatible with the interests of its intended audience. Coke Zero�s initial promotion tagline �Everybody Chill� also created some confusion among its target group. Aiming to avoid confusion Coca-Cola South Pacific launched Coke Zero in 2006 with the more masculine-styled black cans which more effectively reached its target audience (young males). The U.S. Coca-Cola team quickly replicated the success of the Australian (South Pacific) market and adopted the black packaging with a factual tagline �Real Coca-Cola Taste and Zero Calories.�In 2007 America Online (AOL) labelled Coke Zero the �second-hottest� product of the year after the iPhone and the new drink was retailed across 159 countries. The Coke Zero product line had four variants: Coke Zero Caffeine-Free Coke Zero Coke Cherry Zero and Coke Vanilla Zero. Not all four variants were sold globally however. Their market presence was predominantly grounded on the basis of regional factors. THE RELAUNCH AND ASSOCIATED CHALLENGESThe Coke Zero relaunch was primarily driven by a need to dispel confusion about the product�s sugar-free quality and to offer a closer-to-Classic-Coke taste. The finding that five out of 10 consumers in Great Britain were unaware of Coke Zero�s unique sugar-free quality prompted CCGB to completely overhaul Coke Zero. The introduction of a �sugar tax� in the United Kingdom encouraged consumers to seek a cola with a similar taste to the original Coca-Cola Classic but without the sugar content. Marketing consultants felt that the reformulation and rebranding of Coke Zero disrupted its value cycle making it essential to manage the associated challenges for the launch to be effective. The value-management cycle involved three interrelated components: value creation value communication and value capturing. Value creation involved enhancing the customer�s perceived value of the product or service. Value communication involved various marketing strategies to effectively convey enhanced value. Value capturing was the process of attaining the desired outcome based on the first two phases. The effective execution of each phase was imperative to ensure a holistic business performance.THE VALUE MANAGEMENT CYCLEValue CreationThe initial component of the value management cycle was value creation an ongoing activity in the Coca-Cola business culture. Value creation was defined as the total savings monetary gain or satisfaction that the customer received from the product or service. The value created was estimated using a metric called economic value estimation which was the sum of a reference value and a differentiating value (positive or negative). Coca-Cola�s reference value was derived from the next best competing alternative traditional soft drink and included the ability to assist digestion stop nausea offer a sugar rush and sustain concentration. Differentiating values were explored using a variety of metrics; however one of the acknowledged approaches involved mapping customer needs against product characteristics. This process was referred to as the product�needs framework. Product innovation formed the core of Coca-Cola�s strategy to offer differentiating value to its customers. The company consistently complied with the changing tastes preferences and lifestyles of its customers by periodically introducing new products. Indicative of that pursuit the launch of a Coca-Cola variant with a zero amount of sugar (i.e. Coke Zero) in 2005 was one of its many such significant milestones. Customers acknowledged value creation only when product characteristics appropriately matched their needs; however in the case of Coke Zero the hedonic needs did not meet their expectations. Some consumers raised concerns over Coke Zero tasting different from Coca-Cola Classic. One new aspect of the value creation framework involved reformulating Coke Zero to make it taste similar to Coca-Cola Classic but without the sugar. At the time 43 per cent of Coca-Cola products sold in the United Kingdom already contained little or no sugar. However the company aimed to increase its market share by 7 per cent by 2020 and the new taste of Coke Zero would help achieve that target. Jon Woods CCGB�s general manager explained the company�s strategy as follows: �Since 2012 our commercial strategy has focused on accelerating the growth of our no sugar options. We know that millions of people love the taste of Coca-Cola and have been working to refine the recipe of Coca-Cola Zero to match the taste of the original but without sugar.�Value CommunicationValue communication was the next phase in the value-management cycle. Whether the value created was incremental or radical its successful result needed to be effectively communicated among the product�s target markets. The company used a variety of different marketing strategies to communicate and position its new product offerings. Coca-Cola was available in four major variants: Coca-Cola Classic Coke Zero Coca-Cola Life and Diet Coke. Each variant created a unique value proposition for its customers. Coca-Cola Life was a low-calorie drink similar in taste to Coca-Cola Classic but Coke Zero and Diet Coke were both no-sugar and no-calorie drinks each with a different blend of flavours and a lighter taste.Coca-Cola leveraged the influence of its packaging specifically the packaging colour to communicate the distinct value of each variant. For example Coca-Cola Classic was red Coke Zero was black Coca-Cola Life was green and Diet Coke was silver. The different colour coding supported the notion that packaging acts as a �silent sales representative� in retail outlets to attract the attention of prospective buyers. However different packaging styles for an extensive product portfolio raised confusion among the different target markets. To counter this issue Coca-Cola used its value communication to introduce a one-brand strategy. The unified strategy was intended to inform consumers that all of the company�s different offerings belonged to one brand�Coca-Cola. The design united the four major variants. According to Marcos de Quinto the company�s chief marketing officer (CMO) the intention was to emphasize that Coca-Cola was a soft drink for everybody with various different options that shared the same values and visual appeal: �People want their Coca-Cola in different ways but whichever one they want they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and refreshment.�The one-brand strategy was complemented by one-brand packaging that included revitalized graphics and integrated visual identity by using the official Coca-Cola red colour as a unifying feature across the trademark. The red disc was Coca-Cola�s signature element according to de Quinto signifying �great taste uplift and refreshment.� Using brand integration and the familiar red packaging was the company�s attempt to amalgamate its one-brand strategy and bring all Coca-Cola products under one visual umbrella. The goal was to empower consumers to opt for the Coca-Cola variant of their choice be it calorific calorie-free caffeinated or non-caffeinated.James Sommerville vice-president of global design for Coca-Cola explained that this major brand unification effort using Coca-Cola�s iconic visual identity was the company�s first such endeavour in its 130-year history: �When applied across packaging retail equipment and experiential this new approach becomes a global design language that utilizes a historical brand icon to present the range of Coca-Cola products available today in a contemporary and simple way.�The one-brand strategy was launched as part of Coca-Cola�s Taste the Feeling campaign with the core message �The simple pleasure of drinking any Coca-Cola makes the moment more special.� At the launch ceremony in Paris the CMO mentioned that the company�s considerable investment to bring all Coca-Cola products under one iconic umbrella would assure customers that irrespective of their specific Coca-Cola�s calorie and caffeine content they would all be enjoying the �specialness of an ice-cold Coca-Cola.� The idea was to reinforce in people�s minds an equal attraction for the variant products as the brand itself. According to the CMO the company noticed that magnifying the Coca-Cola brand�s iconic status seemed to minimize the company�s status somehow as if the brand had become bigger than the company itself. The �bigness of Coca-Cola� claimed the CMO lay in �the fact that it�s a simple pleasure� and that the company�s bigness was directly proportional to its humility.Value CaptureThe improved value creation and effective value communication acted as vital antecedents for the organization to capture added value. Various metrics measured the added value to the company in terms of improved business share enhanced buyer willingness to pay and many other benefits. The actual essence of the added value to the company consisted of the trade-off between the benefits and the price or could be interpreted as the perceived benefit minus the perceived price. Therefore either increasing the perceived benefit or decreasing the perceived price or doing both would result in higher value and eventually a greater probability that customers would buy the product.Moving forwardThe enhanced value of unifying the product�s taste would broaden the potential target market thereby adding many more prospective consumer segments as potential buyers. The scope of the task entailed diligent attention on a wide range of activities including the need to draft a new segmentation and targeting framework. A product�needs framework template was also necessary for the relaunch of Coke Zero as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. That template could then help identify the differentiating values and develop a new value communication strategy for the new variant Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.The potential of the one-brand strategy seemed immense. It was highly likely that encapsulating every product line under one umbrella would allow for a spill-over effect from the high brand equity enjoyed by Coca-Cola Classic to other brands specifically to Coca-Cola Zero Sugar while seeking a complete transformation. However the underperformance of any of the products under the umbrella brand would equally affect the parent brand image and equity. The new transformation strategy required Coca-Cola to sustain a parent brand image and equity. The new variant Coca-Cola Zero Sugar would act as a first-experience product for new buyers who would assess the product�s quality and benefits after the purchase. The benefits received from the new variant might be broadly classified as economic and psychological features. These two benefit dimensions would help develop a value communication matrix and probable strategies for effective positioning. Coke Zero�s reformulation positively influenced customers� value perception. However equally important was customers� price perception which the CCGB leadership team needed to manage to fully capture the value of the product. The leadership team was now given the task of developing a pricing architecture to highlight various strategies that would influence buyer perception.endnotes

At that time the team was focused on delivering health care services for the rural and urban slum poor in Bangladesh. Substantial progress in health care service delivery was achieved through Shasthya Shebikas female community health workers. Although the director acknowledged the substantial contribution of the Shasthya Shebikas in delivering health care services she was concerned with the enormity of the task. Motivating and retaining the Shasthya Shebikas was a challenge for BRAC. Afsana was also aware of the presence of other potential service delivery channels. The 2007 Bangladesh Health Watch report had suggested improving the skills of these alternative informal health care service providers; it had suggested this as a short-term solution to meeting the huge challenge of serving the rural poor. The health care delivery challenges BRAC faced in Bangladesh were quite unlike the challenges faced in developed countries. The rural poor in Bangladesh lacked education and were conservative and this affected the number of young women who volunteered to be a Shasthya Shebika. The Shasthya Shebikas were required to make house calls to promote and offer health care services a task that was not viewed favourably by the community nor quite often by their family. Some volunteers even dropped out when required to attend the mandatory residential training program. The socio-economic context of rural Bangladesh posed a problem not only for the supply side of health care service but also for the demand side. The rural poor preferred traditional healers and were reluctant to use the modern health care services. Given the unique challenges of delivering health care service to the rural poor in Bangladesh BRAC staff tried new methods and often improvised on the existing approach. BRAC faced two important issues in health care service delivery. One issue related to including unqualified local health care service providers in BRAC and the other related to strengthening the Shasthya Shebikas� health care service delivery channel. These issues led BRAC to ask whether it should examine the other health care service providers to determine if they could complement the work of the Shasthya Shebikas. If so which of the various types of health care service providers should BRAC consider? What steps should BRAC take to strengthen the Shasthya Shebika channel? What should BRAC do to motivate and retain the Shasthya Shebikas?BRAC and its ProgramsBRAC was founded by Sir Fazle Hasan Abed in 1972. Based in Bangladesh BRAC operated in 11 other countries through its international arm. It had more than 111000 employees providing health care financial and other social services to a population of over 138 million. Bangladesh had a predominantly rural population and 24.8 per cent of the country�s population was poor (see Exhibit 1). BRAC strived to reduce poverty through its programs in the areas of human and social empowerment education and health economic empowerment and enterprise development livelihood training environmental sustainability and disaster preparedness. Its business enterprises not only contributed to its revenues but also increased the effectiveness of its development programs. Of the total expenditure of US$904 million for the year ended December 31 2015 the contribution from BRAC�s donors was only $100 million (see Exhibit 2). Enterprises and microfinance helped reduce its dependency on donors for its development programs (see Exhibit 3).BRAC�s Health Nutrition and Population Program (see Exhibit 4) was one of its critical development programs. The program had many components which included Essential Health Care; Maternal Neonatal and Child Health services for rural and urban populations; Tuberculosis and Malaria Control programs; Nutrition; Eye Care; Mobile Health Intervention; Health Care Financing and Innovations; Non-communicable Disease programs; and BRAC Facility Based Services. Essential Health Care was the basic platform for all of BRAC�s health programs and the Shasthya Shebika delivery system was the low-cost method of BRAC�s health care service delivery. Shasthya Shebikas and their responsibilitiesBRAC had more than 117000 community health workers who worked part-time. These were the Shasthya Shebikas and they delivered basic health care services to rural consumers in Bangladesh and helped them to access public health care service. The Shasthya Shebikas also retailed health products. BRAC faced the challenge of attracting and sustaining Shasthya Shebikas; one published source indicated that their turnover rate was 15 to 20 per cent. One BRAC official believed that turnover rates varied over the years. According to her the turnover rates were closer to 10 per cent. Whenever BRAC launched a new project a large number of Shasthya Shebikas had to be recruited within a short period which sometimes resulted in a poor fit between the newly recruited Shasthya Shebikas and their task requirements. The poor fit could also be attributed to the initial identification and screening done at the community level. New recruits were required to attend a residential training program. And at this stage quite a few of them dropped out of the program. The Shasthya Shebikas were offered incentives for rendering health care services. Their earnings depended on their delivery of the mix of BRAC�s product and service offerings. It was important for BRAC to identify the mix of products and services that would not only meet BRAC�s objective of providing affordable health care but also provide financial incentives to motivate the Shasthya Shebikas. There were limitations on what could be sold through the Shasthya Shebikas. The territory covered by these women also influenced their income. The Shasthya Shebikas desired wide coverage which at times conflicted with the intensity of coverage that BRAC desired.The Shasthya Shebikas worked part-time visiting village households to deliver health care services (see Exhibit 5). They contributed to preventing diseases and promoting health through health education. They organized health education forums making house visits and spreading their message in community meetings. They spoke to villagers about family planning methods child health immunization pregnancy related care safe drinking water and sanitation personal hygiene nutrition tuberculosis and other topics. They also offered basic curative services. Shasthya Shebikas also provided treatment for common ailments such as diarrhea dysentery the common cold anemia and ringworm. For other ailments and cases that were beyond their capability the women referred patients to government or private health facilities. The Shasthya Shebikas also identified possible tuberculosis cases referring patients who had had a persistent cough for more than three weeks for sputum examination. The Shasthya Shebikas provided directly observed treatment short-course (known as DOTS) for the treatment of tuberculosis patients and performed follow-up of the treatment. They also sold over-the-counter drugs and health commodities. They encouraged villagers to access the primary health care facilities offered by the public health care system. It was observed that holding health education forums increased the sales of health care products and created demand for health care services. Managing the Shasthya ShebikasBRAC exercised care in recruiting and training the Shasthya Shebikas. It also regularly monitored the women�s performance and its compensation package was designed to motivate and retain them.RecruitmentThe Shasthya Shebikas were young women between the ages of 25 and 35 or older who were married and had no children under the age of two and who were required to have passed standard 8 (eight years of schooling; standard 1 started at age six) in school. They were also required to have an entrepreneurship mentality. The women of a community nominated a person from among themselves and the nominee had to be ratified at a meeting organized by the BRAC local office.5 If found eligible to be a Shasthya Shebika at the community level the nominee was given two days orientation by BRAC staff and sent to the field for one month. If the nominee performed well she was selected for training. After training she started working as a Shasthya Shebika.TrainingBRAC provided regular group training for the Shasthya Shebikas at its residential training centres. The batch size for training the newly recruited Shasthya Shebikas was 18 to 20. BRAC organized an initial three weeks of training on maternal and child health and nutrition immunization family planning water and sanitation communicable disease control and basic curative care for some common illnesses. The Shasthya Shebikas were also given training on specific topics such as nutrition intervention maternal and newborn child health reading glasses and others. A regular one-day refresher training was conducted once every three months by the program organizer Health at the local BRAC field office. As part of the refresher training new health and nutrition issues were discussed; in addition experiences were shared and problem-solving exercises were performed.MonitoringShasthya Kormis were community-based front line workers who supported the work of the Sasthya Shebikas. Each Shasthya Kormi worked in the catchment area of 10 Shasthya Shebikas and met with all of them twice a month. During field visits which they made six days a week the Shasthya Kormis reviewed the activities of the Shasthya Shebikas and provided health care services alongside them. The Shasthya Kormis also educated the rural population during the health education forums in the village organized by the Shasthya Shebikas.The Shasthya Kormis reported to the program organizer Health who was responsible for all of the health program activities that occurred in the catchment area of the field office. The Shasthya Kormis and the program organizer worked under the overall supervision of an upazila (sub-unit of a district) manager in an area. These upazila managers reported to district managers.As part of the quarterly refresher training session a work plan for the Shasthya Kormis for the following three months was prepared. The session was also used to check sales performances and replenish the stock of health products. The monthly performance report for the Shasthya Shebikas was generated at the field level by the Shasthya Kormis. Shasthya Shebikas� performance was assessed based on the number of patients they served and products they sold their attendance at refresher training the number of patients/clients they mobilized for immunization and so on. Shasthya Shebikas who did not take products from BRAC nor attend the refresher training were considered inactive.CompensationA Shasthya Shebika was an independent worker incentivized by BRAC. An example of the compensation for the rendering of health care services by a Shasthya Shebika was the payment she received every time she identified someone with tuberculosis and every time the identified patient completed a six-month course of tuberculosis medicines. The patient receiving the service paid the Shasthya Shebika for the service rendered. Health products were sold by the Shasthya Shebikas at a 10 to 15 per cent markup. BRAC provided interest-free working capital of up to 1000 taka for a regular Sasthya Shebika (one who received training on basic primary health care) and 4000�5000 taka for the upgrade/model Shasthya Shebika (one who received advanced training on non-communicable diseases care and eye care along with basic primary health care training). The income of Shasthya Shebikas was in the range of 500�1500 taka per month. They earned income by selling medicines and commodities and earned incentives from the sale of reading glasses the completed treatments of tuberculosis patients identifying pregnancies providing antenatal and postnatal care and the early initiation of breastfeeding (see Exhibit 6). Shasthya Shebikas received travel and meal allowances for attending quarterly refresher training sessions. About 1 to 2 per cent of Shasthya Shebikas reported earnings from health services outside BRAC.Motivating the Shasthya ShebikasWomen in Bangladesh volunteered for community work in order to gain social recognition and financial independence. Most of the women who joined the Shasthya Shebikas had no income-generating activity before becoming a Shasthya Shebika. Many of them approached BRAC on their own initiative to take up the position. For some of these women their job as a Shasthya Shebika was the main source of their household income. According to a BRAC official the factors influencing the performance of Shasthya Shebikas were community trust social recognition BRAC monitoring and motivation and income earned. A survey observed that the effort and performance of Shasthya Shebikas was greater when the household was dependent on their income. Shasthya Shebikas expected reasonable compensation for their efforts. In addition to monetary compensation the opportunity to provide a service social recognition and respect were given as important motivating factors by a significant number of Shasthya Shebikas.implications of product/service mix and territory size on incomeThe range of health care services offered by Shasthya Shebikas and the products they sold had implications on the income they earned. The influence of the product/service mix on income was observed in two situations. One was the introduction of new services by BRAC and the other was the effort by Shasthya Shebikas to increase the range of services and products they sold outside of BRAC�s product and service offering.Range of Offerings and Its Implications on Shasthya Shebikas� IncomeBRAC introduced the Maternal Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) pilot program in 2005. This program provided help during childbirth and care for the newborn. The additional services were rendered by the Shasthya Shebikas but because of this the territory they covered was reduced in order to increase effectiveness in the delivery of these health care services. The majority of Shasthya Shebikas attributed a perceived income reduction to the reduced territory. However 34 per cent of Shasthya Shebikas perceived an increase in income and of these women 73 per cent attributed the increase to the additional services offered under the MNCH program.Approximately 40 per cent of Shasthya Shebikas earned additional income by providing health care services outside of BRAC. That additional income came from referrals to health care facilities and from providing services such as neonatal care. A significant number of Shasthya Shebikas received training from external sources in addition to the training conducted by BRAC enabling them to offer the additional services. Some of the Shasthya Shebikas even purchased medicines from sources other than BRAC. An interesting observation was that those who had taken outside training ultimately worked with BRAC for a longer period. Territory Coverage and IncomeThe territory covered by Shasthya Shebikas was designed typically to include 400 households. Shasthya Shebikas spent their time on field visits for tuberculosis drug administration and primary health care from 7:00 a.m. until noon usually making 20 visits in a day six days a week. They ensured that they visited the households in their territory at least once in a month. Earlier the number of households that Shasthya Shebikas were required to visit was 300 but this was subsequently increased to 400. Under the MNCH program as mentioned above the territory of Shasthya Shebikas was reduced and they were required to visit only 150 households instead of 300 households. Efforts to retain Sasthya ShebikasBRAC invested a significant amount in creating and maintaining an effective team of Shasthya Shebikas and therefore the turnover of Shasthya Shebikas had cost implications for the organization. The cost incurred by BRAC when a Shasthya Shebika left the job was estimated to be $24. A reason for a Shasthya Shebika dropping out was that she considered the income insufficient for her effort. The increased literacy levels of a Shasthya Shebika and the availability of alternative employment opportunities for her also contributed to the turnover. There were other issues besides the issue of income including the competing demands on Shasthya Shebikas� time such as household work; the unfavourable light in which families and neighbours viewed these women�s taking up employment; and the difficulty the women faced because of people�s reluctance to seek advice on health problems from a local as opposed to a fully qualified practitioner.Some of the steps BRAC had taken to increase retention of Shasthya Shebikas included proper recruitment practices; improvements to the incentive system both monetary and non-monetary; and an increase of its product and service mix. In addition to this BRAC carried out an experiment to improve delivery of health care service and to address the retention issue by introducing the �model� Shasthya Shebika program in July 2010. A pilot study was carried out in the urban slums of Dhaka city in an effort to develop an improved cadre of Shasthya Shebikas based on performance. The model Shasthya Shebika was defined as having the additional requirement of being literate as well as owning and operating a grocery shop. The purpose of shop ownership was to enable Shasthya Shebikas to sell BRAC products in addition to rendering doorstep health care services. Ninety-four per cent of model Shasthya Shebikas perceived positive benefits after the program. Clients also gave positive feedback on the program with most of them indicating that the model Shasthya Shebika visited their home more than once in a month. Furthermore they believed that the model Shasthya Shebika had expertise in treating minor ailments.Shasthya Shebikas and competitionShasthya Shebikas offered heath care services to more than 100 million people mostly women. Most of them were from poor households but approximately 5 per cent were from well-off households. Around 40 per cent of Shasthya Shebikas� clients were BRAC village organization members. Shasthya Shebikas were approached with cases of anemia fever diarrhea and other ailments as well as for the purchase of medicines. The poor however also used the health care services provided by the informal sector. Poor use of the formal health care service was evidenced by the number of births that took place at home assisted by untrained attendants�one-third of all cases.Most Shasthya Shebikas perceived the presence of competition mostly from pharmacies and village doctors. Some Shasthya Shebikas indicated that the competition affected their income. A small but significant number of them also mentioned government hospitals as competitors. The unavailability of preferred brands of medicines and sometimes unavailability of the medicine itself was considered by some Shasthya Shebikas as their weakness compared to competing service providers. A sizeable number of Shasthya Shebikas who did not face challenges because of competition indicated that the presence of other health care service providers in their territory was low. Shasthya Shebikas suggested that their clients preferred them to other health care service providers because of the doorstep service and flexible payment options they provided. In addition to this many of their clients were female and preferred to buy most health products from other females. Familiarity and proximity were other reasons given for a preference for Shasthya Shebikas.A study of informal health service providers checked the quality of treatment provided by these service providers and observed that the quality of treatment by these village doctors and other informal service providers was poor. In most cases inappropriate drugs were prescribed. Although Shasthya Shebikas were not qualified medical practitioners they were trained to cure minor illnesses and to identify complex cases that required the attention of qualified physicians. The efficacy of their treatment was also due to the regular follow-ups they conducted. This was important because clients had a tendency to discontinue treatment and the BRAC program provided incentives both to patients and to Shasthya Shebikas to finish the treatment.Rural consumers and their preference for health care service providersAttracting and retaining Shasthya Shebikas was only one of the challenges BRAC faced. Another critical aspect related to the delivery of health care service in Bangladesh. In the rural areas of the country health care service delivery was carried out mostly by unqualified health care service providers. The presence of qualified medical professionals was minimal because there were only 7.7 qualified professionals per 10000 people. In contrast there were 64.2 unqualified medical practitioners per 10000 people. A review of the sector indicated that 60 per cent of the population generally patients in the lower income group sought the services of unqualified health care service providers. Studies that reviewed the health care service delivery system recommended enhancing the quality of care provided by the informal sector for the short term.According to a BRAC official �It is costly to have fully qualified medical practitioners and their availability is also limited. In the absence of qualified medical practitioners the informal health care service providers fill a need-gap. The second reason for their existence is that at least some of them do have reasonable skill levels. These practitioners can attend to small ailments but problems arise when they do not limit themselves to treating minor illnesses and also when complications arise.�About 60 per cent of the population sought the services of unqualified health care services providers and only a small percentage of people (13 per cent) used public health care services for treating illnesses. Different categories of health care providers existed (see Exhibit 7). However one study indicated that there was an increasing preference among consumers for getting treatment from qualified doctors.The health care seeking behaviour of rural consumers was examined by a BRAC University study that conducted in-depth interviews with 17 mothers from two villages. The study indicated that an important reason for rural consumers seeking unqualified service providers like �village doctors� for minor illnesses was proximity (see Exhibit 8). In addition to village doctors some consumers also visited faith healers for prayers. In the case that the illness worsened they then sought treatment from qualified physicians. Although these consumers recognized the superior treatment of the qualified physicians they did not seek qualified physicians in the initial stages because of the expense distance and loss of the day�s wages or income. The poor villager also favoured local practitioners because they did not always insist on immediate payment if the patient did not have money. In addition to cost and distance approachability and familiarity also mattered. The perception of the villagers was that they received attention from the local practitioner. They also found it easy to communicate with the local practitioner in contrast to their experience with public health care service providers. A study on patients� satisfaction with health care service providers and the factors influencing this indicated a higher rate of satisfaction with unqualified health care service providers. Satisfaction with the behaviour of unqualified practitioners was 90 per cent compared to satisfaction with the behaviour of government health care service practitioners at 56 per cent. Aspects that led to increased patient satisfaction included the explanation of the illness provided to the patient availability of medicines and reduced waiting time.According to a BRAC official education and awareness among rural women was increasing which created demand for formal allopathic medical practitioners. BRAC had noted this trend and was unsure about investing the effort in developing informal service providers even for short-term use. Also the income earned by some of these informal providers was much higher than the earnings of Shasthya Shebikas. Therefore some of the informal heath care service providers would not be a viable option for BRAC. Information on the income earned by other types of health service providers was also available (see Exhibit 9).IssuesThe manager of BRAC�s Health Nutrition and Population program indicated a need to revisit the community health worker model to further enhance the quality of service and to make it sustainable. This would involve creating a spirit of entrepreneurship among Shasthya Shebikas which according to the manager required improving the competency of the community health workers and increasing their income and motivation by exploring opportunities to enhance the basket of product and services offered by them. This would require training and increasing the women�s access to funds.The program manager faced the challenge of increasing incentives for the Shasthya Shebikas to reduce turnover. Toward this goal the program manager could consider the possibility of identifying the optimum territory size for the Shasthya Shebikas and encouraging them to take up related services or products outside of BRAC�s offering in addition to the option of increasing the service and product mix. It was important however that the efforts to increase the income of Shasthya Shebikas not take the focus away from BRAC�s objective of providing health care service. It was possible that in an effort to increase their income the Shasthya Shebikas could shift their efforts from providing service to selling products�and even push products not needed by their clients. The Shasthya Shebikas had a different view on the issue; most of them believed that providing health care service and offering health-related advice helped them to sell their products. Another option available to BRAC was including local unqualified health care service providers to complement the work of the Shasthya Shebikas. Some studies suggested exploring ways to use these unqualified health care service providers that were popular among the poor but this involved improving the quality of the health care service they offered. If BRAC decided to use the services of local unqualified health care service providers it would have to identify acceptable service providers and determine the cost of using their services. BRAC would also need to determine when to use unqualified health care service providers instead of Shasthya Shebikas.Exhibit 1: Bangladesh Population Geography and Income levels (2011)PopulationThe population of the country stood at 149.8 million in 2011 with a population density of 1015 persons per square kilometre.

Mishra had called a meeting with his plant managers to review the progress on their production targets. As the plant director he had received a request from the head office at Bangalore fifteen days earlier asking him to produce 27000 units of a popular inverter brand for the month of June. The original target of 5000 units set two months previously had unexpectedly been raised to 7000 just a month ago and since the Rudrapur operation was already struggling just to deal with that change in its original production target this latest order represented a massive challenge both for the plant and for its director. SCHNEIDER ELECTRICFounded in 1836 Schneider Electric (Schneider) was a French multinational corporation that specialized in producing components for energy management and electricity distribution. It operated in over 100 countries around the world and employed approximately 160000 people. In 2015 the company made a profit of €3.6 billion on revenues of €26.6 billion.Schneider Electric had been operating in India since 1963 and had established a 100 per cent owned subsidiary in 1995. The company’s growth in India had been inorganic in nature with several well-known acquisitions including Conzerv (2010) Zicom (2010) Digilink (2011) and Luminous (2011).SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC PLANT—RUDRAPURA New Plant The city of Rudrapur was located in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. The State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) had been formed in 2002 with a mandate of promoting industries by developing industrial infrastructure in the state. SIIDCUL set up a large integrated industrial estate in Rudrapur that attracted companies such as Tata Motors Ashok Leyland HCL Technologies Limited and Schneider among many others. This flood of new business led to significant infrastructure growth in the area along with an influx of migrants from across India who were looking for jobs in these industries. Schneider set up its Rudrapur plant in 2009. Availability of land infrastructure facilities a cheap labour force and attractive tax incentives represented the major reasons for Schneider’s selection of Rudrapur as the site for its new plant. To quickly set up the operation old machines from the Bangalore plant were relocated to Rudrapur. Quality testing of products continued to take place at the Bangalore plant during the initial setup period and eventually in 2010 this process was moved to the Rudrapur plant.Schneider divided its business operations in India into three clusters each of which was led by a vice-president who oversaw operations at eight to 10 factories. Each cluster had three to four directors of operations who were responsible for plant-level profitability. Initially all senior plant managers reported to their counterparts at the main plant in Bangalore Karnataka in southern India but this decentralized form of supervision led to a lack of unity of command in the individual plants a situation that adversely affected operations. In 2010 the plant director at Rudrapur was given complete command of that plant and all senior managers reported to him (see Exhibit 1). The plant director reported to the vice-president at corporate office. Early Workplace Culture at Rudrapur A significant number of Schneider operators had been relocated from Bangalore to Rudrapur in order to run the new plant and train local hires. These workers faced a variety of issues in their new city such as language barriers and difficulty adapting to the extreme weather conditions of Rudrapur. As a result they jumped at any opportunity to return to Bangalore. This ongoing shifting of jobs soon created a transactional mindset among the relocated employees and their performance lacked a sense of ownership and responsibility. The Rudrapur plant employed over 450 workers 20 per cent of whom were permanent staff; the remaining 80 per cent consisted of temporary local hires. Because the local workers were not offered any formal training they found it difficult to match the productivity of the operators who had come from the main plant. This lack of preparation and some human resources (HR) issues resulted in low morale among the workers who felt unmotivated to improve their productivity. During the first few years of operation at the Rudrapur plant the corporate culture suffered from the workers’ limited sense of connection to the products and to the plant a low degree of involvement by senior management with the workers and the workers’ dislike of the senior managers’ authoritarian leadership style.Production IssuesWorkers at the Rudrapur plant were untrained in the latest methods of lean production and the five basic phases of the “5S” workplace methodology (derived from five Japanese words for “sort” “set in order” “shine” “standardize” and “sustain”) were missing. Thus the overall operation lacked this main component of a lean manufacturing system. Newer managers noted that tools were not stored in the proper drawers and areas the production line was haphazard and the production floor and surrounding area were not cleaned to management’s expectations.Rudrapur was located a significant distance from other manufacturing hubs so it faced the additional problem of long lead times for delivery of materials. This situation combined with unmet high production targets and low labour productivity led to a pileup of inventory at the plant in terms of raw material and work in progress. Since the plant output had a seasonal demand inventory targets fluctuated a factor that further exacerbated the inventory pileup.Due to these and other planning-related issues idle production lines were a familiar sight at Rudrapur. The plant often fell below its production targets and faced a constant struggle to keep the lines rolling. Worker productivity was low and there were quality issues with the products. The defect rate was high with customers returning a large proportion of products back to the company. Schneider’s head office believed that the problems at the Rudrapur plant were caused by external factors over which the management had no control. For that reason no corrective actions were initiated by the head office or by plant management.Acquisition of LuminousIn 2011 Schneider Electric India acquired a major stake (74 per cent) in Luminous Power Technologies India (Luminous) a well-known manufacturer of power back-up solutions for retail customers in India. Luminous was launched in 1988 by Rakesh Malhotra and had sales of approximately 11 billion Indian rupees (€170 million) in the year ending March 2011. The company was well known for its power inverters and uninterrupted power supply devices. This product segment had been growing at a compound annual growth rate of over 20 per cent in the last five years and was expected to grow at the same rate for the next decade. India experienced severe power outages during the summer season (April to August) and demand for Luminous products was highly seasonal in nature. Over the course its existence Luminous had been able to establish a reputable brand name in the power-supply segment. As a leader in a fast-growing market Luminous was a good strategic fit for Schneider Electric India. This acquisition helped Schneider triple its sales locally and made it the seventh largest operation in the Schneider group globally.Prior to the 2011 acquisition Luminous had appointed Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador in 2010. This brand-building strategy sought to project an image of excellent product quality by associating it with a cricketing legend like Tendulkar.Luminous planned to introduce a new product in 2014 the production of which was assigned to the Rudrapur plant. Starting in late 2013 the plant began to receive ever-increasing targets of manufacturing components for that particular model but in line with its past record the plant kept falling short of meeting those targets and its product quality fell far below expectations as well. Defective returns were high which did not bode well for the Luminous brand which had Sachin Tendulkar as its ambassador.Mishra Joins the Rudrapur TeamSamir Mishra held a master of science degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university and had worked with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (India) Mahindra Reva (India) Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Limited (India) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (United States) prior to joining Schneider as its director of engineering in 2012. In March 2014 Schneider Electric India appointed Mishra as the plant director of its Rudrapur plant. Mishra was given the overarching mandate of turning the plant around—specifically to successfully deliver on the new Luminous product line. Up to the time of this appointment Mishra’s experience consisted of managing small teams of engineers; he had no prior experience with managing workers at a plant level. Even so Mishra nurtured a passion for active people management and he welcomed the opportunity to move from a technical role into one of leadership. PLANT TURNAROUND A Plan for Change at RudrapurAfter taking over leadership at Rudrapur in March 2014 Mishra took stock of its operations. Upon a review of the reports on product returns he noticed that the plant rejection rate was around 96000 parts per million. An industry average plant rejection rate of 25000 parts per million was considered acceptable; the rate at the Rudrapur plant was almost four times that. Mishra was surprised at this poor state of affairs. Upon accepting the offer to manage Bangalore he had been assured that while the plant faced a major issue concerning productivity quality was not an issue. Mishra quickly realized that the head office was not being kept up to date on the quality issues so he arranged a personal meeting with the plant’s quality manager Anil Rao to get to the root of the problem.  Rao was adamant that the plant’s quality issues could not be resolved as quickly as Mishra was expecting. He also complained to the top management that Mishra was interfering in his functional domain. After some discussion with his superiors Mishra decided to dismiss the quality manager asking him to leave immediately. Within a week Mishra had appointed a new head of quality. From his two decades of experience in working with various organizations across different geographies and cultures Mishra had derived a three-pronged philosophy for running a successful business. He believed that customer satisfaction drove volume lean manufacturing minimized waste and motivated the workers and informed workers were more engaged and hence highly productive. To drive customer satisfaction Mishra believed the product should have high quality and high reliability. Moreover these traits should not come at an added expense; the product should be priced competitively. Mishra’s time in the United States had exposed him to the principles of lean manufacturing so he understood that minimizing waste and improving productivity provided effective ways to reduce costs. Finally he felt confident that employees who had a sense of ownership towards their product and company would be motivated to make sound decisions to improve quality and reduce waste. Mishra knew that if he could successfully implement his three-pronged philosophy he could improve the state of affairs at the Rudrapur plant. Dealing with Resistance Deciding to tackle the HR issues first Mishra planned to launch a number of HR and learning interventions to empower engage and energize the workers and improve productivity at Rudrapur. Most of his interventions were based on the belief that workers perform better when they possess a sense of ownership. Before he could implement his plans however Mishra’s changes met with some stiff resistance from the most unlikely of corners.Anit Singh who had served as the HR manager at the Rudrapur plant since its inception did not appreciate his new director meddling in HR issues. To his credit Singh had a proven track record of keeping the plant free from any industrial relations issues. Furthermore the plant remained non-unionized while all the other plants under SIIDCUL’s control were plagued with union issues. Singh was concerned that the plant’s temporary employees who constituted 80 per cent of Rudrapur’s workforce might raise demands to be promoted to permanent status if they began to feel empowered by Mishra’s planned HR interventions. In light of these concerns during discussions between the two men Singh presented Mishra with some strong arguments against such changes. Singh informed Mishra that the former plant head used to keep workers at arm’s length and had a highly directive approach to leadership; he was in the habit controlling the workers through Singh.Mishra shared “The HR manager and his style of functioning before I took over were highly controlling and directive. No dissent was [allowed from the workers]. I had to deal with Singh’s mindset which was more challenging than dealing with workers.” To deal with Singh’s concerns Mishra invited Singh to his cabin for a discussion over a cup of tea. Before Mishra could initiate the conversation Singh told him “You are playing with fire. Temporary workers may create industrial relations issues.” Mishra acknowledged Singh’s concerns but went on to request that Singh proceed with the suggested HR interventions. Further Mishra assured Singh that the HR department would be given the credit for all potential benefits derived from such interventions and if any of the interventions failed Mishra was ready to take the blame. Mishra listed the probable benefits which included lowering the plant’s attrition rate enabling workers to develop a sense of ownership and fostering a new feeling of security among temporary workers all of which would improve the engagement level of the workers. Eventually Singh understood that there would be no personal risk in the interventions and he agreed to follow through with Mishra’s plan. Human Resource InitiativesThe Collar SystemWith Singh on board Mishra started off by rigorously emphasizing a collar system. Trainees in the workforce wore a red-coloured collar on their shirts which was upgraded to orange and then green when they became experts in their sections and passed the requisite tests. This graduated process was designed to facilitate other HR interventions that involved peer learning and on-the-job training. Public functions were organized to congratulate workers as they graduated from one stage to the next. Once workers arrived at the green-collar level they became members of a high-powered group that could directly approach senior management with suggestions for ways to make the plant run more smoothly. Senior managers were asked to forward these suggestions to the director within 24 hours along with a brief analysis and plan of action to ensure quick decision-making and implementation. By quickly implementing many of the workers’ suggestions Mishra established himself as a leader who believed in empowering others. The implementations had the added effect of instilling a sense of ownership among the green-collar workers who numbered about 60.Training ProgramsAnother intervention that Mishra initiated—one that he liked to call the “Duality of Training”—was essentially peer learning. The green collars were specifically given the task of training the red collars which fostered close interaction between the trainees and the skilled workers. Plant engineers used to sit in on these training sessions to evaluate the trainers. The engineers’ input honed the skills of the green-collar workers and made them expert at their tasks.  Mishra also asked the line leaders to swap positions with operators on the line for a few shifts each week calling the process “Face the Management.” This intervention was initially opposed by the line leaders who felt that performing the tasks of an operator was a demotion. Mishra also heard concerns that temporarily allowing operators to run the line might create issues among the operators and line leaders. By outlining the expected learnings from the job-swap process Mishra was able to defuse the tension around the process and things went smoothly forward. Operators were expected to understand and appreciate the challenges faced by line managers and thanks to the job swap and managing the production line for a day the operators realized that the job of line leader was not as easy as they had previously believed. Similarly line leaders were exposed to the pain points of the operators and to the issues these workers faced in performing to their peak capability. Over a period of several such rotations this intervention fostered a sense of mutual respect between the operators and line leaders in place of the previous animosity. The process also facilitated empathy and meaningful communication in the workplace which had been missing up to that point.Communication EffortsMishra implemented a policy of having an open house each month where the plant’s workforce and the management team would discuss plant issues. At these meetings Mishra shared Schneider Electric’s vision for the plant with the workforce and regularly highlighted how the workers’ career goals were in sync with the vision of the plant. The goal was to instil a sense of belonging and cohesion across the workforce and bind the disparate groups with a shared vision.For his part Mishra started a daily routine of walking throughout the entire plant and assembly lines mingling with the workers. He was open to discussing any issues the operators faced on the line and he tried to come up with on-the-spot solutions. This daily communication removed the power distance perceived by many of the workers who finally began to see the management and workforce as a single team with a shared vision striving to improve the future of the plant.THE CHALLENGEProduction Targets at SchneiderThe Schneider India marketing function was an independent vertical that reported to the senior vice-president of marketing based out of the Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong. Schneider India’s marketing management team received a quarterly target based on the average yearly revenue target that had been fixed for its business operations. This number was reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis taking into consideration the actual production target as well. Based on this quarterly number set for Schneider India’s marketing team each cluster was assigned a revenue target. Further down the line the respective marketing managers who were each responsible for one or more plants set the product forecast based on the clients’ needs. The production target-setting process was dynamic and was linked to the revenue target set for the entire Indian operation. The production target of the plant was reviewed regularly and the targets for various months were updated in advance after a review process (see Exhibit 3).An Unexpected Jump in DemandSoon after Mishra joined the team at Rudrapur in March 2014 the Bangalore head office set a June 2014 production target of 5000 units of finished goods for the new Luminous product (see Exhibit 2). Two months later in May 2014 this target was revised to 27000 units. The sudden spike in demand was due to the Luminous team’s aggressive marketing efforts for the new product and it was essential not just to fulfil the demand but to fulfil it with quality products. Mishra and his management team were shocked by this sudden change in expectations. Several people felt that the plant could not supply the increased demand and they asked Mishra to negotiate lower targets with head office. Off the record senior management at the head office suggested the same approach advising Mishra to formally ask head office to lower the plant’s production targets. One senior executive from the head office privately advised him against accepting the order at all since failure to fully meet Luminous’s request could cost Mishra his hard-earned professional reputation. MEETING THE CHALLENGEConvincing Head OfficeMishra did not want to let the Luminous order slip away from the plant and he was keen to take up the challenge in spite of being advised against doing so. He spoke to his management team and presented them with a roadmap for how he planned to execute the order. Mishra’s plan included the introduction of a learning culture through a people-process intervention and the launch of a lean production concept that included a re-engineering of the production process. The members of the top management team were convinced by Mishra’s enthusiasm for meeting the challenge and they handed Mishra free rein to implement his ideas at the plant. They did however advise Mishra to act with caution. They realized his strategy would have to be put into place immediately before the plant’s issues hurt the market for the new product. Convincing the Team at RudrapurDespite considerable advice to the contrary Mishra decided to push ahead. He saw an opportunity in this challenge. Having tasted initial success with the HR interventions he felt this production challenge represented a growth opportunity for the plant. Mishra called his plant management team together for a meeting where he announced his intention of accepting the target and he discussed his plan to meet it. Immediately the heads of two departments—procurement and production—raised their protests. The procurement manager Vikas Choudhary was among the strongest opponents of Mishra’s plan to forge ahead with the increased order. Choudhary argued that accepting the increase in demand at the plant’s current production level would impose a severe inventory shortage on the plant and purchasing large amounts of raw materials in such a short span of time would be very expensive. The suppliers would demand a significant premium and freight costs would also increase significantly to ensure the faster transport of goods. Added to all of these logistics issues was the possibility that Rudrapur’s routine suppliers would not have the spare capacity to be able to match the plant’s short-term demand.Rakesh Razdan the production manager pointed out that the production line in its current configuration did not have the capacity to produce even half the output expected from the plant. Mishra accepted these concerns as genuine and appreciated the thoughtfulness of his managers during the meeting. He gave the responsibility of finding solutions back to the managers themselves promising them his full support in their efforts to meet this challenge and pointing out the benefits of being able to successfully re-engineer the current processes to meet such a demand spike.Creating Production Efficiencies The plant management team quickly realized that improvements in worker productivity alone could not match the required demand; it was time to implement lean and agile production techniques. Razdan was given the task of studying each process in the assembly line and identifying those that were creating bottlenecks. Upon finding a bottleneck he was given the authority to redesign the process and workflows to effectively “debottleneck” the line. Razdan also undertook an action study by observing the workers as they performed their tasks on the line. This activity allowed him to identify the processes that needed to be re-engineered to improve worker productivity. Razdan found many simple changes that could be quickly implemented. Minor changes (for example moving a raw-material feeding tray from a position below the line to a platform alongside it) improved worker productivity and line capacity significantly. The line operators were responsible for correctly aligning and installing electrical components inside the inverter bodies. The plant’s own research and development team shared the operators’ feedback (for example regarding the placement of various components inside the inverter) with the research and development team at Luminous and  these two teams jointly improved the product layout to make it easier and quicker to assemble. The testing bench for the inverters was also shifted to the Rudrapur plant from the Luminous offices thus enabling quicker identification and correction of assembly issues.Choudhary was asked to expand Rudrapur’s current group of raw-material suppliers. Finding it difficult to bring new suppliers on board in a short period of time he decided to ask Luminous to share its own list of suppliers. The Luminous management team initially balked at this request but soon complied when they realized that their latest product launch would collapse if they did not assist the Rudrapur plant. Two of the new suppliers were located in Pune and Vadodara in western India so Choudhary decided to visit them personally to persuade them to help the Rudrapur plant with its high inventory requirements in the short term. To save time Choudhary hesitantly asked Mishra for permission to travel by airplane instead of the usual train. Mishra approved this request on the spot and commended Choudhary for his commitment to the endeavour. Seeing Mishra follow through on his promise of support was a morale booster for the entire management team. THE PATH FORWARDMishra and his team had made a lot of progress in improving the overall function of the Rudrapur plant but there was still a long way to go and a huge production hurdle had yet to be crossed. It remained to be seen whether Mishra would be successful at turning the plant around and fulfilling the challenging order. Were his interventions likely to succeed? Could Mishra have adopted a different approach to meet the challenges? exhibit 1: organization structure of the rudrapur plantSource: Created by the authors EXHIBIT 2: PRODUCTION TARGETS FOR luminous’s NEW PRODUCT LINE IN 2014 Source: Created by the authorsEXHIBIT 3: RUDRAPUR PLANT PRODUCTION PER MONTH IN 2014Source: Created by the authors

She had recently finished the second year of a bachelor of arts and science degree at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario and expected to have an influx of demand for Moana-themed events this upcoming fiscal year. She was excited by the idea of offering new characters but wondered if the initial investment would be worth the cost. She wanted to examine whether she should expand her character options or maintain the status quo. To ensure the expansion was not too complex she wanted to offer Moana performances only for either residential birthday parties or corporate events. Company OverviewCharacter House was started in April 2015 by Daisy Stargell in Markham Ontario when she was in grade 12. Throughout high school Stargell had spent her summers working at Canada�s Wonderland and Casa Loma as a character performer and host for children�s shows and meet-and-greets. She quickly ascended from part-time performer to a host and event coordinator and she even gave individual tours for celebrities such as Mike Tyson and Zac Efron. When Stargell learned that parents were beginning to find the ticket prices unreasonably expensive she decided to launch her own business�one that would offer lower-priced but high-quality birthday party performances for young children in the comfort of their own homes. Stargell started the business as a sole proprietorship and received a CA$3000 grant from the Ontario Summer Company program. She found a low-cost supplier in China who provided costumes at one-third the price of suppliers in Ontario. She also purchased materials for children to create their own stuffed animals and invested in a �stuffing station� calling it the �Fluff Factory� (see Exhibit 1). With new equipment start-up inventory and a website that Stargell had designed herself Character House was launched.Stargell launched Character House in Markham and Stouffville and it became an instant success. Parents were drawn to Character House because it provided a custom birthday party performance that was tailored towards children�s favourite Disney and cartoon characters for a reasonable price. Parents would book an event one month prior to the party for an average cost of $150. Each one-hour event included two Disney and/or cartoon characters a musical performance pictures with the children games dances and cotton candy. Birthday parties were organized year-round and took place inside the customer�s home. During the summer months Character House would host events outdoors and games and dances were replaced with a bouncing castle and the Fluff Factory for children to make their own stuffed animals. After the first fiscal year Character House grew rapidly from one or two shows per weekend to an average of 10 shows every weekend. Stargell and her sister went from performing every show themselves to hiring high school and university actors to portray the characters. This allowed Stargell to manage the business and ensure customers were satisfied while she continued her studies at university. Stargell believed it was important for Character House to give back to the community so she provided free performances for sick children at hospitals every month. Stargell was also adamant about ensuring that Character House was both run and performed by students which meant that all actors hired were high school or university students. Since many Disney and cartoon characters were meant to be in their late teens and early twenties hiring young actors that were about the same age gave Character House�s performances a more authentic feel and parents enjoyed supporting an organization that was committed to helping students save money for their education.Character House required little marketing as the business expanded successfully through positive word-of-mouth referrals throughout the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). In its second fiscal year Character House expanded into corporate events which included musical performances and meet-and-greets at daycares camps and business events. With this increased demand came requests for specific characters that Character House sometimes did not have the costumes or skilled actors to portray. The business often hired and trained new actors to cater to this demand; otherwise it turned customers away. CustomersCharacter House�s customers were divided into two segments: residential birthday parties and corporate events. Residential parties included middle-upper-class families in the GTA that wanted to provide a fun and memorable birthday party for their children who were usually between two and eight years old. These customers were happy to organize a fun-filled day for their kids but they did not want to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a one-hour event. They were also looking for an option that allowed their children and friends to have fun in a nearby location. The second customer group was corporate events which included daycare companies summer camps city festivals at the Canadian National Exhibit and private business events for employees and their children. These events were planned several months in advance. Organizers requested grandiose performances that averaged two hours in duration. Because the corporate events were more intricate and complex Character House charged $500 per hour. Businesses were willing to pay this higher rate as they were looking for professional and magical performances that would amaze the children and they often later used pictures and videos from these events as marketing materials to enhance their brand and recruit new customers. Character House garnered positive customer reviews and received requests for longer-duration performances. Stargell expected the average duration of all corporate events for the coming fiscal year would increase to three hours.In Character House�s second fiscal year sales for the residential customers and corporate events amounted to $60000 and $20000 respectively. The cost of sales for the residential customers was $48000 and for the corporate customers it was $11000. CompetitionCustomers had a plethora of options available when considering birthday parties and corporate events. There were several direct and indirect competitors; however the market was quite fragmented for character performances. Stargell identified three of Character House�s direct competitors:Little Jingle Beans Inc.Founded in 2013 and offering its services in Toronto Milton and Oshawa Little Jingle Beans Inc. (LJB) specialized in mascot costumes and birthday parties and in meet-and-greets with actors depicting superheroes and Disney princesses. LJB offered three times as many character options as Character House and used professional actors who were often in their thirties and forties. In addition to the meet-and-greets LJB offered musical performances face painting art classes and live interactive shows. Prices ranged between $200 and $300 for a 60-minute event. It also had corporate clients including Labatt Brewing Company Limited TJX Canada and North York General Hospital.The Superhero Company Inc.The Superhero Company Inc. (TSC) had been in business for 10 years and also used professional actors who were in their thirties and forties. The company had garnered positive media recognition and was deemed the number-one superhero party company in Canada by City Parent magazine for five straight years. TSC offered superhero meet-and-greets for children and adults interactive games and temporary tattoos. TSC also helped plan personalized events. The average price for a one-hour event was $170 for a one-character appearance in Toronto. Requests for more characters and events in the GTA were subjected to higher fees. Tricks with BricksLocated in Newmarket Tricks with Bricks (TWB) was founded in 2013 and provided Lego-themed birthday parties for preschool to preteen children. In addition to hosting birthday parties TWB also used Lego for educational purposes including teaching programming essentials creating animated Lego videos and incorporating Lego into introductory robotic designs. Birthday party prices ranged between $220 and $350 for a 60-minute event. Indirect CompetitorsParents had countless other options for their children�s birthday parties including bowling laser tag miniature golf rock climbing escape rooms and arcade games. Prices for these events in the Markham and Stouffville area varied between $50 and $200 per hour. Stargell felt that these competitors were not a direct threat to her business because the companies did not offer character appearances.The Moana OpportunityMoana starred Dwayne �The Rock� Johnson and Auli�i Cravalho as the primary characters Maui and Moana. The film had been one of the highest-earning movies from the end of 2016 to April 2017 grossing over US$643 million worldwide. Stargell anticipated that the movie�s popularity would result in a high demand for Moana-themed birthday parties and corporate events and she decided to examine if it would make sense for Character House to add Moana and Maui to its selection of characters. Stargell wanted to assess the opportunity of offering Moana events solely for either residential customers or corporate events. She did not want to offer Moana events for both residential parties and corporate events for two reasons. First the type of advertising required to attract corporate customers was costlier than residential customers and it required more time to meet with corporate event organizers. Stargell felt it would be difficult to effectively advertise to both customers simultaneously. Second there were often requests from both groups of customers for the same dates throughout the year. In order to maximize her advertising efforts and continue offering great service to customers Stargell decided to target only one customer group in the upcoming fiscal year; she would consider offering Moana events to both customer groups in future years.With residential customers Stargell would charge the same price of $150 for a one-hour birthday party and she believed the additional sales from Moana-themed events would be equal to 40 per cent of the total residential events revenue from the last fiscal year. Customers typically paid for half of the event cost upfront and the other half would be paid within 60 days of booking each event. Character House would need to audition high school and university actors to ensure they looked the part had an ability to sing well and displayed professional conduct. Based on her past experiences in hiring actors the auditioning process would take two weeks and cost $1500 in scripts props and filming. Once the two actors were selected to play Maui and Moana each actor would need to undergo three hours of training to rehearse and choreograph the songs and dances and learn professional etiquette for engaging with children. Due to the nature of the performances Character House offered competitive wages of $40 per hour to attract skilled young actors. Makeup costs for Character House averaged $9.50 per event and the cotton candy expense was 5 per cent of sales. The stuffed animal shell and cotton fluff used to create a stuffed animal cost $0.25 and $0.05 respectively and Stargell expected that each party would request 10 stuffed animals. Fuel costs for Stargell and the actors was projected to be $2500. Character House would need to order professionally designed Maui and Moana outfits. Each outfit was $200 and Stargell wanted to have two of each character. She believed each outfit could be used for five events before needing to be washed and dry cleaned which cost $10 per outfit. Insurance expenses for Character House would be $450 the same amount as the previous year. Stargell wanted to attract new customers in the GTA so she decided to increase her marketing expenditures by $1500 for the upcoming year only. She would use this money for newspaper Facebook Inc. and Google LLC advertising. The days of inventory was expected to remain the same at 30 days. Corporate events took place infrequently; however with the box office success of Moana Stargell believed Character House would increase its number of corporate events by 50 per cent. Hourly prices charged to corporate customers would remain the same as the previous year. Corporate clients would also pay half of the cost upfront with the remaining amount paid within 90 days of booking. Actors would be paid the same $40 hourly rate for training but they would each be compensated $150 per corporate event. Stargell would order a third set of costumes to have as spares for corporate events. Cotton candy would increase to 15 per cent of sales and an average of 40 stuffed animals would be created at each event. Stargell would double the advertising budget to attract corporate clients fuel expenses were projected to be $1750 and the days of inventory would increase to 60 days. All other recurring costs and investments were expected to remain the same as the residential opportunity.ConclusionStargell was excited for Character House�s third fiscal year after two consecutive years of strong sales growth and a high level of customer satisfaction. If she decided not to offer Moana-themed events Character House would need to turn away business and competitors would take advantage of this. Customers liked that Character House was run by students and enjoyed supporting students� ambitions of working hard to pay for their university and college tuition. Whether or not Character House decided to expand Stargell wanted to ensure that she could continue putting smiles on children�s faces gain leadership experience and increase profitability. After a mild brain freeze she began analyzing her options.Exhibit 1: Fluff FactorySource: Company files.

He was looking forward to sharing with them the success story of SociÃ©tÃ© anonyme de pÃªche malgache et rÃ©unionnaise [Malagasy and RÃ©union Fishing Limited Company] (SAPMER) SA and he reflected on what Yannick Lauri the chief executive officer (CEO) had just said at the board meeting:During 2012 SAPMER recorded strong growth in its activity and maintained strong profitability. The highlight of the year was the arrival of two new â40 degrees Celsius [Â°C] deep-freeze tuna purse seiners Dolomieu and Belouve which joined an Indian Ocean tuna fleet already composed of three ships. Moreover if the tuna activity was growing the southern seas activity (Saint Paul rock lobster and toothfish) was also doing very well with good fishing campaigns and steady sales.De Chateauvieux was pleased to see that return on equity had improved significantly in the past two years. However reading through the companyâs financial statements and the report on ship deliveries and payment terms he knew that SAPMER still had enormous challenges related to its growth. He needed to know the reason for the improvement in return on equity what potential problems could be identified from a DuPont analysis of SAPMERâs financials and what bottlenecks could appear in the coming years. A BRIEF HISTORY OF SAPMEREarly YearsJean Chatel Georges Michel and Raymond Latour three entrepreneurs from RÃ©union Island created SAPMER in 1947 when they joined forces and acquired a three-masted motorized ship outfitted by Madagascan ship fitters. The trio sent the ship rechristened the Cancalais fishing around the Saint Paul and Amsterdam Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. That was the beginning of a rich journey for the company.The period from 1947 to 1965 was the age of pioneering and conquering the Southern Ocean with the fishing companyâs strategic plan taking shape in 1949. After an exploratory mission and some trial and error SAMPERâs founders realized that they needed to catch and prepare their haul with whatever they had on board. They also realized that in this environment âthe future of seafood belonged to the cold rather than salt preservation techniques.â SAPMER bought a refrigerated 62-metre-long cargo ship and turned it into a giant lobster freezer. They added eight motorized whaleboats to the ship to support fishing activities and on December 31 1949 sent the ship on the first of what would become an annual fishing campaign.From 1965 to 1980 companies took advantage of fishing grounds teeming with lobsterâdifficult to harvest but a catch worth the effort. SAPMER advanced its capacity in 1965 by replacing its first ship with a former wine carrier fitted for pot fishing and on-board processing with a freezing tunnel. But exploitation was exhausting the resources. At the end of the 1973â1974 fishing campaign quotas were greatly reduced dropping from 960 to 450 tons. Only one ship was allowed to fish on behalf of the three companies working the area: OrganisÂ pÃªcheries Ouest Bretagne [Organization of the Fisheries of West Bretagne] SAPMER and Bretic. Year after year the resources were replenished through sustainable management of fishing. In 1986 SAPMERâs boat focused on catching toothfish a species that had not attracted much attention until then. The deep sea fish described by sailors as the most beautiful species of the Southern Ocean had been considered a by-catch and stock was considered depleted. But in this new venture SAPMER brought 241 tons of toothfish to RÃ©union Island and Japanese customers took interest. The fish resembled a species of fish favoured by the Japanese but which Japanese fishing companies could no longer access. With popularity prices started to rise. After ten years of difficult campaigns fishing the waters surrounding the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) finally became profitable for the RÃ©union Island fishing company. On land the company was also restructured: Maurice Barrier son-in-law of Robert de la Fortelle the previous chairman took charge of the company in 1987. The Bourbon YearsIn 1989 Les Sucreries de Bourbon (Bourbon) then focused only on sugar and managed by de Chateauvieux began its diversification. Its sugar business was struggling and the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. SAPMER whose majority share was owned by de la Fortelleâs family was already a symbol of RÃ©union Island famous for its small fish-processing activity. De la Fortelleâs son and de Chateauvieux had studied together at Columbia University in the United States then worked together for the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Later they were both members of the founding team of BCG Europe. Because they knew each other very well and de Chateauvieux was very fond of SAPMERâs management team de Chateauvieux began to consider investing in SAPMER. Believing in and appreciating SAPMERâs commitment to development as well as its growth potential in lobster and toothfish Bourbon took a majority of shares in SAPMER in June 1989.In November 1990 Bourbon bought a retail operation. In 1991 it acquired a shipping business in order to become further diversified. In 1992 de Chateauvieuxâs group attained sole ownership of SAPMER. Over the following years SAPMERâs performance with reasonable ups and downs was in line with the expectations of the management team. The toothfish business was good and SAPMER renewed the vessel for lobster fishing. Keeping SAPMER in the FamilyIn 1998 Bourbon was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. However the stock market did not show much interest in the company even though the company delivered a good performance in line with the forecast of its initial public offering prospectus. From 2000 to 2001 Bourbonâs leaders reconsidered the companyâs strategy and decided to narrow its focus to one field rather than continue as a conglomerate. Having so many unrelated businesses was unattractive for financial analysts and investors. Bourbon sold off its sugar business in February 2001 and decided to gradually step out of its retail business in November 2001 focusing on its marine service activities and offshore oil ship businesses. Because the Bourbon team liked SAPMER very much it was one of the last businesses to be sold. In 2005 Bourbon looked for a buyer of the fishing company. An Indian RÃ©union Island family that was a SAPMER competitor offered â¬15 million.De Chateauvieux held a family meeting to talk about the possible disposal. His wife and six children all knew about SAPMER products; they had been visiting the port to see the vessels and had been enjoying the lobster and toothfish for many years. They expressed their wish to keep the fishing company in the family. De Chateauvieux decided to buy SAPMER from Bourbon for his family holding group JACCAR Holdings SA. As a related party de Chateauvieux finally paid â¬21 million to buy SAPMER and keep it as a wholly owned subsidiary of JACCAR. De Chateauvieux regarded buying SAPMER as he would collecting a painting; he did not expect the company to create value as it should for Bourbon. Bourbonâs share price soared after its business became more focused.The strategic rebirth of SAPMERDiversification with the Tuna VentureWhile rock lobster and toothfish were SAPMERâs two main sources of revenue the fishing company had never stopped seeking new commercial species. Because both lobster and toothfish were resilient profitable businesses with high quota limits each year SAPMERâs limited production could hardly meet the demand. To find new methods of development the company undertook various campaigns in different sectors of the Indian Ocean over the years. In 2006 de Chateauvieux asked general manager Yannick Lauri how they might further grow SAPMERâs business. Lauri proposed an idea he had developed with his predecessor Jacques Dezeustre: expanding into the tuna business. Experiments with fishing pelagic fish (e.g. tuna and swordfish) had been going on in the Indian Ocean since 1995. The experiments involved using âa freezer longliner capable of producing sashimi-quality fish for Japanese buyers.â The tropical Indian Ocean was abundant with tuna and SAPMER knew the demands of the Asian market. The growth potential of the European market was within the companyâs reach.Lauri decided that the tuna business could be a source of diversification for SAPMER. Various studies and trials also confirmed his judgement. Accordingly SAPMER bought two old tuna vessels to learn the business seriously. The two freezer purse seiners were renamed Titan and Takamaka. SAPMER had begun learning a new trade. SAPMER used these old vessels for tuna fishing from 2006 to 2008 then sold them in 2008. De Chateauvieux and Lauri reviewed the financial results and found that the business was cyclical. Its profitability for canning and fresh markets was low. But they believed that the tuna business could succeed if they targeted the correct markets and carefully segmented them. Thus they developed a plan for ordering new ships to develop the market for tuna products. New Niche Positioning for the Tuna BusinessIn 2007 SAPMER ordered three ships from the Piriou shipyards in Concarneau a French county highly renowned for tuna fishing. De Chateauvieuxâs holding company was Piriouâs largest shareholder. The company accepted the daunting task of developing a freeze and deep-freeze seiner of a completely new design. The ships used the purse seiner technique with very modern means giving them great power and a rapid execution time. At 90 metres long they implemented high-performing fish-detection methods. The most important novelty was their propulsion system. Two electrical engines activated a pitch propeller while these two electrical engines were powered by a main diesel engine. The new propulsion system saved fuel and reduced emissions while also giving the ships the power and manoeuvrability to operate seines 1800 metres long 280 metres high and weighing 90 tons. The electrical power of the vessels also allowed fish to be frozen in reduced time preserving the natural quality of the fish. On board the fish was handled in two ways. First the undamaged fish was immersed in a smooth-walled 300-ton tank of chilled brine and frozen to the core at â9Â°C. Then the frozen fish was transferred to a work area where the small fish were separated from the large ones and transferred to 700-ton freezing holds. There the core temperature of the catch was lowered to â40Â°C; this very low temperature was maintained until the fish was unloaded.With the new ships SAPMER embarked on a five-year plan with proven development of a new segmentâsuper-frozen tuna fishing and processing in the Indian Ocean. The process addressed the Asian consumer market for premium sashimi and tataki and premium tuna loin and steak. The company created a niche position between canning and fresh markets targeting mainly the Japanese market (see Exhibit 1).At the same time SAPMER and Seafood Hub Ltd. (a subsidiary of Ireland Blyth Ltd.) partnered to invest in a processing factory for frozen fish on the wharf of Port Louis the capital of Mauritius. The factory supported an important element of the SAPMER strategy: to provide all markets with tuna without any thawing during the whole process from capture to the consumerâs plate. Part of the catch was intended for the canning industry while the best fish would be used for processing and value enhancement to meet customersâ demand for fillets steaks and dices (see Exhibit 2). This value enhancement would allow SAPMER to triple its sales in the near future and further expand the market in accordance with its long-term strategic plan. Financial Arrangement Ordering new ships for tuna fishing required significant investments. To finance the new vessels for its tuna venture SAPMER decided in 2007 to open up shareholding through private placement to investors. After two years de Chateauvieux realized that SAPMER needed to choose whether to buy back the shares with a given return or list SAPMER on the over-the-counter (OTC) market in Paris. He concluded that the easiest way to waive his obligation was to be listed on the OTC market. SAPMER was listed on the Alternext in July 2009 becoming the first French fishing company to be listed. The first investors were RÃ©union islanders. strategy since 2008The strategic five-year plan was successfully implemented in 2008 (see Exhibit 3). In 2012 SAPMERâs revenue was â¬93.1 million an increase of â¬16.1 million from 2011âs revenue of â¬77 million. This increase was mainly due to an increase in whole tuna sales growth in value-enhancing tuna products an increase in Saint Paul rock lobster revenues and steady toothfish sales.Strong Fishing ActivitySAPMERâs fishing activity represented 79 per cent of total revenues. This growth was the result of increases in gross tuna sales and a slight increase in its rock lobster sales. Southern seas fishing (Saint Paul rock lobster and toothfish) still profited from a strong demand from the Asian markets with steady prices over the year.Rock lobster sales increased from â¬8.7 million in 2011 to â¬9.3 million in 2012 as a result of a favourable price and exchange rate. SAPMER caught its whole quota. The price index was 138 and the basic price index was 100 based on whole rock lobster average prices from 2007 to 2011. Sales were primarily to Japan.Toothfish sales dropped from â¬40.7 million in 2011 to â¬39.4 million in 2012âa result of a change in fishing trip dates and a slight price decrease in the second half of 2012. The price index was 139 based on HDG average toothfish prices from 2007 to 2011. More than 85 per cent of the sales were in Asia including 10 per cent in Japan.Gross tuna sales increased by 74 per cent from â¬13.8 million in 2011 to â¬24 million in 2012. This growth was linked to a strong increase in the average selling price over the year and an increase in sales volumes. In 2012 the whole tuna market met a strong demand with an average price that almost doubled compared to 2010. SAPMERâs increase in volume was a result of having on average four tuna purse seiners in operation over the whole of 2012 compared to three in 2011. The main clients for tuna were based in Mauritius (43 per cent) the Seychelles (33 per cent) Europe (12 per cent) and Japan (10 per cent). SAPMERâs main achievement for tuna in 2012 was diversifying its client base.Value-Enhancing ActivityValue-enhancing activity included processed tuna sales (e.g. tuna that was fished and processed in the factory into loins and steaks) and the Mauritian subsidiariesâ activities. SAPMERâs premium choice line increased value-enhancing activity by 51 per cent to â¬19.9 million in 2012. This growth was linked to an increase in sales volumes and an augmentation of catches suitable for processing. In 2012 36 per cent of the total catch was value enhanced. A price rate effect also affected growth and the Mer des Mascareignes factory also increased its whole tuna value-enhancing production to 7600 tons up from 5300 tons in 2011. Revenues could be divided into two main products: loins at 68 per cent of revenues and steaks at 20 per cent. Loins were mainly sold in Japan and steaks were mainly sold in Europe and the United States.SAPMERâs strategy of diversifying sale zones continued with penetration of the North American market led by the popularity of tuna steaks. Mirroring its toothfish and lobster activity SAPMER was positioned in a âvery high-qualityâ niche market and enjoyed an excellent reputation for its value-enhanced tuna products especially its loins. SAPMER was then the only company in the Indian Ocean operating across the entire value chain: fishing deep freezing at â40Â°C and cutting and packing tuna into sashimi-quality loins. This high-end positioning was particularly appreciated by Japanese clients and generated high demand for sashimi loins.Benefits of a Diversified PortfolioBecause the economic crisis in Europe had made it difficult to assess economic and financial prospects SAPMERâs potential in its home market was uncertain. In Europe and South Africa SAPMER supplied supermarkets (frozen sections) and out-of-home catering. In Asia and Japan the tuna sold by SAPMER (e.g. loins bellies and saku) was mainly consumed raw in sushi bars; SAPMER also supplied the tataki market with high-quality pre-grilled skipjack loins that were raw in the centre. In the United States SAPMER products were sent to major specialized high-end food stores (the organic market). SAPMER was also studying other outlets that would enable the resource to be most effectively value enhanced.SAPMER was not as affected by the European economic situation as were other companies. By 2012 the majority of SAPMERâs sales were exports to either economically buoyant countries such as China or countries with a major and growing market for fish such as Japan. Revenues from Japan in 2012 accounted for 30 per cent of the total; revenues from Hong Kong Singapore Taiwan Korea Indonesia and China combined accounted for 33 per cent. Japan seemed to be the main market for processed tuna: this small country contributed 72 per cent of the revenues for this product in 2012.De Chateauvieux was satisfied that through the years SAPMERâs share price had been steady and had grown since the end of 2011 (see Exhibit 5). However reading through the financial statements the report of ship deliveries and the companyâs payment terms de Chateauvieux also knew that SAPMER still had enormous challenges (see Exhibit 6). The companyâs growth would require a balanced view and careful management.EXhibit 1: Super-frozen tunaâvalue chain and niche marketSource: Company documents.

(TCW) a privately owned third-party logistics (3PL) company based in Haddonfield New Jersey could detect the determination and firmness in the voice of the company’s president and chief operating officer (COO) Jim Tucker: “Mike it is not just about being cheap fast and easy” Tucker said. “We have an obligation to provide the best logistical solution to our customer for each of their shipment requirements.” Mellencamp was working on a bid to provide logistics support to Bell Oil a refinery based in Reading Pennsylvania.  Winning this contract would further TCW’s establishment as a leader in the 3PL industry. As Mellencamp walked out of Tucker’s office he realized that preparing the bid would not be as straightforward as he had thought it would be. The proposal would need to effectively showcase TCW’s value address all practical transport options and remain consistent with the company’s core practice. Above all Mellencamp had only that day Friday June 1 2018 to bring it all together.HISTORY OF Tucker Company WorldwideTCW a third-generation family-held corporation was founded in 1961 by Jacob Tucker. The company provided logistical services to shippers and their customers helping companies efficiently execute freight hand-offs; saving them time; and eliminating the hassles of paperwork billing audits training staffing and optimization. It acted as an intermediary both between shippers and receivers and between shippers and carriers. Through its market knowledge and subject expertise it often helped its clients open new market opportunities receive volume discounts lower overhead costs and achieve timely service.After Jacob’s sudden death his son Bill Tucker took over the business. For the next 32 years Bill immersed himself in the business and industry. His two sons Jeff and Jim worked for their father for over 10 years and later took over the business; they shared a passion for the business and the industry. Jeff served as the chief executive officer overseeing sales and marketing as well as industry participation and leadership. Jim served as the president and COO managing the carrier side credit collections and accounting. Over the years Jeff and Jim had built an outstanding reputation in the 3PL industry. TCW was ISO certified in 2008 and it held ISO 9001:2015 certification as well. In all their business interactions the brothers strove to uphold their core values: customer focus integrity safety quality and advocacy. Services Offered by Tucker Company WorldwideAs a non-asset-based company (i.e. it owned no trucks but worked with fleet operators) TCW provided supply chain solutions to companies in industries such as oil and gas life sciences and health care high-value and high-security goods and food. It also provided services to government entities for example providing relief work during national emergencies such as forest fires hurricanes and terrorist attacks; freight services for the U.S. Mint; and helicopters and boats for the military. TCW utilized an array of transportation modes—including truck rail ocean and air—to arrange logistics all over the world. It offered truckload (TL) intermodal flatbed and specialized equipment for transporting freight. It specialized in freight transportation that required higher service needs—that is where the risk of shipment delays or cargo theft was high where the delay consequences were high and where there was visible corporate behaviour dysfunction. TCW also provided real-time tracking and tracing (through a customer portal) quarterly business reviews (for existing customers) scorecards (based on shipping characteristics) and technology options that included visual performance statistics. Customers appreciated these analyses by TCW and considered them to be value-added services.One thing that had set TCW apart from its competition was its investment in establishing strong communication and visibility channels between its customers and service providers including truck air and ship carriers. This helped TCW create the right logistical solutions for its customers. Results from an internal customer survey showed that TCW was one of the most dependable and reliable partners for most of its clients.The Request For ProposalOn Friday June 1 2018 Bell Oil a large refinery in Reading Pennsylvania sent out a request for proposal (RFP) soliciting bids to transport multiple products from multiple origins to multiple destinations. The refinery solicited local and regional 3PL companies to submit bids for three unique transportation needs. The first requirement was to ship a highly critical 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. The second requirement was to transport a large 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. The third was a small (90-kilogram [200-pound]) but highly valuable $48600 computer server containing sensitive company information which was to be transported across the country from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California.According to the RFP each component could use a combination of transport modes but the best solution should offer the best service in terms of transit time reliability damage rate insurance and of course cost.Jim Tucker saw the call and asked his manager Mellencamp to begin working on the bid right away. However preparing the bid was not easy and TCW had a set of challenges to overcome. TCW’s ChallengeCustomers typically preferred solutions that were fast easy and cheap; they assume that the right vehicle with the desired transit time reliability insurance terms and damage rates would be available. This last-minute attitude increased the overall transportation costs for most customers and became the enemy of corporate savings. They would often not realize how sharply logistics costs rose in the absence of their own advance planning and clear communication and examination of needs. TCW knew that overcoming this attitude would be its first challenge. It could not provide the lowest-cost option to its customer if the customer waited until the very last moment.Jim Tucker wanted to prepare a bid that exceeded expectations for customer service and satisfaction—a solution that provided the lowest-cost option while maintaining the required reliability and service to successfully transport the shipments. He knew that an overly expensive option would jeopardize TCW’s chances of winning the bid.  Tucker and Mellencamp recognized that they were competing with other 3PL companies in the region on this bid. They understood the market and were aware of the different strategies their competition might use—and they were afraid the competition might present a low-ball offer that might be attractive to the customer. At the same time they were confident that the competition could not deliver the experience and service that TCW could offer.Tucker was aware of several past instances where a competitor 3PL had bid on and lost a deal because of a lack of communication and feasibility analysis from the trucking company and driver. Conversely TCW had seen competitor 3PLs win business but then fail to follow through and meet customer expectations leading to aggravated customers. Tucker and Mellencamp discussed their strong communication channel which kept all involved parties in touch at all times as well as their forensic dispatch practice which had been successful over the years. They were confident that a careful examination of the available options and clear communication of the customer’s needs would enable TCW to provide the best logistical solution for the Bell Oil refinery. TCW’s Transport OptionsTo prepare the bid Mellencamp carefully examined all shipping options for serving the refinery’s three specific needs. He prepared three different tables for the three different scenarios and shared these with Tucker. Together they needed to create a bid that not only minimized transport costs but also maximized reliability and customer satisfaction.Shipment Requirement 1: Ship a 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. In this requirement the customer wanted to move a 67-kilogram gasket which was critical to the normal operation of the refinery. If the gasket were needed a delay of one day in receiving it could result in millions of dollars in losses for the refinery. Mellencamp evaluated the different shipping options and prepared a table that compared the different components of each option (see Exhibit 1). Shipment Requirement 2: Ship a 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. In the second requirement the customer wanted to move a 102058-kilogram tank from Texas to Delaware. Mellencamp considered four different transport options to move this oversize load across state boundaries:Option 1 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it on a 19-axle trailer over-the-road (OTR) to its final destination (see Exhibit 2).Option 2 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the rail ramp in Houston then transload and move it on rail to the customer site via a local rail line. Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the final location on a 19-axle trailer. Option 3 involved picking up the vessel from the manufacturer and moving it OTR to the port in Houston then transloading it onto a barge and barging it to the port in New Castle Delaware. Finally it would be transloaded to a 19-axle trailer and moved OTR to its final destination. Option 4 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the port in Houston then transload it onto a barge and barge it directly to the customer’s site. (This option would require site improvement on the customer’s end.) Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the installation site.Mellencamp prepared a table listing all the feasible transport options to carry out this oversize load transportation (see Exhibit 3).Shipment Requirement 3: Ship an estimated 90-kilogram (200-pound) computer server valued at $48600 from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California. The shipper believed the dimensions were roughly 36 × 36 × 40 inches. Under the third and the last requirement the customer required a computer server with very sensitive corporate information to be transported coast to coast. Mellencamp developed a set of feasible solutions to successfully carry out this transportation (see Exhibit 4).THE DECISIONBased on the choices he had developed the challenge for Mellencamp was to come up with a decision for each shipment requirement that would become part of the final bid. He wondered how he should go about making the right logistical decision. What strategy should he use to prepare TCW’s bid?Exhibit 1: Options for Transporting a 67-kilogram Gasket

The trading halt had been called the day before so that CapitaLand could announce its voluntary conditional cash offer of SG$2.22 for each share of CMA through its wholly owned subsidiary Sound Investment Holdings Pte Ltd. The intention was to delist CMA and integrate it into the CapitaLand Group. The offer was conditional on CapitaLand garnering more than 90 per cent of CMA.At the time of the offer CapitaLand already owned 65.3 per cent of CMA. The cash offer of $3.06 billion for the remaining shares was 27 per cent above CMA’s one-month volume-weighted average price. The per-share price in the offer was also 20.7 per cent higher than CMA’s net asset value per share as at December 31 2013 and represented a premium of 22.3 per cent over the closing price of $1.815 on April 11 2014. The offer price would be reduced for any CMA dividends distributed on or after the announcement date including a proposed final CMA dividend of $0.0175 per share for the financial year ending in 2013. If acceptance levels crossed the 96.5 per cent threshold CapitaLand would be able to compel acquisition of all of CMA’s shares. As an investor in CMA you were congratulating yourself on the unexpected windfall. However the news also made you wonder about the intrinsic value of CMA. When trading resumed on April 15 you noted that CapitaLand’s share price had also risen. Thus not only was there a premium for the target shareholders there was also value created for the acquiring shareholders. In fact you could calculate the estimated synergy arising from the acquisition from the premium and the net present value of the acquisition. CapitalandCapitaLand had its headquarters in Singapore and was listed on the Singapore Exchange Limited. Its businesses in real estate and real estate fund management were focused in Singapore and China. As of December 31 2013 the company had assets of $14.91 billion (45 per cent of the group’s assets) in China the company’s largest market and assets worth $12.52 billion (38 per cent of the group’s assets) in Singapore which was the company’s second-largest market. Following a strategic review in 2013 CapitaLand had been reorganized into four business units: CapitaLand Singapore CapitaLand China CMA and the Ascott Limited (Ascott). CapitaLand Singapore and CapitaLand China developed residential office and integrated or mixed-use properties. Despite challenging market conditions CapitaLand Singapore had almost doubled the number of private residential units it sold in 2012 by “right-sizing” the units. CapitaLand China had refined its strategy to focus on mass market and first-time buyers and upgraders and had become the largest foreign real estate developer in China.CMA was in the business of shopping malls and Ascott in serviced residences. CMA had achieved high shopper traffic and net property income and in 2013 it announced a partnership to jointly develop the Jewel project at Changi Airport. Ascott which operated more than 33000 apartment units across 82 cities in more than 20 countries had achieved modest revenue growth in 2013. CapitaMalls Asia Limited (CMA)CMA founded in 2004 went public in November 2009 at an initial offering price of $2.12 per share and raised $2.8 billion. After this initial public offering CapitaLand’s shareholding interest in CMA was reduced from 100 per cent to 65.5 per cent. When it was listed CMA was one of the largest pure-play shopping mall owners developers and managers in Asia. Its shares closed at $2.30 on the first day of trading.CMA used an integrated shopping mall business model with interconnected buildings where shoppers could live work and play. Its primary business objective was to be a leading owner developer and manager of shopping malls in Asia. As of December 2013 CMA had a pan-Asian portfolio of 105 shopping malls valued at $34.3 billion. It had $1 billion in cash and a debt-to-asset ratio of 25 per cent (see Exhibit 1). motivation to delist cmaCapitaLand had several reasons for delisting CMA. First because CMA’s integrated developments tended to enjoy high foot traffic from a captive base of offices and residences the developments were expected to enhance CapitaLand’s competitive strengths. Second delisting CMA would simplify CapitaLand’s organizational structure. Third the delisting would give CapitaLand more flexibility in allocating its capital and expanding its scale. Fourth it would unlock shareholder value and achieve synergies. CapitaLand claimed that the acquisition of CMA would immediately raise earnings per share by approximately 21.5 per cent and improve return on equity from 5.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent. However it was not clear whether increasing earnings per share was a good reason for the acquisition. President of CapitaLand Lim Ming Yan said “The market has changed. Earlier companies were pure-play residential; now companies are emerging that are doing mixed developments which include homes offices and malls. This move will help us compete better.”According to an analyst at Barclays Plc “CapitaLand’s offer to take CapitaMalls private is a win-win for both CapitaMalls and CapitaLand. Regaining full control of CapitaMalls should allow CapitaLand more flexibility including the ability to streamline its organizational structure.”However according to Samsung Asset Management Co. Ltd. (Samsung Assets) the transaction showed that CapitaLand could not put the money to better use at a time when the property markets in Singapore and China were starting to weaken. In a similar vein an investment manager at Samsung Assets in Hong Kong commented The company is effectively undertaking financial engineering to enhance returns. The problem is these returns are still unsatisfactory relative to the cost of equity and suggests a lack of investment opportunities in an adverse environment of declining property prices in Singapore and slowing growth opportunities in China.financial performance and valuation To calculate the value of your investment in CMA you could conduct valuations of CMA’s shares using the discounted cash flow (DCF) discounted dividend model (DDM) relative valuation (RV) and precedent transaction methods. DCF valuation is based on the principle that the value of a business is determined by its ability to generate cash flows. The relationship between the business’s revenue and cost drivers can be gleaned from the company’s historical financial statements (see Exhibits 1–4 or refer to the student Excel worksheets “CMA Financial Statements” and “CapitaLand Financial Statements” [Ivey Publishing product number 7B19N012]). These can be used to project a company’s cash flows for the initial few years after which a terminal growth rate can be applied in perpetuity (see Exhibit 5 or refer to the Excel worksheet “Information about CapitaLand”). All projected cash flows will be discounted by the weighted average cost of capital. DCF models provide insights into the drivers of share value but small changes in inputs can result in large changes in intrinsic value. The DDM method assumes that a stock is worth the sum of its discounted future dividend payments. The discount rate used is the cost of equity capital. For stocks with a solid history of dividend growth it is reasonable to assume that the historical growth rate will continue for some years after which a terminal growth rate will be applied (see Exhibits 5 and 6). The DDM is a simple and convenient way of valuing stocks but it can be sensitive to the assumed growth rates.The RV method compares the value of a business to those of its competitors using common multiples or benchmarks such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-book (P/B) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. It is a widely used peer multiple but because the denominator is earnings investors have to be careful when comparing peers from countries that are subject to different accounting regulations. In addition P/E cannot be applied if earnings are negative. The P/B ratio compares a stock’s market value to its book value. The ratio is calculated by dividing the price of the stock by the book equity per share. It gives some idea of whether investors are paying a reasonable price for the equity that will be left if the company were to go bankrupt immediately. For example a P/B ratio of less than one indicates that investors can theoretically buy up all the shares of the company liquidate the assets pay off the company’s liabilities and still have money left. The P/S ratio compares how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales. Because sales is a top-line figure and is therefore less affected by accounting policies this is a useful multiple for businesses that have yet to generate positive earnings and it is useful for comparing businesses that are subject to different accounting regimes.Regardless of which multiple is used it is important to develop accurate benchmarks and it is crucial to compare only businesses from the same industry and with similar market capitalization. Thus although information had been gathered on a number of CMA’s potential peers (see Exhibits 7 and 8 or student Excel worksheets “Peer Financial Ratio” and “Other Key Peer Financial Data”) further deliberation would be required to identify a suitable comparison group. In addition to relative valuation precedent transactions could also provide some useful information. Precedent transaction analysis uses the prices paid for similar companies to estimate the worth of a target company. Under normal market conditions transaction comparables provide higher multiple ranges than peer comparables because acquirers normally pay control premiums and strategic buyers often have the opportunity to realize synergies. To assess the value of CMA information on 12 precedent transactions had been retrieved for consideration (see Exhibit 9 or student Excel worksheet “Precedent Transactions”). PREMIUM NET PRESENT VALUE and SYNERGY By the close of trading on April 15 2014 CapitaLand’s shares had increased 6.5 per cent to $3.11. CMA’s shares had surged 21 per cent from the closing price of $1.815 on April 11 2014 to $2.19 (see Exhibit 10)—the company’s biggest gain since going public in 2009. Based on the market response it appeared that the shareholders of CMA and CapitaLand clearly approved of the transaction. In fact the net present value of the acquirer could be estimated directly from the response of CapitaLand’s share price on April 15th. This together with the premium for the target would provide an estimation of the synergy created.Exhibit 1: capitamall asia’s BALANCE SHEETS (IN SG$ THOUSANDs)Source: Created by the case authors based on information obtained from CapitaMalls Asia Limited Clarity Sustainable Growth: Annual Report 2013 accessed January 27 2017 http://infopub.sgx.com/FileOpen/CMA%20AR(Final)_2013.ashx?App=Prospectus&FileID=20423;

Ltd. (Nukkad) an organized tea cafÃ© retail chain was checking his notifications on his phone. He saw that Nukkad had garnered positive reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor Facebook and other social media pages. Patel was proud of his social enterprise which encompassed two cafÃ©s based in Raipur a city in Chhattisgarh India. Since its inception in 2013 Nukkad had created quite a buzz in Raipur for its distinctive initiative: it specifically employed youths with speech- and hearing-related disabilities. Patelâs aim was to expand Nukkad to more locations so that more people with these disabilities could be employed and a larger customer base could be reached and he was trying to determine the best way to achieve this aim. Patel questioned whether franchising represented the optimal expansion route or whether he should continue growing with his own outlets. He realized that his decision could adversely affect his business and as a result his employees; if the expansion was not successful it could cost people their jobs or dilute Nukkadâs hard-earned reputation. Moreover Nukkadâs business model was exceptional with respect to its offerings employees and social values. If the model expanded to new markets Nukkad had to be prepared to face the challenge of serving customers with different preferences.NUKKADCompany History and BackgroundPatel was originally an electronics engineer working for various organizations from 2007 to 2011. During that period he also volunteered his services to several non-governmental organizations (NGOs). His work with these organizations helped Patel realize that he wanted to work in the marginalized segments of society.In 2010 Patel learned of a fellowship program run by ICICI Foundation which was established by Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) Group an Indian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Mumbai India. Patel applied to the program and was chosen to be one of the designated fellows at which point Patel left his corporate job. The program was designed to empower Indian citizens to participate in Indiaâs inclusive growth by helping rural development projects; it centred on experiential learning and transforming the fellows into socially responsible leaders. The newly designated leaders spent 15 months working on grassroots development projects with NGOs intermixed with modules on management training and leadership development.Patel became a part of a community working to solve issues in remote locations. This experience became a turning point in Patelâs life. He worked in villages within three Indian statesâOrissa Maharashtra and Gujaratâfor 18 months. This opportunity resulted in two successful projects: the Community Resource Centre in Gujarat in which Patel worked with underprivileged communities to empower socially marginalized individuals by providing them with livelihood services employment skills wellness and education; and Tribal Women Cooperatives for NTFP (Non-Timber Forest Products) Trades in Orissa which organized trading and enhanced income for women in rural regions collecting non-timber forest products. His time with the ICICI Foundation was transformative for Patel: it provided him with insight knowledge andâmost importantlyâa commitment to inclusive growth. Patel gained a new perspective. He realized that disadvantaged young Indians needed to join the social sector to bring dynamic change and bridge the skill gap. Patel started developing ideas to create a bridge that could help society benefit from these individuals and offer them an enriching experience in return. As of 2011 India had nearly 27 million disabled citizens (see Exhibit 1); increasing their social and economic participation might have a positive effect on everyone.After six months Patel had the idea of creating a social space for people and groups to meet join and converse while adding value to society in different ways. This train of thought led him to create Nukkad The Chaitastic TeafÃ©. Founded in 2013 Nukkad was a for-profit tea cafÃ© with a mission of providing employment to individuals with disabilities and a platform for discussing various social issues. The cafÃ© was decorated in a Bohemian theme with murals posters and artifacts (see Exhibit 2). It served 29 varieties of tea 17 varieties of coffee snacks and non-alcoholic cocktails in a calming ambience. Market and Competition India was one of the biggest tea-producing countries in the world and the fourth-largest exporter of tea. During fiscal year 2015/16 India exported 232.92 million kilograms of tea; the export valuation reached US$686.67 million with 90 per cent penetration in domestic markets. Growth in disposable income and urbanization had resulted in strong growth in the ready-to-drink tea market. However the popularity of ready-to-drink was limited among urban consumers aged 13 to 34. International firms such as Costa Coffee Starbucks Barista and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf rose to prominence at a fast pace in the Indian cafÃ© market. The prior success and demand of domestic tea and coffee along with an abundant consumer population attracted these companies to India. Maharashtra was the top state when it came to spending money on tea but most tea consumption occurred in the home. Outside of the home consumption of tea had increased while consumption of coffee had fallen since the year 2012 (see Exhibit 3). There had been an acceleratory growth in the number of tea start-ups which led to an increase in tea drinking. These start-ups focused on increasing the quality quantity and ready availability of tea (see Exhibit 4). Nukkad was the first themed cafÃ© of its kind in Raipur; the cityâs other cafÃ©s served varieties of coffee. However attracting customers that would be willing to pay from $0.45 to $2.24 for tea was difficult because tea was available on every corner of Raipur for as little as $0.07. Advertising and PromotionIn 2016 Nukkad had a 4.6 rating in Google reviews and 4400 âlikesâ on Facebook. The business was also featured on a television series OMG! My Chhattisgarh that aired on History Channel India. The series ventured into various parts of the state to cover incredible stories of courage inspiration progress and culture. According to Patel at the core of Nukkadâs success was its employees its grounded philosophy in encouraging good conduct in people and its opportunity to give employees a platform to discuss various social issues. The business had no advertising budget and its marketing communication was mainly done through social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Patel had created some promotional campaigns in the form of social experiments that were aligned with Nukkadâs vision.âDigital DetoxâSmartphones (and especially social networking apps and games) negatively affected the quality of face-to-face discussions. Nukkad promoted social interaction by offering a 5â10 per cent discount on the total bill if customers deposited their smartphones at the counter for the duration of their time at Nukkad.âGyaanDaan (Donation of Knowledge)âNukkad maintained a small library that encouraged an exchange of books. Customers could deposit a book in the cafÃ© and exchange it for another that could be taken home for three days.âBill by Dil (Pay by Heart)âOn Nukkadâs first anniversary the business customized a special menu that had no prices displayed. Customers ate what they liked and paid what they wished to; bills were not generated and at the end of the meal the staff placed an envelope on the table into which the customer could put whatever amount they wanted to pay.âThe Charity Chaiâ The Charity Chai promotion created an opportunity for customers to pre-pay for a cup of tea for underprivileged members of society.choices AND CONCERNSPatel was considering his options for Nukkadâs expansion. The first option was to set up his own outlet and the second option was to pursue franchising. The franchising route could be further classified into three different models with respect to the ownership and operation: franchise owned franchise operated (FOFO) franchise owned company operated (FOCO) and company owned franchise operated (COFO). Patel knew that choosing any one of these options could affect Nukkad at its core challenging all aspects of how the company evolved and operated. Above all Patelâs priority was sustainable growth for Nukkad. Patel picked up his notebook and summarized the options.Expanding Traditionally with Own OutletsPatel had identified Nagpur as a potential location to expand Nukkad beyond Chhattisgarh. Nagpur was a Tier 2 city in Maharashtraâthe third largest city in the state and the largest city in Central India. However taking Nukkad to Nagpur presented possible challenges as well as opportunities.Patel saw great risk in pushing his existing model into new markets. Entering into a new state without any prior connection there could leave Nukkad open to unknown market risks and aggressive competitors. Nukkad would face bigger competitors (that would potentially be more aggressive) and an unfamiliar environment. Patel wondered if he should outsource by bringing in a temporary executive who had experience in expansion train his staff in a new technology or start a new cafÃ© with new equity rather than with existing cash flow.India was a diversified market with cultures and lifestyles that varied significantly from state to state. Nukkad had a presence in Raipur but would it be possible to replicate the same success in Nagpur? Could an outlet sustain itself without any link to local market knowledge? Patel was unsure. Knowledge of the local market was crucial for any cafÃ©: such knowledge would help in promotional activities (e.g. with regard to particular festivals and celebrations) and offer an understanding of the customer base customer preferences and food habits.Expansion involved finding sources of fundingâsuch as loans investors and any owner-contributed capitalâbut Patel could not count on his existing location for any funding. Rather he had to consider the new cafÃ© as an entirely new business venture which would require that he invest in an initial set-up cost (see Exhibit 5). Notably this cost could be much higher than it would be for any location in Chhattisgarh. Further Patelâs model would require that he employ more people such as managers for this new location. The salaried managersâ earnings would be unrelated to their performance and would be added to the monthly cost.As a social enterprise Nukkad faced unusual challenges with respect to its employees because hiring and training involved a number of steps. Recruiting disabled individuals required collaboration with NGOs or social service institutions that worked for the disabled community or other sources. Patel also had concerns about how well his team would be able to handle daily operations without his monitoring and continuous support at the new cafÃ©. Even if he employed managers would it be possible for the employed managers of the new cafÃ© to have the same compassion and understanding as Patel did toward disabled workers? Finally what internal structural changes needed to be made? A larger business could not operate in the same way that a smaller one could; quite often smaller businesses had ways of managing employees and dealing with human resource issues in ways that were not scalable. In pursuing significant expansion these structures and processes could become unnecessarily bloated. Therefore Patel believed that he may need to re- evaluate aspects like restructuring departments and redefining roles. Keeping an eye on every outlet was important for a business owner. Patel wanted to monitor every aspect of the business dealings but he could not be on site at all times. He would need to screen hire and train employees to take charge of the business for him in some ways. Franchising NukkadThe second option for Nukkad was to franchise the cafÃ©; doing so would be a ready-made solution. Patel had received messages from individuals (based out of different cities across India such as Nagpur Aurangabad Delhi Chandigarh and Ranchi) inquiring about Nukkadâs franchising options including the following: Dear Patel I own a manufacturing business based in Nagpur Maharashtra. I am a franchisee of [International Institute of Fashion Design] an educational institute. I came to know about Nukkad from friends and family and was very much interested in becoming a franchisee of Nukkad. I would like to know if you have an application form. Hi Patel I am based in Delhi India. I operate a small cafeteria. My cafeteria is 10 years old and serves varieties of Indian snacks tea and coffee. I visited Nukkad recently while I was in Raipur to meet friends and I would like to know if you are interested in franchising your cafÃ©. I run an NGO for mute and deaf [individuals] in Ranchi Jharkhand where we train them for employable skills. I visited Nukkad last year and I am very impressed with the business model as I also work with the vision of action and compassion towards the deaf and mute community members. Iâm curious as to whether you have a franchise model.Patel considered the requirements that would have to be met if he were to decide to franchise Nukkad. Despite the fact that franchising seemed like an easy solution to implement Patel had doubts over losing control of the business. With this option he would need to establish long-term relationships with the franchisees because he would be depending on them for profits and operations. Potential Obstacles to FranchisingNukkadâs foremost concern was its employees: its primary objective was to assist marginalized members of society by giving them employment. Patel feared that by pursuing franchising he might be developing a work culture that did not prioritize Nukkadâs core values. He could not be sure that the franchisees would emphasize respect compassion teamwork and collaboration as much as he did. Moreover Patel strongly believed that art was an important factor in Nukkadâs success and he had deliberately developed the cafÃ©âs Bohemian-esque environment himself. Nukkad was designed to nurture a creative artistic and supportive culture. Its walls were decorated with hand-painted murals and most of the items in the cafÃ© were handcrafted. Patel experimented with different activities to engage customers in socially beneficial initiatives and discussions. He organized a talk series at the cafÃ© with local poets activists and journalists. On Nukkadâs third anniversary he presented a poetry and storytelling event that was heavily attended by locals. He also helped local writers promote their books at Nukkad.Each Nukkad location had three employees one of whom handled the management desk while the others worked as chefs. The dress code was casual. Nukkad was functionally organized and all communications between Patel and his employees were in sign language because the employees had speech or hearing impairments or both. Accordingly Nukkad also had to adopt an unusual service concept with its employees and customers. Customers ordered their food and beverages in writing. When Nukkad first opened Patel was not sure if people would react positively to this concept. Surprisingly however customers quickly adopted the method of ordering and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Some customers even began to communicate in sign language with the employees. Patel did not want to compromise on any of the distinctive aspects of Nukkad. Yet while the franchisees would have to agree to operate their cafÃ©s according to Patelâs stipulations there still remained some areas for innovation. Many ideas for new items on the menu could come from the franchisees responding to customer demand. Developing new products was crucial to any business even one that had successfully relied on a limited menu for many years. Consumer tastes could change over time and companies had to respond to these changes. Innovation could inject dynamism and allow Nukkad to utilize markets that Patel had previously overlooked. Each future franchisee would be required to put at least 40 hours a week into business development. What to do NEXTApart from questions about replicating Nukkadâs distinct operations Patel wondered whether franchisingâa medium known for its focus on commercial successâcould nurture a start-up that focused on a social cause. Patel knew that what separated a typical entrepreneur and a social entrepreneur was that the main goal of a social enterprise was to drive social change and that was the potential payoffâan enduring transformative advantage for society. For the typical entrepreneur the business would be organized to serve markets that could comfortably afford the new product or service and it would thus be designed to create financial profit. Contrastingly social entrepreneurs neither anticipated nor organized to create substantial financial profit for their investors or themselves. Unlike the entrepreneurial value proposition that assumed a market could pay for innovation and might even benefit investors the social entrepreneurâs value proposition targeted an underserved neglected or disadvantaged population that lacked the financial means or political clout to achieve any transformative benefits without outside help. However this did not mean that social entrepreneurs shunned profit-making value propositions as a rule. Profit though not the primary objective for a social entrepreneur was important for sustainable development of a social enterprise. Patel believed that social franchising required co-operative development. He wondered if the well-trodden path to success that commercial franchising offered could work for a social enterprise like Nukkad. The fact that there were other tea cafÃ©s rapidly opening in multiple locations India indicated that making Nukkad a prominent tea cafÃ© brand was unrealistic without expansion to more locations. Patel viewed expansion as crucial for Nukkad to remain competitive. He knew that it was the best time to start another branch of Nukkad in a new location if he was going to do so. How could he maintain Nukkadâs success and effectiveness in each new location opened?

Cornhill chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of AltaGas Ltd. (AltaGas)—an energy infrastructure business focused on natural gas power and regulated utilities—was looking to expand the company’s operations into the United States. He was specifically interested in entering the U.S. renewable energy market with the purchase of Decker Energy International Inc. (DEI). Cornhill stated:Acquiring DEI will provide AltaGas with an opportunity to enter the U.S. green energy market with fully contracted assets. DEI’s assets and the Busch Ranch Project which is expected to be operational by the end of 2012 will provide us with operating assets in the U.S. energy market and ensure sustainable returns for shareholders.Cornhill was preparing his presentation on DEI to the AltaGas board of directors. Assisting him was the company’s finance team. “Let’s go through the numbers one more time so that we’re sure our argument is tight” he suggested. The move into renewables and into the United States would be a departure for AltaGas which was primarily focused on traditional energy and infrastructure businesses in Canada. “I’d like to see how well the proposed purchase aligns with our strategic objectives” said Thomas Campbell the financial lead on the project. “Along with our assumptions we need to consider the business environment the competitive environment and whether DEI is a sound fit for us.”Campbell added: “I’m wondering if there are any other potential buyers for DEI. To whom can they sell this asset in the market? I believe that there are only a small number of players in the market able and willing to purchase DEI.” Campbell continued to evaluate the acquisition by taking a look at the latest information on the biomass energy market. Biomass as a Renewable Energy SourceBiomass was a relatively new renewable energy source. Biomass power plants produced electricity by combusting wood waste from sources such as urban construction sites that would have otherwise gone to landfills and forest waste. These waste woods could otherwise contribute to forest fires and greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass as a fuel could be classified as carbon neutral because biomass power plants in producing power burned off the methane component of carbon. Biomass power plants were slowly beginning to emerge in the renewable energy sector. One drawback was that the investment required to build these plants was large. Also with low natural gas prices the most efficient way to harness biomass power production was to locate plants as close to wood waste fuel sources as possible.AltaGas HistoryFounded in 1994 AltaGas was a diverse energy infrastructure firm with a market capitalization of about CA$4.5 billion in late 2011. There were three distinct business units: gas power and utilities. The gas business revolved around field gathering processing natural gas liquid extraction transmission and storage. Its operations managed over two billion cubic feet in Canada per day. The power business encompassed over 560 megawatts (MW) of generation from a combination of fuel types such as coal hydro wind and natural gas. The utilities business was geographically diverse with customers in Alberta British Columbia Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories. A proposed acquisition of SEMCO ENERGY Gas Company (SEMCO) would further diversify the utility business into Michigan and Alaska.Each AltaGas business unit operated independently with the company as a whole benefiting from a diversified portfolio of commodities and geographies. There were complementary effects as well with growth in one business leading to opportunities in adjacent segments. The financial contribution of each business unit was clear (see Exhibit 1). “Our strategy is to capitalize on the supply and demand for natural gas and power by owning and operating assets in gas power and utilities in places that provide a strategic competitive advantage” said Cornhill. “We operate physical assets and provide essential services to customers who produce and consume natural gas and power.” Key to the company’s risk management was signing long-term offtake agreements for its energy products. The agreements allowed it to achieve stable earnings and cash flow which supported its dividend growth strategy.In 2012 AltaGas was focusing its growth on the power business. The intent was to explore increasing the portfolio’s capacity with clean power sources such as gas-fired generation wind run-of-river and biomass. One option was to look at power markets and assets in the United States given the strength of the Canadian dollar. In 2011 all AltaGas assets were in Canada principally in Alberta.Industry AnalysisAltaGas had focused on growing in the Alberta power market. This market consisted of multiple generation companies that owned physical assets or the rights to generation from assets in the form of power purchase agreements (PPAs). In 2001 Alberta de-regulated power generation and was the first province to operate with a spot market and hourly prices. The market structure was such that generators sold into the hourly wholesale electricity market known as the Alberta Power Pool and were paid according to where the market price settled. Alternatively there was an active financial market where forward swaps were traded among generators banks and hedge funds. Consumers were able to purchase power at prices that floated with the hourly market rate or lock in prices at residential load rates. Active companies in the Alberta Power Pool included a range of companies—from Capital Power Corporation with a market capitalization of $1.5 billion to TransCanada Corporation with a market capitalization of $32.1 billion. Many companies in the power pool were also active in gas markets distribution and processing. Others such as ATCO Power Ltd. were focused primarily on power transmission and distribution. In addition many Alberta power companies were beginning to expand their presence not only across Canada but also the United States and in some instances internationally. As legislation around clean energy progressed corporations that had expertise in operating renewable projects saw an opportunity to expand across borders (see Exhibit 2).Decker Energy International OpportunityIn the fall of 2011 a U.S.-based energy business broker contacted AltaGas’s vice-president of Business Development—Power regarding an investment opportunity in the U.S. market. McCauley “Mike” Whiting a Princeton graduate and co-founder president and CEO of DEI was actively looking for a buyer for his company. A recent bid had been approved but the deal did not close due to financing problems on the buyer’s side. Considering the illiquid nature of the market for power generation assets Whiting was willing to sell DEI at the same price of US$34.8 million as long as financing could be quickly put in place. AltaGas learned that DEI had partial ownership in two operating biomass facilities—Craven County Wood Energy (Craven) in North Carolina and Grayling Generating Station (Grayling) in Michigan—as well as a permitted development project in Georgia. As part of the acquisition AltaGas would receive approximately US$4.8 million in production tax credits (PTCs). PTCs were generated by renewable projects but for DEI these PTCs had gone unused due to reduced profits in the past few years. The PTCs could be used to offset project or corporate U.S. income. In the fall of 2011 AltaGas was already moving into the United States with the purchase of SEMCO its U.S subsidiary. SEMCO renamed AltaGas Services (U.S.) Inc. (AGUS) focused on regulated gas distribution in Michigan. AGUS would begin paying U.S. corporate taxes shortly and the opportunity to purchase DEI would allow AGUS to take advantage of the PTCs. “U.S. tax law allows for a consolidated tax return so all of the subsidiaries under AGUS would be treated as a single taxable entity” stated an AGUS finance manager.The AltaGas finance team looked at DEI’s Craven and Grayling assets (see Exhibit 3).Craven County Wood EnergyDEI had a 50 per cent flow-through working interest in a 48 MW wood biomass power facility in Craven County North Carolina. The other 50 per cent was owned by CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy) a Michigan-based firm focused on utility operations. There was a PPA in place through 2017 with Progress Energy Inc. an electric power holding company recently purchased by North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corporation. DEI indicated that there was a high likelihood the PPA would be renewed after 2017. Craven’s chief fuel supply was waste wood. The source for the approximately 550000 tons of waste wood per year would come from a variety of sources around Craven. The fuel included wood chips forestry residue bark sawdust and railroad ties. Craven had been operating with availability above 90 per cent indicating that it was inoperable for less than 10 per cent of the time. Grayling Generating StationDEI had a 30 per cent flow-through working interest in a 37 MW wood biomass power facility in Grayling Township Michigan. The other 70 per cent was owned by CMS Energy. Grayling had a PPA in place through June 2027 with Consumers Energy the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy. As part of this PPA Consumers Energy had the right to economically dispatch the plant—to adjust or turn off the plant as a result of changing demand. As economically dispatching a plant would lead to lower generation output there was a contract feature that allowed for a “capacity payment” to Grayling as compensation. AltaGas estimated that the odds of Grayling being economically dispatched were very low.Grayling’s supply of fuel consisted of approximately 350000 tons of wood waste per year from a variety of sources including forestry products firms such as Weyerhaeuser Company and AJD Forest Products LP and sawmill and forestry residue. The plant also burned approximately 5000 tons per year of rubber-tire-derived fuel. Waste from the plant in the form of ash was disposed of in a nearby landfill. Grayling was included as a renewable energy facility under Michigan’s Renewable Portfolio Standard legislation which was passed in 2008. Under this law 20 per cent of renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated were kept by Grayling and 80 per cent went to Consumers Energy. The benefits of these RECs were included in the projections created for Grayling. Grayling was named Power Plant of the Year in 1992 by POWER magazine and had historical availability of over 96 per cent as well as an exceptional safety record. Fitzgerald (Georgia Development Project)AltaGas would acquire the rights to a permitted site for a 60 MW forest wood biomass development that was 100 per cent owned by DEI. For the purposes of the acquisition analysis AltaGas did not attempt to value the option to develop Fitzgerald.Reviewing the IssuesThe AltaGas finance team was reviewing the various aspects of the deal. In terms of having a brand-name acquisition the team believed that DEI met the criteria. DEI was a known and reputable name in biomass in terms of both operating standards and safety. Safety was an AltaGas core value; therefore ensuring new assets were in line with best operating and safety practices was a key factor in any acquisition and just as important as the financial valuation. Whiting was a well-known executive in the U.S. power industry and was an acquaintance of AltaGas president David Harris. As part of the sale process the energy broker requested a finder’s fee of US$900000 for the exclusive opportunity to evaluate and purchase DEI. Proposed Purchase of DEICampbell noted: “We want to take into account financial metrics such as the value of DEI the payback period and the impact on AltaGas financials especially earnings per share post-acquisition.” As such there were several issues he had to address with regard to DEI’s forecast performance. The first was whether AltaGas should assume that plant availability and operating capacity would remain the same as it had been in the past. Craven’s PPA was about to expire in 2017 and the DEI team believed it could be renewed in 2017 with annual price increases per megawatt hours of 2.5 per cent through 2031. Campbell wondered how conservative he should be with that figure if at all. Second an eight-year major maintenance cycle was anticipated which would result in availability of about 90 per cent on average per year. The financial forecasts for both Craven and Grayling took this 90 per cent level of availability into consideration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Campbell assumed that a similar cycle and availability rate would be maintained going forward. He wondered if this assumption would be reasonable.With regard to both plants assembling a steady flow of biomass materials was key to ensuring that the plant did not shut down. At Grayling fuel costs varied slightly more but were within a reasonable amount. Grayling’s PPA was set to expire in 2020 with a major plant overhaul set for 2020. At Craven which was permitted to burn a range of biomass materials such as waste wood poultry litter and railroad ties annual fuel costs had been consistent year over year since 2011. One of the assumptions in the acquisition price was that Craven would be able to burn railroad ties at US$7.00 per ton compared to approximately US$20.00 per ton for green wood. In addition to costing less railroad ties generated more British thermal units (BTUs) per ton than green wood at 6500 BTUs compared to 4704 BTUs. However no railroad tie agreement was in place as of yet. Campbell wondered how to tackle this point of uncertainty. If Craven was unable to secure railroad ties for fuel the net impact would be lost savings over 19 years assuming an 8 per cent discount rate which was AltaGas’s cost of capital.Craven according to its management team was also forecasting productivity savings—separate from the railroad ties opportunity—to yield reductions in overall fuel costs from 2012 through 2014. These reductions could be seen in the financial forecast. “We’re targeting an after-tax unlevered IRR of greater than 10 per cent” said Campbell. “Can we achieve this with our proposed acquisition of DEI?” Campbell wanted to compare the DEI opportunity with AltaGas’s current power portfolio and consider AltaGas balance sheets income statements and statement of cash flows (see Exhibits 6 7 and 8). While the opportunity to move into biomass power production was appealing Campbell wanted to ensure that AltaGas was making a financially prudent decision.Exhibit 1: AltaGas—Composition by Segment (IN CA$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: AltaGas Canadian competitors (in Ca$ Billions)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 3: Craven county wood energy and Grayling generating stationSource: Company documents.Exhibit 4: Craven—Forecast Performance (in thousands of US$)Note: MWh = megawatt hour; EBITDA = earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization; EBT = earnings before taxSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 5: Grayling—Forecast Performance (in thousands of US$)Note: MWh = megawatt hour; EBITDA = earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization; EBT = earnings before taxSource: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 6: AltaGas—Balance Sheets (in Ca$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 7: AltaGas—Income Statements (IN CA$)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 8: AltaGas—Statements of Cash Flows (in Ca$)Source: Company documents.

Goldbeck was a bicycle program specialist working in the Planning and Sustainability Division at the Washington DC District Department of Transportation (DDOT). Goldbeck had noticed that bike-sharing programs were frequently in the news. On April 9 2018 Uber Technologies Inc. announced its acquisition of Jump a dockless and electric bike-sharing operator that began offering services in 10 cities across the United States after piloting a scheme of dockless electric bicycles in hilly San Francisco. Three months later Lyft Inc. acquired bike-sharing company Motivate which was responsible for operating a number of popular bike-sharing systems such as Citi Bike in New York City and Ford GoBike in San Francisco.In the current era every city strove for an eco-friendly and sustainable system for sharing vehicles. The ever-growing industry of ride-sharing companies saw bike sharing as a natural extension of their easy urban mobility approach toward developing a smart city.Capital Bikeshare a regional bike-sharing program in Washington that was owned by the DDOT and operated by Motivate was also capitalizing on the trend of bike sharing and its avid riders were enjoying the benefits of renting and returning a bike at any of the program’s 8635 docks. Every minute the system generated a large volume of trip data that was available for analysis. Goldbeck and his team had heard the following questions since launching in 2010: Who were the riders that used Capital Bikeshare? When did they ride? What days of the week were most rides taken on? What factors affected riding behaviours? With the emergence of smart analytics what useful ridership insights could Goldbeck extract from Capital Bikeshare’s datasets? How could this information best help Goldbeck to prepare a future expansion plan?CAPITAL BIKESHARE PROGRAMCapital Bikeshare was a station-based bike-sharing operator that provided an expansive multi-jurisdictional transportation system to (a) Washington DC; (b) the neighbouring counties of Arlington Virginia; Prince George Maryland; Fairfax Virginia; and Montgomery Maryland; and (c) the city of Alexandria Virginia. It was the first public–private partnership bike-sharing system in the United States and had been the largest until May 2013 when New York’s Citi Bike launched. The Capital Bikeshare system was owned by the participating jurisdictions and was currently operated by Motivate a New York-based company that operated several other bike-sharing systems in different cities.To achieve its mission “to transform our community by providing a high quality convenient and affordable bicycle transit system that will connect people to more places where they live work and play in the region” Capital Bikeshare offered five distinct membership options tailoring to both registered and casual riders. People could join for a single trip a day three days a month or a year. All memberships had an initial fixed rate plus the extra amount that was paid depending on the time of use—though the first 30 minutes of each trip was free. Single-trip 24-hour and three-day membership customers received a five-digit key that they could insert into any bike dock with an available bike at any station. Monthly or annual membership customers received a card that they could use to rent bikes. By 2018 Capital Bikeshare had more than 4300 bicycles at a total of 500 stations and had provided more than 20 million fun and affordable rides to metropolitan DC dwellers.Bike-Sharing BOOMSOverviewA bike-sharing system was “a self-service short-term one-way-capable bike rental” offered “in public spaces for several target groups with network characteristics.” By integrating information and communication technology into everyday life bike-sharing programs had received increasing attention in recent years as a popular and strong green-minded alternative to automotive-centric transport services. The benefits of a bike-sharing program often centred on the goals of promoting cycling reducing congestion improving air quality and offering residents an active mobility option. The bike-sharing system following an asset-light approach and allowing users to share mobility offerings was available in more than 70 countries. By 2017 with nearly 1600 bike-sharing systems in operation worldwide the number of shared bicycles hit an estimated 18.2 million. The overall market reached €6 billion in 2018 and was expected to grow continuously by 20 per cent making the bike-sharing model a fast-growing permanent feature of the urban landscape.Evolution of Bike-Sharing ProgramsOriginally a concept from the revolutionary 1960s bike sharing was slow to grow over the years. However better approaches to bike tracking as well as improved information technologies had given birth to the rapid expansion of bike-sharing programs throughout the globe in recent decades.The past 50 years had seen four generations of bike-sharing systems. The first generation started in the summer of 1965 in Amsterdam with Witte Fietsen (White Bikes). Ordinary bikes painted white were provided free of charge for public use as a political statement of concern for pollution and against the growing number of cars in the city. Even though the program collapsed within days due to heavy bike theft and vandalism the White Bikes were the world’s first demonstration of a bike-sharing program providing increased mobility to Amsterdam dwellers.The second generation led by Copenhagen’s Bycyklen (City Bikes) began to emerge in Europe through public–private partnerships in the late twentieth century. Aside from significant functional improvement in bikes specifically designed for intense utilitarian use the development of software for tracking and managing bicycles laid the foundation for the locking system at specific stations. City Bikes allowed users to pick up and return bicycles at different stations throughout the central city via a coin-deposit system which answered the need to deter theft and incentivized bicycle return.The invention of individualized magnetic stripe cards in 1996 put an end to the bike theft problem. In contrast with the first two generations the third generation used a smart card to produce real-time information and assist in rebalancing the bikes between different stations as part of a complete technology-enhanced operating plan. The bike-sharing system started to adopt smart-card technology in 1998 and when the Vélo'v system in Lyon France opened in 2001 it soon became the prototype for the third generation of the system. Throughout the following 10 years the demand-responsive and multimodal “smart” dock system took hold in multiple locations across the globe with many stations installed at strategic locations to answer riders’ natural demand for “the last mile” problem in their commutes and to grow a top-of-mind green transportation method in dense urban areas.In 2015 a new free-floating bike-sharing model started to become popular in Asia particularly in China. The rapid development of bike-sharing schemes was enabled by the advent of new technologies such as mobile payments the Internet of things and bike locking and tracking systems which allowed dockless bike businesses to thrive.Motivation and Evaluation for Bike-Sharing ProgramsFrom the perspective of the individual bike sharing attracted riders through its convenience and practicality. When leveraging other modes of transportation bike sharing could provide a fundamental shift in the way people moved around and made decisions about transportation. It filled the critical gap between the bus or train station and the final destination and improved public mobility by extending fixed-route transit services thereby increasing accessibility for dwellers and visitors. Bike sharing also offered an active transport choice providing easy access to the physical and mental health benefits of bicycling while helping riders to fulfill their personal mission of embracing an environmentally friendly and green lifestyle.From a municipal perspective bike sharing could improve a city’s image and branding as a green or innovative “smart” city and held the potential to stimulate general investments in local industries through continuous demand for hardware software and the provision of operations. From an investment perspective bike-sharing systems offered many key advantages over other transportation systems with the capital cost in establishing a viable network comparatively lower for bike-sharing systems. Furthermore the relatively short timeline to begin operating the system meant that the benefits to the public were attained quicker than was the case with most transportation projects. In the planning stage there were five key elements to consider when building a cost-effective high-performance bike-sharing system. The stations needed adequate spacing to offer maximal coverage as well as convenient walking distances to riders. It was common to have 10–16 bike stations in every square kilometre with stations spaced 300 metres apart. To ensure reasonable demand for the system typical bike-sharing programs covered areas of at least 10 square kilometres. The number of bikes that were deployed depended largely on the density of the area. Typically 10–30 bikes were allocated for every 1000 residents. Areas with a high influx of commuters received an even higher number of bikes to ensure capacity during peak demand hours. Bikes needed to be durable attractive and practical to limit repair costs and encourage adoption. The bikes were also designed to discourage theft. Finally technology needed to permit easy bike checkout and return processes. The real-time availability of bikes mobile payment and automated locking were essential elements for a desirable bike-sharing system.Bike-sharing operators and cities presented bike-sharing programs as a viable means of transportation rather than as an occasional fun activity. Paul Stratta director of the Platform for European Bicycle Sharing & Systems a European forum for intra-industry collaboration that guided cities in planning and operating bike-sharing programs stated thatfor bike share schemes to be seen as a real public transport solution and a smart answer to urban mobility they need to work as good or better than existing public transport services. People go to bus and railway stations expecting the services to be there and for them to operate on time. It should be the same with bike share schemes.While the bike-sharing idea was gradually advocated by the general public across the globe and with high expectations the need for continuous strategic and operational improvements required special attention to fulfill riders’ dynamic demands and to respond agilely to external variabilities.BIG DATA BEHIND Bike SharingAs bike-sharing models entered into the new era of “smart mobility” which was often considered a city’s virtual sensor network a key trend of bike-sharing culture was the open sharing of data about ridership trends allowing the public to analyze trip patterns and build various predictive algorithms to help maximize utilization of the bike fleet. The data generated by these bike-sharing programs was attractive for studying mobility in a city as customer data duration of travel departure location arrival location time elapsed and other trip features were systematically collected exchanged with partners and used to improve the customer experience. Smart cities and smart companies alike had already seen the additional potential value of bike-sharing systems to provide sanitized and enriched movement data for generating ancillary commercial revenues.Goldbeck knew that Capital Bikeshare also kept a complete history of its ride trips and he was particularly interested to see how data analysis could provide some insights about Capital Bikeshare’s bike-sharing users as well as suggest some improvements in Capital Bikeshare’s operation model. Hourly rental demands on the Capital Bikeshare system were collected for the period between October 1 2016 and September 30 2018 (see Exhibits 1 and 2).THE DEMAND FOR BIKESOver the years Capital Bikeshare experienced a steady rise in bike rentals. The bike-sharing program tried to keep up with growing demand from its enthusiastic fans through expanding its coverage area and adding new station locations. It also wanted to incorporate a strategic evaluation into its current operation system to optimize its top line by raising system efficiency and recruiting more people to join this green transportation alternative. One of the challenging problems that Capital Bikeshare now faced was the difficulty of meeting the fluctuating demand for bike rentals among stations across the whole system. Research into past years’ bike rental data showed that the overall demand increased during warmer months and decreased during colder months. Therefore Goldbeck questioned whether ridership patterns within different seasons for the past two years also followed a similar trend. He was equally curious to find out how seasonality affected Capital Bikeshare’s business and when the best time of the year would be for a promotion strategy to boost demand and encourage the use of Capital Bikeshare’s bikes.On a per-day basis Goldbeck also knew that while the flow of commuters was approximately balanced over the course of a day ridership patterns could be changed by a variety of external factors such as temperature and weather conditions that would cause the flow of bicycles to behave differently. Therefore Goldbeck wondered how these factors affected users’ riding decisions and how different timing would affect the system’s operations.LOOKING AHEADWith radio-frequency identification global positioning system technology and an adequate artificial intelligence system the system’s data would continually become more accurate as more Capital Bikeshare users entered and exited the system. Goldbeck knew that invaluable insights about ridership patterns were embedded in the collected data and he needed answers before he could develop a sound strategic expansion plan.EXHIBIT 1: SELECTION OF Historical Data for CAPITAL BIKESHARE DEMANDSource: Created by the authors using data from “System Data” Capital Bikeshare accessed October 1 2018 https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.EXHIBIT 2: DESCRIPTIONS OF DATANote: °C = degrees Celsius; mph = miles per hour; kPa = kilopascal.Source: Created by the authors.

Rai chief executive officer and managing director of NourishCo Beverages Ltd. (NourishCo) was reading with pride the special mention of NourishCo�s performance by the chief executive officer of PepsiCo India Holdings (PepsiCo) Indra Nooyi included in her 2016�17 second-quarter summary report. As Rai looked away from the colourful array of sample packs towards his talented team of dedicated professionals he knew the young company had already made a mark in the beverage sector.NourishCo began its journey on October 28 2010. The long-term corporate vision of NourishCo was to focus on the health and enhanced wellness needs of India. The company currently had a diverse and well-conceptualized portfolio of three brands. It was founded as a fifty�fifty joint venture between one of the world�s best-known companies PepsiCo and one of India�s most respected and trusted brands Tata Global Beverages (Tata). Since its inception the two parent firms had been regularly financially supporting NourishCo. After a considerable amount of investment in product packaging manufacturing and innovations NourishCo had successfully met the objectives of its business model. The company now wanted to continue its expansion nationwide. The NourishCo board had approved national expansion plans with Tata Gluco Plus as the company�s leading brand. This was a great step forward but the pragmatic 46-year-old Rai knew that with great expectations came great responsibilities. NourishCo had a distinct low-cost and effective business model. However the low entry barriers in that segment could lead to fierce competition from both big and small companies. Tata Gluco Plus had taken four years to establish a market presence. However to retain its first mover advantage and achieve financial viability NourishCo needed to be a national company within the next couple of years or else it could lose its unique status as the on-the-go energy company. However there was the question of how best to carve a national footprint. Should the company begin with regions closest to its existing market or expand to regions with different climatic and customer compositions? The company�s fragile product packaging needed support from its manufacturing operations in the region. Was the decision to keep this kind of packaging viable for a national strategy? What about the variant mix; should regular flavours like lemon and mango be kept or new regional choices added? Rai expected that the company would be moving at a very fast pace over its next phase. The company would need to strike a perfect balance between managing cash flows and expansion plans.THE NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE MARKET IN INDIA: An OverviewAlthough the definition of a non-alcoholic beverage varied across countries and continents it was widely known as a drink that contained less than 0.5 per cent alcohol. The category originally referred to juice cider and lemonade and expanded over time to include a large variety of products in a profitable and diverse market sector. In 2016 the category was separated into carbonated soft drinks functional or non-carbonated drinks and hot beverages. Carbonated drinks the largest group accounted for 40 per cent of the category growing at an annual rate of 10 to12 per cent in India.Functional beverages were grouped together based on useful benefits they provided to consumers. Therefore the category included functional water and other drinks that contained some form of healthy ingredients such as vitamins minerals prebiotic or probiotic bacteria and raw fruits and vegetables. These drinks came in the form of fruit- and vegetable-based juices or pre/probiotic and energy drinks. The category also included ready-to-drink tea options which were also considered to have functional stimulating benefits. Dairy-alternative beverages which were non-dairy drinks and an important source of nutrition for lactose-intolerant consumers were also part of this group. The energy and fruit-based juice drinks together accounted for more than 50 per cent of the functional beverage market. These two sectors were expected to see exciting growth in the future at a compound annual growth rate of 25 per cent for energy drinks and 30 per cent for fruit-based juice in value terms.After India created the food and beverages sector in the late 1990s and 100 per cent foreign investment was allowed (see Exhibit 1) there was a proliferation of international brands with extensive reach across all beverage segments over the entire country. Generally three different manufacturing models were used by these beverage firms: contract-based outsourced manufacturing franchisee operations and stand-alone company-owned operations. Working capital management and brand building were challenging for stand-alone operations especially for creating a national brand. Quality diversification was a clear advantage for firms that had company-owned operations. On the other end a company with franchisee operations had a lower liability because of fixed assets which made exiting the market much easier compared to other models.The Coca-Cola Company PepsiCo Inc. and Parle Bisleri Ltd. dominated the soft-drink and bottled-water market. With very little differentiation between products they carried out continuous product innovations and extensive brand-building exercises to create entry barriers for new ventures. They also had the advantage of well-planned wide reach through their distribution and manufacturing networks.  In the previous six years an unexpected but critical market trend had emerged. Smaller beverage companies from Tier 2 cities had grown by 30 per cent. This was almost twice the growth rate of the market leaders in Tier 1 cities. In 2014 the market research firm Crisil had predicted that aggressive smaller companies would likely occupy 40 per cent of the food and beverage sector by 2019. Two regional companies were making significant gains in the market. Kali Aerated Water Works based in Tamil Nadu achieved success with its flagship brand Bovonto; and Hector Beverages based in Haryana had two successful brands: Paperboat and Tzinga. Both companies adopted packaged and branded traditional unbranded flavours and used innovative packaging and branding to succeed where cola giants led the market. These two brands were preparing to gain a national presence in forthcoming years. The soft drink sector was almost constantly affected by fluctuations in the prices of raw materials including sugar artificial sweeteners fruit-juice concentrates and other commodities. The base ingredient for soft drink products was water which was a major risk factor for the sector because water stress was a global and national area of concern. New trends shifts and reversals were also expected in the market share of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages based on forecasts of key market and consumer trends.SHAPING FUTURE MARKETS: Key Market and Consumer TrendsAccording to market research two-thirds of future market growth in the soft drink beverage sector would be coming from Asian nations mainly India and China. Carbonated non-carbonated and packaged water were going to be the major areas of growth despite environmental and health concerns. The chief managing director of Manpasand Beverages a fruit drink company based in Guajarat India compared the sector�s growth in India to other countries as follows:As per a report India�s per-capita consumption annually of soft drinks is three litres while it is almost 90 litres in the USA�and 16 litres in Pakistan. In a country of more than 1.2 billion people if consumption increases from three litres to six litres I am sure that no company can fulfill that demand. Such is the potential size of our market.A McKinsey report predicted exciting times for India and forecasted that by 2025 it would be the fifth-largest beverage-consuming nation in the world. The factors that the report credited for this growth included a 7.4 per cent increase in household incomes between 2015 and 2025 although the distribution of income would be erratic across income classes. A significant prediction was that employment opportunities would trickle down to the base of the income pyramid labelled the deprived group whose average annual income was less than _90000. This group was expected to shrink from 54 per cent of the population to 22 per cent by 2025. According to the report smaller nuclear households increased urbanization and a rise in the number of double-income families would further contribute to increased beverage consumption. With higher consumption growth for beverages in urban areas a considerable increase in consumption in smaller cities and low-penetration rural areas was also forecasted for the coming years. These areas which once suffered due to a lack of adequate infrastructure would gain with improvements in existing roads and infrastructure development which had become a prime focus for central and state governments in India. This would be further accentuated by improvements in cold storage and supply chain facilities. Consumers around the world including in India were consciously moving towards bottled water and water-based beverages for health and wellness reasons making pure water and fortified water beverages natural choices. Another trend of some significance was the emergence of smart consumers�well-informed customers that sought complete transparency in the ingredients and production processes of products demanding more natural and less processed foods and beverages. An increase in out-of-home consumption of food and beverages was also expected partly due to the fact that consumers were spending more than 50 per cent of their waking hours outside the home engaged in either work or leisure activities. Public beverage consumption was carried out in retail and restaurant settings while private consumption occurred at home. Roughly 80 per cent of beverage sales came from public or out-of-home consumption making on-the-go ready-to-use single-package units the preferred choice for all consumer groups. These consumer trends were shown to be effective in shaping the routine decision-making habits of consumers who were seeking new flavours and packaging options. These behaviour patterns had been recognized and addressed in the product strategies of both small and major companies that looked for innovative packaging labelling product form and composition for their offerings. Companies in India and around the world were experimenting with effective and innovative manufacturing processes taking care to balance functional and health benefits with taste.  However none of these trends could work without delivering value for consumers as expressed by Saloni Nangia president of the market research firm Technopak:Some segments of urban India are becoming more health-conscious . . . there is huge opportunity linked to fortified water or milk�they have more mass appeal; [however] if you look at it from a nutrition perspective alone one has to look at pricing. Value-priced models will have a bigger market opportunity. As a high nutrition product it is possible to create a new category as long as it�s also value and not only lifestyle.Another factor that needed to be considered while designing product forms and flavours was that India�s vastness and diversity in climate and demographic composition exhibited immense variations in beverage preferences. Regional drinks and flavours held familiarity for the localized preferences of consumers (see Exhibit 2).NOURISHCO BEVERAGES LTD.: The Inside StoryNourishCo began as the dream project of the two Indian business icons Indra Nooyi and Ratan Tata in October 2010. The company was set up as a fifty�fifty joint venture between PepsiCo and Tata to fill the health and wellness gap in the country by delivering healthier hydration options for the Indian consumer. The partnership agreement materialized a year later in 2011 and NourishCo was launched as a full-fledged company. The company�s first brand and manufacturing product was the global beverage brand Himalayan. The company began its journey with experts from both PepsiCo and Tata with each company bringing its own team of talent and experience to the project for the sale of �good for you� products to the Indian masses. These professionals worked to set up operations and business processes at the new company. The six-year journey had seen two changes in leadership by 2015 when NourishCo announced that Rai would be its third leader. Rai had been a senior director of sales (snack foods) at PepsiCo. He was an economics major and a management graduate from S. P. Jain Institute of Management and Research. By the time Rai took over the company had three unique brands�Himalayan Tata Water Plus and Tata Gluco Plus (see Exhibit 3)�with which to address the health and wellness beverage consumer gap throughout the country. At the top of the market segment was Himalayan a product that catered to holistic wellness needs on a global scale; at the bottom of the beverage market was Tata Water Plus a lower-priced product sold in pouches to meet the nutritional needs of consumers. Rai explained the company�s product strategy as follows: Indian consumers across segments have different health and wellness needs. There is one set we call the �globals� who are at the top of the pyramid who are evolved and seek holistic wellness options. Then there is the rapidly-growing middle of the pyramid for whom apart from replenishment energy needs are very important. And then there is the absolutely bottom end of the pyramid where nutritional needs are greatest. At NourishCo through the three hydration brands we are attempting to address the health and wellness needs across the segments. Tata Water Plus India�s first nutrient-water brand apart from being a safe alternative provides immunity for the bottom of the pyramid. Next is Tata Gluco Plus for the consumer who wants to get into packaged beverages at a _10 price point and for whom on-the-go energy is a strong requirement. Himalayan is natural mineral water sourced from the Himalayas targeted at those seeking holistic wellness.NOURISHCO BUSINESS MODEL: Developing a Formula That WorksNourishCo�s organizational vison and mandate was to become India�s number one hydration company. Tata had transferred to NourishCo its established premium brand Himalayan which brought natural mineral water from the foothills of the Himalayas to consumers. However for the company to meet its mandate it needed to look at other options as well. Through a systematic and structured path it was able to create a unique value proposition and a cost-effective business model.Understanding Consumer NeedsThe process began by first identifying the consumers� need that NourishCo wanted to target with its product offerings. One obvious consumer need was a basic thirst quencher. Considering that India was generally a hot country with contaminated bodies of water clean drinking water was seen as a basic necessity. NourishCo executives realized this and made a conscious decision to provide a safe drinking water option but with a difference. To do this a comprehensive water assessment study was carried out by Tata. The study identified some glaring micronutrient deficiencies among the Indian population. One of them was zinc deficiency a generally latent and little-known issue. Diarrhea was a common ailment in India due to low-quality water conditions which could lead to heavy zinc loss in the body. The World Health Organization spotlighted this problem which it commonly addressed with zinc tablets. The health benefits of zinc included a boost for the immune system. Another important consumer insight discovered in the study was the perceived importance of copper to India�s consumers. Indian residents generally stored water in copper vessels overnight which they believed was a healthy practice and Tata recognized the appeal that copper had as a cultural value for most Indian consumers.Another opportunity that NourishCo identified was a significant gap in the beverage market. Most of the Indian population was employed in manual labour which was mainly carried out outdoors. This livelihood necessity combined with the nation�s tropical heat led to excessive sweating causing losses in bodily electrolytes and sapping energy. Iron was also identified as an important deficiency among India�s population. Studies by major institutions showed that a significant portion of India�s population was anaemic which was a further drain on energy for consumers. These two health-related issues created a major need for consumers although no ready-to-drink product was currently available in India�s beverage market to address deficiencies in electrolytes zinc or iron in consumers. Interestingly homemade and available-at-home options did exist including powdered glucose drinks. However there were no products currently on the market to meet India�s out-of-home energy beverage need. Creating the Value Proposition Two new brands were created to address the gaps in the market identified by the research. The first was Tata Water Plus India�s first nutrient- and immunity-boosting water brand. The second was Tata Gluco Plus India�s first non-carbonated energy drink with the added benefits of electrolytes and minerals. The company ensured that both Tata water products delivered affordability and taste as well as health. �Taste is a hygiene [core benefit] factor� explained Rai. �You need to understand that while consumers seek a healthy drink option it cannot be at the cost of taste.� He further emphasized that a country like India required attractive price points.Tata Water PlusThe first Indian states where this product was launched were Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh which were very large beverage consumption markets in 2013. The targeted population group for this product was the lower end of the consumer pyramid. The NourishCo team recognized that the likelihood of nutrient deficiencies was more common among this group because of their limited food and beverage resources. After extensive consumer research the company also realized that at the lowest level consumers would not be willing to spend more than _2 to _3 for a thirst-quenching option. Therefore the company worked towards developing a packaging innovation that would help the company deliver the product at this price point arguably one of the lowest prices from a major company anywhere in the world.Although existing local brands did offer laminated pouch water they came with a plastic odour that affected taste. NourishCo�s technical and operations team developed a special quality of laminate that did not create an odour or taste in the water and that had a shelf life of two months even in the challenging Indian climate conditions. This enabled Tata Water Plus to offer a zinc and copper fortified water for as low as _2 for a 200-millilitre serving. In 2013 the company changed the product�s packaging and labelling to a copper coloured design. By 2014 Tata Water Plus was available in three states�Tamil Nadu Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat�in both pouch and polyethylene terephthalate format.Tata Gluco PlusTata�s non-carbonated product had to address the instant-energy needs of the consumer by providing electrolyte replenishment as well as having a satisfying taste. Therefore the next step was to collect further insights on what would be the right flavours. Research revealed that the safest (most liked) flavours were orange lemon grape and mango. Based on these insights PepsiCo�s research department worked towards creating a water-based non-carbonated drink that blended essential dextrose with electrolyte replenishment through sodium and potassium salts plus iron at 10 per cent of its recommended daily allowance. The challenge in this composition was the iron content which could leave an aftertaste. However after considerable trials and reformulations the team got it just right. The product was to be manufactured indigenously and thus a plant was set up in Aurangabad (Maharashtra). Initially named Lehar Gluco Plus the lemon-flavoured non-carbonated rehydration drink was test marketed in February in Maharashtra at an introductory price of _5. Later the company decided to change the Lehar name to Tata and formally launched Tata Gluco Plus in the hot and humid state of Tamil Nadu in 2012 in a first-of-its-kind peelable cup. The packaging was a key enabler to making the drink affordable at a price of _6 for a 200-millilitre cup. By the end of the year the brand was launched in two new flavours�orange and mango. Subsequently the new flavours of grape (in 2013) and apple-cinnamon (in 2014) were added. The product also changed price first to _8 in 2014 and then to _10 in 2015. Three years after the launch of Tata Gluco Plus the company decided to revamp the brand and significantly changed the packaging and labelling in 2015. This change was accompanied by new flavour names and the new tag line Gas Minus Energy Plus. That same year the first television advertisement was aired for the brand and widespread contests and events were launched in the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to support the brand�s positioning. ONSET OF A NEW JOURNEY: Why Tata Gluco Plus?With success came the desire to replicate and expand the success story. Himalayan already had a national presence but it catered to a very small niche market. Therefore to emerge as a major hydration company NourishCo needed products with a wider appeal. NourishCo executives recognized that although Tata Water Plus was unique as the only nutrient water in the country it lacked a distinct taste making it nearly impossible to distinguish the core benefit from other similar branded packaged water. The brand would need an immense awareness campaign for consumers to seek out the branded water for its core added benefits: zinc and copper. With such a considerable investment in marketing and time the company decided to launch Tata Gluco Plus nationwide. The product was promoted as an on-the-go product that provided energy replenishment through essential salts and at the same time the core benefit of great taste in popular flavours.Crafting the Value Proposition in Tata Gluco Plus Rai reflected on this next phase as NourishCo moved toward crystallizing the business model with Tata Gluco Plus. �After we rolled out this brand in Tamil Nadu and in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh we felt that it was time to scale up and we went to the NourishCo board with a proposal for expanding nationally.� The challenge for a product rollout was the fragile cup as the product�s packaging which could not safely travel 300�400 kilometres to reach consumers across the country. Therefore the manufacturing and supply of the product units had to be close to where consumers worked and lived. With the average size of an Indian state at approximately 500�700 kilometres in radius at least one plant per state was needed�more than one for bigger states like Uttar Pradesh. While the board was not averse to expansion the concern was the considerable capital expenditure required. A single plant needed an investment of close to _180 million so if the firm looked at 10 states and needed 10 plants it meant an investment of _1.8 billion. This kind of investment was risky. Underutilization was one concern especially in the initial years when demand for the drink would likely still be low.The NourishCo team recognized that it had the right level of product but needed to somehow justify and considerably reduce the capital investment. The technical and operations team which was given the task of solving this problem came up with an indigenous solution that would cost only 12.5 per cent of the original proposed capital expenditure (see Exhibit 4). Rai and his team again sought the board�s support for piloting and testing this manufacturing solution and the board quickly approved the project. The first indigenous plant was eventually set up in Hyderabad (in 2016). The product was pilot-tested and subsequently launched in that region obtaining positive results within three months.However the company encountered other challenges. A viable expansion required the right margin structure to be sustainable but at a price point of _10 the company�s profit margins would be limited. In-house manufacturing would provide some relief in terms of expenditures but the packaging material was still a concern as Rai explained:Next we looked at somehow working toward reducing the manufacturing cost. So we said �In this cup format can we improve on this format also and can we use a weight of a lower order?� Thus we worked toward reducing the weight of the cup. So experiments were done around that. Alternate vendors were identified so that we could get the right kind of pricing for our raw material. All this was done so that our margin structure becomes viable in order to replicate this model and expand nationally.The strategies worked and profit margins started to improve. The company then experimented with some local (regional) flavours. Upon examining consumer habits in Tamil Nadu it was determined that children in Northern India had grown up on something called paneer soda made from curdled milk and used to make special vegetarian food dishes. However in Southern India paneer referred to the rose flavour which was used to create a rose-flavoured drink designed especially for this state.To test the market potential in neighbouring states Tata Gluco Plus was made available in a few select cities in the states of Karnataka Kerala and Maharashtra. The product�s availability was managed by making use of the distribution resources of the parent company PepsiCo. In some areas the product was distributed through franchise partners. At this early stage in the product�s marketing process testing was done without setting up any manufacturing facilities in these states even though it was important to manage the supply chain for the fragile cup format in an effective way. NourishCo eventually established a manufacturing plant in the state of Jammu in 2015 and Tata Gluco Plus was rolled out in that state in the summer of 2016.THE DECISION DILEMMA: Marching Into the FutureLooking at the future Rai shared his vison for the company:NourishCo has been very nimble-footed and an extremely cost-conscious organization. Our credo is �Think fresh and act fast.� Our focus will be on building great brands but constantly challenging ourselves in terms of improving cost efficiencies. At this stage I do not have a clear-cut answer that I can articulate for what the future holds for NourishCo. But rather than giving you a specific answer let me give you a sense of the sort of organization we would like to see it evolving into. We would like to be known as the hydration company of the country which addresses the health and wellness need straddling the entire socio-economic pyramid.Himalayan was the company�s established brand but the surprise element that had captured the imagination of consumers was Tata Gluco Plus. The brand had taken the market by surprise and carved a niche among the traditional beverage consumer market in two large geographic areas of the nation: Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Tata Gluco Plus was the vehicle through which NourishCo intended to move ahead on its national journey. Rai emphatically supported that vision for the brand:NourishCo has the potential to enter the 10 billion club in the next couple of years. And as we march ahead to make our presence in five to seven more states lots of local players will pop up. There are two things that we are trying to work on to address this issue. One is the speed. The first thing is how quickly I can scale it up in multiple geographies so that there is no loss of time. And second is how can we develop a generic identity for the brand so that if it is about instant energy the only name that surfaces in your mind is Tata Gluco Plus? You don�t think beyond that.NourishCo had been a successful business thus far. However investing in the company�s expansion strategy came with a cost (see Exhibit 5). The company was successful in making use of product trials and innovation to create a unique and value-based beverage proposition. However Tata Gluco Plus still needed to establish itself as the everyday choice of the targeted audience across the country for an on-the-go energy drink. With small regional companies looking to imitate the cup format and _10 price point Rai had to move fast before the brand lost its unique identity.Rai had a weekend to prepare for his national rollout plan presentation to the Tata Gluco Plus management team. He still needed to resolve three key factors: the region the flavours and the product�s unique advantage.The RegionWith 29 Indian states there were just too many possible combinations to consider. The brand had already established a presence in the southern states. However several questions remained:Should the company expand into neighbouring southern states? Or would this decision define the brand as a southern product and make it less acceptable in other states?Because the brand also had a presence in the northernmost corner of the country (Jammu and Kashmir) would it be wiser to begin there? However as beverage consumption was lower and more seasonal in those northern states should the company instead consider states with a hotter climate like Rajasthan and Gujarat? Should the company maybe consider a combination of southern and northern states or all regions?The FlavoursAfter starting with flavours that had national appeal (lemon orange apple and mango) the company had experimented with local flavours such as paneer soda. However three questions remained:What combination of flavours should the brand adopt?Should the company consider only generic flavours such as lemon and orange?Would localized flavours had better regional acceptance? The Unique AdvantageTata Gluco Plus had several unique assets: the plastic cup format non-carbonated and non-caffeinated energy benefits an attractive price point and a great taste. However two questions remained:As the company planned the national launch what should be the brand�s key differentiators?What benefits should the brand focus on as it developed its brand communication?Staying ahead of the competition while remaining true to its vision of constant innovation backed with operational efficiency was critical to NourishCo. Tata Gluco Plus was the launch vehicle that the company had chosen for the next phase of the journey. Could this relatively new brand deliver on the promise that it had created?EXHIBIT 1: Government policies Affecting India�s Food and beverages segmentSource: Prepared by the authors based on data from �Ministry of Food Processing Industries� Government of India accessed September 8 2016 http://mofpi.nic.in.EXHIBIT 2: Snapshot of India�s cold beverage consumption by stateNote: km2 = square kilometres; * the state of Andhra Pradesh was divided into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

KG OPENS SHOP IN the United StatesIn June 2017 the supermarket giant Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG (Lidl) entered the U.S. market by opening its first 20 stores throughout the southern states of Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina. Brendan Proctor president and chief executive officer of Lidl US was given the charge of launching the hard discount grocery chain in the United States. When Lidl first opened it lured customers away from other top competitors such as Aldi Walmart Inc. (Walmart) the Kroger Co. (Kroger) Target Corporation (Target) and Food Lion LLC (Food Lion). Lidl offered lower prices than its competition and quickly gained a strong advantage in the marketplace. Although this gain was profitable Walmart and Kroger were quick to regain most of their lost shares.Lidl�s struggle to attract new customers was attributed in part to the company�s decision to open its doors to the U.S. market only one day after Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. (Whole Foods) and plan to slash product prices dramatically. Lidl also struggled to hit the correct target market for each of its different locations in terms of tastes and demographics. Despite high early consumer demand according to one observer the stores were too large too overly engineered and too costly to operate. With plans for 100 U.S.-based locations by the summer of 2018 coupled with the launch of a new clothing line in June 2018 Lidl the German supermarket giant had set its sights high. ECONOMIES AND CULTUREEconomyThe United States had been known to have the world�s largest economy; however in 2014 the U.S. economy took second place behind China in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). The purchasing power parity (in terms of GDP) of the United States was US$19.36 trillion in 2017 compared to Germany�s $4.15 trillion. The growth rate in terms of GDP for the United States was 2.2 per cent in 2017 which was similar to Germany�s growth rate of 2.1 per cent. There was also a difference in disposable income between the two countries. In 2017 the adjusted disposable net income per capita in Germany was $31925 while in the United States it was $41071. Lidl wanted to enter the United States in hopes of taking a piece of the large U.S. market for itself. The U.S. retail and food service industry totalled $5.35 trillion in 2015.CultureThe cultures of the United States and Germany were similar in many ways. For example both the United States and Germany had a low power distance score combined with a high score of individualism. Power distance referred to the hierarchical extent of a country and to the degree a person could exert power over another. In Germany citizens took pride in making their own decisions regardless of a person�s status. This was very similar to the American belief of �liberty and justice for all� and emphasis on equal rights in all aspects of society. Individualism was measured by the �degree of interdependence a society maintained among its members.� In both the United States and Germany people looked after themselves and their immediate family before worrying about others in the community. Germany and the United States also shared the same value system. There were two types of value systems determined by the main drive of society: to be the best (�masculine�) or to like what you do (�feminine�). Both countries were considered �masculine� meaning that both countries were driven by �accomplishment achievement and success with success being defined by the winner/best in field.�U.S. and German cultures were also different in several ways. For example unlike the United States Germany had a higher �uncertainty avoidance� score. Uncertainty avoidance was �the way that a society dealt with the fact that the future can never be known.� This implied that the German people emphasized planning for the future and exercising caution when making important decisions; Americans on the other hand were known to accept new ideas and innovative products and were more willing to explore the unknown. Germany also differed from the United States on its scores in �long-term orientation� and �indulgence.� The long-term orientation of a country described how a society had to maintain some links with its past when dealing with the challenges of the present and future. With a high score in this category education and changing cultural ideologies were the driving forces behind future planning in German society. The United States scored low on the long-term orientation scale meaning that Americans preferred to maintain time-honoured traditions and norms viewing societal change with suspicion. The indulgence attribute measured how social norms called for the restraint or relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires. The German culture emphasized conservatism and only using what was needed. German society viewed its desires and gratifications with cynicism and pessimism and did not indulge often. The United States had a contradictory attitude as defined by its work-hard play-hard lifestyle; while America was engaged in a war against drugs the drug addiction rate in the United States was higher than that of other wealthy countries.INDUSTRY OVERVIEWIn 2017 the U.S. retail industry ended the year with a growth of 4.2 per cent. The retail industry included any business that sold finished merchandise to an end user. In 2015 grocery sales accounted for 36.5 per cent of total retail sales in the United States. Grocery store sales totalled $600.31 billion in 2016 with an increase of $16 billion since 2015. Some of the top grocery stores in the United States in terms of sales were Walmart with $362.82 billion; Kroger which had acquired Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. (Harris Teeter) with $110.22 billion; Aldi with $23.49 billion; and Whole Foods with $16.02 billion.The CompanyThe first Lidl store was opened in Germany in 1973. By 1979 Lidl had grown to a total of 30 stores and had become a household name in Germany. Lidl could be perfectly described as a hard discounter�a store that offered a limited assortment of goods typically 1000 to 3000 different items at rock-bottom prices. In the 1980s Lidl�s growth continued and soon reached 300 stores. Lidl began its international expansion in neighbouring France and in 1994 continued expanding by opening its first store in the United Kingdom. Within a decade of opening its first store in the United Kingdom Lidl became the nation�s leading discount retailer. By 2018 Lidl operated more than 600 stores in the United Kingdom alone. Lidl first expanded into the United States in 2017 and the grocer operated more than 10000 stores across 27 countries by 2018.As an international company Lidl focused on respecting the cultures and traditions of its customers. The mission of Lidl was �to offer our communities high quality products at low prices� while continuously improving its stores. With its launch into the United States�its first expansion outside of the European market�Lidl did not want U.S. customers to think that its products were not fresh. In order to get its message across Lidl adopted the tagline �Our roots are European but our vegetables are grown here.�Environmental and social responsibility was of the utmost importance to Lidl. Lidl believed that sustainability was a key indicator of quality. Every Lidl store had a recycling centre at the exit where one could dispose of cans plastic bags and bottles. In addition Lidl had collaborated with How2Recycle to provide recycling instructions for all of its product packaging.Principles and ValuesLidl�s principles and values included customer satisfaction; superior quality for the lowest price; expansion and constant improvement in Lidl stores; defined working processes and procedures; short decision paths and simple work processes; ensuring the law and internal policies of Lidl; being economically socially and environmentally responsible; fairness to all in the company; promoting a respectful and encouraging environment; endorsing agreements in an ether of trust; recognition acknowledgment and constructive feedback in daily work; and nurturing an environment for leadership growth.The CustomerThe typical Lidl customer was middle class or lower middle class. Lidl had a �Surprises!� section of the store where customers could find discounted appliances and other household items. All products in Lidl were discounted and yet were of a decent quality.Lidl provided budget-conscious customers with a hassle-free shopping experience. Many were middle class families with children or elderly customers on a fixed income. Lidl attracted this customer base by striving for the highest level of customer satisfaction through its commitment to high-quality products at low prices.MARKETING MIXProductWhen walking into a Lidl store customers immediately saw the bakery section as well as an easily accessible household section containing cosmetics toiletries and the like. Having these two sections at the front of the store rather than to the side or in the back�like Lidl�s competitors did�made a Lidl visit much more attractive to customers only looking for bread or toilet paper. Lidl also had its own brand of vegetables and fresh fruits�Oaklands. Oaklands made daily deliveries to Lidl stores and gave customers a chance to experience produce from all over the world which was very attractive to health-conscious customers. Lidl�s push for cost savings was emphasized by the display of products on the shelves; products remained in the boxes or cartons provided by the distributors. Despite Lidl being a huge discount retailer customers would be able to find what they needed quickly without the temptation of buying everything else along the way. Lidl prided itself on having wine expert Adam Lapierre as part of its corporate staff. As a master of wine Lapierre enabled Lidl to offer an array of exclusive wines attracting customers from all demographics. Lidl�s private label wine selections had won 250 awards since entering the United States in May 2017. The label also won 42 medals at the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition where approximately 7000 bottles were tested. This achievement further demonstrated Lidl�s commitment to its customers of providing superior quality products for prices significantly lower than the competition.Quality StandardsLidl had a set of predefined measurable standards to meet quality requirements. The company constantly tested its products to maintain these standards. In addition Lidl conducted third party audits on product suppliers to verify the quality and safety norms. Products below the quality standards were not included in Lidl stores. Some of the quality maintenance programs adopted by Lidl were as follows:Lidl partnered closely with suppliers (i.e. manufacturers and growers).The company personally inspected farms and partnered with animal welfare groups to ensure the quality of meat and its sources.Lidl had a selection of vintage wines including wine from the Napa Valley the Oregon Coast the South of France the hills of Tuscany and so on.Lidl endeavoured to deliver healthy and delicious foods for babies.Food SafetyLidl was committed to food safety through its established strict science-based safety and quality standards to ensure the well-being of its customers. Lidl worked closely with suppliers to sustain its principles and drive continuous advancement through facility audits and product testing for quality assurance. Lidl�s first priority was to offer consistently safe high-quality products.Supplier RelationshipLidl associated with suppliers that shared a commitment to deliver the highest-quality products. With Lidl�s inflexible assurance to exceed consumer expectations the company searched for compatible suppliers devoted to providing and developing with the company. Lidl had long-term contracts with its suppliers and spent less time on negotiations to deliver high-quality products at extremely low prices. In addition Lidl expected its global business partners to adhere to and ensure non-negotiable minimum social standards such as human dignity a ban on forced and child labour working conditions and remunerations a ban on discrimination freedom of organization and assembly health and safety in the workplace environmental protection anti-bribery and operational implementation. SustainabilityLidl believed that sustainability was a fundamental sign of quality and aimed to provide transparency around its sustainability initiatives such as store drop-off recycling How2Recycle labels on Lidl packaging third party certifications seafood certifications and sourcing responsibly.Third Party CertificationsLidl pursued the certification of well-known agencies and organizations�namely USDA Organic the Non-GMO (genetically modified) Project product verification program the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal UTZ certification the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification Fairtrade International and True Source Certified Honey. These institutions set standards and best practices for various different industries including fishing organic farming and production sustainable harvesting and fair trade.Certifications for fresh and frozen Lidl seafood included those set by the Marine Stewardship Council Best Aquaculture Practices and Aquaculture Stewardship Council. Moreover sourcing responsibly allowed Lidl to improve the quality of its products to provide only the best to its customers. These products included cage-free eggs non-GMO foods and olive oil.PriceWhen Lidl entered the United States in 2017 it undercut most competitors by approximately 39 per cent�and Walmart directly by 9 per cent. In a typical Lidl store milk was priced significantly lower than its competitors. The price for a bag of four organic avocados was $2.99 which was far below the price avocados usually sold for at $2.99 each. Even domestic products such as Freschetta frozen pizza were priced at lower rates than Lidl�s competitors. Domestic products accounted for roughly 50 per cent of Lidl�s in-store items (see Exhibit 1). One way Lidl had been successful in its cost-saving measures was by offering many private label brands. Increasing private label brand offerings gave way to higher profit margins. Because of Lidl�s pricing strategy local Aldi stores were forced to lower their prices by 14 per cent. Lidl believed that its customers should not compromise quality for price. Through consistency strict standards and third party audits of suppliers the company was able to provide quality products at low prices. Lidl even went as far as to offer dissatisfied customers a replacement with their refund. PromotionLidl used big glass windows in all its stores to attract new customers. Upon entering a Lidl store a customer would be bombarded with large orange discount signs on almost every item. Lidl also had a �Surprises!� section with low-cost last-minute household items such as vacuums T-shirts and stepstools. These items rotated every Sunday and Thursday. Lidl also released a weekly circular highlighting some of the best deals available in stores that week. Television advertising was used to promote new store openings; however to keep costs low this was not a major part of Lidl�s marketing strategy. Lidl developed a mobile application (app) for both iOS and Android users. When customers entered a store a sign encouraged them to download the app. The app promoted not only deals that were in-store but also those found exclusively online. The app also allowed customers to �clip� digital coupons for additional savings. Aldi Lidl�s biggest competitor also had an app; however Aldi�s app only provided information that could be found in the store. Lidl�s website offered information about local weekly deals recipes sourcing new offers and new store openings. Lidl had a strong social media presence; its Facebook page was updated every few days and Facebook messages were answered within a few hours. LocationClose proximity to an Aldi location was a huge part of Lidl�s criteria for deciding where to open the next store. The Winston-Salem North Carolina location in particular was 2.4 kilometres (km) from the closest Aldi. In fact Walmart Food Lion and Harris Teeter were all within 8 km of this location. When Lidl entered a new market it gave competitors strong competition. Almost every grocery store in proximity to a Lidl was forced to cut its prices to remain competitive and retain market share. In 2018 there were 47 U.S.-based Lidl stores located across six states (see Exhibit 2). The company had originally planned for 100 locations by the end of 2018 but had been scaling back in an effort to maintain and grow the reputation of existing U.S. stores. Lidl also offered online grocery ordering and delivery in three states: North Carolina South Carolina and Virginia. The delivery system used a third party distributor called Shipt. Despite the fact that this service was only offered in eight of the 47 U.S. locations it was a great push in the right direction in terms of maintaining a competitive advantage with stores like Walmart and Amazon who had a huge online presence. To compete with online grocery retailers Lidl offered customers the option of ordering and purchasing their groceries online through its Shipt program using the free mobile app or website. Lidl delivered the groceries within one hour on the same day of ordering for a small fee; however products purchased from Shipt were priced differently from those priced in the store. Customers could also simply browse the site and choose groceries and a Lidl associate would collect the items for the customer before they arrived to the store for pickup. COMPETITIONAldiAldi and Lidl were very similar having both originated in Germany. In terms of number of locations Lidl did not have as many stores as Aldi; however most Lidl locations were within a few miles of an Aldi. One of the first noticeable differences between the two was the cart deposit. Aldi was known for requiring a 25-cent deposit to use a cart which was refunded when the cart was returned to its correct location. In Europe Lidl also had a cart deposit; however the company decided not to implement this practice in the United States. In terms of price Lidl was generally 3 per cent cheaper than Aldi. Most of these savings came from basic staple items such as milk and cheese; produce items however were usually priced similarly. Both Lidl and Aldi were known for carrying private label brands which helped them keep prices extremely low. At Lidl promotions were common; upon entering the store the entire entrance promoted the money-saving app. When users downloaded the app they were given access to all the current discounts taking place in the store as well as exclusive coupons only available through the app. Aldi�s app on the other hand did not provide any additional discounts to users. At Lidl in-store sales were promoted with a bright red sheet of paper showing the sale price. These price signs were hard to miss and really grabbed customers� attention. In comparison Aldi used regular shelf labels with small yellow signs showing the lower price. These were generally not as attention-grabbing as Lidl�s signs. Aldi�s prices were 14 per cent lower when in the presence of a Lidl store.Walmart Inc.Despite Walmart being a huge player in the U.S. grocery market competing grocery stores tended to drop their prices in greater amounts for a Lidl entry than for a Walmart entry. Walmart�s prices were the least affected in response to the presence of a Lidl at 2.5 per cent lower whereas Food Lion�s prices were 13.6 per cent lower. In January 2018 Walmart announced plans to close many of its Sam�s Club stores. It was shortly after this announcement that Lidl too announced plans to scale back its U.S. entry.Food Lion LLCAlthough Lidl was a newcomer in the market it was still creating big waves. With less than 100 stores Lidl was very small compared to Food Lion�s 1089 locations. On average Lidl was approximately 16 per cent less expensive than Food Lion for basic everyday grocery items such as milk: where Lidl charged $1.00 per 3.78 litres Food Lion charged $2.50. On average Lidl carried a smaller selection of products with a larger selection of private label items; Lidl normally carried about 1800 items whereas Food Lion normally carried about 38900 items. While Food Lion attempted to gain as many customers as possible by advertising consistently Lidl did not; instead Lidl saved money by advertising less often and passed the savings on to its customers through lower prices. Food Lion�s prices were 13.6 per cent lower when in the presence of Lidl.The Kroger Co.Kroger was a major grocery chain having also acquired Harris Teeter another major grocery chain in the United States. As of 2018 Kroger had 2782 locations�far more than Lidl. While Lidl found its cost savings by offering larger quantities of fewer products Kroger took the opposite approach by carrying many variations of many brands.�Although both grocers offered private label brands Kroger�s private label items were priced 31 per cent higher. Kroger�s prices were more in line with other major grocery chains such as Food Lion and usually above Lidl�s prices. Unlike Lidl Kroger and Harris Teeter also advertised regularly on all types of media. Shortly after Lidl entered the market in 2017 Kroger sued Lidl for copyright infringement on its private label brands and logo. Kroger eventually decided to dismiss the case and both parties agreed to pay their own legal fees. Amazon.com Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc.Amazon acquired Whole Foods just after Lidl opened its stores in the United States. As a result of Amazon�s news grocery store openings dropped by 29 per cent and some chains even considered filing for bankruptcy. Amazon�s acquisition of Whole Foods came in response to data citing complaints of long checkout lines at grocery stores. With Amazon taking over the ownership of Whole Foods the prices of many products in Whole Foods fell. The partnership also allowed Amazon to offer its Prime members 5 per cent cashback when using their Amazon Visa card in Whole Foods. Amazon planned to add more benefits for Prime customers in the near future. Through the Prime Now service Amazon offered quick home delivery on thousands of different Whole Foods products. Another positive impact for customers was the ability to pick up and return Amazon purchases in all Whole Foods locations. Private label products originally only available at Whole Foods could now be ordered through Amazon and delivered straight to the customer�s home.Lidl�s Future in the U.S. MarketIn February 2018 Lidl�s expansion target of 100 stores in the United States by summer 2018 was termed �aggressive� and �wildly optimistic.� The initial launch in a highly competitive U.S. market was not as overwhelmingly successful as Lidl management had hoped but it was not a closed chapter either. A 2018 survey run by Statista found that only 4 per cent of respondents regularly bought food and products for everyday use from Lidl. Over 4000 respondents between the ages of 18 and 64 participated and were asked to specify from which store they regularly purchased food and products for everyday use. Results showed that Walmart was preferred by 69 per cent Target by 37 per cent Costco by 32 per cent Kroger by 29 per cent and Aldi by 26 per cent. With an abysmal 4 per cent what could Lidl do to meet its U.S. market goals and expand into the future?EXHIBIT 1: Lidl�s PRICES COMPARED TO COMPETITORS� PricesSource: Compiled by case writers.EXHIBIT 2: LOCATIONS OF LIDL�S U.S.-BASED STORESSource: �Stores� Lidl accessed October 31 2018 www.lidl.com/stores; �Grand Openings� Lidl accessed October 31 2018 www.lidl.com/grand-openings.endnotes

He sat back in his chair and drank his tea. May was chief executive officer of Paillasse International SA (Paillasse) a Swiss bakery. He had just returned from a business trip to Spain where he signed a licensing agreement with one of the major retail chains which would begin selling Paillasse’s bread in 2017. May shared the good news on the phone with the company owner Sindy Pouly daughter of the company’s founder Aimé Pouly. May’s telephone conversation ended with Sindy asking “Where do we go next?” Sindy asked May to prepare a presentation for the next board meeting identifying major European markets and outlining the company’s internationalization strategy for the next few years. She also asked him to explore North American markets as a possible avenue for growth. This was not an easy task; the company was already present in 15 European countries including Switzerland. The challenge for May was to come up with a solid recommendation for expanding even further internationally. COMPANY HISTORYAimé Pouly founder of Paillasse was a far-sighted and intelligent baker who was passionate about baking and the baking business. He started working for a baker at the age of 13 making bread deliveries. Later Pouly did a baking apprenticeship in Biel a little town of about 50000 people in the French part of Switzerland. His apprenticeship was with a master baker who happened to also be the president of the Swiss Bakers’ Association. It was at that time that Pouly learned and developed his commitment to and appreciation for the taste of quality bread. Pouly finished second-best of all the apprentices of the Canton (state) of Bern in 1972. At the age of 24 Pouly opened his first bakery in Geneva. Over the next few years he opened 10 additional bakeries. He and his wife Catherine who was his business partner built their bakery business growing to 80 bakeries by 2016. While opening new bakeries Pouly also developed a new type of bread Pain Paillasse which was first introduced to the Swiss market in 1993. In 1994 Pouly registered the trademark “Pain Paillasse” in Switzerland and patented the recipe for making the bread (see Exhibit 1). In 2004 Pouly and his wife acquired the Novafood bake house in the little Swiss town of Satigny. The acquisition added nearly 100 people to the business bringing the total number of employees to 450 by 2016. Awards followed and in 2009 Pouly won the prestigious prize of Swiss “Master Entrepreneur” of the year. Pouly died suddenly in 2011 at the young age of 62. Since then his daughter Sindy and her brother had been running the Pouly family business to ensure the future of one of Switzerland’s flagship bakery companies.THE PATENTThe method of producing Pain Paillasse was based on years of research and development to achieve a bread that released no fewer than 80 flavours. This traditional bread with a rustic look was made with wheat flour natural leaven and pure water which were left for a long fermentation process then twisted by hand before being baked to obtain a golden and crunchy crust and a light open crumb. The main ingredients were a specific blend of flour and a confidential premix prepared with a unique production method. The premix and production method were both protected by patent (see Exhibit 1). The company had been considering launching a new Pain Paillasse product in 2017—the “Paillasse Tritordeum” with low levels of gluten to facilitate digestion. INTERNATIOnAL EXPANSIONFour years after Pain Paillasse was introduced to the Swiss market the first Pain Paillasse license was signed in Germany in 1998. In the following years the company executed licensing agreements with bakers in Italy Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg and Denmark. In 2006 Pain Paillasse continued its international expansion by entering Austria Hungary and France. Sindy wanted to continue with her father’s vision for their bakery including the internationalization strategy. In 2013 Paillasse celebrated its 20th anniversary and with its latest license agreements began sales in Russia and the Czech Republic. In 2016 the company obtained the prestigious International Certification Award for innovation of its bread. By the end of 2016 Paillasse had signed an agreement in Spain which brought the total number of points of sale to over 1400 globally (see Exhibit 2). BUSINESS MODELTo support internationalization Pouly had created a separate company Paillasse Marketing SA. This increased the business units in Groupe Aimé Pouly to three: Boulangerie A. Pouly (bakeries) Le Fournil Romand SA (bread and pastry manufacturing) and Paillasse Marketing SA. In 2016 the marketing unit generated about US$10 million in sales in the Swiss market alone. Paillasse served two primary market segments: domestic and global. In Switzerland the company either sold its bread in its own Paillasse bakeries or offered the premix under license to traditional bakeries. The business model Paillasse used in Switzerland was based on “pure licensing” with no additional investments needed for production or distribution. A key factor for success was finding licensees—producing partners such as a miller artisan bakery or industrial partner—that paid a start-up licensing fee of $3500 and a unit-based price for the premix (including a royalty fee) of $0.75 per kilogram. The Pain Paillasse premix—the secret and patented bread concentrate—could only be bought by licensees under contract with Paillasse Marketing. The licensee mixed the concentrate with regular flour or had a milling partner do it to produce the bread for market. Paillasse worked with about 600 partner bakeries throughout Switzerland. Once they paid their licensing fees Paillasse provided the licensed bakeries with the training necessary to make the bread properly and granted the bakeries the right to use the brand name “Pain Paillasse” (see Exhibit 3). Licensees also had access to marketing and communication materials provided by Paillasse (see Exhibit 4).The second market segment was international partnerships also built on the licensing agreements Paillasse had developed in the local markets. Paillasse normally designated one partner per country that was allowed to produce either fresh or frozen bakery products. The partner had to have its own network which varied between artisanal industrial and retail clients. The cost of the license in the international market included start-up fees between $10000 and $200000 depending on the market size and the partner’s network. The partner was also required to purchase the premix and pay the included royalty fees. As in the domestic market Paillasse provided international licensees with the necessary training and marketing support. GLOBAL BAKERY INDUSTRYIndustry SupplyThe global bakery industry grew about 2 per cent to $415.7 billion in 2016. The majority of industry growth was led by rising demand from emerging markets particularly in Latin America Asia and Eastern Europe. In the developed markets of North America Australia and Western Europe consumption was expected to be relatively stagnant (see Exhibit 5). While demand for traditional baked goods was expected to stagnate in mature markets globally a number of producers focused on introducing a greater variety of premium products in Western Europe’s and North America’s markets to offset the declining demand. The main growth in these markets was a result of manufacturers introducing a variety of new and innovative products meant to appeal to health-conscious consumers. These new products were generally in the areas of organic reduced-fat sprouted and gluten-free breads. Different types of flour were better suited for different products. Wheat flour was one of the main inputs used to produce bread. Any fluctuation in the price of wheat shifted the costs to the producers who often had to either accept the higher costs of doing business or pass on the additional cost to customers in the form of higher prices. It was expected that wheat prices would continue to decrease over the next few years. Due to the global nature of this industry the products manufactured by industry participants varied drastically from region to region depending on the local culture. The main products manufactured by the industry were generally classified into four segments: fresh and frozen bread and rolls; cookies crackers and pretzels; fresh and frozen cakes pies and other pastries; and tortillas and flatbreads (see Exhibit 6). Revenues in the tortilla and flatbreads sector increased over the previous five years with sales from North America leading that growth. In contrast sales of cookies crackers and pretzels continued to decline in part because of growing health concerns among consumers around the world. Global DemandThe demand for bakery goods depended on a number of factors including consumer taste which varied by country price levels per capita disposable income and product innovation. Producers in regions where bread represented a staple food item benefited from the steady demand for bread and other bakery goods. However in regions where consumers primarily made their own bread and baked desserts at home including the Middle East and Central Asia the demand for industrially produced goods remained relatively low. Moreover consumers around the world were becoming increasingly health-conscious and busy therefore demanding healthy and convenient yet tasty products. The emphasis on health and nutrition had adversely affected the demand for a variety of goods in the developed world. These included white bread cookies pastries and other products. In response to these consumer trends producers had introduced a variety of healthier and more nutritious products including whole-wheat bread and nutrient-enhanced bread to drive demand in wealthy countries. Bakery goods were sold in various distribution channels ranking from supermarkets (35 per cent) convenience stores and other grocers (27 per cent) food service and hospitality industries (22 per cent) and grocery wholesalers (16 per cent). Global CompetitionThe bakery industry was very fragmented with the three largest competitors accounting for less than 10 per cent of the global market. These market leaders included food manufacturing giants such as Grupo Bimbo SAB de CV based in Mexico (4 per cent) Mondelez International Inc. based in the United States (3 per cent) and Yamazaki Baking Co. Ltd. based in Japan (2 per cent). Most competitors were characterized as small commercial bakeries operating in a highly mature and fragmented market. Roughly 120000 establishments operated worldwide most of them as single entities. Price and quality were the two most important bases of competition. The industry was large with a number of small operators that specialized in generic products which were priced significantly lower than branded goods. The price sensitivity of consumers also varied between product segments. Consumer loyalty was strong but there was a high level of price sensitivity and buyers easily shifted to lower-priced substitutes. With the increase of affordable higher-quality private label brands competition for consumers continued to intensify significantly. As with any market the perceived quality of a particular product or brand in the bread industry influenced the price of a product. The higher the quality the higher the price. With regard to bread and bakery goods quality was considered the most important attribute followed closely by such factors as freshness and taste. Taken together these ultimately determined the competitiveness of the industry. Craft and artisanal bakeries were recognized for producing fresher products than supermarkets or convenience stores. Cost structures varied widely among industry players depending on the size or scale of production supply chain relationships and level of technology and capital investments. Typically larger manufacturers benefited from a lower per-unit cost of production because of their greater purchasing power and economies of scale. A typical cost breakdown consisted of 50 per cent for purchase of ingredients; 15 per cent for wages; 10 per cent for rent utilities and depreciation; 15 per cent for other costs; and 10 per cent for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).WHERE TO GO NEXTEarlier in 2016 May had hired Faustine Kesilber a young and enthusiastic business development manager and placed her in charge of international expansion. With the artisan bakery market in Switzerland decreasing at an average of 3 per cent annually Kesilber was tasked with conducting market research identifying opportunities for international growth and preparing an analysis that May could present at the next board meeting. Specifically May asked Kesilber to identify the top three countries the company should enter next (see Exhibit 7). Getting the market selection right was critical but there was another question May wanted to consider: Should licensing continue to be Paillasse’s mode of entry for internationalization or should the company use other modes such as franchising joint ventures or company-owned stores in certain markets?EXHIBIT 1: Bread-Making MethodsNotes: Hydration the weight of liquids to flour in bread dough governed the texture of the final bread crumb; kg = kilogram L = litre.Source: Aimé Pouly Method for Making Bread European Patent EP 0886472 B1 filed March 21 1996 issued March 6 2002 accessed December 2 2016 https://google.com/patents/EP0886472B1; and Aimé Pouly Method for Making Bread Swiss Patent CH20110000478 20110321 issued October 31 2012 accessed December 2 2016 https://worldwide.espacenet.com.EXHIBIT 2: PAILLASSE International SA INTERNATIONALIZATIONNotes: POS = points of sale.Source: Paillasse International SA documents.

(EuropaCorp) announced a historical record loss of â¬119.9 million. The next month the company released Franceâs most expensive film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (Valerian). Earlier between 2001 and 2010 the company had almost doubled revenues operating through what it called an âintegrated studio modelâ but then incurred substantial losses and nearly went bankrupt in 2011. To effect a turnaround the company formed distribution and co-production deals with Shanghai Fundamental Films Inc. (Fundamental Films) based in China. EuropaCorp also formed a joint venture with Relativity Media LLC (Relativity) based in the United States to market and distribute both EuropaCorpâs and Relativityâs movies in the United States. These efforts had increased EuropaCorpâs revenues in 2015 to the highest level it had ever reached. Then unexpectedly in July 2016 EuropaCorp announced the lowest revenues since 2008 and operating losses. It tried to effect a second turnaround by selling non-core assets refocusing on the founderâs historical successes of core businesses raising funds restructuring debts and reducing overheads. The subsequent capital increase that resulted from issuing new equity stakes to Fundamental Films brought about a major shift in EuropaCorpâs shareholding structure. However in November 2017 EuropaCorp still anticipated a continuing loss in 2018 (see Exhibit 1). Given the recent events and financial results the company appeared to be still in need of a second turnaround. How could EuropaCorp achieve its needed turnaround and continue to grow?THE FOUNDER OF EUROPACORP: FROM FILM PRODUCER TO ENTREPRENEURBorn in Paris in 1959 Luc Besson the founder of EuropaCorp discovered the film industry when he was 17 years old and on the film set of a short movie. He took many jobs in film production being second and then first assistant to film directors all while writing his own projects. Bessonâs first full-length feature Le Dernier Combatâwhich Besson wrote directed and produced himself in 1983âearned several awards in France. His next film Subway which was distributed by The Gaumont Film Company (Gaumont) in France was a great success in France with almost 3 million viewers (see Exhibits 2A and 2B) and was the seventh most successful movie of 1985. In 1988 Bessonâs next film The Big Blue sold 9.1 million tickets becoming Bessonâs greatest box office success to date in French cinema. Almost 30 years later The Big Blue remained in the top 50 of the highest grossing films of all times in France. Besson directed and released Nikita in 1990 and LÃ©on: The Professional in 1994. The two movies made $6.7 and $45.3 million respectively in worldwide box office sales with 3.8 and 3.5 million tickets respectively sold in France. Nikita became the most successful French movie in the United States making Besson famous on the international stage. In 1997 the release of The Fifth Element the most expensive European film ever made became the most successful French movie in the United States with $264 million in gross revenues worldwide. After a decade of international successes Besson started a new project Taxi. Gaumont was not convinced that this project was worthwhile therefore Besson and Gaumontâs former distribution director Pierre-Ange Le Pogam joined in November 2000 to create EuropaCorp which would produce Taxi and other projects. Besson was scriptwriting action movies at that time focusing on creating movies with popular appeal such as sequels to the original Taxi as well as The Dancer Exit Yamakasi and Kiss of the Dragon. The movies received poor reviews. Nonetheless the Taxi franchise achieved popular success earning $238.5 million in revenues worldwide and attracting 27.5 million viewers in France.By 2002 EuropaCorp had become a well-structured company generating â¬98 million in revenues and employing about 50 people (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Besson owned 73 per cent of the companyâs shares through his wholly owned company Front Line and was chair of EuropaCorpâs board. Le Pogam owned 16 per cent of EuropaCorpâs shares and was the chief executive officer (CEO) (see Exhibit 5).EUROPACORP: A HISTORY OF VERTICAL INTEGRATIONSEuropaCorp adopted an integrated studio modelâa studio system that brought many or all aspects of film production under one company. Creative talent was usually employed on long-term contracts (see Exhibit 6). EuropaCorp vertically integrated value-creating activities through acquisitions partnerships and greenfield investments aiming to consolidate its competitive position along the value chain of the film industry.Alongside EuropaCorpâs production business the company also sold television broadcasting rights and international rights. In 2001 the company set up several subsidiaries to extend its involvement in various stages of the film business in Franceâfrom theatrical distribution through EuropaCorp Distribution to video publishing and distribution through EuropaCorp Home Entertainment and EIG Fox PatheÌ Europa. The film distribution involved selecting a movie acquiring the needed copyrights marketing and programming. The company could produce movies internally or acquire copyrights for movies from other companies. Marketing activities included selecting a release date and method of promotion and organizing previews. Depending on the criteria for releasing the film programming involved negotiating with independent or networked movie theatres.During the same period EuropaCorp created EuropaCorp Home Entertainment to edit and distribute EuropaCorpâs own movies. This subsidiary then joined with another French producer and distributor PathÃ© FrÃ¨res (PathÃ©) and with the American film studio Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (Twentieth Century Fox) to create Fox PathÃ© Europa. The group distributed movies from the catalogues of all three companies in video format (DVDs). In April 2002 EuropaCorp invested a 35-per-cent stake in EuropaCorp Japan which was created in partnership with Japanâs leading media players to exclusively distribute EuropaCorpâs films in Japan. In April 2010 EuropaCorp increased its stake in EuropaCorp Japan to 100 per cent; however the entity was liquidated in February 2012 after recording revenues of â¬129000 but with net losses of â¬98000 in fiscal year (FY) 2010/11. In May 2002 EuropaCorp acquired Intervista a book publishing company and The Dog Productions a producer of advertising films. Intervista had published the Arthur and the Invisibles book series written by Besson and CÃ©line Garcia with more than 400000 copies sold of the first three in the series. The books were the basis for EuropaCorpâs Arthur and the Invisibles movies; with the success of the first film released in 2006 movies of the second and third episodes were subsequently released in 2009 and 2010 respectively.In 2005 apart from its core film production EuropaCorp created another subsidiary EuropaCorp Music Publishing to increase profitability of its own original music works. Until March 2017 the catalogue of approximately 1500 original works had been acquired by collecting societies all over the world. In June 2017 EuropaCorp sold its catalogue of music copyrights to Sony/ATV Music Publishing and signed an agreement with it to administer its music royalties for future film and television titles.In 2007 EuropaCorp fully acquired a long-term partner YdÃ©o which specialized in consulting and creative marketing creation for â¬670000. In 2008 EuropaCorp acquired 100 per cent of Roissy Films for â¬28 million strengthening EuropaCorpâs asset base and expanding its offering in the video and television market. Roissy Films was one of very few independent companies that owned a large catalogue; Roissy had about 500 quality movies.In 2009 EuropaCorp partnered with Euro Media Group S.A. Quinta Communications S.A. and Front Line to launch La CitÃ© du CinÃ©ma a cinema hub near Paris France. The project included nine film sets costing over â¬170 million to construct. The hub finished in 2012 became EuropaCorpâs headquarters in August of that year attracting local permanent and temporary employees who worked together on each production project.Penetrating the Television Drama IndustryIn April 2010 EuropaCorp acquired a 75-per-cent stake in Cipango Ltd. (Cipango) a producer of French television dramas. Targeting French and international markets Cipango was ranked as the seventh French television drama producer with revenues of â¬14.6 million. The acquisition was a significant step towards increase the value of brands EuropaCorp had developed over the previous 10 years while strengthening its reputation and position among large American distributors as a leader in the European film industry. Cipango was renamed EuropaCorp Television in 2011 and fully acquired by EuropaCorp in July 2014. Producing television series was considered less risky than producing movies because television projects were usually fully financed before production started. EuropaCorpâs entry into this market was also timely: the emerging SVoD (subscription video on demand) platforms like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.âs Prime Video were transforming how people consumed television series.The Initial Public OfferingIn July 2007 EuropaCorp announced a successful initial public offering (IPO) with a stock price of â¬15.5 and funding of about â¬77 million. Besson retained majority control with 63.2 per cent of the shares and voting rights. The goal of the IPO was to increase the number of high-budget production projects and attract well-known American actors. Agents of these actors usually looked for financially strong production companies. Besson and Le Pogam aimed to reach sales of around â¬300 million within four years of the IPO. Despite the fact that the IPO was heavily oversubscribed the companyâs first trading day was relatively quiet. After the IPO the share price had continued to drop until the global financial crisis. Within a year the global financial crisis had pushed the price down by 60 per cent to around â¬6.40. Based on the companyâs risk and return profile the IPO valuation might arguably have been too high. EuropaCorpâs shares reached their lowest level at â¬1.17 in May 2012 and then climbed fluctuating between â¬3 and â¬5. Compared to other film and entertainment companies such as The Gaumont Film Company in France and the American companies The Walt Disney Company (Walt Disney) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. EuropaCorp had underperformed in the market since its IPO in 2007 (see Exhibit 7).THE FILM AND CINEMA INDUSTRYIn FranceThe film production and distribution industry in France accounted for 3.2 per cent of the countryâs gross domestic product worth â¬58 billion in 2014. Franceâs population of people six years of age and older in 2014 was about 59 million; about 67 per cent of these people went to movie theatres at least once a year. Movie attendance at the theatre was the main driver of the French cinema market. In 2015 Franceâs box office sales were over 205 million tickets or â¬1331 million (see Exhibit 8). Record high sales in 2011 were linked to successful films like The Intouchables which was produced by Gaumont. The movie theatre was one of the final links in the value chain closest to the final viewer. In France the main theatre companies included Les CinÃ©mas Gaumont PathÃ© CGR Cinemas Group and Cineworld Cinemas Ltd. representing 13.4 per cent 8.1 per cent and 7.0 per cent of the screens respectively. In 2015 there were 5741 screens in 2033 establishments in France showing 654 movies which included 322 French-initiated projects. Movie theatres generally kept 50 per cent of the after-tax ticket sales and transferred the remaining 50 per cent to the distributor. In 2016 major film production companies Walt Disney Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. held 15.0 per cent 13.3 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively of the market share in France (see Exhibit 9). These market shares were volatile depending on the number of movies the company distributed.In 2015 investments in Franceâs film production reached â¬1224 million of which French-initiated production accounted for â¬4.4 million. Film producers often aimed to minimize their own investment capital by securing additional funds from co-producers including television channels distributors and subsidies. In general producers still had to invest approximately 15 per cent of the production costs. The major French production and distribution companies were Les CinÃ©mas Gaumont PathÃ© StudioCanal Cineworld Cinemas Gaumont and EuropaCorp. The French âCultural ExceptionâThe concept of French âcultural exceptionâ referred to the use of legislation to protect French cultural creations. One measure was an additional tax of approximately 11 per cent charged on all cinema tickets and 2 per cent on all DVD sales. The revenue approximately â¬700 million per year was used as a subsidy to support French original content such as all French movies. In fact American movies which represented 45â55 per cent of ticket sales in France were helping to finance the production of French movies. French television channels were also committed to investing some revenues in cinema production in exchange for the right to broadcast the movies on their television channels nine months after the release in theatres. The French government also imposed quotas on French content played on radio and television.In the United StatesIn 2016 box office revenues in the United States reached $10.6 billion representing 28.5 per cent of the worldâs market share. However movies produced by American companies represented an overwhelming shareâ79 per centâof all movies in the worldwide box office. The American cinema industry had six major studios including Walt Disney (holding 26.3 per cent of the global market share) Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (16.7 per cent) Twentieth Century Fox (12.9 per cent) Universal City Studios Productions LLLP (12.4 per cent) Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (8 per cent) and Paramount Pictures Corporation (7.7 per cent). Together they accounted for 84 per cent of the global market share worth about $9.6 billion.Before 1948 major American studios were fully integrated from production through distribution to exhibition in movie theatres owning their own theatres and exclusive rights to dictate which theatres would show their films. However a landmark anti-trust court case in 1948 forbade studios from being both distributor and theatre operator. Major studios were therefore relegated to production and distribution. The six major studios in the United States had their own subsidiaries in France to distribute their movies in that country. In ChinaThe Chinese film market had seen a very high growth rate from 2012 to 2016 compared to the market in the United States and France (see Exhibit 10). Chinaâs international box office had grown from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $6.2 billion in 2016 representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.9 per cent. With growth of 49 per cent from 2014 to 2015 China was the first market outside the United States to achieve box office revenues of over $5 billion. Its box office revenues were expected to reach $10.7 billion with a market share of 23.2 per cent by 2021 or a CAGR of 11.6 per cent from 2016 to 2021. This forecast was only $500 million less than that of the United States.China had become the most attractive market for French movies. However the Chinese government was also trying to boost its own film industry over Hollywood by implementing tax breaks for local cinema operators and requiring that to enter the market foreign films be co-produced with Chinese companies. In 1994 when it first allowed foreign titles in China the Chinese government limited the number of foreign films (i.e. films produced by a non-Chinese film producer) to 10 per year to preserve its own growing film industry. After entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 the government increased the quota to 20 titles then to 34 titles in 2012 and in December 2016 to 39 titles as âcultural exchange projects.â EuropaCorp was well established in China producing seven out of 10 French movies distributed in the country since 2000.CHRISTOPHE LAMBERT ERA: 2010â2016 EuropaCorp had almost doubled its revenues from â¬98 million in 2001 to â¬181 million in 2010 through vertical integration; Jean-Julien Baronnet was the CEO (until November 2008). However EuropaCorpâs earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) struggled decreasing from a profit of 14 per cent in FY 2004/05 to a loss of 9 per cent in FY 2009/10 (see Exhibit 11). Christophe Lambert CEO of Front LineâEuropaCorpâs parent company holding 62 per cent of EuropaCorpâs sharesâwas then appointed CEO of EuropaCorp effective July 7 2010. During FY 2010/11 EuropaCorp nearly went bankrupt with disastrous operating losses of â¬47 million. To recover the company launched a new strategic plan in May 2011 focusing on overseas expansion by targeting the Chinese market and the production of English language films. In October 2013 EuropaCorp strengthened its competitive position by opening a 12-screen multiplex movie theatre in the AÃ©roville shopping centre near Paris. This theatre activity generated revenues of â¬5.8 million in FY 2014/15 and â¬7.46 million in FY 2015/16 with 770000 tickets sold. The company planned to open a second theatre La Joliette in Marseille with construction to start in 2017.In February 2014 EuropaCorp formed a joint venture with Relativity the American production and distribution companyâRelativity EuropaCorp Distribution (RED). The new venture marketed and distributed films from both EuropaCorp and Relativity in the United States. EuropaCorp was to pay Relativity $130 million over the next six years for 50 per cent of the shares of the venture. Both companies were to seek opportunities to produce and finance movies together while sharing their profits. Being already present in the U.S. market EuropaCorp expected to use RED to fully control EuropaCorpâs distribution and maximize its visibility in the United States. Relativity also expected to increase its use of REDâs strong distribution and marketing abilities while continuing to expand its own film production.These efforts renewed EuropaCorpâs profitability between 2011 and 2015 with EBIT between 4 per cent and 16 per cent and revenues increasing from â¬168 million in FY 2011/12 to â¬227 million in FY2014/15 the highest level the company had ever reached. The release of Lucy a film produced by EuropaCorp and directed by Besson in August 2014 was a main driver of EuropaCorpâs success. Lucy became the most successful French film ever with the highest worldwide revenues and number of tickets sold to date (see Exhibits 2A and B).PARTNERSHIP WITH Chinaâs FUNDAMENTAL FILMSAs part of Lambertâs turnaround plan which included gaining a larger presence in China EuropaCorp announced a three-year deal with Fundamental Films in China in July 2012. Fundamental Films was founded in 2008 with headquarters in Shanghai and offices in Beijing and Los Angeles. A prominent distributor of Chinese and foreign film in China Fundamental Films was listed on the Chinese NEEQ stock exchange with revenues of â¬25.7 million in 2015 (see Exhibit 12). Through the deal with EuropaCorp Fundamental Films was given exclusive rights to distribute all films produced by EuropaCorp (at least 15 titles) in the Chinese market and the two companies committed to co-producing three of those films. EuropaCorp already had a large number of well-known top-tier films in China particularly Transporter 3 and AdÃ¨le: Rise of the Mummy. With Fundamental Filmsâ knowledge and market position in the country EuropaCorp planned to significantly expand the presence of both Chinese and French films to fully benefit from the extraordinary growth in the Chinese market. The partnership also made Fundamental Films an international player in funding and producing international film projects. After the success of this initial partnership the deal was extended in May 2015 for an additional five years. In the extended deal Fundamental Films committed to investing $50 million in Bessonâs new Valerian project adapted from a comic book and embodying EuropaCorpâs history. Valerian was by far the most expensive French movie to that point (â¬197 million) overtaking other films directed by Besson including Asterix at the Olympic Games (â¬78 million) and The Fifth Element (â¬75 million). Valerian was filmed at EuropaCorpâs CitÃ© du CinÃ©ma. Its post-production effects were done by a subsidiary of EuropaCorp Digital Factory. Fundamental Films and EuropaCorp would each be responsible for distribution of the movie in the companyâs respective territory and Fundamental Films claimed a substantial part of the international box office.THE END OF LAMBERTâs ERA AND CRITICAL STRATEGIC DECISIONS 2016â2017Lambert unexpectedly resigned in February 2016 and Marc Shmuger an American and a former chairman of Universal Pictures was appointed the new CEO. Lambertâs sudden departure raised speculation that EuropaCorp might soon be sold offâa conclusion drawn by linking Lambertâs departure with his overly ambitious Valerian project and overseas expansions. In July 2016 EuropaCorp announced very disappointing results for FY 2015/16 including revenues of â¬147.3 million the lowest level since 2008 and operating losses of â¬22.3 million. In September 2016 EuropaCorp announced the sale of its multiplex theatre activities launched earlier in 2013 and of the La Joliette project in Marseille still under development to Les CineÌmas Gaumont PatheÌ for $21.2 million indicating that it wanted to refocus on its core production and worldwide distribution of films and television series. In November 2016 EuropaCorp announced a reserved capital increase of â¬60 million by issuing new equity stakes of 27.9 per cent to Fundamental Films at a share price of â¬5.25 corresponding to a premium of 38.5 per cent (see Exhibit 13). This capital increase would enhance EuropaCorpâs ability to produce and distribute English-language films and series worldwide. The capital increase was also a major shift in EuropaCorpâs shareholding structure reducing Bessonâs ownership from 44 per cent to 32 per cent and making Fundamental Films the second-largest shareholder (see Exhibit 14).In June 2017 EuropaCorp announced its FY 2016/17 results which included revenues of â¬151.7 millionâa marginal increase of 3 per cent driven by foreign salesâbut with a historical record loss of â¬119.9 million. The operating cash flow was also enormously reduced to â¬2.4 million from â¬81.7 million in FY 2015/16. Accordingly EuropaCorpâs stock price decreased by 8 per cent. The company attributed its loss to the poor performance of English-language films and disappointing box office revenues in the United Statesâthe result of RED the joint venture with Relativityâwhich failed to offset the significant distribution costs of over â¬100 million. In response to this failure in January 2017 EuropaCorp outsourced some theatrical distribution and marketing of Valerian and other upcoming films in the United States to STX Motion Pictures Group with a multi-year agreement. This decision had immediate and dramatic effects on RED which included a large number of RED employees being laid off. FY 2016/17 also marked a high level of investment of â¬133.7 million in world-class films like Valerian and television series like Taken. In October 2017 EuropaCorp anticipated a continuing loss for FY 2017/18 again due to disappointing box office revenues for Valerian in the United States. In November 2017 Shmuger announced his plan to leave EuropaCorp at the end of his contract on December 31 2017. Besson would assume the position of interim CEO on January 1 2018. The company also announced the sale of the French television activity it had acquired earlier for â¬11 million; the sale would decrease yearly overheads of approximately â¬2.5 millionââ¬3Â million. EuropaCorp kept its U.S. television business continuing to produce and distribute English-language television series that had strong international potential. Also in November 2017 EuropaCorp reaffirmed its priority strategic objective to focus on what had been EuropaCorpâs successful core business: production of English- and French-language feature films and English-language television series and distribution and international sales of films. Valerianâs box office revenues were still disappointing at $225 million as of November 28 2017. The revenues would cover the production budget of $200 million but were far below what was needed to pay the marketing expenses of around $200 million. Given the cost of debts and the maturity of credit lines the company was considering additional recapitalization as well as cost cuts and asset sales related to post-production or film catalogues. EuropaCorpâs stock price continued to fall from â¬4.19 on June 26 2017 before the announcement of the historical record loss of â¬119.9 million to â¬1.15 on November 28 2017âa drop of 73 per cent.It seemed that EuropaCorpâs future would be decided by the box office success of the ambitiously big Valerian project and its distribution in the U.S. market. However press reviews of the movie were negative not leaving much hope for its success in France and abroad. Was EuropaCorp doomed or was there some way to turn the company around? Indeed given all the past and present challenges was a second turnaround even possible and if so what strategic financial and operational actions would be necessary?Exhibit 1: timetable of EUROPACORP S.

(Amazon) hit $702 billion the highest level ever. When its fourth-quarter results were released on February 1 2018 Amazon showed a 30-per-cent increase in revenues to $60.5 billion for the quarter and net income for the quarter had increased by 150 per cent to $1.9 billion. From its start as a venture looking to build �earth�s largest bookstore� in 1994 Amazon was now one of the most valuable companies in the world and founder Jeff Bezos was the richest person on earth. In 2018 Amazon had an online store that sold its own products and listed products for sale by more than two million third-party sellers. Since its founding Amazon had added more than 30 store categories ranging from electronics to furniture selling millions of different products and making an estimated 1.2 billion domestic customer shipments in 2017. Amazon Web Services the company�s on-demand cloud-computing service generated $17.5 billion in sales in 2017. Amazon Prime Video had become a leader in video-streaming services with original-content series and movies that rivalled the offerings of Netflix. Its Echo devices powered by the artificial-intelligence assistant Alexa had more than 30000 skills and could be used to control smart-home devices. The popular Kindle e-reader boosted sales of Amazon e-books. Amazon had increased its number of brick-and-mortar stores with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market (Whole Foods) in 2017. It had also opened AmazonFresh and Amazon Go grocery stores as well as Amazon bookstores. With total shipping costs that exceeded $21 billion in the most recent fiscal year the company was taking steps to gain greater control of its supply chain�a strategy that could eventually put Amazon in direct competition with United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) and Federal Express Corporation (FedEx). In recent years it had expanded into ocean freight forwarding opened an air cargo hub built a truck fleet and established a parcel delivery network. The company offered its third-party sellers fulfillment services called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) which provided transportation warehousing picking packing shipping customer service and returns for products sold through its website. The company�s latest initiative Shipping with Amazon was a new service for any business offering package delivery to customers regardless of whether they sold products on the Amazon site.From a standing start Amazon�with 566000 employees (referred to as �Amazonians�)�had become more valuable than Walmart Inc. (Walmart) the world�s largest retailer. However given the broad variety and volume of products Amazon was selling through a range of formats a key challenge for the company�s founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos was how to structure Amazon�s supply chain to support the company�s strategy and growth objectives. What supply chain capabilities would Amazon need as its business model continued to evolve?The RETAIL INDUSTRY Total U.S. retail sales were estimated at $5.1 trillion in 2017 of which e-commerce represented approximately $450 billion. U.S. e-commerce sales were forecast to reach $640 billion by 2020. Globally retail sales were projected to reach $27.73 trillion in 2020 and e-commerce�s share was expected to increase from 10.2 per cent in 2017 to 15.5 per cent in 2020.Amazon was the world�s largest online retailer and a competitor to traditional retailers such as Walmart and Target Corporation (Target) (see Exhibits 1 and 2). By comparison Walmart had generated an estimated $11.5�billion from e-commerce sales in the fiscal year ending January 2018 representing a 44-per-cent increase over the previous year. Walmart had been working to catch up to Amazon; it had purchased the online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion in August 2016 to augment its Walmart.com site. As an indication of Amazon�s lead in the e-commerce space Target had generated $706 million in e-commerce sales for the second quarter of 2017 an annualized run rate of $2.8 billion. Traditional Retail Supply ChainThe standard supply chain for retailers such as Walmart Target and Tesco PLC (Tesco) was driven by the orders retail buyers placed with suppliers who coordinated the delivery of goods for sale. A significant portion of general merchandise was manufactured in Asia and in 2016 U.S. retailers imported $479 billion of goods from China. Deciding what to place on shelves was a significant task for a store that could have more than 100000 different items. Category buyers were responsible for selecting and pricing merchandise. Large retailers had approximately 40 categories including housewares toys and fashion. A buyer normally set the assortment plan from quarter to quarter accounting for changes in customer demand due to seasonal events such as Christmas Easter and back-to-school sale periods. In order to clear out inventory to make room for new product for the next season retailers used a variety of approaches including price discounts or markdowns selling product to discount stores such as Nordstrom Rack or returning goods to suppliers. It was estimated that end-of-season markdowns and discounting cost U.S. fashion retailers an average of 30�per�cent of revenues.Since the 1990s retailers had partially offloaded the responsibility for category management to category captains�key supplier partners with the capabilities to analyze review and plan the assortment recommendations for product categories such as toothpaste shaving products and cough and cold medication. At Walmart for example there were 40000 suppliers; this included just 200 strategic suppliers such as large consumer packaged goods firms Procter & Gamble Company and General Mills Inc. Retailers provided suppliers with access to sales inventory and other data in real time using online information portals such as Walmart�s Retail Link network. Analysts working for suppliers downloaded and reviewed this data and then brought their recommendations to category buyers who had the final say over approving these assortment recommendations called �planograms.�It was often challenging for small and medium-sized businesses to sell products to large retailers. First it was difficult to secure meetings with buyers who were likely to stay with proven product assortment plans and less likely to devote shelf space to unproven new items. It generally took six to eight months for new products to be added to shelves as assortment plans were developed and current merchandise was phased out.Retailers and large suppliers tended to outsource a large portion of their logistics needs starting at the suppliers� factory gates and ending at retailers� distribution centres (DCs). They relied on third-party logistics providers and freight forwarders to ensure timely shipping and delivery of goods which could involve a combination of marine rail and truck transport. Goods were shipped in bulk�in container loads�from supplier factories and then consolidated broken apart into cases and stored. Retailers shipped mixed batches of cases from their DCs in full trucks to stores. At the store employees placed the goods in inventory in the backroom warehouse re-stocking shelves as required. While money was collected from customers immediately payments to suppliers were generally made in 30 to 60 days.Retailers had to deal with one final logistics piece after the product was sold: the returns process. Retailers worked with manufacturers to determine how best to handle returns. This service was often outsourced to firms such as FedEx Supply Chain and Optoro Inc. The retailing boom in the United States which started in the 1950s had left the country �overstored��with too much retail capacity in relation to demand�and consumer traffic in malls had been declining steadily since 2014. The Wall Street Journal noted that the United States had more than five times the gross leasable retail space per capita than the United Kingdom and that in 2018 U.S. retailers were on track to close more than 8600 locations which would eclipse the number of store closures during the 2008 recession.AMAZON.COMIn 1994 Jeff Bezos quit his job as vice-president of D.E. Shaw a Wall Street investment management firm and moved to Seattle Washington to start Cadabra Inc. which he later re-named Amazon.com (Amazon). He started to sell books online because books were low-price items with a large variety of categories.Amazon went public in May 1997 raising $54 million on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its online retail store grew in the years after the dotcom boom ended a period during which there were few if any serious competitors. Starting in 2000 Amazon allowed third parties to sell on its site. It also acquired other online booksellers such as Bookpages Ltd. in the United Kingdom and Telebook Inc. in Germany and rebranded them as Amazon sites.Amazon moved beyond books in an attempt to broaden the appeal of its online store buying online retailers specializing in various niche markets. A few of these included drugstore.com Diapers.com Audible.com and Zappos.com.  To attract more users Amazon started offering a service called Amazon Prime for a flat fee of $75 per year in 2005. Prime offered members free two-day shipping on eligible items access to Prime Video and Prime Music and free online books. In about 5000 cities and towns Prime offered customers free same-day and one-day delivery for more than one million items. In selected areas Prime offered two-hour deliveries on tens of thousands of items through its Prime Now hubs. As of April 2018 there were over 100 million Prime members who spent an average of about $1300 a year on Amazon�s website significantly more than the $700 spent by non-members. In April 2018 Amazon announced that it was increasing the annual price of its Prime membership by 20 per cent to $119 citing rising costs and expanded services such as an expanded library of streaming music and videos. In 2017 Amazon had generated about $9.72 billion in revenues from subscription services which included fees from Prime members.Amazon also branched out beyond online retail starting Amazon Web Services (AWS)�a data services firm that originally provided information on Internet traffic patterns�in 2006. In 2018 AWS provided more than 90 cloud-computing services including networking storage analytics mobile and tools for machine learning artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Its most popular services included Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon Simple Storage Service.Amazon also started testing physical store concepts such as AmazonFresh grocery stores in 2007 and bookstores in 2015. It made a more significant commitment to brick-and-mortar retail when it purchased Whole Foods for $13.7 billion on June 16 2017 signalling that it had serious intentions of capturing a greater share of the $800-billion-per-year U.S. grocery market. Although online sales accounted for an estimated 3 per cent of the U.S. grocery market in 2017 this segment was expected to increase dramatically in the next five years. Amazon�s total grocery sales in 2017 were an estimated $2�billion. When the Whole Foods deal was announced Amazon�s market capitalization jumped by $15.6 billion. Amazon had succeeded because according to Amazon�s chief technology officer Werner Vogels it had relied on several key building blocks and the �flywheel effect��the concept that core technology pieces once assembled could drive other positive effects and innovations�to maintain its technological edge over rivals (see Exhibit 3). As Vogels commented during BoxWorks a tech show �We may be a retailer but we are a tech company at heart. When Jeff started Amazon he didn�t start it to open [a] book shop. He was fascinated by the Internet. We are missionaries. It�s why we do innovation to make life better for our customers.� This innovation was illustrated in the development of important Amazon products and services over the years (see Exhibit 4).THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMAZON�S SUPPLY CHAIN Amazon�s distribution network started with the building in 1994 of two warehouses which Amazon called fulfillment centres in Seattle and Delaware. The Seattle fulfillment centre was 8640 square metres (93000 square feet) and resembled other retailers� fulfillment centres with manual receiving warehousing picking packaging and shipping operations. Boxes were packed taped and weighed and then they were shipped by either U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or UPS arriving at the customer�s location within one to seven days. The Delaware fulfillment centre was larger�18766 square metres (202000 square feet). In 1999 the company opened five more fulfillment centres as well as its first European fulfillment centres�two in Germany (Regensburg and Bad Hersfeld) and one in Marston Gate United Kingdom. Six years passed before Amazon opened more fulfillment centres in 2005.In 2006 Amazon created FBA a service that managed the fulfillment process for its third-party sellers. Third-party sellers could manage their own inventory and ship directly to Amazon customers (for which they would be reimbursed the standard shipping and packaging fees) or they could outsource inventory storage picking shipping customer service and returns to Amazon through FBA (see Exhibit 5). In 2013 it was reported that Amazon had launched an umbrella project code named �Dragon Boat� to expand its fulfillment capabilities. This initiative aimed to create a global delivery network to facilitate the movement of goods from China and India to Amazon DCs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The volume of Amazon orders overwhelmed UPS and other carriers during the 2013 Christmas holiday season. Late deliveries of customer orders reportedly cost Amazon millions of dollars in refunds and motivated management to embark on plans to build its own last-mile delivery network.In 2016 Amazon created a venture named �Global Supply Chain by Amazon� that featured Amazon as a global logistics provider targeting all services including trucking freight forwarding and customer delivery. According to Amazon it would be a �revolutionary system that will automate the entire international supply chain and eliminate much of the legacy waste associated with document handling and freight booking.� This initiative would see Amazon purchase space in bulk on airplanes trucks and ships allowing it to bypass brokers and thereby reduce logistics costs. Amazon added that sellers would no longer book with DHL UPS or FedEx but would book directly with Amazon. The ease and transparency of this disintermediation would be revolutionary and sellers would flock to FBA given the competitive pricing.Whole Foods sourced products from local regional and national producers. It had three seafood processing and distribution facilities a specialty coffee and tea procurement and roasting operation and 11 regional DCs that focused primarily on distributing perishables to stores across the United States Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition Whole Foods had three regional commissary kitchens and four bake-house facilities all of which distributed products to its stores. Other products were typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors. United Natural Foods Incorporated (UNFI) was the company�s largest third-party supplier accounting for approximately 32�per�cent of its total purchases in 2016.To make Whole Foods more attractive to customers Amazon reduced prices in 2017 on a selection of best-selling grocery staples. With an estimated 62 per cent of Whole Foods customers�about eight million people�maintaining Amazon Prime memberships there were cross-selling opportunities as well. Amazon had plans to sell electronic goods at Whole Foods and offer special in-store discounts to its Prime members. Amazon also planned to use Whole Foods� 400-plus stores as pickup locations for groceries and to handle returns. The chain�s stores and supply chain provided Amazon with access to the refrigerated distribution system its existing network lacked which it could use to supply home delivery of groceries. Meanwhile the Whole Foods supply chain would benefit from being part of Amazon with its greater purchasing power and opportunities to achieve cost efficiencies. In February 2018 Amazon announced it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its Prime Now hubs in four markets. Amazon�s supply chain had evolved over time (see Exhibit 6) and Prime Now was Amazon�s fastest delivery option with one- and two-hour delivery service. AMAZON�S SUPPLY CHAIN IN 2018Traditional retailers purchased goods from manufacturers in bulk and took receipt in full container loads at their DCs. In contrast Amazon�s strategy was to control the shipment of goods across the entire supply chain including procurement shipment to DCs and final customer delivery. As of November 2017 Amazon had 573 million products for sale on its website in what seemed like an unlimited number of categories and subcategories. The category on Amazon.com with the most sales in 2017�more than $8�billion�was the company�s consumer electronics division which included Fire tablets laptops headphones and other computer components. Home and kitchen publishing (including books) and sports and outdoors were other top-grossing categories.Amazon had first-party second-party and third-party sellers. A first-party seller was a manufacturer that sold product directly to Amazon. The online labelling for these items stated �Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.� For these products Amazon was the merchant of record (MOR) and the legal owner of the inventory prior to delivery. Second-party sellers were resellers that bought from brands or manufacturers and then sold the product to Amazon. Amazon was the MOR for second-party products. Lastly third-party sellers relied on Amazon�s marketplace to sell directly to customers. These third-party sellers were the MOR for their products. Amazon�s buyers purchased and priced goods for sale on the Amazon site placing orders to replenish inventory. Third-party sellers could quickly and conveniently list products for sale in 20 low-risk categories such as stationery books clothing cell phones beauty baby products and fashion jewellery. Product categories that required approval included collectible coins fine jewellery automotive and power sports products sports collectibles and watches. For other categories including packaged food sellers were required to apply for verification and approval to ensure they met applicable government standards. Amazon had more than two million third-party sellers worldwide including more than one million small businesses in the United States. In 2017 for the first time more than half of the units sold on Amazon�s site were from third-party sellers. Third-party sellers accounted for 26 per cent of Amazon�s order volume in units in 2007. Ten years later third-party seller volume represented approximately 51 per cent of the total units shipped while revenue from third-party seller services was $32 billion.  ProcurementAmazon purchased products for resale on its site acting as the MOR. Its buyers purchased goods for resale pulling product from manufacturers� warehouses on a weekly basis. Each Monday Amazon�s buyers would send electronically a list of purchase orders for items that manufacturers would then ship to one of the company�s 122 fulfillment centres. Suppliers second-party sellers and third-party sellers would log into Vendor Central Amazon�s ordering application and download the orders as Excel or PDF files. Amazon typically offered suppliers the option of receiving orders in multiples of up to six units. Thus if a particular fulfillment centre needed only one unit Amazon would wait until it could trigger a six-unit order before issuing the purchase order.  Suppliers could enter shipping details on Vendor Central follow up with tracking numbers and submit invoices. Amazon typically offered payment terms in the 90- to 120-day range. The features of Vendor Central contrasted starkly with the ordering systems of most brick-and-mortar retailers who continued to rely on a system of emailed or faxed purchase orders and manual invoice processing. One exception was Walmart with its Retail Link system.Warehousing and DeliveryAmazon�s distribution network consisted of a network of sortation centres fulfillment centres Prime Hubs outbound sortation centres and delivery stations. In April 2018 it had 122 fulfillment centres and 207 other DCs in the United States. These other facilities and services included eight inbound sortation centres; 122 fulfillment centres; 39 outbound sortation centres; 33 fresh food DCs including Whole Foods DCs; 53 Prime Now hubs; and 71 Amazon Flex services delivery stations (see Exhibit 7).The typical flow for goods through Amazon�s distribution system was as follows: Product from overseas arrived at one of Amazon�s inbound sortation centres before being sent to a fulfillment centre. Domestic suppliers often shipped goods directly to fulfillment centres. From the fulfillment centres product followed one of three channels. First it could be shipped to FedEx or UPS who handled customer delivery. A second option was for it to be sent as part of a truckload of packages to an outbound sortation centre where packages would be sorted and loaded together with other packages destined for a similar ZIP code; these shipments would go to the USPS and letter carriers would deliver them to customers. A third option was for shipments to go from outbound sortation centres to an Amazon delivery station or hub where local couriers or Amazon Flex drivers would deliver the packages to customers.In October 2017 Amazon introduced Amazon Key a smart lock system. One feature of this system was the ability to allow Amazon couriers access to customers� homes to place packages inside.Fulfillment CentresAmazon�s fulfillment centres were warehouses where product was stored picked and shipped. Individual fulfillment centres focused on specific types of product such as small sortable large sortable large non-sortable specialty apparel and footwear specialty small parts and returns. Small sortable fulfillment centres handled items smaller than a typical box in length which could be placed in totes and ferried around on conveyor belts. These items included books small electronics and watches. Large sortable fulfillment centres looked after products that were too large to fit in typical 18-inch boxes and that could not be sorted easily. For example the Arizona PHX3 facility was dedicated to apparel and footwear; the California LGB4 facility was for large items such as sports equipment patio furniture and pet food; Indiana IND5 was for large non-sortable items and for hazardous materials (hazmat) merchandise; and Illinois MDW4 was for apparel shoes watches and jewellery.In an effort to control logistics costs Amazon invested heavily in warehouse automation. It acquired Kiva Systems in 2012 and later re-named it Amazon Robotics. This division designed and installed warehouse automation systems exclusively for Amazon. Amazon Robotics automated fulfillment centres with the latest technology such as autonomous robots and associated systems control software and devices that incorporated innovative tools such as computer vision depth sensing and object recognition.Fresh Food Distribution CentresAmazon had a separate set of DCs for fresh food and cold storage grocery. These facilities had refrigeration and infrastructure to handle perishable soft foods. Amazon had retained the Whole Foods DCs to focus on serving physical stores and to augment Amazon�s online perishables orders.Prime Now HubsThrough its Prime subscription service Amazon offered special items for rapid shipment to Prime members in select markets. Prime Now Hubs were smaller buildings�about 1765�4645 square metres (19000�50000 square feet)�located in or near urban centres. They warehoused a small subset of the fastest-moving items that were available to Prime subscribers�about 15000 stock-keeping units. Delivery for these items was made as little as 60 minutes after customers placed their online orders.Outbound Sortation CentresGoods ready for shipment from fulfillment centres were also sent to outbound sortation centres (OSCs). Unlike in a traditional order-fulfillment process where packaged orders went straight to the shipper for sorting and shipping Amazon OSCs received sorted and packaged orders before delivering them to the shippers. Amazon coined the term �sortation centre� in 2014 when it opened its first such centre in Kent Washington. According to Amazon �Our sortation centers are at the intersection of our passion between our transportation and logistics networks and help us provide our Prime members with their orders in two days or less.�Outbound sortation centres allowed Amazon to have greater control over the outbound transportation of packages. By identifying opportunities to rely on low-cost carriers such as the USPS local couriers and independent Amazon Flex drivers OSCs aimed to divert volume away from UPS and FedEx. In 2017 3�per�cent of FedEx�s revenues came from Amazon compared to 7 per cent at UPS.Amazon FlexAmazon Flex was a program that started in February 2016. Similar to Uber but for package delivery it enabled contract drivers to make $18 to $25 dollars per hour delivering Amazon packages within select metropolitan areas. The first four cities to use Amazon Flex were Seattle Las Vegas Phoenix and Dallas. Drivers signed up through a mobile application (app) similar to that provided by Uber. Amazon was looking to save costs by using Flex drivers instead of dedicated local couriers which could charge 35�per�cent of the total shipping cost to deliver goods in the last mile.  Delivery StationsInstead of being directed to OSCs product from fulfillment centres could go to delivery stations. Amazon�s delivery station network (DSN) facilities were similar to OSCs but with key differentiating features. First they were smaller�5574�9290 square metres (60000�100000 square feet)�and they were nested within larger metropolitan centres. Second DSNs focused on last-mile and rapid outbound shipments within a tightly confined urban region. Third DSNs relied heavily on contractors such as independent Amazon Flex drivers to deliver packages.TransportationAmazon started building its truck fleet in 2015 to take increased control over shipments to and between its fulfillment centres and sortation centres. In July 2017 Amazon was also leasing 40 cargo planes as part of its logistics network. In January 2017 Amazon relied on its freight forwarding arm set up in Beijing in October 2016 to arrange the transportation of goods from China to North America.Amazon shipping costs included the costs of sortation and delivery centres and transportation costs; these were $4 billion in 2011 $5.1 billion in 2012 $6.6 billion in 2013 $8.7 billion in 2014 $11.5 billion in 2015 $16.2 billion in 2016 and $21.7 billion in 2017. Total fulfillment expenses (see Exhibit 8) did not include shipping costs. Management expected that shipping costs would increase as more consumers became Prime members and accepted two-day shipping offers. To offset these shipping costs the company was working to optimize delivery operations by investing in new technologies and negotiating better prices with suppliers as volumes increased.  Physical Store NetworkAs of January 2018 Amazon�s brick-and-mortar store network consisted primarily of 465 North American and seven international Whole Foods stores. Other locations included 12 bookstores in the United States and an experimental Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle. Amazon opened its first bookstore in November 2015 at Seattle�s University Village shopping centre and it had 11 other locations across the United States. It planned to open more bookstores in Walnut Creek California; Austin Texas; and Washington D.C. In the third quarter of 2017 Amazon began reporting sales from its physical stores with sales reaching $1.3�billion in the quarter.Building A Global Logistics GiantIn 2018 Amazon was both a retailer of merchandise and digital content and an operator of a chain of grocery stores and a chain of bookstores and it had more than 300 million customers around the world. It contributed about 4 per cent of total U.S. retail sales and its market share of the e-commerce segment was estimated to be approximately 43 per cent. By comparison its two closest competitors eBay and Walmart had 7.4 per cent and 4.3 per cent of the U.S. e-commerce market respectively. In addition Amazon had video-streaming and music-streaming services and offered cloud-computing platform services. Amazon was continually exploring new products services and markets. Meanwhile it was using new technologies and logistics models to exploit opportunities to reduce supply chain costs and improve customer service. Despite Amazon�s rapid growth the company faced challenges in its supply chain. In 2017 Amazon shipped over five billion items worldwide through its Prime program alone. However based on the difference between what Amazon charged customers and third-party sellers for shipping and the actual costs the firm incurred to deliver those packages Amazon lost $7.2�billion on shipping in 2016: it had outbound shipping costs of $16.167 billion and revenues from shipping of $8.976 billion. The company�s shipping volume was set to grow as it continued to build its business-to-business (B2B) marketplace Amazon Business. Launched in 2015 Amazon Business was a B2B marketplace that had more than $1 billion in sales in its first year of operations. By July 2017 it had one million business users and had expanded to Germany and Britain. Along with other business segments (see Exhibit 9) Amazon�s B2B marketplace continued to grow.  Amazon had a fleet of long-haul truck trailers to ship by ground and it was experimenting with delivery drones and had a fleet of Boeing 767-300s for its Prime Air logistics service. It had established a freight forwarding company to manage marine shipments. It was using big data to pre-position packages in the delivery chain in anticipation of customer orders and it had established a last-mile delivery network in some markets. It was encroaching on FedEx and UPS in an effort to control the entire delivery chain. As a result Amazon�s capital investment in its distribution network had accelerated to $13.2 billion in 2017 up from $5.2 billion in 2016.In February 2018 the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was looking to enter the business-to-consumer shipping market. This new service called Shipping with Amazon would deliver packages from merchants� warehouses to customers� homes. While the initial trial was limited to Los Angeles couriers such as FedEx and UPS saw their shares fall by 4 per cent on the announcement.While one certainty was that Amazon�s business model would continue to evolve a key challenge facing Bezos was determining how Amazon�s supply chain should change to support the company�s strategic objectives.Exhibit 1: Key Financial Information for Amazon Walmart and Target*

Prior to joining the APY Art Centre Collective O’Meara had worked in various roles in the Indigenous art industry for over a dozen years (see Exhibit 1). She joined the Collective in 2017 and by 2018 was immersed in opening the Collective’s first gallery in Sydney more than 2500 kilometres from the APY communities. Now barely a year later the board (see Exhibit 2) wanted to open another gallery this one in Adelaide in large part because Adelaide was closer to the APY Lands and a large contingent of APY community members lived in or visited Adelaide at any one time.O’Meara shared the board’s excitement about starting a gallery that could also serve as an urban art centre for the APY community residents in Adelaide and she was happy about the prospect of being closer to the APY Lands that she loved and visited monthly. At the same time O’Meara was worried about the expansion. She had doubts about whether the small isolated city of Adelaide could support a gallery: Would there be enough demand and donors? O’Meara was also concerned about whether she and her small staff could manage two galleries thousands of kilometres apart and still keep their ties to the APY Lands. On top of it all O’Meara was developing a digital presence for the APY Gallery Sydney and was worried that opening a new gallery would distract her from building that presence. The board’s vision was certainly compelling but was it practical?APY Lands and ArtAPY stood for Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Aṉangu (pronounced arn-ung-oo) being Indigenous peoples of Australia. The APY Lands were a parcel of land set aside for the traditional landowners from the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples. The Lands were in the north-west corner of South Australia south of Uluru near the centre of the Australian outback. In 2019 approximately 2300 people lived on the APY Lands in approximately seven small communities spread over a vast area (see Exhibit 3). Remarkably each community had its own art centre.In the late 1930s into the 1940s the Australian government supported mission organizations in establishing settlements on the lands. The clans slowly settled into seven communities around the missions although it wasn’t until the 1950s that the last clans settled down. Many of the elders on APY Lands had memories of the pre-contact period. Their parents spent most of their lives with no contact with the “whitefellas” and the elders themselves remembered both the “walking around time” (when clans were nomadic) and the early period of settlement.By 2019 the economic and health conditions on the Lands were dire. Sedentary life combined with poverty had led to significant health problems. Obesity was endemic due to a combination of food insecurity and the prevalence of poor-quality high-calorie food. Alcoholism and violence were pervasive and petrol sniffing was making a comeback despite the legacy of death and brain damage left by the previous wave of petrol sniffing in the late 1980s. Incarceration rates were extremely high in part because of the poverty and substance-related violence and in part due to cultural rifts between the communities and the police. The widespread health problems resulted in many people from the APY Lands travelling to and living in Adelaide to receive medical treatment related to diabetes and associated kidney disease. The need to seek treatment 1400 kilometres from home resulted in isolation from families and communities which only added to the stress and illness.One of the few bright spots in this grim picture was art. Remarkably approximately 500 active artists were on the APY Lands and most were working out of one of the art centres located in the communities. The art centres such as Ernabella Arts grew out of craft rooms set up in the missions; they provided art training mentoring and community (see Exhibits 4 and 5). They also offered emergency financial support often in the form of small jobs that might pay enough to cover a tank of petrol or food for a week. Over time each community developed a distinctive style of art but across the APY Lands art expressed preserved and rejuvenated culture; generated continuity across generations; and provided one of the only sources of income independent of government assistance.APY artists were a force in the Australian art world. For example in 2017 APY artists accounted for 14 of 15 finalists for the AU$50000 Wynne Prize awarded annually for the best landscape painting of Australian scenery or for the best example of figure sculpture by Australian artists; two finalists for the $100000 Archibald Prize awarded annually to the best portrait painted by an Australian resident; and 25 nominations for the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards Australia’s longest running and most prestigious Indigenous art awards.Nationally a handful of recognized APY artists could command $100000 or more for canvases and established galleries in the big cities competed to showcase their art. For the other artists distribution choices were few and risky because unscrupulous dealers travelled to Adelaide and the art centres to purchase canvases for tiny amounts offering “day rates” of $20 or $100 for quick paintings then re-selling the work without attribution royalties or fees throughout urban Australia. Some dealers even set up painting sheds located in and around Alice Springs and paid young artists a few dollars a day to work in the painting sheds and create cheap reproductions of famous works. O’Meara explained:Carpetbaggers do not often come to the Lands; they lure artists into their sheds or sweat shops with a promise of fast income. They often exploit vulnerable disadvantaged families living in extreme conditions and they take advantage of the lack of numeracy and literacy skills and family social challenges.... Fake works are also produced in these sheds with artists being paid to copy works of higher profile artists.APY Art Centre CollectiveIn response to these abuses the APY Art Centre Collective was organized to create new markets support region-wide collaborative art projects and increase the money flowing to the art centres and the artists. The Collective was controlled by a board of elders each elder representing a community art centre.One example of an APY Art Centre Collective project was the canvas painted for and presented to the mosque in Christchurch New Zealand after the March 2019 massacre there. Elder artist and board member Nyunmiti Burton conceived the idea of giving a canvas after seeing television coverage of the massacre. She felt sad for the families and a connection with the spirituality of those in the mosque; she decided that the APY community needed to use its art to make a statement about the insanity of this kind of killing.Reflecting on her inspiration Burton spoke eloquently about “looking back to the time when we were strong—back when we walked around with no clothes—to find elements of our culture to become strong again moving into the future.” She was talking about making art but art rooted in culture stories and oral and visual histories leading from water source to water source. She spoke about how all these elements were interconnected into one narrative told and retold painted and repainted. But the artists did not just retell the old; they spoke of the current and future using techniques and colours that made sense for the present.Burton went on to talk about “sorry camps” another cultural practice that had evolved. When someone died the clan dropped everything and gathered in the desert for a week or more to mourn tell stories and bury their relative. A newer tradition involved placing yellow plastic flowers on the coffin and on the grave. These yellow flowers were a prominent feature of the canvas the APY Art Centre Collective gave to the Christchurch mosque.The canvas was painted in a weekend by a group of women artists old and young. After conversation about the massacre and the goal of the canvas about sorry camps and grieving about the connections they saw and felt two or three of the elders painted the basic scaffolding—the black lines in the picture—and then the rest filled in the colours each working on a small patch of canvas. Besides being a moving offering in and of itself the finished painting was valued at well over $100000 due to its beauty and the notoriety of some of the artists. It was an all-star canvas.Big City LightsTo circumvent the carpetbagger art dealers and support emerging artists the APY Art Centre Collective decided to open its own gallery. The Collective’s goals were to command higher prices build the reputations of emerging artists protect them from unscrupulous dealers and channel more money back to the APY Lands.The elders envisioned not just a gallery space but an urban version of an art centre—a space that would provide support for the APY community members in the city a communal studio a launch pad for emerging artists and an economic engine that would send money back to the APY Lands. The brick-and-mortar APY Art Centre Collective gallery would also provide a rich experience for art buyers by creating opportunities for customers to view and buy finished pieces and to learn about the art and its cultural roots from APY artists working on site. The gallery would educate customers and the broader community about APY art and about the workings of the market for Indigenous art. Finally art buyers could be confident that the art they bought through the APY Art Centre Collective gallery was genuine and that the proceeds would provide financial support to both an APY artist and the APY community at large.The elders asked O’Meara a trusted “whitefella” to represent the Collective and interact with the urban world. O’Meara had spent 12 years in the APY Lands working at first for the government and later for various art centres. Although she had no dealer or gallery experience O’Meara had proven to be a good administrator a passionate advocate and critically a trustworthy employee. O’Meara estimated that about 200 rising artists had work that could be priced at $1000 to $3000 per piece if sold in an urban centre.From the outset the Collective was determined to challenge existing industry commission structures. Working with the elders the Collective decided that the gallery would pay 60 per cent of the sales price to the artists and keep 40 per cent for operations; in addition the gallery would channel any profit back to the art centres on the APY Lands. This payment structure was in marked and intentional contrast to the conventional gallery structure in which the gallery kept 60 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of the established artist’s work (see Exhibit 6). The Collective’s gallery fees were even further removed from the carpetbaggers’ practice of paying artists a small flat fee and then keeping the entire selling price for the dealer. At first the APY Art Centre Collective wanted to open its gallery in Adelaide the capital of South Australia. South Australia was a sparsely populated desert state about the size of France and approximately 1.3 million of its 2 million residents lived in Adelaide. Although Adelaide’s economy had suffered from the steep decline of automotive manufacturing in Australia Adelaide remained the economic and service hub of the state with three universities two large hospitals a port and a large number of small businesses. Adelaide was also familiar ground to the APY communities. While it was a two-to-four-day drive on dirt roads from the APY Lands in the far corner of South Australia Adelaide was still the closest city of any size and was home to a constantly changing population of people from the APY communities drawn to Adelaide for health care and economic opportunity. A gallery in Adelaide could do double duty as an art centre and place of support for the APY people navigating the city.To fund the gallery dream the Collective applied for government and private support while also raising seed money by producing and selling all-star canvases. After struggling to find enough philanthropic or government support to open in Adelaide the APY Art Centre Collective received a donor’s offer to match the Collective’s seed money if the art centre would open its gallery in Sydney. Much larger and wealthier than Adelaide the Sydney region had a population of more than 5 million residents a diverse array of firms—many with global ties—and a burgeoning art scene. Further Sydney was located in the state of New South Wales the richest and most populous of Australia’s states. But Sydney was more than 2500 kilometres from the APY Lands and although it was home to an extremely diverse population it had virtually no APY community. After painful deliberation the board decided to take the risk follow the money and launch its first gallery in Sydney despite concerns about the distance and lack of APY community there.APY Gallery Sydney opened in March 2018 in a two-story building just blocks from the National Art School where artists visiting from the APY Lands could participate in professional development opportunities across a diversity of mediums including printmaking ceramics sculpture new media arts and photography. Despite a rushed launch scant initial notice from the art world and the lack of an APY presence in Sydney the gallery surprised everyone including the APY Art Centre Collective by selling $700000 worth of artwork in its first year.Part of the gallery’s success was attributed to the occasional presence of the artists: gallery goers could interact with visiting artists making art. Also contributing to first year success was a concerted effort to reach art buyers through digital marketing techniques. The APY Art Centre Collective created a presence on the web Facebook and Instagram and developed a mechanism for selling directly to buyers through direct messaging and email. The increased visibility also paid off indirectly with more APY artists winning awards selling their art works at higher prices and even being invited to travel internationally to display their work (see Exhibit 7).By the end of its first year the Sydney gallery had helped the Collective direct $941000 to artists and the art centres on the APY Lands. However as successful as the Sydney gallery’s first year was the Collective remained reliant on donor support (see Exhibit 8). The gallery contributed to an increase in art sales from just over $913000 in 2018 to just over $1458000 in 2019 but the cash proceeds from art sales contributed only $517000 to cash operating expenses in 2019 of $1076000. The balance was made up from donated funds especially government grants.The success of APY Gallery Sydney sparked renewed interest in South Australia and the state’s premier urged the APY Art Centre Collective to open a gallery in Adelaide. Because the Collective had always wanted to locate in Adelaide where so many APY people lived or visited for medical care the elders were interested in the offer and asked O’Meara to move from Sydney to Adelaide to open a second gallery.O’Meara was not so sure of the plan. Although the APY community was strong in Adelaide and many more artists would be able to work from a gallery located there the Adelaide art market was tiny compared to that of Sydney. Also South Australia’s capacity to support both art and Indigenous communities was much smaller than that of New South Wales. Further the Sydney gallery was just finishing its first year staffing was thin and projected profits were uncertain. O’Meara worried that opening an Adelaide gallery would dilute attention time and money and increase the chance that the Sydney gallery the digital marketing initiative and the Adelaide gallery would all fail. Finally the board had recently asked O’Meara to help several artists tour Europe and to organize a trip to Christchurch to present the sorry camp canvas. She was not at all sure that she could manage Sydney Adelaide digital marketing and the tours especially given the large distances involved and her commitment to the elders to spend as much as 40 per cent of her time on the Lands.With all this in mind O’Meara argued that she should stay in Sydney to develop both the Sydney and online customer base using any extra time to work on special projects such as the tours. She was confident that in one or two more years she could develop the gallery and its online store into a reliable source of income and reputation for the APY community. Once a strong foundation was in place in Sydney and online the time would be right to open an additional gallery in Adelaide.But the elders had been dreaming about a gallery in Adelaide for nearly a decade. A large APY community in Adelaide needed support the state was interested in providing funding and a gallery and workshop space were available. Further while the Sydney gallery operations were shaky its online presence was growing and there was cash in the bank from previous fundraising various special projects and all-star canvas sales. The elders were adamant: it was time to launch the Adelaide gallery. O’Meara’s challenge was to make the expansion a success—without undermining the rest of the APY Art Centre Collective’s initiatives.Exhibit 1: Biography of Skye O’MearaSkye O’Meara started her work in the Indigenous art industry in 2003. She worked first for the Australia Council for the Arts the federal government’s funding body for the arts for four years before becoming manager of Tjala Arts in the Amata Community in 2007. During her years at Tjala Arts she supported Tjala Arts directors and senior artists across the region to drive innovative artistic projects and strategies such as the Kulata Tjuta Project (Many Spears) and the APY Young Photographers program.
In 2017 O’Meara accepted the position of general manager of the APY Art Centre Collective. In that role she coordinated and delivered an expansive range of prestigious artistic projects and regional business initiatives. Her passion was creating Indigenous employment in communities through art centres. Her self-described professional focus was “positive social change.”Source: “Skye O’Meara” W [Westpac] Scholars accessed December 18 2020 https://scholars.westpacgroup.com.au/Scholars/Profile?Id=3331; “Skye O’Meara” LinkedIn accessed December 18 2020 www.linkedin.com/in/skye-o-meara-9234551a2.Exhibit 2: APY Art Centre Collective Board of DirectorsSource: Company documents.Exhibit 3: Location of APY CommunitiesSource: Company documents.Exhibit 4: Ernabella Arts Centre Philosophy and SpiritI hear the singing and my mind takes me back to my life as a child when we didn’t know about your world. To a time where song was strong and echoed around our beautiful country around the creek beds rock holes and sand dunes of the Lands.I am an old woman now. The songs of my childhood are still alive. There were years where we sang with softer voices our voices were weakened from the challenges we faced when our worlds collided.The job of the Elders became clear and our focus grew stronger. Through our culture we would find the solutions. Through our culture we would find the opportunities and roles for the next generations.We started our art centres first in Ernabella and then one by one in each of the communities.

In response two seller associations with memberships of around 1800 Flipkart sellers out of the total of 90000 registered with Flipkart protested against the new policy expressing their resistance by not processing new orders and campaigning on social media using the hashtags â#OnlineDharnaâ and â#SellerQuitFlipkart.â Sanjay Thakur a spokesperson for an online sellersâ trade union with around 1000 sellers said The changes on return shipping policy will impact sellers heavily. Flipkart used to charge a fee from sellers only if we were at fault which would be less than 1 per cent of the order (value). Now Flipkart will deduct shipping charges and collection fees from sellers (in case of returns) which will be huge since return percentage ranges from 8 to 10 per cent [of] (deliveries) in most of the categories.Another group All India Online Vendors Association which had 800 members stated âDue to the new policy sellers will be forced to increase prices by around 10 per cent and will also charge shipping fees to customers.â Although the number of disgruntled sellers was relatively low in the context of Flipkartâs massive merchant network the protest against the new policy created an opportunity for Flipkartâs competitors. Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) which boasted a seller base of 85000 merchants in India reduced sellersâ commissions to lure these resentful sellers to its platform. Snapdeal another home-grown rival with more than 300000 sellers also decreased commissions for select sellers. Troubled with its falling market valuation (from US$142.24 per share in June 2015 to $87.9 in March 2016) Flipkart was forced to take steps to check this fall. Curtailing the number of returned items could help the company reduce its losses but Flipkart was apprehensive of taking measures that might alienate consumers even though it was clear that many customers had been misusing its âno questions askedâ return policy. How could Flipkart reduce the losses resulting from these excessive returns while pleasing both its sellers and customers?COMPANY HISTORYIn 2007 two ex-Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal began selling books on an online platform in India with an initial fund of $6000. Their initiative resulted in the establishment of Flipkart which was registered in Singapore due to the fact that Indian foreign direct investment norms capped foreign investment in retail companies. The company developed various subsidiaries such as Flipkart Marketplace Private Limited Flipkart Logistics Private Limited and Flipkart Payments Private Limited all of which were also registered in Singapore. These companies in turn held stakes in five Indian entities: Flipkart India Private Limited (the wholesale cash-and-carry entity) Flipkart Internet Private Limited (which owned Flipkart.com) Digital Management Services Private Limited Flipkart Payment Gateway Services Private Limited and Digital Media Private Limited. Flipkart raised funds from several investors over the years receiving its first major investment from Tiger Global Management ($10 million) in 2009. Later Flipkart attracted other large investors including South African technology firm Naspers U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley and Russian investment firm Digital Sky Technologies Global (DST). In total by June 2016 Flipkart had successfully raised more than $3 billion (see Exhibit 1).Flipkart adopted the marketplace model which saved it from holding any inventory. The company worked as an online platform for sellers and buyers sourcing goods from manufacturers and supplying them to third-party sellers who in turn sold these products to online shoppers. Flipkart provided its logistics services and technology platform to sellers and levied a commission for these services by charging fees on each sale made on its platform. The company charged commission under the following heads: commission fees (which varied across sub-categories/verticals) shipping fees (which varied with weight) collection fees (for use of payment modes) and a fixed fee to its sellers for the use of its platform (see Exhibits 2 and 3).Although it had started by selling books by 2016 Flipkart had successfully transitioned to selling 30 million products across more than 70 categories divided across seven product lines: electronics appliances menâs apparel womenâs apparel baby and childrenâs goods home and furniture and books. Earlier in 2012 Flipkart had launched its private labels because these allowed the platform to earn a higher margin (compared to selling other established brands). After beginning with its first private label âDigiFlipâ for digital accessories the company later in 2013 launched âFlippdâ for products in the apparel and footwear category and âCitronâ for home appliance and personal health products in 2014.As a pioneer in the online retail space in India Flipkart encountered and overcame several challenges. For instance to overcome the mistrust that many Indian consumers felt about online transactions Flipkart launched the âcash on deliveryâ (COD) payment option in 2010 which was virtually risk free for customers. Similarly to attract and encourage sellers from small cities in 2015 Flipkart ran the initiative âFlipStarsâ which celebrated and honoured the success of sellers from small cities. To keep sellers motivated the company classified them into Gold Silver and Bronze categories and awarded the top sellers (i.e. Gold sellers) gifts and foreign trips. Flipkart also introduced âFlipkart Connectâ to create awareness and promote online shopping among its customers. From 2010 to 2016 Flipkart further expanded its business by way of acquisitions. In 2014 it acquired online fashion shop Myntra.com in a $330 million deal. Later in 2016 this acquired entity in turn acquired another rival Jabong.com (Jabong) for approximately $70 million.During the Indian festive season of 2016 Flipkart sold 15.5 million units and achieved sales of around $300 million in just four days. By March 2016 it had roughly 75 million registered users and more than 90000 sellers across India. Flipkart employed more than 45000 employees all over the world as of February 2016. The company attracted talent in top management by offering high salaries and other lucrative benefits even when its losses had been increasing over the years. The company was named âE-Commerce Company of the Yearâ at the Golden Carts Awards in 2016. Yet since its inception in 2007 Flipkart had yet to register a profit in any fiscal (FY) year. The company reported net revenue of $290 million in FY 2015â16 but also registered a loss of $343 millionâmore than double its losses of $170 million in FY 2014â15.THE Online Retail MarketIn 2016 globally $861 billion sales took place in the online retail place. Although China and the United States ranked as the first- and second-largest markets in terms of online sales respectively India emerged as the fastest-growing market in the world. The sale of physical goods via online retail sites in India was valued at $16.07 billion in 2016. It was projected that the growth of global online retail sales would increase to $1426 billion by 2021.The Indian MarketIn 2002 online retail (also known as âe-commerceâ) was introduced to Indian internet users when Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation began offering online ticket booking for its trains. Online shopping gained increasing popularity with the deep discount model used by most online retailers including Flipkart. Soon the opportunity in this space attracted other platforms like Amazon Jabong and Snapdeal.SizeIncluding both online and offline shopping the Indian retail market was valued at $750 billion in FY 2015â16. The opportunity in the online space was immense as the e-commerce market touched $14.5 billion in 2016 and was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 31.2 per cent to reach $64 billion by 2021. The COD payment option easy return policies huge inflows of funds from venture capitalists and fast-growing internet penetration all contributed to this growth. CustomersWith the annual addition of 25 million internet users the number of internet users in India had grown to 400 million in 2016. Of these users 75 per cent were between the ages of 15 and 34 which meant that India had the youngest target market for e-commerce in the world. Growth across all retail categories online saw 65 million unique visitors per month and all categories achieved a 55 per cent annual growth rate. Most of these online shoppers were in the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Although most online shopping initially occurred on desktop computers experts believed that mobile platforms generated up to 70 per cent of online retail revenue in 2016. Moreover 75 per cent of online retail traffic came from metropolitan cities.Goods SoldA wide variety of goods were sold on e-commerce platforms in India. While mobile phones were the most sold product on these platforms electronic and fashion items together represented around half of all spending on online retail sites. By 2020 fashion e-commerce was expected to generate $35 billion. The online market for consumer durables like kitchen appliances and other accessories was valued at $530 million which equalled 14 per cent of online retail transactions in 2015. Home furnishing products and books garnered $165 million and $102 million respectively in the same year.Competition AmazonEstablished in 1994 Seattle-based Amazon was Flipkartâs strongest competitor. After entering the Indian market in 2013 with the launch of Amazon India the corporation attracted customers with its 24/7 user support and 100 per cent purchase protection guarantee. With its aggressive marketing in India Amazon quickly gained a majority of the market share. By July 2015 it had more than 25 million products for sale in India. To build customer loyalty the firm launched its Prime service in July 2016 in which customers paid a yearly subscription fee of approximately $7 to enjoy free delivery of most online purchases along with access to streamed movies and television shows. In 2016 Amazon India reported a net revenue of $340 million with a net loss of $531 million. It had around 10000 employees working at its Bengaluru office in 2016.SnapdealFounded by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal in 2010 Snapdeal emerged as a major e-commerce competitor with 20 million products across 500 diverse categories in 2015. With around 200000 sellers the firm served a huge customer base of 100 million. This âhome-grownâ company received its primary funding in 2014 ($627 million) and 2015 ($500 million) from investors Softbank Telecom Corp and Alibaba Group Holding Limited respectively (see Exhibit 1). Facing stiff competition from Amazon and Flipkart Snapdeal struggled to retain its market share and lost a large percentage of this share between 2015 and 2016. The company posted net revenue of $216 million with a net loss of $493 million in 2016 and had 800 employees as of February of the same year. Since their inception e-commerce firms had been reporting significant losses due to their discount-based business models (which engendered cutthroat competition) and large numbers of returns. Changes in Customer BehaviourFree and easy returns and COD payment resulted in new consumer behaviours on online shopping platforms. First due to an increase in mobile penetration there was an increase in âwindow shoppingâ especially among younger consumers who often carelessly ordered items without seriously planning to keep them. Moreover some buyers replaced original products with replicas before returning them which might not be noticed immediately; one buyer caused Amazon losses of â¹10 million over two years by returning the ordered products after replacing them with cheap replicas. Second in certain product categories like clothing and footwear a lack of standardized sizes led to high return rates because the products looked or fit differently than expected. Globally the return rate for online purchases was over 30 per cent. In comparison the average return rate for offline purchases was 8.89 per cent. For online purchases made using COD payment the return rate touched 40 per cent.Common reasons that customers cited for returns included âI no longer need this productâ and âI intentionally ordered more than one size of wearables with the intent of returning extra items.â For some products manufacturers refused to accept returned items from sellers if the seals on the products were broken at the customerâs end. In these cases sellers were forced to sell those items at second-hand/used product prices through a separate channel for such goods. For wearable items the 30-day return window gave unethical buyers the option of wearing the clothes for some time before returning them. Sellers reported that the return rate had increased by around 50 per cent in many categories including electronics and mobile phones since July 2015. This higher return rate distressed small and medium-sized sellers. Yet Amazon Flipkart and Snapdeal all denied any increase in the number of returned products and contradicted reports of this trend.The New Return PolicyWith the addition of hundreds of new sellers joining the platform every month sellers on Flipkart had to compete with each other on pricing discounts and delivery costs. Further Flipkartâs âno questions askedâ return policy made it easy for customers to misuse the policy. As a result even though sellers found the platform attractive because of its vast number of active customers the increasing costs associated with returns gradually became a nightmare for many of them. In June 2016 Flipkart released the announcement of a new policy for sellers using its platform which was met with outrage. The new policy stated that sellers would be charged up to 5 per cent more commission fees than before on certain categories of products (see Exhibit 4). To reduce the impact of these increased commissions on sellers the company offered a 50 per cent discount on the commission fee for those sellers who used the companyâs warehousing services which could enable sellers to source cheaper products from China and within India. To retain existing sellers and attract new desirable sellers Flipkart also offered to give licence to its internal brands to select vendors. A Flipkart spokesperson described the revised policy: âThe new structure [will] enable sellers to have predictability and better control over payments. Our return policy and process continue to be the best and the easiest in the industry.âMoreover a few of Flipkartâs changes to its return policy were intended to benefit sellers. For instance in several product categories the company reduced the window for returns from 30 days to 10 days and only allowed the product to be replaced if a defect was identified. Notably the larger return window of 30 days was still in place for clothing and accessories.Regardless these offerings did not pacify the agitated sellers who already paid a high shipping fee reverse logistics fee and collection fee on return logistics. Sellers complained about having to pay the commission fee for all returns where the customer had opened the package; only when the package was returned without being opened could they avoid paying this fee. They were unhappy with this aspect of the policy and viewed it as being charged âthe marketplace commissionâ despite the cancellation of a sale. A seller shared his concerns on the e-commerce sellersâ forum:At present [Flipkart is] not charging for colour/fit/size issue returns but after June 20 2016 [it] will charge on that too earning from those increased commissions [and from] useless returns too. More returns and more replacements equals more profits for [Flipkart]. [The company] is in a hurry to raise its valuation in one shot which was recently devalued by earning profit from this sale and return game.Sellers were also unhappy because the platform did not seek their consent before approving a return. In a survey conducted by eSeller Suraksha 57 per cent of sellers noted that they would reconsider selling on Flipkart and 42 per cent reported they would increase the price of a commodity by 15â20 per cent. One seller commented on the impact of the newly revised return policy: As per the calculations we need to increase our selling prices on Flipkart by at least 20â25 per cent to make sure weâre not [operating at] a loss; this is in addition to the shipping charges from customers. The majority of [seller union] members will be quitting Flipkart since it will no longer be profitable to sell [there].Because of the new policy for the first time in India a union of sellers revolted against an e-commerce platform in June 2016. Two of the online sellersâ unions eSeller Suraksha (which had about 1000 seller-members) and All India Online Vendors Association declared a strike against Flipkartâs new policy. In protest against the return policy changes these sellers made their products unavailable on Flipkart and showed an âout of stockâ message to buyers on the product listing page. This message was shown for about 1 million stock-keeping units on the portal.  Competitors RespondThe changes regarding Flipkartâs return window for certain items occurred after Amazon India made similar policy changes reducing the replacement period to 10 days for most electronic items. The reduction by both companies was an attempt to make online shopping more like brick-and-mortar shopping where customers were responsible for returning products promptly and for good reason. At the same time Flipkartâs return policy still allowed for refunds on most product categories which made a dent in sellersâ profit margins.Even in terms of platform usage commission compared to its rivals Flipkart had an overall higher marketplace commission on all categories (see Exhibit 5). Basic calculations showed that selling on Amazon was more profitable for sellers in the mobile phone and mobile phone accessories category which was one of the largest e-commerce categories overall (see Exhibit 6).Accordingly when Flipkart changed its policy Amazon India saw an opportunity and reduced its commission rates for various product categories by 2â7 per cent to attract disgruntled Flipkart sellers (see Exhibit 7). The companyâs return policy limited the return window to 10 days for electronic items and 30 days for other product categories. Snapdeal also changed its policy to appear more seller friendly. The platform allowed returns within just seven days after delivery for most product categories and each refund was processed only after a defect had been verified by the brand manufacturer of the product. WHAT NEXT?From June 2015 until March 2016 Flipkart saw a massive cut in its market valuation by Morgan Stanley falling from $142.24 to $87.9 per share. The company accounted for 43 per cent of all e-commerce shipments in 2015 a figure that fell to 37 per cent in 2016. In contrast its close competitor Amazon recorded a leap in market share from 14 to 21 per cent between March 2015 and March 2016.Flipkart was facing a persistent dilemma among online marketplaces: should it prioritize the needs of its customers or those of its sellers? Traditional wisdom suggested that the company side with customers as it had done already with its deep discount model and âno questions askedâ return policy. However now that the company needed to reduce the losses it was incurring due to a high volume of returns it feared that denying refunds or further reducing the window for returns could displease customers. Flipkart management needed to take immediate steps to pacify its sellers and recoup its losses without disappointing its 75 million registered customers.Exhibit 1: Funding for ONLINE REtailers in India (US$ million)Source: Sumit Chakraborty âThe Flipkart Story: A Timeline of Funding from 2007 to 2017â Financial Express March 20 2017 accessed November 1 2017 www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/the-flipkart-story-a-timeline-of-funding-from-2007-to-2017/595740/; Mihir Dalal âAmazon Increases India Investments to $5 Billion to Take on Flipkart Snapdealâ Livemint June 9 2016 accessed October 25 2017 www.livemint.com/Companies/InTrpA1lX6EFAfbAcLCIgM/Amazon-to-invest-3-billion-more-in-India-ops.html; âSnapdeal > Funding Roundsâ Crunchbase accessed October 25 2017 https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snapdeal/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list.Exhibit 2: Flipkart Fee Structure for SellersSource: Shweta Singh âFlipkart Changes Fee Structure & Policies; Sellers Consider Closing Accountâ IndianOnlineSeller.com June 6 2016 accessed June 1 2018 http://indianonlineseller.com/2016/06/flipkart-changes-fee-structure-sellers-consider-closing-account/.Exhibit 3: Comparison of Shipping Charges on Different PlatformS (Before June 20 2016)Note: gm = grams; cm = centimetres; kg = kilograms; approximate commission calculated from Browntape for comparison; INR = Indian Rupees; â¹1 = US$0.02 on March 31 2016.Source: âECommerce Seller Fees Calculatorâ Browntape March 26 2016 accessed November 1 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160326033317/http://browntape.com/ecommerce-seller-fees-calculator/.Exhibit 4: Flipkartâs Old and New PolicIES: EFFECTS ON Buyers and SellersNote: â¹ = INR = Indian Rupees; â¹1 = US$0.02 on March 31 2016.Source:Â âReturnsÂ andÂ CancellationsâÂ FlipkartÂ MayÂ 15Â 2016Â accessedÂ NovemberÂ 5Â 2017Â https://web.archive.org/web/20160315072158/www.flipkart.com/s/help/cancellation-returns?otracker=hp_footer_navlinks#; ""Return Policyâ Flipkart June 14 2016 accessed November 5 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160614121024/www.flipkart.com/returnpolicy; Shweta Singh âFlipkart Changes Fee Structure & Policies; Sellers Consider Closing Accountâ IndianOnlineSeller.com June 6 2016 accessed June 1 2018 http://indianonlineseller.com/2016/06/flipkart-changes-fee-structure-sellers-consider-closing-account/.Exhibit 5: Marketplace Fees across Platforms (Before June 20 2016)Note: Approximate commission calculated from Browntape for comparison.Source: âECommerce Seller Fees Calculatorâ Browntape March 26 2016 accessed November 1 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160326033317/http://browntape.com/ecommerce-seller-fees-calculator/.Exhibit 6: Tentative Margin of Sellers on A SAMPLE Mobile PHONE/Mobile Accessories Product WORTH â¹1000* (Before June 20 2016)Note: *Approximately US$16; â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; â¹1 = US$0.02 on June 15 2016; approximate commission calculated from Browntape for comparison.Source: âECommerce Seller Fees Calculatorâ Browntape March 26 2016 accessed November 1 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160326033317/http://browntape.com/ecommerce-seller-fees-calculator/.Exhibit 7: Comparison of Shipping and Return PolicIES for Buyers ACROSS PLATFORMS (Before June 9 2016)Source: âReturns and Cancellationsâ Flipkart May 15 2016 accessed November 5 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160315072158/www.flipkart.com/s/help/cancellation-returns?otracker=hp_footer_navlinks#; âAbout Our Return Policyâ Amazon.in February 28 2016 accessed December 9 2017 https://web.archive.org/web/20160228170522/www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201149900#reso; Shambhavi Anand and Richa Maheshwari âSnapdeal Tweaks Return Policy; Buyers Will Now Have To Furnish Document From Authorised Service Centreâ Economic Times July 12 2016 accessed JuneÂ 1 2018 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/snapdeal-tweaks-return-policy-buyers-will-now-have-to-furnish-document-from-authorised-service-centre/articleshow/53163973.cms.ENDNOTES"

Ltd. (JIT Technology) was sitting in his office in Longhua District Shenzhen China. He was reading the companyâs 2011 statement of financial position which the director of finance had given to Li. The company had a high level of accounts receivables (AR) in 2010: a total of Â¥20637946 accounted for 60 per cent of the companyâs working capital. In 2011 the AR figure had risen to Â¥27977006 accounting for 63 per cent of working capital. Meanwhile profit after tax for the years 2010 and 2011 were Â¥4654176 and Â¥4748265 respectively. Moreover the number of turnover days for AR a very important index was not promising. As the AR figure increased the time it took to settle them was also increasingâfrom 45â60 days to 90 and sometimes even 120 days or more. (The average AR turnover rate for the manufacturing industry was about 4.08 and the average AR turnover days overall was about 90 days.) These factors made the companyâs operation and management of funds difficult. The company was a small sole proprietorship and Li had recently had to borrow money for the company using his own property as collateral in order to solve the cash-flow shortage. At that time the one-year loan rate was about 6.5 per cent. What should Li do to solve these problems? BackgroundJIT Technology was established in 1999. The company provided a range of electronics chemical materials ancillary equipment and precision adhesive products for the electrical and electronics industries. The core products included insulating materials glue coating equipment adhesives and organic silicon materials. JIT Technology was a small private company established solely by Li who was Singaporean. The company had only Â¥1 million in registered capital and fewer than 100 employees some of whom were Liâs relatives or friends. Its organizational structure included four main departments under the general managerâs office: finance human resources marketing and inventory (see Exhibit 1).Evolution of AR Policy at JIt TechnologyThe sales and financial staff explained that there had been fewer than ten staff members when the company was first established. As was the practice in most Chinese companies sales staff at JIT Technology who were authorized to extend credit to customers were also responsible for collecting accounts receivable. However there were no rewards or penalties associated with collecting these receivables. JIT Technology management staff were unaware of the serious problem of high AR until 2002 when the collection period for AR became longer and longer with increasing sales volumes and an increasing number of sales personnel. A new regulation was established that kept salespeople responsible for collecting AR but asked senior leaders to urge the marketing staff to collect AR as soon as possible. However at that time there were still no specific quantitative terms that associated the AR collection period with any reward or penalty.General RulesWhen the problem of AR became more serious JIT Technology finally formulated a written reward and penalty policy for the marketing staff based on its own situation and the methods of other companies in the same industry and introduced this to the marketing staff at the end of 2009. This policy was developed by the company and the marketing staff and was intended to provide incentives and motivation to the marketing staff and eliminate their concerns about the future. The policy was formalized in writing and applied to all staff members involved with marketing.The policy included the salary system (a basic salary plus commission) the assessment system the payment collection requirements and the relevant rules and used the following formulas:Note: Costs included material costs customs duties and freight costs for delivery to Hong Kong and outside the province.Note: Miscellaneous costs included entertainment costs and commissions; delivery costs included delivery to Hong Kong and outside the province.The maximum commission was 2 per cent for transactions under Â¥5000 regardless of the gross profit margin. Salespeople would be paid a fixed salary of Â¥1500 if sales were less than Â¥100000 per month and this base salary would increase as monthly sales volumes and profit rates increased (see Exhibit 2).Here are some examples of how JIT Technologyâs sales commission policy was applied:If salesperson Aâs monthly sales volume was Â¥150000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 30 per cent the sales commission would be (Â¥150000 Ã 30% Ã 2.2%) = Â¥990.If salesperson Bâs monthly sales volume was Â¥210000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 35 per cent the sales commission would be Â¥1764.If salesperson Câs monthly sales volume was Â¥260000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 50 per cent the sales commission would be Â¥3510.If salesperson Dâs monthly sales volume was Â¥500000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 22 per cent the sales commission would be Â¥2200. If salesperson Eâs monthly sales volume was Â¥920000 and the corresponding gross profit margin was 77 per cent the sales commission would be Â¥35420.The commission structure would be revised yearly or whenever the managing staff thought that it was necessary to do so. The board of directors of JIT Technology reserved the right of final explanation. Performance Assessment and Calculation The probationary period for new sales staff was three months. For those who sold few orders or none (that is those whose sales revenue was less than Â¥50000) the basic salary ranged from Â¥500 to Â¥1000 depending on the individualâs marketing experience and the companyâs needs at the time. New sales staff who achieved monthly sales over Â¥50000 received the same basic salary and commission rate as established salespeople.New staff members were not assessed in the first month but their performance was assessed each month beginning in the second month. The company paid commission bonuses month-by-month. Travel expenses were claimed at cost.Rules for Payment Collection The confirmation of clients was an essential step in the sales and payment process. When they concluded their first deal with the client salespeople asked each client to fill in an application form outlining company profile details. These details were entered into the client information system. Salespeople needed to ensure that all basic client information was documented including the exact address the amount of registered capital the legal representatives the business scope the size of the manufacturing field the relationship of JIT Technologyâs products to the client and the potential amount of business that could be expected from the client. The final steps in the procedure for client confirmation included obtaining approval from the marketing manager and the executive manager. After these approvals the client would be entered into the salespersonâs business client list and the salesperson would receive the total commission from managing all of the clientâs sales activity with the company. Payments for goods delivered were to be collected as specified in the sales agreement excluding the month when the goods were delivered. For example if the payment term was 30 days the payment for goods delivered in January had to be collected before March 2 with postponement possible if the due date fell during a holiday.Sales staff would still receive their commission when payment collection was delayed due to product quality problems but the staff member needed to submit a written application to delay collecting the payment. This application had to include the date the problem would be solved confirmation from quality control (QC) and permission from the manager and executive manager.The responsibility of the sales staff to collect payments was established and emphasized in the policy previously mentioned and in the following rules which were also intended to strengthen the capital turnover rate and protect the company from bad debts. Sales staff would receive 90 per cent of their commission if they collected payment for goods within one month after the payment collection date. They would receive 80 per cent of the commission if they collected payment within two months after the payment collection date but this commission payment would be postponed until the payment date for the next monthâs commission. Sales staff would receive 70 per cent of the commission if they collected payment within three months; this commission payment would also be postponed until the payment date for the next monthâs commission. For payments that were not collected within three months the sales staff would receive only 50 per cent of the commission which would be released the month following the collection of the final payment for goods. For payments that were not collected after three months the relevant supervisors and managers would take action to solve the problem and would decide who would take responsibility for managing the payment collection. These rules were listed separately.Rewards and Penalties The general rules for rewards and penalties applied to the sales staff. Every salesperson had to collect payments for goods on time and would receive feedback about the payment collection from the financial staff. Rewards such as promotions went to sales staff with remarkable performances. Sales staff could also be downgraded and would have to take responsibility for the consequences caused by poor business performanceâespecially for not collecting payments for goods for causing bad debts and for losses to the company because of fraud. The marketing staff had to claim responsibility for any outstanding payments still uncollected two months over the AR recovery date. They would be penalized by being required to return 20 per cent of the sales commission awarded to them. If their supervisors succeeded in collecting their overdue AR then that 20 per cent sales commission would be paid to the supervisors. In the case of bad debt 30 per cent of the bad debt based on the companyâs basic cost would be deducted from the salespersonâs earnings; another 10 per cent would be deducted from the supervisorâs earnings; and 5 per cent would be deducted from the earnings of the manager the finance manager and the executive director respectively. The company would assume 45 per cent of the bad debt. The commission for each salesperson for the previous month had to be accurately calculated before the 12th day of each month. Each salespersonâs commission from two months prior would be released on the 15th day of each month (for example the commission for July would be released on October 15). The financial staff would inform the sales manager and salesperson in advance if the commission could not be released on that date. If this was not done a penalty of Â¥300 would be issued to the involved financial staff member and managing staff member.Members of the sales staff could enjoy the same remuneration package as other staff members by submitting applications to become regular staff members within the probationary period if they met one of three criteria: (1) they had achieved remarkable marketing performance by doubling the basic marketing performance target in any of the first three months; (2) they had exhibited excellent marketing performance and contributed constructive ideas and advice to the management of the company; or (3) they had exhibited high-quality talents and skills and employed these in special circumstances to benefit the company.The response of the Sales StaffThe new rules did not improve the problems of AR. As a result Li decided to ask a consulting company to investigate the situation and the implementation of the marketing policy. Only through careful investigation could the next steps for improvement be developed. resultsSales Staffsâ Attitudes toward MarketingThe investigation determined that the sales staff came mainly from two groups of people. The first group included individuals from companies in the same field as JIT Technology; they had related work experience in the area and business relationships that were based on those experiences. They were familiar with the clientsâ internal operations and had established social networks in the area. Some of them also had prior management experience. These people quickly adapted to their jobs and easily achieved their goals. For example Li the manager of one department came from the client company ZTE Corporation and he sold JIT Technologyâs products to his former company. This group of salespeople were usually well educated and had related expertise and social networks in the field. Thus they performed better and achieved higher commissions; their average salary was over Â¥10000 per month.The second group of sales staff were individuals who had been promoted or transferred from other staff positions in the company by the executive staff. They included former drivers clerks secretaries and warehouse staff. Members of this group had no previous systematic training an average educational background (a high school diploma) inadequate professional knowledge and no established relationships with related industries. Thus these people usually achieved an average business performance at best and had lower incomes as a result. It was very difficult for these salespeople to locate clients particularly large ones or to sign them to contracts. For example Luoâwho as the driver for the chief executive officer had received an average salary between Â¥2500 and Â¥3000âwas encouraged by the chief executive officer to enter sales and became a professional salesperson for the company. He was very depressed because he could only earn a salary of Â¥1500 as a salesperson which was much lower than his former salary as a driver.Satisfaction with SalariesThe investigation found that the salaries of the sales staff fell into two extremes. The difference between the lowest and highest incomes was substantial with the highest being as much as 10 times more than the lowest and the average gap representing a difference of from 5 to 7 times. There were two distinctly different groups with contrasting feelings. High-income salespeople thought that their salaries were reasonable and they had higher expectations while low-income salespeople were generally depressed had lower spirits and saw no promising prospects in their futures. They had no passion for their work and thought there was an unfairness in the salaries of the high-income salespeople. The low-income salespeople believed they worked just as hard as the high-income salespeople and had poorer business performance simply because they had less information and fewer network advantages. ConclusionLi sank into deep contemplation after hearing the investigation report. His mind was awash with questions. Where did these problems come from? Did they come from the oversight of the rewards and punishments policy or from something else? He knew that the causes needed to be found or the situation would become worse and possibly cause the ultimate collapse of the company. Li summoned the company management to find a solution. At the meeting the marketing director Lin suggested that the problem lay in the marketing incentive policy. There were only rewards and no fines and this was the reason why the number of AR had become larger and larger. The financial director Ding suggested that the company should use a quantitative approach to determine the penalty. He wondered if the aging analysis method or the days sales outstanding (DSO also known as âdays receivableâ) could be taken into account. Of the two methods he preferred DSO because the DSO index was calculated based on a single personâs business. If the marketing staff were to be penalized by having to return some of their sales commission for overdue AR collection the amount of the penalty would depend on a calculation of the salespersonâs DSO the uncollected AR and the opportunity cost (based on the treasury bill rate or a one-year loan rate depending on whether the funds belonged to the company or were borrowed). Even if the amount of the deduction greatly exceeded the sales commission the policy would still be executed in order to maintain a strict reward or penalty.Exhibit 1: SHENZHEN JITâs Current Organizational Structure 	Source: Created by the authors based on observation.exhibit 2: commission plan for the sales and marketing staffNote: The market value for die-cutting processing products = Cost (1 + 55ï¼).Source: Company documents.

Ltd. (Chatar Patar) was a quick service eatery that was opened in 2012 with the vision of expanding to multiple outlets. Prashant Kulkarni managing director of the company and his team had planned to expand their business by 2018 once the brand was popular and the company had established a name in the market. As with every new venture the team was ready to put in hard work and establish a good reputation. The team had expansion plans and at the top of the list was the option of entering into a franchise model of business. In 2016 it had been more than a year since the franchise offers started coming in and the team had not yet decided what to do next. The team members did their research and consulted people in the same field to learn more with the hope of developing a lucrative solution to the problem. Kulkarni wondered whether he and the team were taking on their expansion plans too early before they were prepared or had a sufficient plan. Should they wait? If they proceeded which method of expansion should they adopt?The EntrepreneurIt was the summer of 1995 when Kulkarni ran to his father with ₹230 in his hand. His father was surprised to see his son with so much money and asked Kulkarni in a firm tone who had given him the money. Kulkarni replied in an innocent and excited voice that he had sold a total of 20 handmade boats. Kulkarni’s father was taken aback and enquired further asking how Kulkarni got the material to make these boats. The boy shared that he had used all the waste material that was kept in the garage. Kulkarni beamed with excitement and happiness pleased that he had sold all of his boats. Like his father Kulkarni was an entrepreneur and that day marked the beginning of Kulkarni’s entrepreneurial journey.Over the years Kulkarni had many ideas. Some worked but others no matter how good they looked on paper were difficult to implement. Two of Kulkarni’s successful ventures were a CD (compact disc) shop followed by a business in tire tubes. But ventures were short-lived and even though Kulkarni’s father saw potential in the boy he asked him to pursue a college program. Kulkarni completed an honours bachelor degree in commerce and was immediately placed with an information technology (IT) firm in Jaipur India after graduation.Kulkarni loved food and his new job gave him the opportunity to try out new dishes every week. One week he had a craving for panipuri so Kulkarni set out to find a street vendor selling the snack. He returned home having enjoyed his dinner only to feel ill. He went to bed nauseated and woke at 2:00 a.m. with sudden abdominal pain. By morning the pain was worse so Kulkarni went to the hospital where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. When he disclosed his diet of the previous few days the doctor immediately identified the panipuri as the culprit. The doctor shared that they had at least two patients every week sick after consuming street food and in almost 90 per cent of the cases panipuri was the cause.After spending a week in the hospital Kulkarni was discharged home with instructions to take certain precautions with what he ate. He resolved that he would refrain from panipuri indefinitely.Kulkarni completed his tenure with the IT company and decided to continue his education and pursue a master’s degree in business administration in his hometown. Indore was known for its delicacies of Indian street food but Kulkarni’s brush with food poisoning had stayed with him. He did however meet with his friends one day and joined them as they went to a street vendor for their favourite panipuri. It was then that Kulkarni noticed for the first time that the vendors prepared his favourite dish with a total lack of hygiene a factor Kulkarni had never considered before when eating his favourite street food. He also noticed that the quality of the ingredients was poor and that the vendors offered a limited choice of flavours. Kulkarni realized that whatever happened to him could happen to anyone. He wondered how many people would refrain from eating the food or stop their family members from enjoying this delicious dish because of its preparation or serving methods or because preparation was not hygienic or healthy.The CompanyKulkarni researched the idea of providing people with healthy panipuri that was an amalgamation of hygiene health and taste. He always believed in the power of ideas although this idea was fuelled by memories of a week in hospital with several painful injections and bitter medicines. He needed to get a brand into the unorganized world of Indian street food. Kulkarni worked on his idea with his younger sister Pallavi and his colleague Arti pushing the idea further every day. After in-depth study over 18 months the trio learned that although panipuri was a favourite food across the entire Indian subcontinent—India Pakistan Sri Lanka Nepal and Bangladesh—it was often frowned upon because of the vendors’ lack of hygiene. Although panipuri was popular and offered health benefits because of the variety of herbs and spices used many people did not consider panipuri to be a healthy eating option. The same was true with a variety of other savoury snacks served by roadside vendors. The trio decided to start their own venture opening an outlet that served the most liked and popular Indian street food. Their plan was to establish a name in this particular segment of the food industry. They did not want to be just another outlet on a long list of random outlets regularly launched to serve panipuri; they wanted their outlet to be different. And so they launched Chatar Patar an eatery store in the quick service restaurant sector that served standardized Indian street food that could be customized with an extensive scope of products all of it hygienically prepared and served. The vision was to deliver Indian street food that was healthy hygienic and tasted good. The IndustryThe Indian quick service restaurants sector a portion of the restaurant industry was estimated to have a market value of ₹68 billion in 2014. The market was expected to grow to ₹150 billion by 2020 providing lucrative opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs to be a part of this growth story. Another report highlighted that changing consumer behaviour and demographics were expected to drive the Indian quick service restaurants to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 for a market value of US$27.57 billion. Approximately 10 per cent of the fast-food market in India was organized. Novonous’s market research estimated that the organized fast-food market in India would grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by 2020. Vegetarian fast food constituted approximately 45 per cent of the fast-food market in India and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 18 per cent by 2020.Casual dining restaurants (CDRs) in the organized fast-food sector in India were projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by fiscal year (FY) 2019/20. Non-casual dining restaurants (NCDRs) or fast casual dining restaurants had gained a tremendous market share over the previous 10–15 years. That sector was also projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent over the next five years. The quick service restaurants market in the organized fast-food sector in India was projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 per cent by FY 2019/20.The Growth PhaseKulkarni brought his signature product panipuri to the customers of Chatar Patar “the house of India’s first branded golgappas (panipuri) Gapagap.” Kulkari and his team were pioneers in introducing the world’s first panipuri brand Gapagap.Kulkari and his team started their venture with an initial capital of just ₹40000. They opened their first outlet the parent store in Indore Kulkarni’s hometown initially offering 18 products on the menu. They leased space next to the university hoping the location next to their primary target market—youth—would give them visibility. They decided that it would be the founding team that handled the operations from procurement of the raw material to preparing and serving the snacks. The store made a profit after the first month so the team expanded. They hired two employees who were trained to prepare the snacks and attend to customers.The venture was an immediate success. Word-of-mouth publicity and the networking skills of the founding team led to increasing sales despite their inexperience. Customers were drawn in and made regular visits. The store was making profits much above the initial expectation of the team. Yet that was not enough for Kulkari. Even though the team had delivered on two of their promises—providing hygienic and healthy street food—they had yet to deliver on the third promise taste. The team took on the challenge and decided to expand the flavours offered. As they did not want to be just any other store in this line of business they chose to establish a niche with their flavours. Starting with seven flavours they developed a total of 60 flavours within two months and then over time expanded to 112 flavours of pani the main ingredient in Gapagap.The team members were proud to be pioneers adding various flavours to an age-old Indian street food. Really they had revolutionized the food. Word of mouth was strong which increased their footfalls and proved to be helpful in taking the next step. Strategic ShiftKulkari and his team were overwhelmed by the customer response but Kulkari still questioned what was next and how they would get there. The answer came when Singh a regular and loyal customer visited Chatar Patar on a day when the team was a little less occupied. Singh was an experienced businessman and liked the team’s concept of multi-flavoured hygienic and healthy food. He congratulated them on their success and asked whether they had considered expanding. Kulkari shared that this was exactly what was bothering him wondering what was next. Singh proposed a franchise business model but Kulkarni wondered whether it was too soon. The team had researched websites dedicated to promoting the franchise business model and they could develop and use their own website to advertise available franchises. They had a brand but the brand was not yet big enough that people would want to invest. And Chatar Patar charged prices that were a bit higher than what street vendors charged. But Singh maintained that franchising was the path and offered to be Chatar Patar’s first franchisee opening an outlet in Rajkot. Kulkarni and his team were surprised by Singh’s offer and requested time to consider it. In the meantime Kulkarni hired a friend to create a company website. Within three days the website was ready and working. With the website live the team began to promote their restaurant on social media platforms sharing their success story and directing people to their franchise business model which was available on the company website.As word spread more franchise offers came in. The team had already prepared a rough draft of a franchise business model offer but had yet to refine it. They did not anticipate such a quick response but they did not want to lose the opportunity. Before discussing business with Singh or looking at the other offers Kulkari and the team did more research and refined their franchise business model.Under their franchise business format Chatar Patar offered the following:The rights to use the Chatar Patar brand trademarks signs and logos to operate a storeThe ability to prepare and sell Chatar Patar’s standardized products by sharing the recipes and transporting the ingredients required for the preparationUse of the strategic business model and systems developed by Chatar PatarSupport with local promotion using well-thought-out campaigns and creative inputsUse of the support training and research used by Chatar Patar’s headquartersFranchisees could choose one of two types of ownerships:A single unit franchise orAn area franchise with the opportunity to develop multiple units within the franchise referred to as a master franchise (see Exhibit 1).CompetitionThe ethnic fast-food market in India was expected to experience considerable growth with a projected CAGR of 31.95 per cent by FY 2019/20. Millions of people were consuming ethnic fast food daily. To leverage this market and customer segment many players had entered the market as organized outlets between 2013 and 2015. The United Nations reported that India had 356 million people between the ages of 10 and 24—the largest youth population in the world. India’s economy was growing and more young people were entering the workforce giving them money to spend. There were also more women in the workforce bringing a need for different tastes and products. Also consumers were more mobile; they needed food on the go so the need for access to quick service restaurants increased. As a result the consumers in the Indian fast-food market were hungry for more availability of quick service restaurants with a diverse menu which paved the way for entry of international brands such as McDonald’s KFC Subway Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts which competed with local Indian fast-food restaurants. Technology and social media gave quick service restaurants the ability to make menus available online and gave customers the opportunity to post their reviews of the restaurants. Customers could also take advantage of online ordering and home delivery of items methods leveraged by many players. Slowly but steadily the competitors were focusing on three areas: quality food ingredients online ordering and home delivery and customized and dynamic menus to match customers’ taste interests. Panipuri was distinct in that it could not be ordered online because the most important part of the dish was its preparation and service on the spot. Consuming it right away accentuated the taste.ChallengesAlthough franchising seemed to be the next logical step for Chatar Patar and the team was elated with the response of prospective franchisees Kulkari wanted to continue to maintain a niche and exclusivity in the market. The challenge was to expand while maintaining and delivering on Chatar Patar’s promise of health hygiene and most importantly taste. The goal was to maintain the exclusive taste so no matter which outlet the customer visited the Gapagap would taste the same. The team planned to travel to all the locations and train the staff to prepare the products the right way but the team had no previous experience with how a food outlet was run nor did they have any experience with distributing to franchisees.The team had made the ingredients the pani of their signature product Gapagap in liquid form. The immediate challenge was how to transport the contents and ingredients to the kitchen teams in the franchises. The company was still in the initial growth phase and its income was limited so whatever method was adopted needed to be cost-effective. At the same time delivery needed to be done with minimal to no damage to the contents. The ingredients in the semi-liquid state had a shelf life of only two to three days and the goods risked being damaged in transit as a result of breakage or spillage. The team wanted the same method of delivery for all franchise outlets and they wanted a method of distribution that was lucrative in both the short and long terms. They were not looking for a stopgap solution; it had to be a permanent solution. The Way ForwardThe franchisee offers were pouring in. The team was already negotiating with seven prospective franchisees who were satisfied with Chatar Patar’s proposal and were ready to take up the franchises. The team again researched and found methods for transporting the ingredients to the franchisees. Their first thought was to emulate the methods adopted by the beverage giants such as PepsiCo Inc. or The Coca-Cola Company. The team worked out an option for transporting the semi-liquid formula from the main store in Indore to the first franchise offer they accepted in a nearby city in Rajkot (see Exhibit 2).The transportation cost involved carrying the goods from the parent outlet in Indore to the receiving location of the first transport agent which would take it from there to a local transportation company warehouse. The team estimated each trip would cost ₹250. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000.From the local warehouse the product would be moved to the transporter’s warehouses in the franchise cities. The cost for that stage would be ₹500 per trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹4000.Finally the product would then be transported from the city warehouses to the franchises. The cost for this stage of shipment was ₹250 per round trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000 (see Exhibit 3).When the team discussed this plan with the transporting agents the agents established that this plan could be used for all the cities that had direct bus links. Whether they transported their material to Rajkot Baroda Jamnagar or Vizag the cost would be the same. However if the weight of the shipped goods was more than 120 kilograms they would be charged an additional ₹10 per kilogram.This method of transportation of semi-liquid ingredients also carried the risk of 30 per cent damage to the ingredients. If the product incurred damages the loss would not only increase the transportation cost due to more shipments to replace the damaged goods but also decrease the profit margins. The shelf life of the product was two to three days and even after transportation there would likely be 30 to 40 per cent wastage because the ingredients did not taste fresh. The next approach the team considered was that used by large fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC. With this model the ingredients would be prepared and frozen which would increase the shelf life of the ingredients. However only 10 of Chatar Patar’s products could be converted to a frozen-food format; eight products needed to be freshly prepared. Planning needed to be more strategic with the frozen format. First a regular route would need to be established then the stores would be opened along the route to optimally use the delivery channel. The company would need to lease cold storage space located centrally on the route and invest in a blast freezing process. Another requirement would be to maintain a large inventory that could meet the product demand. The advantage with this option was that it was damage-proof (see Exhibit 4). The third alternative that the team considered was to convert the semi-liquid formula into a dry format. The cost for the drying process would be ₹300 for 120 kilograms of semi-liquid formula. The cost of transportation would be ₹1000 (see Exhibit 5).Yet another option the team considered was to share with the franchise owner the trade secret—the recipes and the exact procedure for creating their exclusive taste. This option would be the easiest for the parent company doing away with all the logistics hassle of transporting ingredients. The disadvantage was that the team would lose control of their market advantage; franchise owners could give up their franchises at the end of the contract and start their own ventures under another brand name.Another suggestion proposed by Arti and Pallavi was that they first focus on expanding in nearby cities where the material could be transported within a matter of few hours. Kulkarni suggested that they could also focus on opening franchises in Indore itself.Finally the team considered whether they should standardize the five or six key products and leave the remaining products to the discretion of the franchisee. The franchises could customize the panipuri according to local taste and preference.Exhibit 1: Chatar Patar Foods Pvt.

Ltd. (Uniqlo) built its business by delivering high-quality basic casual clothing��made for everyone everywhere��at low prices. After growing rapidly in the 1980s the Japanese economy entered an era of stagnant growth in the 1990s. Japanese consumers wanted to economize but were still picky about quality. This combination fit with Uniqlo�s value proposition of high quality at low prices.Uniqlo repeatedly launched attractively priced products that broke industry sales records. In 1998 it introduced a fleece jacket for US$14.50 less than half the price offered by its competitors for a similar jacket. Uniqlo went on to sell 8.5 million pieces of fleece clothing in 1999 and 26 million in 2000. No other company had ever sold so many pieces of a single kind of clothing in Japan. Other notable product launches included the $77 cashmere sweater and Heattech products in 2003 and the bratop in 2004. The company rapidly invested in opening retail locations to maximize sales from its hit products. Between 1990 and 2010 Uniqlo�s sales grew 160 times.Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. (Fast Retailing) Uniqlo�s parent company held a double-digit market share in Japan. Its stated goal was to become the world�s number-one apparel retailer. In 2016 the company reported sales of $17.3 billion (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3). Tadashi Yanai Fast Retailing�s founder and chief executive officer set a target of $29.1 billion in total global sales by 2020. According to an earlier Fast Retailing target American and European markets were to comprise 20 per cent of global sales by 2020.Fast Retailing acquired several international brands in France and the United States and its globalization strategy focused on growing Uniqlo into a leading global brand. However Uniqlo�s international experience was mixed. It realized rapid sales growth in Asia but encountered difficulties in the United States and Europe. Yanai argued that success in the U.S. market was crucial to becoming a successful global brand. Yet in mid-2017 after more than a decade of efforts Uniqlo USA�s relatively few stores continued to lose money. As the gap between its goals and performance continued to diverge the company needed to re-examine its U.S.-based business and potentially its globalization strategy altogether.Apparel Retailing in JapanAn island country Japan was sometimes called �Galapagos� because its markets differed from those of other large economies. The Japanese people were highly educated and enjoyed long life expectancies. Japanese culture valued diligence and conformity. Indeed compared with most other countries the populace was relatively uniform in race culture and income levels.Japanese consumers were among the world�s most critical in terms of quality. They expected high levels of quality regardless of price level and could spot defects and blemishes that consumers from other countries might easily have missed. Many consumers in other Asian countries felt that if a brand passed the test of the Japanese market they could also depend on its high quality. Where apparel was concerned Japanese consumers had high expectations for the fabric dyeing stitching and durability of products. Japanese consumers readily recognized even minor differences between products. The Japanese apparel retail business was highly fragmented at the time Uniqlo was launched in 1984. Several formats were common in the business including department stores and small family-owned stores. Discount mass merchandisers were also growing. Retail clothing stores were primarily full service with salespeople playing a central role. Japanese apparel retailers primarily relied on purchasing products designed and manufactured by outside vendors. Typically apparel items went through a trading house which purchased from the manufacturer and then on to two to three different wholesalers before they arrived at a retail store. The system was costly and complex and it limited the retailer�s control over the products it carried. Effective inventory management was difficult for apparel retailers. Orders were made prior to entering the next season but it was difficult to judge in advance which products would sell. Retailers often found the most popular items stocked out quickly resulting in lost sales while less popular items often needed to be liquidated at clearance prices at the end of the season.Uniqlo�s Development and GrowthFast Retailing�s roots were in a small family-owned clothing store that Yanai had inherited. He gained valuable managerial experience in the store but sometimes at significant expense. For example at one point all the employees quit the company because they found Yanai too unreasonable to work with. This situation left him to take on by himself all the different activities they had previously performed including negotiating with vendors purchasing pricing sales inventory management and accounting. Yanai acquired a detailed understanding of key business functions as a result.Uniqlo took its name from an English language conceptualization of the brand as a �unique clothing warehouse.� It opened its first store in Hiroshima in 1984.In 1986 Yanai was impressed by the rapid growth of several U.S.-based apparel chains including The Gap Inc. (Gap). When he visited these stores in person he was struck by how different their approach to retailing was from Japanese practice. Customers could comfortably enter the store look at what they wanted and select items freely without a salesperson being involved. This approach influenced Yanai�s thinking about how Uniqlo stores should operate. Uniqlo started off by selling clothing produced by other firms but later built a vertically integrated business model. Fast Retailing called it the SPA (specialty retailer of private label apparel) model. The company maintained control but not necessarily ownership at all stages beginning with initial product planning; moving through fabric development and then product design manufacturing and distribution; and ending at retail. Manufacturing was mainly outsourced but the company maintained tight control over manufacturing plants. It was strict on quality and at the same time it drove a hard bargain on cost.Simplicity and elimination of multiple layers of margin were benefits of the SPA model. However more important was the increased control of products and inventory that the SPA model offered over the traditional approach. The company could design what it wanted to sell and set the price it wanted to sell the product at. The model also allowed Uniqlo to achieve higher quality standards while aggressively controlling production costs.Although the basic concept of the SPA model was similar to that of some foreign apparel retailers Uniqlo�s approach was unique in several ways. Uniqlo�s model used Japanese production experts�called takumi�who worked with suppliers to improve processes that would reduce cost and improve quality. Another unique aspect was Uniqlo�s relationship with suppliers of fabric and other key inputs which allowed it access to specific inputs but maintain low costs. For example Uniqlo�s relationship with Toray Industries Inc. a Japanese chemical company known for its synthetic fibre technology facilitated the development of new fabrics that featured improved heat retention or cooling. Uniqlo�s low-cost supply chain allowed it to deliver products incorporating these benefits at a fraction of the price possible through its competitors.Implementing the SPA model was not easy and took Uniqlo nearly 10 years to fully achieve. In the process Uniqlo built its new product development and purchasing capabilities to deal with large-scale production outsourcing using low-cost overseas producers. Uniqlo also developed its brand equity and sales.Physical stores were essential to Uniqlo�s growth (see Exhibit 4). Store design and location changed over the years. During Uniqlo�s fleece boom in 1998�1999 the company opened many stores often in roadside locations following a standardized layout scheme. In 1998 Uniqlo opened its first flagship store in Harajuku a high-profile trendy Tokyo neighborhood. In 2005 the company switched from primarily focusing on roadside stores to a large store model. Later Fast Retailing gathered attention when Uniqlo opened a joint store with an electronics retailer (Bic Camera Inc.) in the bustling Shinjuku area of Tokyo and new flagship stores for its Uniqlo and G.U. brands in Tokyo�s Ginza shopping area.Uniqlo�s Value PropositionUniqlo�s product lineup focused on high-quality everyday casual basic clothing items suited to the needs of many age and income groups. The pricing strategy which aimed at having many products in the $9.20�$17.50 range reflected Uniqlo�s intention to attract customers from a broad section of society.Focusing on basic casual instead of trendy fashion items allowed Uniqlo to strictly limit the number of stock-keeping units (SKUs) and sell more of each item. Uniqlo stores tended to stock 300�500 items at any one time. High volumes gave Uniqlo economies of scale and strong bargaining power with its manufacturing partners. The small number of SKUs also simplified inventory management. Uniqlo increased or eliminated mid-season production depending on its sales.Tadashi YanaiTadashi Yanai was a prominent and vocal leader of Uniqlo and Fast Retailing. His approach to business focused on sales growth and profitability. He argued that �a company is as well as dead without growth� and was known for setting seemingly unachievably aggressive goals. Yanai thought these goals needed to be ambitious enough that they were unreachable by simply following business as usual with minor tweaks. He was critical of the company�s performance when profits did not grow attributing the outcome to the firm paying insufficient attention to the details necessary to realize its profit potential. This strong emphasis on profitability was uncommon in Japanese business. It was one reason why outsiders often viewed Fast Retailing as being more like a foreign company than a Japanese one.Yanai was critical of Japanese business culture which he thought overemphasized analysis and internal reporting and resulted in employees waiting for orders rather than proactively engaging customers and markets. He disliked the idea that companies should try to realize �stable growth.� In his 2009 book Yanai commented �Markets and change are violent� and argued that firms needed to meet customer needs in these changing circumstances rather than try to focus on stability.As Fast Retailing grew Yanai became ever vigilant of stability seeking big-company mentality inside the firm. In an e-mail Yanai sent to employees at the beginning of 2009 he asked them to destroy bureaucracy elitism in management big company consciousness and management focused on analysis and reports. Rather than rest on the laurels of their success each employee should be their own harshest judge and look for ways to improve.Yanai was not without his critics. His focus on performance outcomes made Fast Retailing a stressful company to work for. Yanai was known for saying �those who can�t swim should sink.� He was considered to be poor at delegating and his attempts to develop a successor to the firm�s top management failed. However others noted that Yanai�s strong control and top-down approach allowed the company to make quick decisive changes that traditional Japanese companies�with more powerful middle management�could not. Yanai remained the company�s largest shareholder which further cemented his power.Uniqlo�s Competitors Uniqlo�s competitors included several mass-market fashion-focused and basic clothing apparel brands. Most competitors followed a vertical integration model but they differed in other aspects. For example some firms had large numbers of SKUs while others had relatively few. Also some firms followed models that actively managed inventory and replenishment across the clothing season while others deliberately created scarcity or relied more heavily on end-of-season sales. Uniqlo�s closest Japanese rivals included store chains Shimamura Co. Ltd. (Shimamura) and Mujirushi Ryohin (Muji for short).Shimamura was a rapidly growing low-priced fashion-oriented apparel retailer that had been in business since 1953. In 2016 it had 2015 stores and $4.8 billion in annual revenue. It held a 4.3 per cent share of the Japanese domestic market in 2015. Shimamura purchased apparel items from manufacturers in high volumes and bargained hard. Its president Masato Nonaka described the company�s approach this way: �We don�t gamble we only go into what we are certain we can win and do what we understand.� The company had locations in Taiwan and China in addition to Japan.Muji was started in 1980 as a private brand for the supermarket chain Seiyu and became an independent company in 1990. Muji�s product lineup was broad; it included household items foods stationery and clothing with only a few products in each category. The brand emphasized simplicity and high quality at low prices. Muji�s parent company reported $3.1 billion in revenue for the year ending February 2017. Muji had 418 stores in Japan and 821 in total worldwide. It had been building an international network since 1991; however the vast majority of the company�s sales were in Japan and East Asia.Uniqlo�s largest international competitors comprised Forever 21 Gap Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) and Zara (see Exhibits 5 and�6).Forever 21One of the most popular clothing brands among U.S. teens Forever 21 had $4.4 billion in sales in 2016. The company was located in Los Angeles and owned by two immigrants from South Korea. Forever 21 followed a vertically integrated business model with production outsourced. It originally bought from plants run by other Korean immigrants in the Los Angeles garment industry but later moved production offshore to low-cost Asian countries. Forever 21 clothing was inexpensive and trendy but the company had a reputation for selling knock-offs of designer clothes and had been sued on numerous occasions. The company sold a large variety of clothes in small lots quickly. Forever 21 stores could turn over 20 per cent of their inventory in a week. In 2016 Forever 21 had 790 stores in 48 countries.GapFounded in 1970 Gap was a U.S. based firm following a vertically integrated model with outsourced manufacturing. The company had several brands aimed at different customer groups and needs: The Gap brand focused on high-quality American-style casualwear; Old Navy was a low-priced casual clothing brand that Gap launched in 1994; Banana Republic offered contemporary classic style men�s and women�s apparel; and the Athleta brand sold women�s fitness apparel. Gap operated 3200 stores in 11 countries including over 200 stores in Japan. Approximately $12 billion of the company�s $15.5 billion in sales in fiscal year 2016 were in the U.S. market. Old Navy represented roughly half of the company�s U.S. revenue.H&MH&M based in Sweden was founded in 1947. The company was known for trendy inexpensive fashion apparel. It also followed a vertically integrated model�keeping planning design distribution and retail functions in-house while outsourcing manufacturing to independent suppliers in Asia and Europe. Its business model focused on fast inventory turnovers and large volumes; however it did not replenish items that sold out. Customers had to buy items they liked quickly because they might lose the opportunity if they waited. H&M operated or franchised a total of 4351 stores in 64 countries under several different brands. In the U.S. market H&M had 468 stores and reported $3.1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2016. The United States was H&M�s second-largest market in terms of annual sales after Germany.ZaraStarted in 1975 in Spain Zara was a rapidly growing global brand with a vertically integrated supply chain. Zara�s business model was designed around speed. New products went from the design stage to store shelves in as little as four weeks and additional production rounds of fast-selling items could reach stores in as little as two weeks. At company stores around the world new styles arrived twice a week. Because the product lineup changed rapidly customers had to make up their minds quickly since they might lose the opportunity to purchase the item in question if they waited. Zara was higher priced and more fashion-conscious than Uniqlo but offered high-quality items at much lower prices than its direct competitors. Zara offered a large variety of items with around 18000 SKUs per year. It was owned by Inditex which also had numerous other brands. Inditex had 224 stores in eight countries across the Americas and a total of 7292 stores worldwide. The Americas were responsible for $3.9 billion in sales or 15 per cent of the company�s 2016 worldwide revenue. In the United States the company had 81 stores.Growth in New Markets Given Uniqlo�s high market share in its home market Fast Retailing needed to find additional areas for growth. The company pursued new brand development in Japan acquisitions of foreign brands and the internationalization of Uniqlo. Fast Retailing�s acquisitions of international brands included Comptoir des Cotonniers (France) J Brand (United States) Princesse Tam (France) and Theory (United States). These were primarily premium brands.In 2006 Fast Retailing launched a new low-priced fashion-focused brand called G.U. The name �G.U.� was inspired by the Japanese word jiyu meaning freedom. The intended message was for customers to �dress freely.� G.U had a distinctly different value proposition and product lineup from Uniqlo. The retail distribution of the two brands was also separate. However Fast Retailing applied Uniqlo�s experience operational knowledge and the SPA model to the G.U. brand. Comparing Uniqlo and G.U. in Fast Retailing�s 2006 annual report Yanai commented: We created G.U. to develop the market in Japan for �absolutely low prices.� In contrast to our quest with UNIQLO to enhance added value with high-quality fashionable merchandise we are going after rock-bottom prices with G.U.In 2009 G.U. introduced jeans priced under $10.67. The popularity of these jeans drove G.U.�s growth and was credited for sales declines of competing brands including Levi�s Japan. Yanai felt that G.U. was well positioned because it served a market segment that had not yet developed in Japan but had been successfully developed in other countries including the United States.Internationalization of UniqloUniqlo announced its aim to become a global brand in 2000. The United Kingdom became Uniqlo�s first international market in 2001. Uniqlo stores in London sold products using the same materials as sold in the Japanese market but with styles and sizes tailored to Western needs. Uniqlo�s prices were 30�40 per cent below competitors� prices.After opening 21 stores in two years Uniqlo closed most of them because they were losing money. Store management practices were blamed for Uniqlo�s failure in the United Kingdom. Initial attempts to follow local practices in the United Kingdom led to messy disorganized stores that put off customers. After changing to Japanese store management practices the store experience and results improved. Despite setbacks in the United Kingdom Uniqlo continued its international expansion (see Exhibit 7).Uniqlo entered the Chinese market in 2002 opening its first store in Shanghai. The Chinese market had great potential but there were also risks. In China Japanese brands were respected for their quality. However the image of Japan among the Chinese populace could be volatile and anti-Japanese demonstrations sometimes erupted. By 2016 Uniqlo had 472 stores in China. Over the period 2006�2013 Uniqlo entered eight other Asian markets. Uniqlo was also actively entering continental European markets. In 2007 it opened a location in a suburb of Paris. Then in 2009 it opened a global flagship store in the high-profile Opera area of Paris near major department stores. Later it entered Germany and Belgium.Store locations were not the only area in which Fast Retailing was internationalizing its business. In 2005 the company announced it was moving to a global research and development approach with offices in New York Tokyo Milan and Paris. In 2012 the company adopted English as its official business language.Despite these new business activities Uniqlo Japan continued to be Fast Retailing�s largest business accounting for 69 per cent of operating profits in 2016. Uniqlo International and G.U. were growing significantly and G.U. reported an operating profit of �22.2 billion in 2016. Of the international brands Fast Retailing acquired Comptoir des Cotonniers J Brand and Princesse Tam posted losses while Theory reported operating profits in 2016.U.S. Apparel MarketThe United States was the world�s second-largest market for apparel and accessories with annual sales estimated in the range of $225 billion to $267 billion in 2015. By comparison Yanai estimated Japanese apparel sales to be around $82 billion.Brick-and-mortar apparel and footwear specialist retailers represented 57.9 per cent of U.S. sales in 2015 but this segment was shrinking. The number of U.S. shopping malls was expected to decrease by as much as 25 per cent in the next decade. Internet retailers were increasing their penetration of the apparel market expanding from a 7.5 per cent market share in 2010 to 13.6 per cent in 2015. These trends were similar in Japan; however grocery retailers mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs held a substantially larger part of the market in the United States than in Japan. Walmart Inc. was the leading apparel retailer in the United States in 2015 with a 7.5 per cent market share. Target Corporation was the fourth largest with a 5.2 per cent share. Off-price retailers which purchased unwanted inventory from apparel manufacturers at deep discounts and sold it to consumers at low prices were a large part of the U.S. market. This segment included Ross Stores Inc. TJ Maxx and Marshalls; it represented just under 10 per cent of the total market in 2015.Fast Retailing�s direct competitors had varying experiences in the U.S. market. In 2015 Gap brands held a 4.4 per cent market share while Forever 21 had 1.3 per cent and H&M 1.0 per cent. Japanese firms had never played a major role in the U.S. apparel market. In 2016 Muji had 15 U.S. stores and $50 million in revenue.Sports product companies such as Nike Inc. (Nike) had strong positions in the U.S. apparel business. Nike sold $4.7 billion in apparel in North America in 2016. In 2015 it had a 2.7 per cent market share in the U.S. apparel market putting it among the top 10 brands. By comparison the largest athletic wear brand in Japan had only 1.1 per cent of the Japanese market. A relative newcomer U.S.-based Under Armour was growing rapidly and had a 1.2 per cent market share. Under Armour sold high-performance fabrics geared toward managing body temperature similar to Uniqlo�s Heattech products but priced higher.Uniqlo�s U.S. ExperienceUniqlo began planning its entry into the United States market in 2004. In September 2005 it opened three stores in malls in New Jersey suburbs which were part of the greater New York metropolitan area. The stores were not successful. In Fast Retailing�s 2006 annual report Yanai commented: We learned from opening Uniqlo stores in shopping malls in the United States that it is difficult to sell products in new overseas markets where we do not have name recognition. Taking this lesson to heart we have switched to a strategy of opening flagship stores in local fashion centers to dramatically boost name recognition.Nobuo Domae chief executive of Uniqlo USA discussed the failure of the brand�s New Jersey stores: We tried to imitate the Japanese model as much as possible. And that was not very good. We used metal shelving that was very efficient and functional but we didn�t know that was only used for discounters. People might have thought our product was like Wal-Mart.In 2006 Uniqlo opened a global flagship store in the SoHo area of New York City. In preparation for the launch of the store Uniqlo launched a major marketing campaign to generate awareness�with pop-up stores collaborations with the Museum of Modern Art and other activities designed to gain public attention in Manhattan. Domae commented �People in SoHo are more open to new things but customers in New Jersey are more conservative. It�s easier to communicate new things here [in SoHo].�The new flagship store was a bold move considering the company�s initial entry into New Jersey had been characterized by Fast Retailing as �careful.� According to Yanai �If I opened a very small store no one would ever pay attention. We want to sell basics to everyone so to make people notice us we have to open in a big way to make people recognize who we are.�Reaction to Uniqlo in the New York market was mixed. Gabrielle Kivitz a retail analyst characterized Uniqlo�s clothes as being �very very basic�unusually basic.� Observers noted that the quality of Uniqlo products was high. One journalist commented �The Uniqlo goods don�t feel like throwaway pieces. They feel more like things you�ll keep a long long time.� On the other hand the differences between Uniqlo and other brands were subtle and easy to miss. Regarding the Uniqlo value proposition of high-quality casual basics at a low price Kivitz commented �It had me a little concerned. In this market that will not fly.� However Yanai believed that Uniqlo�s value proposition was more suited to Americans� needs than the brand�s fast-fashion competitors arguing that such competitors �copy fashions from the runway and get it out into the stores as soon as possible. That is not what we do. The typical American consumer doesn�t need or want runway fashions�they might find them �difficult to wear.�� Uniqlo maintained its SoHo presence but waited until 2011 before opening its next two American stores one on Fifth Avenue in New York City and one in New Jersey. The following year Uniqlo USA hired an American executive from Forever 21 as its chief operating officer. It also announced an aggressive plan to grow its presence in U.S. shopping malls at a rate of 20 to 30 new locations per year. At about the same time brands such as Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch were closing mall locations.Uniqlo�s Future in the U.S. MarketAt the end of the 2016 fiscal year Uniqlo had 45 locations in the United States. This number was fewer stores than Uniqlo had in Taiwan despite having entered Taiwan five years after entering the United States. Uniqlo continued to lose money in the U.S. market as it had since entering the market.Uniqlo still had difficulty fitting into the local market. For example its employees at stores in New York had been called �Uniqlones� because of the company�s rigid procedures for greeting customers folding clothes and organizing merchandise. Despite several attempts at making hit products for the American market such as lightweight down jackets and Oxford shirts success remained elusive. Some of Uniqlo�s innovations gained press coverage�for example the announcement that Uniqlo would sell jackets in airport vending machines. However even if these experiments bore fruit they would not have the impact the company needed to become a major player in the U.S. market as it had hoped.Uniqlo was not the only large apparel company having difficulty in the United States. Gap similar to Uniqlo was experiencing declining U.S. sales. Also American Apparel and A�ropostale two other U.S.-based casual brands had recently gone bankrupt.As Yanai had commented �One�s strengths can be one�s weakness: basics can be boring.� Yet in mid-2017 Yanai remained determined to crack the U.S. market noting �We�re going to bring all of our best practices from across the globe to bear in the American market.�Exhibit 1: Fast Retailing�s Income Statements 2013�2016Note: Fiscal year end is August 31; � = JPY = Japanese yen; US$1 = �100 on March 31 2016.Source: Fast Retailing 2016 Annual Report accessed June 10 2017 www.fastretailing.com/eng/ir/library/annual.html.Exhibit 2: Fast Retailing�s Consolidated Balance Sheet. as of August 31 2016Exhibit 2 (Continued)Note: � = JPY = Japanese yen; US$1 = �100 on March 31 2016.

Made by hand on Alex�s farm in the famed wine country of California�s Sonoma County the sparkling water had received nearly universally positive initial customer feedback. However the product was available in just a handful of dispensaries in California and Alex knew he had to get ready for the future. California voters had approved Proposition 64 which meant in just a few months Californians over the age of 21 could buy and use up to an ounce of cannabis for recreational purposes and individuals could grow as many as six plants. The measure would also allow retail sales of marijuana and impose a 15 per cent tax. Colorado had already approved the recreational use of cannabis but the California market was 10 times larger.The challenge for Alex was where to grow the business. California had 40 million people; that market alone could drive revenue. Why not go after other states that approved recreational use and even those where only medical marijuana was legal? Alex also thought the product would be popular in many international markets. Where to grow�instead of how to grow�was a good problem to have but it was still a problem. Alex stated:I developed Mountjoy Sparkling because I wanted to be more productive and to be a better person. I have a carefully curated cocktail database but I never felt that alcohol made me a better person. My motivation now is to share with people a product I believe will help people live better happier and healthier.FLOATING AN IDEAIn 2014 Alex bought a refrigerated unit to carbonate water and attached it to his well. He could get fresh sparkling water on demand for his family and friends. Then in 2016 Alex become interested in the cannabis business and started experimenting with different ways to infuse cannabis into the sparkling water. He went to a seminar in California focused on helping people get started in the industry and decided to launch Mountjoy. As a result of the November 2016 elections in the United States medical or recreational marijuana became legal in more than half of the 50 states. Alex saw this situation as market validation of the idea to devote his full attention to the company�s line of cannabis-infused sparkling waters. Alex saw sparkling water as a way to enter the cannabis market by overcoming what he saw as two shortcomings in current product offerings: smoking was bad for you and the amount of sugar in marijuana edibles made them less attractive to many consumers. Alex decided to make and distribute three cannabis-infused sparkling waters one with natural flavour and two with a hint of fruit flavour�orange and peach (see Exhibit 1). He decided to market the products in a distinct refrigerator unit similar to the approach other premium beverage companies used (see Exhibit 2).Alex knew �the trend is your friend� and wanted to seize the opportunity. North American cannabis sales grew by an unprecedented 30 per cent in 2016 as the legal market expanded in the United States and Canada. Also North American sales were projected to top US$20.2 billion by 2021 including Canada as it moved toward implementing legal adult use of cannabis. To put these numbers in perspective the industry growth was larger and faster than even the dot-com era.A LIFE OF CRIME?While the U.S. Constitution granted sweeping powers to states it also granted Congress powers under the Commerce Clause (Article 1 Section 8 Clause 3) �to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes.�Complicating Mountjoy�s�and the entire marijuana industry�s�growth was the Controlled Substance Act (CSA). In 2016 and 2017 the CSA listed marijuana next to heroin as a Schedule I controlled substance having �a high potential for abuse� �no currently accepted medical use in treatment� and �a lack of accepted safety for use.� The CSA prohibited the manufacture distribution dispensation and possession of marijuana. Pursuant to the U.S. Constitution�s Supremacy Clause state laws conflicting with federal law were generally preempted and void.As states moved to formally and informally decriminalize some marijuana use the federal government weighed in. In a memorandum dated August 29 2013 (the �Cole Memorandum�) Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole wrote that while marijuana remained illegal under the CSA the Department of Justice would focus resources on �most significant threats in the most effective consistent and rational way.� Cole�s enforcement priorities (�the eight preventions�) were: distribution of marijuana to minors; marijuana sale revenue going to criminal enterprises gangs and cartels; diversion of marijuana from states where it was legal under state law in some form to other states; state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; violence and use of firearms in marijuana�s cultivation and distribution; drugged driving and exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; growing of marijuana on public lands and attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and marijuana possession or use on federal property.While comforting Alex knew this memorandum was possibly not as long lasting as a formal piece of legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President. A new U.S. Attorney General could simply tear up the Cole Memorandum. Another problem was the banking industry which was highly regulated at the federal level and tended to be highly risk averse. Because of the CSA providing financial services to a cannabis-related business would result in compliance risk and costs that most banks would simply refuse despite the opportunity for a return. The Department of the Treasury�s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Guidance compounded compliance costs by requiring that a bank providing financial services to a cannabis-related business file suspicious activity reports.The challenge of being in the cannabis business would not end for Alex even with legalization at the federal level. Unlike with cigarettes and alcohol all 50 states could and likely would implement their own standards for packaging. This decentralization was already present. Packaging requirements in Colorado the nation�s largest adult-use market and second-biggest medical cannabis market included that the product had to be placed in a child-resistant container or that the container had to be placed in a child-resistant exit package. Washington state required that prior to offering items for sale all marijuana-infused products labels and packaging be approved by the agency charged with running its marijuana program�the Liquor Control Board. Nevada�s packaging regulations required that any container or packaging containing usable marijuana edible marijuana products or marijuana-infused products had to protect the contents from contamination and not impart any toxic or deleterious substance to the usable marijuana or marijuana product.As if being in the cannabis business in California was not difficult enough with the myriad of state and local regulations entering another state was challenging beyond the packaging requirements. Companies were subject to changing laws and regulations in their home states and in the states in which they did business.�Since the legal cannabis industry was still in its infancy Alex would have to try to anticipate new rules and how they might affect his business. Rapidly changing laws could create numerous expenses for a growing business and enable �fast followers� to gain a competitive advantage by learning from the early entrant�s mistakes. Increased regulatory compliance costs could result in lower gross margins or higher retail prices or both while competition from the black market loomed.Furthermore not all of those costs would be deductible as they would in other businesses. Except for �cost of goods sold� Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibited a marijuana business from taking tax deductions for numerous ordinary and necessary business expenses. Also insurance laws for marijuana-related risks were not well-developed and common coverages might not be available to Mountjoy. As with any product manufacturer Mountjoy was subject to the risk of product liability claims. The loss of any such claim in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Mountjoy�s business and financial condition.BOTTLING A LIFESTYLEAlex set out to develop the product category as much as the Mountjoy brand itself. He knew some investors and other people would equate consumption of marijuana in any form with the drug user begging for money on the corner. However Alex compared his product to a glass of wine offering more of a relaxed feeling than a high. He envisioned it being consumed around the pool with friends with cheese and crackers before a dinner party or after a long run or some other kind of exercise.Alex believed that cannabis consumption was at a tipping point. Just as states had promoted marriage equality well ahead of federal rules and regulation so too he thought was the case with cannabis. With legalization in the United States at over 50 per cent of the states in 2016 he thought there would soon be pressure on the federal government to regulate cannabis similar to how it regulated alcohol and cigarettes. States would not have to legalize cannabis but the federal government would not prevent states that wanted to from doing so. Alex�s optimism was based on two developments that were getting a great deal of news coverage all over the country: taxes and the opioid crisis. States always under budgetary pressure saw marijuana sales as a way to increase tax revenue. In Colorado for example �the state received nearly $200 million in marijuana tax revenue whereas just a decade ago it was receiving zero.� In 2017 �legal recreational marijuana sales in Nevada generated $3 million in sales revenue and roughly $500000 in tax revenue in their first four days according to the Nevada Dispensary Association. That puts the state on track to pull in sales of $30 million by the next six months.� Moreover Washington state �expects to rake in about $730 million from sales of legalized marijuana over the next two years.�More controversial was the reporting that marijuana could serve as an alternative to opioids for pain management. According to an article in Scientific American �A handful of drug makers are taking their first steps toward developing marijuana-based painkillers alternatives to opioids that have led to widespread abuse and caused the U.S. health regulator to ask for a withdrawal of a popular drug this month.�In 2017 Alex hired a social media consultant and public relations firm to promote awareness of the Mountjoy brand to consumers and would-be investors. The imagery used to do so was consistent with Alex�s belief that the brand should be seen as a healthy lifestyle choice. Most of the early pictures were taken near the ocean to reinforce that Mountjoy was after all a sparkling water. The mainstream press picked up on this theme with a major health publication writing about it in its Healthy Eating�Healthy Drinks section:Now that recreational weed is legal in some states there are so many more ways to get your weed fix other than smoking a joint. Companies are infusing all kinds of things you�d never think to with cannabis. . . . One cannabis product that�s sure to appeal to all the La Croix-guzzling millennials out there: Mountjoy Sparkling�s cannabis-infused sparkling water. The zero-calorie drink comes in orange peach or natural and is now sold in dispensaries in California and�online. . . . They�re also more fast-acting than edible options (which can take an hour to work) with a high that kicks in within 15 minutes of drinking and lasts three to four hours after drinking it. . . . Overall the beverage is being marketed as�a way to �mellow out� in daily life without getting overly stoned. GROWTH ON THE HIGH SIDEIn June 2017 about seven months after Mountjoy�s soft launch Alex hired two full-time sales people to get the product on the shelves of dispensaries. Mountjoy�s wholesale price allowed retailers to sell the product at high margin even with a $5 suggested retail price. Given the product quality and the favourable reviews online and in the press sales started to grow quickly. Customers contacted the company wanting to know where they could buy it in their area. This pull made it easier for Mountjoy to push more dispensaries to carry the sparkling water.Like most fast-growing start-ups costs were rising faster than sales. Alex had to buy bottles flavourings and of course cannabis. The cost to produce was roughly $1 per bottle including the water carbon dioxide bottle cap cannabis flavouring label and cardboard box. However bottles and caps needed to be purchased in quantities of 10000 pieces to achieve a price break. Similarly the cannabis extract was manufactured in a volume of 10000 doses. These volumes created a short-term cash flow issue that Alex felt was best addressed by selling a small equity stake in the company. While debt might normally have been the right approach given the high demand and quick inventory turn it was not easily available for a cannabis product. The capital from investors could also be used to reduce the cost of goods sold. For example Alex could buy 100000 bottles at a time which was significantly cheaper than what he was paying for his current run of 10000 units.Alex calculated he should raise $500000 in growth capital to get Mountjoy to cash flow positive (allowing for a modest founder�s salary) more quickly (see Exhibit 3). The founder of a venture fund out of Florida who was focused on cannabis businesses had heard about the product and he flew to California to sample it and tour the production facilities. Impressed with what he saw he invested $125000 without waiting for another fund to match as was customary. The fund gave Mountjoy some sales goals to obtain and offered additional funding if those goals were achieved. Alex also tapped his friends and business contacts to raise money. All investors wanted and expected a return of course; however most just wanted to be in the cannabis space given the prospect of dissipating federal control.DRENCHED IN OPPORTUNITIESAlex knew he was in the right place at the right time. His challenge was deciding how best to capitalize on this fast-growing market. He could focus solely on California and increase the availability of the product to the over 3000 dispensaries licensed to sell medical marijuana and just wait for the recreational market to explode a year later. He could establish production facilities in other U.S. states that had legalized either medical or recreational marijuana. He could pursue international markets including Canada and some countries in Europe and South America. He could create a premium line of beverages to complement what he felt was the entry-level pricing of the company�s original three products. He could focus his sales efforts on direct-to-consumer sales either through home delivery or at special events. Alex gathered his team at his farm in California. With Mountjoy the beverage of choice they sat together to discuss the different opportunities in additional markets and products. All of them agreed that the future offered tremendous rewards if they could develop the right strategy.EXHIBIT 1: THREE FLAVORS OF MOUNTJOY SPARKLING WATERSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: DISPENSARY REFRIGERATORSSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: REVENUE PROJECTIONS AS OF FALL 2017 (IN US$)Source: Company documents.

Ltd. (Venture Workshop) faced a dilemma. Founded in 2012 in Dalian Liaoning Province China Venture Workshop specialized in providing incubation and investment services to early stage start-ups according to their needs. Venture Workshop supported the establishment and growth of start-ups by providing office space through the Venture DNA Coffee House Venture Nursery and Venture Incubation Base. It also provided training consulting and investment services through collaborations with entrepreneurship tutors and external organizations.In 2014 the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People�s Republic of China identified Venture Workshop as a �state-level technology business incubator.� Venture Workshop had provided incubation services for more than 15000 entrepreneurs and 175 start-ups and had invested more than �98 million in 69 start-ups. In 2017 Venture Workshop was the largest incubator in Northeast China. However behind its prosperity Venture Workshop had faced years of losses. Since its establishment in 2012 its only income source was the fees it charged for renting office space to start-ups. Its standard rates were far lower than market prices which made it difficult for Venture Workshop to generate enough income. Compared with incubators of the same size Venture Workshop�s operating costs were not high and were even considered low. Hu faced the dilemma of how to increase Venture�s Workshop�s income.The Development of business Incubators in ChinaBusiness incubators were �large buildings operated to nurture young companies by providing low-rent space shared office services and management advice.� A business incubator was structured to provide cost-saving time-saving and skill-developing services in a centralized controlled environment. Start-ups generally faced problems such as shortages of resources and of talent and lack of experience. A business incubator could provide start-ups with many resources and services that would make up for these shortages and thereby increase the success rate of entrepreneurship. The success rate of start-ups that had received incubator services was significantly higher than the success rate of those who had not received such services; therefore the Chinese government vigorously advanced the construction of business incubators in order to develop start-ups.In 1987 Donghu New Technology Venture Center the first business incubator in China was born in Wuhan Hubei Province. Over the next two decades the Chinese government paid little attention to the development of business incubators and so the number of incubators grew slowly. However after entering the 21st century China�s economic strength increased as did the government�s attention to incubators and the number of incubators grew rapidly (see Exhibit 1).In September 2014 at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council of the People�s Republic of China called on governments at all levels to lend their support to mass entrepreneurship and innovation. Subsequently the State Council promulgated a series of policies to promote the development of incubators and start-ups including Guiding Opinions on Expanding Makerspace and Promoting Start-ups by the General Public Opinions on Several Policies and Measures for Vigorously Advancing the Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Supporting Platforms for the Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Accelerating the Development of Makerspace and Serving the Transformation and Upgrading of the Real Economy.From May 2013 to December 2015 at least 24 relevant documents were issued at the central government level to promote the development of incubators. As a result the number of incubators in China significantly increased (see Exhibit 2). In 2014 China had 1755 incubators which by 2015 had grown to 2536�an increase of 44.5 per cent. In 2016 China had 3255 incubators�a 28.4 per cent increase over 2015. In 2015 102170 start-ups were incubated and in 2016 133266 were incubated�an increase of 30.5 per cent. The number of start-ups in China had also increased dramatically. In 2013 about 5000 companies were established per day which increased in 2017 to about 16000 companies being established per day. This surge in the number of start-ups further increased the demand for incubators. Meanwhile the development of Chinese incubators and start-ups boosted the transformation and upgrading of China�s economy from being resource-driven to being innovation-driven.Venture Workshop and its Incubation systemHu had been investing in start-ups as an individual investor since 2002. In 2011 he came up with the preliminary idea of building a business incubator to provide a full range of services for start-ups. To this end Hu went to Beijing and Shenzhen many times to learn about how to set up and operate an incubator and he began to prepare for its establishment. In May 2012 he set up Venture Workshop in Dalian. The new business incubator specialized in incubating and investing in start-ups in the fields of smart hardware new energy and new materials. The rapid development of Venture Workshop was inseparable from its incubation system. Venture Workshop provided (1) office space rental services through the Venture DNA Coffee House Venture Nursery and Venture Incubation Base; (2) training and consulting services through collaborations with entrepreneurship tutors; (3) investment and financing services through angel investments from Venture Workshop and other investors or investment institutions; and (4) a communication platform for entrepreneurs investors (including investment institutions) and entrepreneurship tutors through activities such as �Entrepreneurial ABC� and �Angels Beside.�Incubation ChainThe most basic service that Venture Workshop provided was affordable office space rental. According to the demands of the different stages of start-ups�including the idea period the production period and the commercialization period�Venture Workshop correspondingly provided office space through the Venture DNA Coffee House Venture Nursery and Venture Incubation Base (see Exhibit 3).Venture DNA Coffee HouseThe Venture DNA Coffee House was the outpost station from where Venture Workshop could contact start-ups. Its main function was to help entrepreneurs perfect their ideas. Venture DNA Coffee House was about 500 square metres (m2) equipped with office facilities conference rooms wi-fi books and beverage services. Entrepreneurs with business ideas could use these facilities for free perfecting their ideas and finding business partners through communicating with investors and entrepreneurship tutors. In 2017 after only five years of development the Venture DNA Coffee House had already become a gathering place for entrepreneurs and investors in Dalian.Venture NurseryThe Venture Nursery was the place to turn ideas into products or services. It was dedicated to providing start-ups with a full range of entrepreneurial services and creating a low-threshold low-risk environment. Through three to six months of incubation start-ups could transform their ideas into products or services and then set up a company. Covering an area of 3500 m2 the Venture Nursery provided start-ups with office space for incubation and charged only 10 per cent of the standard market price. In order to solve the problem of capital shortage often encountered by start-ups in the process of transforming ideas into products or services Venture Nursery offered them �20000д30000 in assistance.Venture Incubation BaseThe Venture Incubation Base was the last station before start-ups graduated from Venture Workshop. In this phase Venture Workshop worked with external professionals and companies to provide start-ups with free services related to capital technology marketing talent finance and training and then brought their products or services to market. The Venture Incubation Base possessed about 8000 m2 of office space. For start-ups stationed in the Venture Incubation Base Venture Workshop charged 50 per cent of the standard market price for the rent. During incubation and according to the demands of the start-up a certain amount of angel funds could be invested by Venture Workshop to help start-ups launch their product or service into the market.Entrepreneurship TutorsVenture Workshop provided business support services to start-ups through co-operation with entrepreneurship tutors. Venture Workshop had hired 446 entrepreneurship tutors from Dalian Entrepreneurship Service Center. These tutors which included well-known entrepreneurs from various industries investors from venture capital firms and professors from universities and other educational institutions provided business support services for start-ups.On the one hand tutors provided training services to entrepreneurs. These tutors had rich practical experiences and profound theoretical backgrounds in enterprise structure design product marketing human resources management financial management and other aspects of enterprise internal management. Training services were provided in the form of either classroom lectures or one-on-one tutoring. On the other hand these tutors were also experts with rich social networks in their respective fields; as such start-ups had access to all kinds of resources through their network of tutors including capital technology suppliers and channel providers.Investment and Financing ServicesVenture Workshop provided investment and financing services to start-ups to solve the biggest problem in the process of starting a business�capital. Venture Workshop could directly invest in start-ups using its own funds. Before 2015 Hu had invested in start-ups as an individual investor; in 2015 Venture Workshop set up a professional company named Dalian Venture Workshop Capital Management Co. Ltd. at which time Venture Workshop began to invest in start-ups as an investment institution. As of December 2017 69 start-ups had been supported and more than �98 million in angel funds had been invested by Venture Workshop.Venture Workshop also built bridges for entrepreneurs and investors to help start-ups obtain external capital. In February 2014 Venture Workshop in conjunction with outside angel investors and institutions set up Dalian Venture Workshop Investment Club. Venture Workshop would screen start-ups and recommended any exceptional start-ups to this club at which point club members would choose potential start-ups to invest in. By December 2017 this club had expanded rapidly from the original 77 angel investors and institutions to 425. At the same time because start-ups required a large amount of capital and the city of Dalian had a relatively insufficient supply Venture Workshop would lead any exceptional start-ups to conduct road shows in well-funded cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen to help them obtain investments. As of December 2017 Venture Workshop had helped start-ups raise more than �500 million.Entrepreneurial ActivitiesVenture Workshop had organized a series of entrepreneurial activities designed to promote communications between entrepreneurs and investors entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs and investors and investors.Three examples of these entrepreneurial activities were as follows: �Angel Day� was designed by Venture Workshop to build bridges between entrepreneurs and investors. In this activity four entrepreneurs each conducted a seven-minute project road show and then four angel investors in different fields commented and decided whether to invest in these projects. �Brainstorm Day� aimed to help entrepreneurs find the right partners. In this activity thematic seminars were held for different industries and the participants were divided into several groups to discuss the theme in an effort to match participants to appropriate business partners. �Consulting Day� was committed to building a platform for communication between entrepreneurs and tutors. In this activity entrepreneurship tutors systematically shared entrepreneurship-related domain knowledge in the form of classroom lectures. Then according to entrepreneurs� own problems encountered in the process of starting a business tutors would identify the problem share their own experiences and offer technical guidance. These three activities were characteristic of Venture Workshop and formed the basis of its �Entrepreneurial ABC� series. As of December 2017 these activities had been held 168 times.The Dalian Venture Workshop Investment Club also regularly organized activities to promote communication and exchange between investors. Relying on the investors in this club Venture Workshop held the activity �Angels Beside� which aimed to help entrepreneurs obtain personal one-on-one guidance from angel investors. As of December 2017 �Angels Beside� had been held 49 times. Venture Workshop also held other activities to promote communication between entrepreneurs and investors such as the �Product Managers Forum� held 78 times; �Stuff and Nonsense� held 33 times; and �Going to Universities� held 89 times.start-ups incubated by venture WorkshopDalian CZUR (Continue Zeal until Real) Technology Co. Ltd.Dalian CZUR Technology Co. Ltd. (CZUR) was founded in Dalian in 2013. Its main areas of focus were the research development production and sales of fast smart-scanning equipment. This smart equipment could quickly scan books or bound documents without disassembling them. In January 2014 CZUR entered the Venture Nursery to receive incubation from Venture Workshop. Venture Workshop provided �30000 to enable CZUR to make its prototype of the fast smart scanner. After the prototype was completed CZUR entered the Venture Incubation Base in July 2014 and obtained �1000000 from Venture Workshop to promote the scanner and take it to market. Subsequently Venture Workshop also helped CZUR find the proper equipment manufacturers in Shenzhen. In 2016 and 2017 Venture Workshop helped CZUR obtain two rounds of angel investment and a total of �10 million from other investors.Kang Zhou the founder of CZUR said �When CZUR was just established Venture Workshop provided us with office space and capital and also gave us help in the aspects of product development product promotion etc. Without Venture Workshop CZUR could not be as successful as it is now.� And there were reasons why Venture Workshop chose CZUR to be an incubated start-up. As Hu said: The fast smart scanner of CZUR could really solve the problem of scanning books and bound documents which greatly improved the efficiency of scanning. This product could be sold to organizations in need of book-scanning services such as libraries courts financial companies etc. I believe there is always market potential for products that could really address customers� pain points. Besides Zhou has many entrepreneurial experiences which make him good at business management personnel recruitment marketing investment management and so on. At the same time Zhou also has excellent communication skills bringing CZUR many high[ly] qualified talents with a wide range of abilities. As a whole CZUR�s products have huge market potential and its team is fully capable of completing this product. So I choose CZUR to be an incubated start-up and give it all the resources and supports it needs.Dalian New World Media Co. Ltd.Dalian New World Media Co. Ltd. (New World) developed a series of early education products including books cards and educational toys. Through augmented-reality technology these products could display voice video and animation on mobile terminals (e.g. tablet computers and smartphones). These products provided customers with richer experiences than traditional early education products did.In 2014 New World suffered from a shortage of capital and product development therefore stopped. Consequently Lianghua Zhao chief executive operator of New World took part in Venture Workshop�s �Angel Day� activity to raise funds. The four investors who participated in �Angel Day� thought that New World�s products were very innovative and interesting and that they would surely win children�s affections. The investors also felt that the outstanding technical and management abilities of Zhao and his team guaranteed product development and marketing. Eventually Hu along with the other three investors invested �10 million in New World to help it address its financial problem. In addition Venture Workshop also provided management consulting marketing promotion and other incubation services to New World. In the last quarter of 2017 these products had a turnover of up to �200 million.Dalian Flextail Technology Co. Ltd.Dalian Flextail Technology Co. Ltd. (Flextail) designed developed and promoted original outdoor equipment. Flextail�s core product was a lightweight pump for inflatable outdoor air cushions. This pump was less than two-thirds the size of a soda can and about one-sixth the weight of an ordinary pump. By the end of December 2017 Flextail�s sales had exceeded �2000000. In August 2015 Tao Li founder of Flextail took part in Venture Workshops� �Angel Day� activity. After the road show Hu thought that this product�s target customer was clear and that the pump could improve on the drawbacks that ordinary heavy pumps posed to outdoor travellers. Moreover Li and his team had finished the product prototype. However the entire Flextail team including Li was composed of college students; although they could develop innovative products they still lacked the experience of management and product promotion. As such Venture Workshop provided an angel investment of �300000 invited Flextail to enter the Venture Incubator Base and provided comprehensive capital technology and product marketing services.venture workshop�s dilemmaVenture Workshop managed approximately 12000 m2 of office space. It had also hired 446 entrepreneurship tutors and served more than 15000 entrepreneurs. Venture Workshop had incubated over 170 start-ups invested in 69 start-ups and provided more than �98 million to incubated start-ups. And Venture Workshop had also helped start-ups raise more than �500 million. Hu was very proud of the success Venture Workshop had achieved but he always worried about its continual losses that stemmed from insufficient income (see Exhibit 4).Venture Workshop�s only source of income was from rental fees for office space that it procured from Venture Nursery and Venture Incubation Base. But the fees it charged were already far lower than the standard market price. Because operating costs were difficult to reduce Hu was considering how to increase Venture Workshop�s income and avoid losing money in successive years.EXHIBIT 1: the number of Chinese incubators (2001�2016)Source: Chinatorch �2016 Torch Statistics Manual (Science and Technology Business Incubator and Makerspace Part)� [in Chinese] chinatorch.gov.cn November 6 2017 accessed June 21 2018 www.chinatorch.gov.cn/fhq/tjnb/201711/92d7e2003f87421aade583186a2c2f9b.shtml.EXHIBIT 2: the percentage growth rate of Incubators in China (2001�2016)Source: Chinatorch �2016 Torch Statistics Manual (Science and Technology Business Incubator and Makerspace Part)� [in Chinese] chinatorch.gov.cn November 6 2017 accessed June 21 2018 www.chinatorch.gov.cn/fhq/tjnb/201711/92d7e2003f87421aade583186a2c2f9b.shtml.EXHIBIT 3: Incubation chain of dalian venture Workshop technology service co. ltd.Source: Created by the case authors based on a discussion with Jianfeng Hu chairman Dalian Venture Workshop Technology Service Co.

(ECS) the primary focus was to establish ground rules for the firm�s annual fleet purchasing schedule and to approve the planned expansion into new markets. ECS currently operated in three American cities (Seattle Denver and San Francisco). However ECS�s business model called for expanding into three much larger markets (New York Boston and Toronto) in the coming months. Typically ECS replaced approximately half of its rental car fleet on an annual basis. This replacement cycle was consistent with ECS�s mission of offering its customers up-to-date vehicles at competitive prices. ECS�s management team headed by the chief executive officer Doris Johnson had established a budget of US$10 million for funding the vehicle purchases that year. Traditionally the firm paid cash when purchasing new cars; however the current very low interest rates had caught the eye of the chief financial officer Johnny Debonair. According to Debonair preliminary discussions with a local finance company had revealed that ECS could make a down payment for the cars and then pay the remaining balance over a two-year period. In response to this the vice-chair Ben Johnston asked �Why would we wish to pay interest when we can pay cash?� Debonair respond adroitly by saying �By buying on time we can purchase many more vehicles which should more than offset the paid interest based on maximizing net present income.� He added �The number of vehicles available at our planned three new locations would be severely limited under the cash model.� As the meeting concluded Johnson directed Debonair to conduct an analysis of both options cash versus finance using ECS�s new analytics-based resource management system and to report back within two weeks. RENTAL CAR INDUSTRYThe global rental car industry was estimated to reach approximately $125 billion in revenues by 2022 which represented a compounded annual growth rate of 13.5 per cent from 2017 to 2022. Typically the rental car industry was segmented into four broad sectors: rental lease purchase and sharing. The car-sharing business represented a small but growing component of this market. Basically the car-sharing model focused on customers who wished to (1) utilize a vehicle for short periods of time often by the hour; (2) replace corporate fleets; and (3) employ different types of vehicles for specific functions (e.g. minivan for a sporting event). Some of the major players in the global rental car industry included Enterprise Holdings Inc.; Hertz Global Holdings Inc.; Avis Rent a Car System LLC; Europcar Groupe SA (France); and Sixt AG (Germany). Enterprise Holdings Inc. the world�s largest rental car firm alone employed approximately 1.5 million cars. Additionally most industrial nations had local car rental firms (e.g. Park24 Co. Ltd. in Japan) that primarily concentrated on the domestic market. The continued expansion of the car rental industry was driven primarily by growth in tourism on a global basis. However there was growing concern in the environmental community regarding the impact of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the car rental industry. As a result many of the major car rental firms were looking to go green which involved increased use of all electric and hybrid vehicles. Another major challenge facing the rental car industry was the growing role of ridesharing firms like Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber) and Lyft Inc. (Lyft). Their market share was continuing to grow as customers shifted from traditional car rental in the metropolitan areas to ridesharing which eliminated the need for parking and driving in unfamiliar environs. The car rental firms had responded to this new threat by downsizing their car fleets. The dawn of the age of autonomous vehicles (i.e. self-driving cars) represented an even more serious threat to the established rental car business model. To that end some of the larger rental car firms were in the process of inking agreements with Apple Inc. and Google two of the current autonomous vehicle powerhouses as well as with Uber and Lyft.COMPANY BACKGROUNDECS which was founded in 2014 offered several car-sharing options in three metropolitan areas�Seattle Denver and San Francisco. Specifically it offered a city-wide service that rented vehicles by the hour and a program that provided residents of large apartment complexes and universities access to vehicles on demand. Currently customers could choose from four different vehicle types: minivan sport utility vehicle sedan and economy. ECS had experienced significant growth over the past few years with sales approaching $40 million annually. As a result ECS planned to expand in the New York Boston and Toronto markets in the coming months. ECS�s management believed that ridesharing represented a new zeitgeist for the rental car industry and that ECS would be well positioned to take advantage of these new trends. Debonair understood based on his preliminary investigation that the finance company required at least a 20�per�cent down payment and that at least 50 per cent of the purchase price plus interest had to be paid by the end of the first year. The financing company was currently charging 4 per cent interest. ECS used a 10�per�cent discount rate for financial planning and based on inputs from operations Debonair believed that all of the cars that were purchased could be rented. However to meet overall market demand Debonair wanted each vehicle category represent at least 15 per cent and no more than 50 per cent of the total number of vehicles purchased. Cars purchased were depreciated and paid off for over a two-year period after which they were sold in a secondary market (see Exhibit 1).EXHIBIT 1: Wholesale Purchase Price and Revenue Summary (US$)Note: Second-year revenue estimates include the resale value; SUV = sport utility vehicle.Source: Based on the authors� calculations from information in the case.

It was the last week of September 2014 and the staff at JSW Steel Ltd. (JSW) was frantically focused on last-minute efforts to achieve the company’s quarterly targets. Kumar was the senior customer relationship manager to Jindal SAW Ltd. (JSAW) a long-time client of JSW and he found himself in a difficult spot because he had only a short window of time to decide whether to transport finished materials to JSAW by barge (sea route) or instead use the faster but more expensive method of transporting it by rake (rail route). On a routine day Kumar would have had no second thoughts on the matter but today was an exception because JSAW needed the material urgently and Kumar certainly did not want to shut down his customer’s production process. The JSW logistics team was putting pressure on Kumar to release the material and send it by rake to JSAW; however Kumar thought that shipping the materials by barge would still ensure that they reached the client in time with additional savings for his own company during the crucial quarter-end period. Kumar had less than 12 hours to decide on the mode of transportation and release the material. The CompanyJSW Steel Ltd. was a steel giant that operated five manufacturing units in India. The company generated annual revenues of ₹512196.2 million in 2013–14 (see Exhibit 1) and was the nation’s leading private steel manufacturer. JSW produced a variety of steel products including hot-rolled (HR) coils cold-rolled (CR) coils thermo-mechanically treated sheets wire rods galvanized steel and galvalume sheets. It also manufactured special grades of steel that were used extensively in high-end applications such as the manufacturing of large-diameter pipes prefabricated metal structures and components for auto sectors. The company’s largest plant—the Bellary plant in the village of Toranagallu Karnataka—was strategically located in south India close to the ports of Goa Chennai and Mumbai. In terms of its corporate vision JSW aimed to become a globally respected organization through sustainable industrial and business-development practices. The steelmaker had received several awards for its initiatives in cultivating a green philosophy among its employees processes and products. One such initiative involved the operation of a responsible supply chain that assessed the benefits to people planet and profit throughout its corporate decision-making. Thus apart from the regular railway routes the company made every effort to supply its clients with materials that were shipped by barge to locations that were close to ports (see Exhibit 2). Shipping by barge reduced the time needed to transport material and offered an additional benefit of reducing in the company’s carbon footprint. SteelMaking and LogisticsJSW manufactured steel using iron ore coke and limestone either in a blast furnace or in a Corex furnace which was a more environmentally friendly alternative to the blast furnace. The end products of reduction and melting were hot metal and slag. The hot metal was processed further by blowing it with oxygen to remove the unwanted carbon. Finer elements such as vanadium nickel cobalt and titanium were added to enhance the features of the steel and to make it suitable for specific applications. The steel slabs were rolled through a critical method to manufacture HR coils which were then shipped to customers who manufactured pipes and tubes. The customer put the HR coils through a flattener and used a special technique called submerged arc welding to manufacture pipes. This process required clean coils to avoid strains on the pipes and tubes produced. The pipes were further processed and used to connect water resources natural gas and fuel lines around the world. The timely supply of these HR coils to the customers was obviously an important concern for JSW’s logistics department. The logistics team used different transportation modes for different locations. The customer—in this case JSAW—was located in the Mundra region of Gujarat so the closest port was Mundra and the closest railway siding was Gandhidham (see Exhibit 3). The material for JSAW products had always been transported by rail route from the time the two companies started doing business together; however with JSW’s recent focus on a responsible supply chain the sea route was also considered as a viable alternative. Indian railways charged JSW based on a price list that was approved every year and JSW’s accounting department shared this price list with all other departments within the company so they could refer to it to make cost-effective shipping decisions (see Exhibit 4).The Indian railway system classified its rake services based on the number of rail wagons attached. For example 45 wagons constituted a BOXN rake and 59 a JUMBO rake. A JUMBO rake could carry 3500 tons (3175 tonnes) while a BOXN rake could carry 2500 tons (2267 tonnes). Indian Railways’ monopoly gave it the authority to sanction the type of rakes it supplied. The chance of attaining a JUMBO rake on request was just 30 per cent since the railway operated only a small number of JUMBO rakes and availability was limited. Prior to 2014 Kumar’s experience had taught him that the railway authorities usually gave permission for the requested number of BOXN rakes 80 per cent of the time and 20 per cent of the time the allocation was one BOXN rake less than the number requested. Also from experience Kumar knew that for a rail shipment the odds of late arrival were approximately 30 per cent. South West Port Ltd. Goa operated the nearest port to Bellary. This port was mostly used for the export of HR coils CR coils steel plates and steel sheets to international customers; it was also used for the import of raw materials such as coal and iron ore. Gates 1 to 4 were used for exports gates 6 and 7 for domestic activity and gates 8 to 10 for imports. Because South West Port Ltd. was owned by JSW Group Kumar had always enjoyed the availability of the required number of rakes between the plant and the port.Most of the barges that entered this port for domestic purposes were carrying coal shipments and thus a significant amount of coal and iron dust could damage the surfaces of the coils that were being transported. The vendors who supplied barge transportation that offered clean storage space (Class I) charged a premium (₹30 per ton) beyond the normal delivery charges but the availability of such clean-storage barges was only 30 per cent. Kumar knew that he could place a request with port officials to have Class II vendors provide clean storage space on their barges. In such a case the vendors would charge an additional ₹25 per ton and Kumar estimated only a 75 per cent chance that the cleaning would actually be done. He remembered that Class I vendors had a record of 80 per cent timely delivery whereas the Class II vendors had a record of only 35 per cent. The combined cost of transporting coils to the port in Goa by rake and then to the Mudra port by barge was approximately 22 per cent cheaper than that of transporting the coils directly by rail. JSW’s past records showed some variation in activity times across both modes of transportation (see Exhibit 5).Kumar’s problem The quantity of steel ordered by JSAW was 7000 tons (6350 tonnes) of which 5000 tons (4535 tonnes) had already been produced; the remaining 2500 tons (2267 tonnes) was under production and was scheduled to be ready for dispatch by 10 p.m. that same day Sunday. The conditions for delivery of the coils were decided through a memorandum of understanding and a negotiation document had been drawn up between JSW and JSAW. All terms and conditions were clearly defined for every project (see Exhibit 6).The intricacies of this logistics problem were growing with every minute that passed and Kumar knew he needed to make his decision in less than 12 hours. He was under tremendous pressure since this was the last week of the quarter. As well timely delivery to JSAW was high on Kumar’s list of priorities but the logistics department could not confirm the availability of JUMBO or BOXN rakes until the next day Monday at 10 a.m. As he pondered the situation several important questions ran through Kumar’s head: Would it be best to wait until Monday morning to get confirmation on the rail rakes? What if he could not obtain the required type or number he needed? Should he talk to the port officials now and at least try to get a confirmation on the availability of a clean barge? JSAW shipments had always been transported by rail. Would it be risky to rely on a recently developed sea route to make a rush delivery for an important customer such as JSAW? Would the final decision affect the goodwill between JSW and JSAW? As Kumar considered the possible answers to these questions he felt he could not agree more with the well-known adage “Too tired to stay up yet too awake to fall asleep.” Exhibit 1: Revenue of JSW Steel Ltd. 2008–09 to 2013–14 (IN ₹ Millions) Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹60.53 on September 1 2014.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca.Copyright � 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-07-19Vazirani Automotive Pvt. Ltd.�s debut electric hypercar the Vazirani Shul (pronounced �shool�) was launched in July 2018 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex England. Chunky Vazirani the founder and chief designer of Vazirani Automotive created the Shul as a counter to the traditional aggressively designed supercars of the world. The concept car was appreciated for being futuristic in its design and use of technology. According to Vazirani the Shul was the perfect blend of art and science which along with power depicted a lesser-known side of Indian culture and mythology. If successful the Shul would become the world�s first electric car with a jet turbine-electric powertrain. Other automotive companies including the American giant automakers General Motors Company and (then) Chrysler Corporation had tinkered with the technology in the early 1960s but had not been able to successfully implement the technology in reproducible cars. With the Shul Vazirani Automotive ushered India into an elite exclusive club of hypercar manufacturers dominated by manufacturers from the United States and Europe. Although the Shul�s national origin was Indiaa the design centre and the manufacturing hub were located in the U.S. state of California. Indian hypercar enthusiasts would have to import the Shul after it was commercially launched. The Indian market had witnessed an increase in the sales of high-performance cars in recent years. However with the high cost of such cars purchases were far fewer than in developed countries like the United States (see Exhibit 1). The heavy import duty imposed by the Indian government on luxury cars supercars and hypercars made the cost of such imported cars almost double the actual price in the Indian market. Supercars sportscars and hypercars were typically priced above US$1 million with at least 12 out of 50 supercars in 2016 priced above $ 2 million. Consequently high net worth individuals or millionaires were the major customers. In 2017 India had only 263000 millionaires a number that was expected to increase to 1 million by 2020 (see Exhibit 2). Nevertheless automobile enthusiasts were skeptical about whether a market like India was ready for a hypercar like the Shul. Reckless driving accidents and traffic snarls were frequent occurrences in India as was the lack of space to drive such high-performance cars. Vazirani himself admitted that the Shul resulted more from passion than practicality. To skeptics the Shul had been likened to vapourware�something much promised but never delivered. However skeptics were somewhat reassured by Vazirani Automotive�s engineering partnership with the Sahara Force India Team (Force India) and design partnership with Kazunori Yamauchi. Force India was India�s first and only Formula 1 racing team and Yamauchi was the designer of the extremely popular PlayStation Gran Turismo video game series. Yamauchi was also credited with providing key inputs and design guidance for the Shul which increased the car�s feasibility. By the end of September 2018 Vazirani was quickly progressing toward the manufacture of the Shul. Could he succeed in making the Shul successful in India and in global markets? With its design and manufacturing centres located in the United States was Vazirani right to position the Shul as an Indian car? COMPANY BACKGROUNDHypercars were characterized by appealing aesthetics exorbitant price tags state-of-the-art technology and unimaginable speed and performance. Many hypercars were associated with developed countries with many hypercars coming from European and American luxury car manufacturers such as Ferrari N.V. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. and Automobil Lamborghini S.p.A. On a global level very few Indian automotive designers were successful. The few designers that were popular included Dilip Chhabria and Chetan Shedjale. Pratap Bose of Tata Motors was also credited with new-age Tata designs. Among these popular names Vazirani was unheard of.In 2015 at the age of 25 Vazirani founded Vazirani Automotive as an automobile design and manufacturing company in Mumbai India where Vazirani was born and raised. To the general public motor shows were nothing more than a demonstration of automobiles but for Vazirani they were a source of inspiration. In 2005 while attending the Geneva motor show he was struck by the design of the Enzo Ferrari and decided that his future was in designing cars.Vazirani graduated from the ArtCenter College of Design in California which was also the alma mater of popular Indian automobile designer Chhabria. Vazirani stated �Dilip Chhabria has been the only Indian car designer around who has done good work. He is responsible for letting people know that car design exists on the planet. It is crucial to have someone like him.� After working as a product designer for Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC and the Volvo Group Vazirani decided to return to India with a mission to build �India�s first hypercar.� By early 2018 he created the Shul hypercar concept vehicle. The car gave Vazirani global recognition and was expected to catapult him to global prominence. Vazirani stated that the principles that guided him in the car�s development were motivated by Indian culture and mythology. Vazirani considered his automotive company not just a hypercar company but also a design and technology company. He intended to work with other original equipment manufacturers on a consultancy basis to support them in designing and advancing future cars. He stated �We�re working on the technology of the next generation so that�s something that we can capitalize on by offering consultancy services to other companies.�Despite being an automobile company Vazirani maintained a lean structure with only 10 employees. The company hired various consultants and partnered with several designers across different countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2017 Vazirani Automotive had $30996 in fixed assets and $26555 in current assets. The two figures represented growth for the company of 2479 per cent in fixed assets and 1778 per cent in current assets over 2014 (see Exhibit 3). SHUL�S DESIGN and APPEARANCEVazirani wanted the Shul to look both modern and international to �strike the correct equilibrium concerning art and science He wanted his car to be unlike other contemporary hypercars which Vazirani described as being �built by engineering.�� Vazirani also wanted to depict a less familiar side of India to the world the side that involved getting closer to one�s soul. Thus he drew upon his Indian heritage and beliefs while designing the car. Commenting on challenges associated with embedding Indian culture and mythology in the car Vazirani stated �The Indian influence is very tricky as you tend to go overboard and be too decorative with colour.� He cautioned �On a sports car you need to be subtle.� The Shul was not about aggression but about reconnection. Its design was inspired by the Indian god Lord Shiva and his trident weapon known as the trishula. The Shul�s sides and hood had trishula-like lines. Its headlamps featured three vertical lines that resembled the three lines on Lord Shiva�s forehead known as the tripundra which personified life. In Indian mythology the symbol of the trishula could remove negative qualities human beings suffered from such as ego. It thus helped transform an individual from physical existence to the spiritual plane thus conveying a message of getting closer to one�s own soul. Shul drivers would be able to approach their own selves through the experience of totality. Despite the inspiration from Indian mythology the design of the Shul like other supercars in the market was also partly aggressive with several cuts and curves to enhance its aerodynamic capabilities. The body panels were designed to increase downforce as were those of most hypercars. With a plunging roof slanted front end and a graceful rear end the Shul was aesthetically comparable to Ferraris Aston Martins and Jaguars. It had light emitting diode (LED) lamps in both the front and back. The side of the car had vents and the exhaust system was centrally mounted. Because the Shul was designed with input and guidance from Yamauchi the Gran Turismo logo was mounted at the centre exit exhaust of the car. Vazirani intended to manufacture an electric car that gave the driver equivalent handling to that of a traditional sportscar. SHUL�S TECHNOLOGYVazirani used a revolutionary jet turbine-electric powertrain in the Shul enveloped in a suit of carbon-fibre which distinguished the Shul from competitors. Turbine-electric powertrains were generally used in warships submarines and railway locomotives. Despite repeated attempts in the past automobile companies such as Volkswagen AG England-based MG Rover Group and (then) Chrysler Corporation had not been able to achieve much success using turbine engines in cars. The Shul�s jet turbine-electric powertrain consisted of microturbines which enabled its propellers to run on multiple fuels including regular gasoline or petrol. This made it more efficient and less expensive to maintain than other electric hypercars. Microturbines also created less pollution than regular supercars and other electric supercars although noise levels were still a concern. The microturbine acted as an instant generator charging the batteries as the car ran. This feature allowed Vazirani Automotive to deploy a lightweight battery pack. The Shul battery pack weighed around 300 kilograms (kg) which was much lighter than batteries in other electric cars such as the 540 kg battery in the Tesla S. The lightweight battery pack not only reduced the car�s weight it also added a distinct sound and enhanced the car�s driving range. The signature �whoosh� sound from the turbine was expected to add to the unique driving experience for customers. In the Shul the battery pack was placed behind the passenger for equitable distribution of the car�s weight. The Shul was driven by four electric motors powered by the in-body 300 kg lithium battery pack. The four electric motors located beside each wheel acted as independent engines. Each engine provided its own independent torque resulting in unprecedented acceleration. The car body was made of carbon-fibre which made the Shul light and helped keep the car intact in a crash. Overall the Shul weighed around 1600 kg compared to heavier competitors such as the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 at 1888 kg or the Tesla Model S at 2100 kg.The smaller components of microturbine also helped create extra space which was efficiently used to improve the aerodynamics of the car. Air was channelled through and around the car to reduce drag and improve downforce. The Shul had a smooth flowing design with several air ducts which were designed to create adequate downforce to keep the hypercar of 1000-plus horsepower stationed at high speeds. The double diffuser of the Shul a shaped section of the car�s underbody that influenced its aerodynamics was also one of the biggest in the industry and components around it were innovatively and creatively packaged. A massive radiator ran across the centre of the car. The front bumper featured a large intake that fed air to the batteries located on the central tunnel and behind the passenger�s seat. The intake also created a lot of downforce toward the anterior end. An air duct was built under the headlights with the objective of cooling the brakes.Vazirani kept the design intact through the production stage stating that design and packaging were ready. Further aerodynamic simulations had been successfully conducted with favourable results as Vazirani reported: �A lot of interior ergonomics and the door-shut lines will stay on. The cooling requirements such as ducts for the individual components will also carry on unchanged.� SHUL�s PARTNERSFor the Shul�s development Vazirani worked with multiple companies globally including Brembo SpA for the brakes and Michelin for customized tires. For design and branding as noted earlier Vazirani partnered with Yamauchi and the team that created the PlayStation Gran Turismo series of racing video games which imitated the appearance and performance of real-world automobiles with licensed reproductions. Yamauchi himself awarded a final touch to the Shul�s design.Vijay Mallya the owner of Force India on collaboration with Shul stated �It is only logical for us to collaborate with Vazirani Automotive to advise mainly with aerodynamic design and participate in this important milestone in Indian automotive engineering.� In August 2018 Force India was acquired by Racing Point UK and rebranded as Racing Point Force India. Vazirani looked forward to collaborating with the new owners to gain expertise in using a wind tunnel which was required for developing the aerodynamics of the Shul. Vazirani also had teams based in the United Kingdom Japan Italy and the United States who worked on the design and development of the Shul.SHUL�S COMPETITIONAlthough the Shul�s pricing was not revealed by Vazirani Automotive industry experts believed that the Shul was expected to be priced similar to BMW�s i8 in India which cost $293000. The estimates were based on Shul�s size which was similar to the BMW i8 in several aspects such as design size and engine layout. Given their high pricing (see Exhibit 3) supercars and hypercars like the Shul needed average annual sales of approximately 400 units to break even. The two most prominent electric hypercars in direct competition to the Shul were the Rimac Concept One and C Two by Croatia-based Rimac Automobili. The Rimac Concept One delivered in early 2017 had a price of $1 million; the Rimac C Two scheduled for release in 2019 was priced at $2 million. Rimac Automobili claimed that the C Two would have a longer driving range of approximately 600 kilometres (400 miles) with a single charge compared to the Concept One at 340 kilometres (210 miles). The C Two also boasted an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometres (60 miles) per hour in 1.85 seconds and a top speed of 415 kilometres (258 miles) per hour.Another competitor to the Shul was Tesla�s 2020 generation of the tri-motor Roadster all-electric hypercar. Tesla was criticized for its claim to have a 200-kilowatt hour battery pack which implied a weight of approximately 833 kg. Such a weight would substantially limit the hypercar�s range and acceleration. Tesla claimed that its Roadster could accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres (60 miles) per hour in less than two seconds compared to Vazirani�s Shul at 2.5 seconds. Experts opined that this range of acceleration speed would become the norm rather than the exception once several electric hypercars were available in the market (see Exhibit 3).In India�s automobile market for high-end luxury cars sportscars and supercars most companies had received a mixed response. Well-known companies from developed markets such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motors Ltd. had registered some sales success in the Indian luxury car market. However less-known companies such as Koenigsegg Automotive AB from Sweden and Apollo Automobil Ltd. (formerly Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur GmbH) from Germany had been unable to generate any sales in India.MARKETINGThe Shul�s first teaser promotion was released on Vazirani Automotive�s YouTube channel. The channel described the Shul as �an aerodynamically enhanced elegant design paired with a Micro Jet Turbine Electric powertrain to deliver a spiritual automotive experience of restrained power eternal beauty and quiet eminence.� Vazirani advertised the Shul as a car of Indian origin and claimed it as being India�s first hypercar due to its headquarters in Mumbai India. The company however had its design and style centre in California. Shul was also expected to be manufactured in California considered the world capital of electric cars and companies. To explain why California was chosen as the foreign design location Vazirani stated �It�s the cash of the electric-powered auto environment and we have connections there.� Venture capitalists funding the future growth of Vazirani Automotive were more likely to be found in California than in India. Also the lack of suitable technologies for building hypercars in India was a roadblock.INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS IN INDIAThe Goodwood Festival of Speed was considered one of the best motor shows in the world. India received global visibility on the 25th anniversary of the festival when the Shul was first presented. With the Shul India was not only launching its first hypercar but a battery-operated electric hypercar. According to a survey by Velocity MR a market research firm in India 90 per cent of Indians surveyed claimed that they would choose to drive an electric car. However critics were skeptical about the future of electric cars in India because of the lack of electric car maintenance infrastructure such as publicly available charging points (see Exhibit 4). But the Shul was a hybrid-electric car built on the concept of �charging on the go.� Fuels such as gasoline or petrol were used to charge the batteries while the car was being driven so the lack of public charging points was less of a concern for Vazirani Automotive.Nevertheless hypercars like the Shul had a low ground clearance and were generally sensitive to road infrastructure problems. A modest blemish in the roads could result in a cost of thousands of dollars for maintenance and servicing. India�s road infrastructure was considered greatly inferior to developed countries. Poor road conditions such as potholes and bumpy roads had been known to cause accidents and even death. Another challenge to hypercars in India was road traffic. Traffic jams in major Indian cities often caused cars to slow to a crawl making walking much faster than driving. Further speeding related accidents were a major concern in India. In 2016 66.5 per cent of all road accidents and 61 per cent of deaths caused in road accidents were attributed to speeding. National and state highways where traffic that was relatively smoother and speed limits were generally more relaxed were the site of about 55 per cent of all road accidents in 2016. Skeptics further raised concerns about whether hypercars or supercars could be effectively driven in the uncontrolled obstructions of Indian roads including pedestrians disobeying street crossing regulations potholes in roads and roads blocked by the movement of stray animals such as cows and dogs. Driving supercars could also be particularly hazardous due to the driver�s lack of attention lack of knowledge of the vehicle�s high-end technology and incapability to deal with high acceleration speed limits and the required maneuvering. However with several start-ups in India posed to chase the electric hypercar dream as Vazirani Automotive had already done many experts believed that India would soon be recognized on the global platform as an influencer of the hypercar world.THE ROAD AHEADThe Shul was expected to hit the Indian market before being sold globally. Commenting on future plans Vazirani stated �We want to make things a lot more modular going forward in terms of not just the way we design the car. We see the powertrain evolving a lot faster in the future so owners will get an option to swap. For instance if in three years there�s a better motor out there we could offer this as an upgrade.� Other Indian entrepreneurs racing toward the development of supercars included Sathak Paul a 21-year-old entrepreneur. In 2015 Paul had intended to launch a supercar in the Indian market under his company�s name of Mean Metal Motors. However he found fundraising to be a major roadblock. Given the financial and engineering support Vazirani Automotive received automobile experts were far more positive about the possibility of the Shul running on roads. However according to media sources a similar project called the Techrules Ren RS was presented at the Geneva Motor Show in early 2018. The Techrules Ren RS was also a turbine-run car fuelled by diesel and powered by up to six electric motors. However after its Geneva debut no news about the company was heard. Vazirani wondered if he should continue to position the Shul as an Indian car despite its manufacturing in the United States. Would Vazirani succeed in creating turbine-powered hypercars or would the company vanish like the Techrules Ren RS? Could Vazirani succeed in the Indian market? Would the Shul design inspired by Indian mythology prove to be a distinct advantage?EXHIBIT 1: UNIT SALES OF LUXURY CARS INDIA VersuS United States (2015�2017)Note: USA = United StatesSource: Created by the authors with information from Sumant Banerjee �Luxury Car Sales Grow Fastest in 5 Years in India� Business Today January 9 2018 accessed December 19 2018 www.businesstoday.in/sectors/auto/luxury-car-sales-grow-fastest-5-years--india/story/267578.html; and �Mid-Size Luxury Car Sales in the United States from 2015 to 2017 by Model (in units)� Statista accessed October 19 2018 www.statista.com/statistics/287751/midsize-luxury-vehicles-sales-by-make-in-the-united-states.EXHIBIT 2: RANK AND NUMBER OF MILLIONAIRES by COUNTRY (2016 2017 and 2020)Source: Created by the authors with information from �Growth Continues as Global HNWI Wealth Breaks the US$70 Trillion Mark� Capgemini accessed October 18 2018 www.worldwealthreport.com/hnwi-market-expands; and �Countries with the Most Millionaires in 2020 (in 1000)� Statista accessed October 19 2018 www.statista.com/statistics/260622/coutries-with-the-most-millionaires.

The previous leader and prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper had stepped down as party leader in October 2015 after losing the federal election to the Liberal Party of Canada. The 2017 Conservative Party leadership race attracted an unprecedented total of 17 candidates who campaigned over seven months or more. Thirteen candidates were on the ballot for election. The race was not one of Canada’s finest political events for many reasons not least of which was the divisiveness of the candidates’ campaign rhetoric. Amid the cacophony one candidate stood out: Kellie Leitch the member of Parliament for Simcoe-Grey in Ontario.Leitch’s platform addressed several issues such as supply management natural resource planning and women’s safety but two issues in particular galvanized the media and came to define Leitch’s campaign: a commitment to institute the screening of newcomers to the country for their adherence to Canadian values and a platform of “anti-elite” initiatives. Leitch emphasized that her platform was based on the values of hard work generosity freedom and tolerance but many interpreted her commitment to screening newcomers as conflicting with a growing characterization of Canada as a place of multiculturalism and inclusivity. Her position riled several people including Leitch’s fellow leadership candidates and many party members. Her message found traction however among segments of the Canadian population particularly those frustrated with politically correct attitudes concerned about preservation of language and culture or advocating anti-immigration values. The media were critical of Leitch’s campaign lambasting her at almost every turn—for her campaign platform to be certain but more aggressively for a campaign platform that seemed to depart from Leitch’s background experience and values. Was Leitch for real or had she deliberately pushed a divisive issue to garner attention and raise her profile?Kellie LeitchKhristinn Kellie Leitch was born in 1970 the eldest of three siblings. She was a fourth-generation Canadian her father’s family having emigrated from Scotland and her mother’s family from Iceland. In the early 1970s Leitch’s father an engineer started and ran a construction company that built a substantial portion of Fort McMurray which became the urban centre for Alberta’s booming oils sands project. Leitch’s mother was a stay-at-home mother—a role she cherished—who inculcated her children with the value of community service. Leitch credited her mother for encouraging her to pursue an education and professional success participate in team sports and be active in local community groups. The family were practising Roman Catholics a faith that Leitch had sustained through her life.Leitch was academically talented. She advanced quickly through elementary school and high school graduating high school at age 16. She started university at age 17 pursuing a general arts degree without a clear career focus at the time. A little more than a year later Leitch’s mother died of breast cancer at age 46—an event that prompted Leitch to consider a career in medicine. She graduated medical school completed a residency in paediatric orthopaedic surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto pursued a clinical fellowship at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and by age 39 had become the chief of surgery for a large hospital in a rapidly growing community east of Toronto.Along the way Leitch also completed her master’s degree in business administration focusing on health care management. When Leitch accepted a position as a professor of surgery at the Schulich School of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario she was cross-appointed to the Ivey Business School where she taught in the health sector stream and was the founding chair of what became the Ivey International Centre for Health Innovation. Leitch combined her medical and business talents in multiple volunteer and community roles such as council member on the National Research Council of Canada board director of the YMCA of Greater Toronto board member of Genome Canada and vice-president of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research.Having been tagged as one of “Canada’s Top 40 Under 40” at the age of 34 then awarded the Order of Ontario at age 40 for her work in child health advocacy Leitch had been profiled several times in the media. She was variably described as focused and hard-working academically inclined smart driven and strategic loyal and “amazingly great at time management.” When Leitch ran for political office in 2010 The Globe and Mail described her as a “star candidate.”The Naissance of a Political CareerLeitch became politically active at the age of nine when her father a Conservative Party riding president became the campaign manager for a friend seeking office. Leitch joined the Conservative Party as soon as she was eligible at age 14 and was politically active as a volunteer throughout high school and university. She was well known in the party; Leitch and her friends referred to the party as Leitch’s second family. In 1993 Leitch threw her energy behind Jean Charest a liberal-minded Francophone in his bid to become party leader. At university Leitch helped pay her way through school by working for David Turnbull a member of Ontario’s provincial parliament and later by working for Barbara McDougall then federal minister of external affairs. In 2006 Jim Flaherty a well-known Conservative and then finance minister invited Leitch to chair an expert panel on developing tax incentives to improve children’s fitness. The work was the start to what would become Leitch’s niche for policy initiatives to advance children’s health and wellness. In 2008 Leitch released a government-backed study that concluded Canada was slipping behind its peer countries in indicators of child health. The report called for a national strategy which Leitch undertook. In 2009 she founded what became the Sandbox Project a Canadian non-governmental organization that worked across disciplines to advance the health and well-being of Canadian children and youth.Flaherty continued to mentor Leitch. He was highly regarded for his fiscal management skills balanced with social financial initiatives and he was liked and respected by politicians and business people regardless of party affiliation. That Flaherty took Leitch under his wing to groom her for a successful political career was a credit to Leitch and his influence on her was not lost on Leitch. In 2014 she was with Flaherty the morning he suffered a heart attack and despite Leitch’s best medical efforts died. Leitch was devastated but she spoke through her grief the next morning in the House of Commons to give a moving tribute to Flaherty “a colleague a mentor my champion and a very close friend.”Elected PoliticianIn 2010 Flaherty encouraged Leitch to run as the Conservative candidate in the upcoming 2011 federal election. Leitch was being parachuted by the party into the Simcoe-Grey riding to replace the incumbent member of Parliament who had been expelled from caucus. The campaign was bitter. The incumbent was liked in the riding and still identified herself as a Conservative even if she was unwillingly no longer a member of the Conservative Party. The party put a great deal of effort behind Leitch’s campaign sending no fewer than three Conservative cabinet ministers a well-known Conservative senator a well-known and highly regarded party strategist and previous senator a previous provincial premier and the prime minister himself to stump for Leitch. She won the riding the Conservatives won the election and Leitch was rewarded with government appointments.Leitch was first appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of human resources and skills development. Two years later she was promoted to minister of labour and minister of status of women. Her accomplishments as a parliamentarian however did not follow the thread of initiatives she had established in health care or regarding children. Rather when asked Leitch identified a women’s entrepreneur mentorship program and changes to the Federal Accountability Act as key accomplishments. The changes to the accountability act amended conflict of interest guidelines to allow parliamentarians to practise their profession as volunteers. This amendment aligned with both Leitch’s belief in service and her own professional activities in medicine: to sustain her medical skills and credentials she had continued to practise on a volunteer basis at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. In 2014 as minister of labour and minister of status of women Leitch introduced the government’s CA$25-million plan to address violence against Aboriginal women and children. The Conservative government had been resisting ongoing calls to investigate and launch a public inquiry into an ongoing problem with missing and murdered Indigenous women. The media and the government opposition criticized Leitch’s plan as a weak response to such a significant problem. The next year in the same role Leitch introduced a women’s mentorship program. It Starts with One encouraged leaders in the public and private sectors to become mentors and champions for young women to “increase women’s economic prosperity in Canada.” Leitch may not have yet had a high political profile in the general public but her status within the party was secure. She was regarded as “smart focused strategic driven and most of all loyal.” Her devotion to the party had been particularly noted; a party insider described Leitch as “a loyal soldier of the party. . . . For good and bad she [was] there.” Her allegiance to the party had been tested early in her parliamentary career. Once Leitch was elected physicians and public health professionals lobbied her as a health professional to push the government to end its export of asbestos. The issue was not on the government’s agenda and the Harper government was renowned for requiring the cabinet and caucus to speak with one voice. Leitch sided with the party and abandoned the request later justifying her actions: “I had a choice. I could speak my mind publicly and be removed from having a voice within caucus. Or I could achieve a longer-term goal in the best interests of Canadians. I chose the latter. . . . Sometimes you have to take it on the chin for the team” she said.Federal Election 2015Canadians went back to the polls in 2015 to elect a new federal government. The Conservatives had formed the government for nine years and the national desire was for change. Change was what they got: the Liberals swept the election exceeding expectations. Although not far behind the Liberals in terms of the popular vote the Conservatives lost 89 seats dropping from 188 to 99. The Conservative platform—“Proven leadership for a strong Canada”—had offered Canadians more of the same which seemed to be not what Canadians wanted. The party had also lost some campaign steam when an extended media cycle was taken up with the trial of a Conservative senator for fraud a charge linked to questionable dealings in the prime minister’s office. However it was widely believed that it was not the trial that lost the race but the party’s inability to respond to the needs of young middle-class and immigrant Canadians and its insistence on maintaining and strengthening what many saw as anti-immigration policies.Canada prided itself on its multicultural reputation so Canadians cried in protest to both the prime minister’s use of the appellation “Old Stock Canadians” during a nationally televised debate and the party’s fuss over whether women could wear a niqab during a citizenship ceremony. The campaign tension over immigration escalated in the face of the Syrian refugee crisis. The Conservative government had been criticized for having failed to do enough for the refugees and for having passed over certain religious groups in the selection process. The Conservative Party denied the claim and renewed its commitment to Syrian refugees promising to increase the number of refugees who would be accepted. However citing security concerns the government suspended the review process for an audit. Then just a few months later at the height of the election campaign the body of a toddler washed up on a beach in Turkey. With the world watching the child who came to symbolize all those who had lost their lives in their flee to safety was identified as Alan Kurdi the nephew of a Canadian woman who had been attempting to bring her brother and his family to Canada. Canadian bureaucracy had prevented the child’s family from seeking asylum in Canada.The death knell for the Conservative Party according to many was a “snitch line” introduced by Chris Alexander the immigration minister and Leitch. The Conservatives had earlier passed legislation that reinforced strict penalties on acts that were already crimes in Canada but might have been considered acceptable by some cultures such as polygamy and honour killings. During the election campaign Alexander and Leitch promised additional resources to back the legislation including a proposed tip line to be managed by Canada’s federal police specifically for reporting suspected violations of the new law.The Conservative Party was no longer focused on fiscal management and instead had self-identified as the defender of Canadian values. Alexander declared “We need to stand up for our values. . . . We need to do that in citizenship ceremonies. We need to do that to protect women and girls from forced marriage and other barbaric practices.” Leitch indicated the values involved “difficult issues that impact women.” Accusing the opposing parties of being preoccupied with political correctness Leitch announced “The Conservative government is not afraid to defend Canadian values.”The Conservative Party lost the election but it earned 32 per cent of the popular vote and increased the number of Conservative seats in Quebec where language and culture were two key issues. Clearly some Canadians had picked up and backed the party’s shifting position to protecting Canadian values.Leadership CampaignHarper announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on the night of the party’s election loss. Leitch known inside the party but still a political newcomer to the Canadian public was the first to announce her intent to run to replace Harper as leader of the party. Her announcement on April 6 2016 triggered the beginning of a long year of campaigning. Defending Canadian ValuesLeitch’s association with the snitch line seen by many to have been largely anti-Muslim dogged her every step of her leadership campaign. During a televised interview early in her campaign Leitch apologized for her role in introducing the proposal:I’ve had a lot of time to think about this since the [federal election] campaign took place and if I could go back in time which I can’t I would change things. . . . As minister of status of women I was focused on making sure that we eliminated violence against women and girls especially making sure we advocated for women’s rights. . . . We weren’t talking about race; we were talking about kids . . . but that message was completely overtaken and I regret that and I regret that it occurred and it shouldn’t have been done.Nonetheless and despite the controversy generated during the federal election Leitch’s platform picked up where the snitch line left off: proposing to screen newcomers to the country for “anti-Canadian values.” Leitch identified Canadian values as equality of opportunity hard work generosity freedom and tolerance—especially freedom and tolerance which according to Leitch were “at the core of what makes us uniquely Canadian. I’m proud of that value set” she said. “That value set built our country. [It’s] worth protecting [so we can] continue to be the beacon of hope around the globe the reason why individuals want to immigrate to our country.” Leitch canvassed Canadians with a questionnaire asking for their feedback on screening potential immigrants and rescinding citizenship of dual citizens who violated Canadian values. Her eager engagement of a proposal that was widely seen as just a variation of that for which she had apologized invited public scorn and furious criticism. High-profile Conservatives denounced the plan. Several of Leitch’s party colleagues including the party’s interim leader (who would normally remain neutral during a leadership campaign) distanced themselves from the proposal. The media had a heyday calling out every reference Leitch made to a practice from a Muslim nation—and there were many. Opinion columnists recalled previous failed attempts to guard Canadian values such as the residential school system that stripped Indigenous communities of their language and culture in favour of instilling Canadian values. Leitch emphasized that her intent was to protect Canadian women from those who “believe that women are property that they can be beaten and bought or sold.” She made it clear that she wanted to protect gay men and lesbians from those who believe they “should be stoned.” Opinion columnists responded by pointing to the inconsistencies with that philosophy within Canada: In our country a woman is murdered by her intimate partner every six days. Indigenous women are killed at a rate six times greater than non-indigenous women. About every two days a gay person becomes the victim of a hate crime. Until this year it was the official stance of Leitch’s own political party that gays and lesbians be denied the right to marry.A Conservative senator questioned why a former minister responsible for the status of women was not advocating for those living in poverty for greater access to daycare and for other policies that would address the already existing and pressing needs of women.Denying RacismOn January 29 2017 a gunman entered a mosque in Quebec City during evening prayers and opened fire killing six people and injuring 19. Quebec had a higher proportion of Muslim immigrants than any other province and the university near the targeted mosque attracted a high proportion of French-speaking students primarily from Muslim-dominant countries. The gunman was later identified to be a far-right white nationalist with anti-Muslim views.Politicians and columnists quickly identified the attack as racist making it clear they believed the attack was a result of fear-mongering and discriminatory politicking. Without naming her many blamed Leitch and her exclusivist policy of immigrant screening. One Conservative leadership candidate tweeted:This mosque attack is no accident: It’s a direct result of demagogues and wannabe demagogues playing to fears and prejudices . . . . This is Canada. This was an attack on real Canadian values enshrined in the Charter: religious freedom.Protestors hung a banner on Leitch’s campaign office that said “Hate puts us all at risk.” The banner also named the six murdered men and called for Leitch to resign. Leitch responded in an interview asserting as she had at every turn during her campaign that her belief that screening immigrants for anti-Canadian values was not intolerant racist or isolationist and that supporters of her campaign and the screening policy were not racists. She contended that Canada was “built on immigration” and her proposal was “about acceptance of a framework by which we agree to live as Canadians and the tolerance that goes with that because here in this country we are tolerant.” When challenged with the suggestion that Canadians celebrated tolerance as difference not conformity Leitch disagreed. She claimed that “without a common set of values a common identity we can’t have integration of newcomers.”Leitch continued her campaign accusing opponents of trivializing the issues or being “elites” out of touch with what the “average guy or gal on the street” wanted.Opposing ElitesCampaigning against the elite had become popular politics made infamous by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign of 2015/2016. Who the elite were was open for debate but in political rhetoric it was “the other.” Elite according to the dictionary referred to quality class and culture. It could also refer to a group of individuals with power and influence in a society usually as a result of wealth or privilege. According to analysts political anti-elite rhetoric engaged an even broader group by referring to those known for liberal ideas and “highbrow consumer preferences.”Leitch defined an elite as “an individual who is out of touch and seems to think they know better what how someone should think.” She described her anti-elite platform as an effort to address the disconnect between “hard-working” Canadians “the average guy or gal on the street” and their government. Reducing both taxation and regulations represented the traditional Conservative policy position which Leitch endorsed but added “I think our party can be bigger than that.” Referencing her listening skills and collaborative approach in her medical practice Leitch added “I think if [we] work together . . . we actually are doing better public service. It’s about listening first developing a plan together and then going out and implementing it in the best interests of Canadians.”Leitch defended her immigration screening program as a response to the interests of average Canadians. A Forum Research poll in September 2016 concluded that 67 per cent of Canadians were in favour of a program that screened immigrants for anti-Canadian values. The idea met with even higher approval among those supporting Leitch’s party. Leitch argued that her screening program also protected the needs of “Canadians [who] work hard”—the non-elites. The program was “different than having an elitist attitude of thinking you know best and you can tell people what to do” she said. When Trump won the U.S. presidential election Leitch again aligned herself with hard-working Canadians in an email message to supporters: “Tonight our American cousins threw out the elites and elected Donald Trump as their next president. It’s an exciting message and one that we need delivered in Canada as well. It’s the message I’m bringing with my campaign to be the next prime minister of Canada.”The media pressed Leitch questioning whether she wasn’t an elite herself. She had two advanced university degrees had been a professor and chair in the university system was a member of Parliament and had been a member of cabinet and was a specialist surgeon who had been chief of surgery. Leitch had especially insisted on her distinction as a physician being noted: despite tradition that eschewed professional titles on Parliament business cards Leitch insisted on the inclusion of “Dr.” on her cards and in her ministerial correspondence noting that she was maintaining a medical practice while serving as a member of Parliament. Nonetheless Leitch denied that she was an elite noting that she grew up in “small town” Fort McMurray Alberta and that her first home there had been a trailer. She worked hard she said and while she had an “elite education and great jobs” she was “not out of touch. I don’t think I know better than everyone” she added. On another occasion Leitch suggested that if she were an elite that status was countered by oppression: “You may call me an elite but look I dealt with the most challenging old boys’ club there is in the country. They’re called surgeons.”However at a campaign event organized for young Conservative Party members Leitch again brought into question whether she was an elite herself. When asked what her policy was on Aboriginal affairs Leitch informed her questioner that she would “abolish the Indian Act” noting that “every Canadian should be treated the same.” Leitch’s proposal was in effect to remove Aboriginal identities their legal status and their reserved land. When the questioner pointed this out Leitch retorted “Please understand that I do have 22 letters at the end of my name; I’m not an idiot.” When the questioner further challenged Leitch by asking whether she felt she had consulted widely enough to reach her conclusion Leitch broke from her commitment to work together and listen first replying: I think that the people of Canada and the Parliament of Canada is supreme. And when people decide that’s what we should do. And every Canadian should be equal. And if you think I need to go out and speak to Aboriginal Canadians across the country to ask them for their consent to change the law it won’t happen.Her retort garnered the day’s media attention with the criticism that an anti-elitist closed down conversation by referencing her own elite status. Leitch later tweeted an apology for miscounting the number of letters after her name noting that she had 18 letters not 22. “Each is an achievement I worked hard for” she added. Opposing the MediaLeitch had hired Nick Kouvalis to run her leadership campaign. Kouvalis was a controversial figure with a track record for getting unlikely candidates elected on populist campaigns. His prior notable victory was the election of Rob Ford as mayor of Toronto. Ford was an atypical bumbling politician from the suburbs whose term in office was characterized by his drug and alcohol abuse criminal acquaintances and disdain for the media. Leitch was a different candidate—highly educated respected in policy circles and free of criminal suspicions although awkward speaking in public and developing a reputation for being high-handed as a cabinet minister. What was similar to both was Kouvalis’s pitch: both campaigns advanced divisive populist positions and both dismissed the elite and cast the media as bullies. As Ford and more recently Trump had done Leitch cast herself in an adversarial relationship with the media. Leitch expressed her condemnation of the media in interviews regularly accusing the “media elite” of attacking her or misunderstanding her. She had also embedded her position on the media in her campaign platform: while many Conservatives proposed some form of funding cut for Canada’s national broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Leitch promised to completely dismantle the “left-wing media elite” broadcaster.Social MediaOn February 25 2017 Leitch advanced her campaign using social media posting a video to YouTube. Leitch spoke to the camera about her Canadian values policy for the full eight-and-a-half-minute clip. There were no visual aids or props beyond a desk and the Canadian flag. The video was marked by awkward prolonged pauses; wooden verbal pacing; and multiple sometimes extended glances off-screen. Leitch was known as an inelegant public speaker and it was thought she had received coaching so she could have been attempting to implement for the camera what she had learned. Regardless the result was posted and subject to extensive ridicule on social media. People edited the video in multiple ways for comic effect. The Canadian satire team from CBC Television’s comedy show 22 Minutes prepared two new sketches to add to their growing collection of Leitch sketches for television and YouTube fuelling the social media traffic. Within days the link to Leitch’s video had been displayed approximately a million times on Facebook; the video itself had been viewed by more than 500000 people. When speaking in Calgary several days later Leitch pointed to the viral interest in her video as evidence that her proposal on immigration was resonating with Canadians. Leitch applauded the ridicule identifying it as an opportunity to share her message “unfiltered” with the Canadian public. She dismissed concerns about the video’s production quality. When asked what she thought of the response to the video Leitch replied “That I should take acting lessons.”Ridicule on social media aside it was the staging of the video that generated attention. What was Leitch saying amid the prolonged pauses and glances off-screen? One columnist summed it up as “little more than saying she loves her country and its ‘shared values’ of generosity hard work freedom tolerance and equal opportunity.” Another columnist criticized the video as “clickbait . . . Trumpian politics of distraction: bizarre optics become the topic of discussion while content and substance are left unexamined or unchallenged.” A political commentator who had seen and made note of Leitch early in her political career was more charitable and remarked “She is or was in her earlier life a compassionate charitable charismatic personality who saved or repaired hundreds of young lives while educating other doctors on advanced surgical skills. That does not compute with the person in this week’s bizarre Facebook production.” Whatever Leitch intended in one day the video “set the Internet afire with chatter larks and memes.” A communication specialist pointed out that the video should be considered a success because media organizations were talking about it even if the talk was about the video’s failures. “It’s a hijacking of the news cycle” the specialist noted. “If I were still in journalism I’d be covering it too just like Trump.” Public ResponseLeitch may not have had much support within her own party or with the mainstream media but she did have public backing. Despite being comparatively new in her political career Leitch was the front-runner early in the leadership campaign. A poll of Conservative supporters had identified Leitch as the top choice for leader. At that point Leitch was also the top fundraiser in the leadership campaign. She was later surpassed by two other candidates in total funds raised but Leitch relied on fewer larger donors than the others; halfway through the race the average donation to the leading candidate was $137 and to Leitch $310. The bar for contributions was also high at a fundraising dinner held for Leitch by Bay Street lawyers: the tickets were $500 each. Ironically for an anti-elite platform Leitch’s campaign was attracting elite donors.The Forum Research poll from September 2016 found that Leitch’s proposal to screen immigrants appealed to two-thirds of the Canadians surveyed. A different company conducted another poll in January 2017 the same month that the gunman entered the mosque in Quebec City killing six people. The January 2017 poll indicated that again about two-thirds of Canadians polled would support screening immigrants for adherence to Canadian values. Some commentators also saw merit in Leitch’s idea of promulgating Canadian values and improving the immigration system but challenged the details of Leitch’s plan suggesting it was unworkable and that by focusing on immigrants alone the plan failed to address value clashes within the country.However by May 2017 as the Conservative Party prepared for the leadership election Leitch’s campaign had become nothing but polarizing. Her criticism of Torontonians for lack of community—she claimed that when she lived in Toronto she felt she could never reach out to a neighbour—elicited a social media response of good neighbour stories in Toronto posted under the hashtag #OurTO. Constituents in Leitch’s own riding of Simcoe-Grey had begun a campaign against Leitch. They posted signs and launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #NotMyMP. A poll in January 2017 indicated only 2 per cent of Canadians of all political affiliations wanted Leitch to be leader of the Conservative Party.Still Leitch entered the convention (and the election for leader) with more than 30000 members supporting her campaign—representing more than 20 per cent of the votes to be cast. The last poll to assess the ranking of candidates ranked her fifth in a list of 13 candidates. There was no question that Leitch was mentioned most often in the headlines even if most of the content below the headlines was critical. Canadians seemed to be repulsed by Trump’s leadership politics but Leitch claimed she would not have changed anything: “I don’t have any regrets because I think this has been a really—and is now becoming even more so—a thoughtful dialogue that Canadians are having.”ConclusionElection of the new leader of the Conservative Party took an extraordinary 13 rounds of balloting. The result was an upset: the front-runner on the previous 12 ballots was overtaken by Andrew Scheer a 38-year-old social-conservative whose political experience was as speaker of the House of Commons. He had not held any ministerial post. He was known as “the nice guy” who ran a race with a positive tone.Leitch’s 20 per cent showing before the election evaporated into a 7 per cent result on the first ballot and increased to only 7.95 per cent by the ninth ballot. The once well-regarded member of the political world initially considered to be a front-runner in the leadership race was eliminated with “an embarrassing seventh place showing after the first ballot.” She held a position in the election until the ninth round of voting at which point she was eliminated.How had Leitch’s reputation shifted from well-regarded physician and community leader to criticized political candidate? With the bid for leadership ended how could she rebuild her position and what strengths and experience would she need?Endnotes

Che Jianxin (CheChe) founder chairman and chief executive officer of Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. (RSM) was providing the finishing touches to a growth-oriented action plan he termed the “1001 Strategy.” RSM was the largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in China. CheChe was to unveil the plan at RSM’s upcoming 30th-anniversary celebrations. While preparing to host the event at the sprawling New International Expo Center in Shanghai CheChe was also weighing his options on implementing the strategy:The “1001 Strategy” is about two action plans: building 1000 brick-and-mortar shopping malls focused exclusively on home-centric business all over China and integrating them into a seamless ecosystem of our offerings and their end-users through a single overarching Internet platform. The goal in the short term is to convert RSM into a technology-driven enterprise that leverages data in real-time. In the long term the strategic intent is to make RSM an O2O [online to offline] leader in China. Our guiding post in the imminent journey will be to take all complexities out of the ecosystem. We want to make it easy as a result for our customers and vendors to transact with one another and for our employees to facilitate those transactions.RSM had for many years considered physical stores as its core medium for reaching customers in its shopping malls. In 2012 however it launched online shopping with what was known in China as O2O (online to offline) functions. Targeted at individual consumers O2O enabled shoppers to order and pay for goods online and receive delivery at their nearest store offline. In 2015 RSM launched an upgraded version of O2O at selected shopping malls. It was targeted at business customers who would use the same functionality. However in both formats the model encountered two specific problems: the online service was not always consistent with the offline service and the prices displayed online often differed from those displayed offline. As a result of his pursuit of an integrated and interactive model CheChe was now moving towards an omni-channel strategy as his “1001 Strategy” was generally known worldwide. An omni-channel strategy provided an environment wherein customers shopped through a variety of online and offline channels while also switching easily and seamlessly between them. It was challenging in the age of the Internet for a home improvement and furnishings company to operate in a standalone mode of either brick-and-mortar stores or e-commerce. Building a new Web 2.0 mode integrating the two channels was crucial to exploiting business synergies. CheChe was keen that RSM should be the first to do so in its industry in China in an effort to stay ahead of its competitors. RSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015 mobilizing ¥5.6 billion. In mid-2016 it announced an initial public offering (IPO) on the A-share market to mobilize an additional ¥3.95 billion. The company had set aside ¥1.45 billion toward the construction of an exhibition mall ¥600 million for the construction of a unified logistics service system and ¥500 million for upgrading projects to the O2O platform. To execute its strategies RSM had also recruited a team of 200 professionals from top Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft. Bin Li (Lao Li) the new president of the company was to orchestrate the projects. Lao Li had previously worked as executive president at Suning Commerce Group Co. Ltd. a large home appliances retailer in China where he had headed its O2O project.THE OMNI-CHANNEL STRATEGYHistorically retailers displayed their products in brick-and-mortar stores and walk-in customers could examine the products and buy them. The launch of the commercial Internet in 1995 led to numerous channels in addition to the physical channel. For example customers could log on to company websites to buy their products online. They could order through designated kiosks and call centres and more recently through social media and mobile devices. Also launched were online pure-play companies in categories that did not require customers to touch and feel the products before buying—for example books movies music and office supplies. Their end prices were lower because the online distribution costs were lower. Very soon two trends had become evident. One was “showrooming” wherein customers would visit a physical store to examine merchandise and then make their purchase online. The other trend was “webrooming” wherein customers would research products online but visit a physical store to make their purchase. The latter was particularly evident in such categories as shoes sports equipment and cosmetics. Omni-channel retailing was the result of the convergence of the two ongoing trends. In omni-channel retailing a customer could switch channels—buy online and pick up in-store or use a mobile device in-store to research a product or make a purchase or buy in-store and make a return online. The retailer also gained a 360-degree view of a customer’s purchases across all channels. Two retailer capabilities were thus crucial to the success of omni-channel retailing: enabling the customer to order online and pick up in-store; and enabling the customer to buy in-store and return online. In building those capabilities technology came into play. Online retailers were establishing what were known as “storefronts” in their attempts to build customer relationships engage in real-time market research and provide hands-on assistance to those wary of shopping online. These retailers saw a storefront not just as a store but also as a space where opinions reviews social media and technology combined to create “connections.” A storefront was particularly relevant for products where the customer experience associated with touch and feel were crucial to closing the sale. Said CheChe:The proposed omni-channel platform will allow our customers to view design scenes for their home interior ideas examine the products of their choice write reviews save and share images with family and friends and purchase those products online. It will provide our tenants with an additional point of contact with potential customers. It will enhance our customer stickiness and increase their conversion rate resulting in higher gross sales at our shopping malls. The first-hand consumer data collected through the omni-channel platform further improves our data pool for analysis of and research on customer tastes and industry trends providing us and our tenants with valuable market intelligence.The HOME IMPROVEMENT AND HOme FURNISHINGS INDUSTRY in chinaChina’s home improvement and home furnishings industry had recorded sales revenue of ¥3704.1 billion in 2015. It was forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent over the next five years.The growth was being driven by four factors. First urban per capita disposable incomes were rising in China—having increased at a CAGR of 10.3 per cent during the period 2010 to 2015—leading to individual families demanding larger and well-furnished living spaces. Second the rate of urbanization in China was rising steadily: at 771 million the urban population had exceeded the rural population of 603 million in 2015 leading to demand for home improvement and furnishings products as migrants from the interior settled into their new urban locations. Third with the gross floor area having increased and the refurbishing cycle of existing homes having decreased to six years both the furnishing of new homes and the refurbishing of existing homes were on the rise in China. Fourth notwithstanding the rate of growth of the industry China’s per capita expenditure on home improvement and furnishings was lower at US$425.50 in 2015 as compared with $1033.40 in the United States and $867.10 in the United Kingdom indicating potential for market expansion.The industry had two major segments: business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B). The B2C segment consisted of households and individuals purchasing home improvement and home furnishings products for their own use and represented 64.1 per cent of the market in 2015. The B2B segment consisted of centralized procurement by real estate developers and wholesale purchases by contractors and represented 35.9 per cent of the market.The home improvement and home furnishings industry consisted of three broad product categories: furniture home decoration products and light building materials. Furniture was the largest subsector by retail sales value. The demand for light building materials was tied to new home sales and was therefore cyclical.China had more than 14000 home improvement and home furnishings manufacturers. Some were located along coastal export hubs serving as offshore manufacturing centres for overseas firms. Among those manufacturers some focused on the domestic market and manufactured and marketed products under their own brands. The majority of the brands had limited recognition among consumers because home improvement and home furnishings products were typically low-frequency and low-quantity purchases. The companies themselves had limited marketing expertise and low marketing budgets. Said CheChe:Raw materials such as wood plastic and metal are available in China in plenty. But because they are also commoditized low cost is the basis of differentiation at that phase of the industry’s value chain [see Exhibit 1]. The most important element of the value chain is distribution at the downstream end. That is where the source of competitive advantage lies. That is where a lot of innovation has also been happening. Other key success factors include brand recognition the location of the shopping mall the product mix offered by tenants and the ability to understand customer needs. The quality of customer service is also a differentiator.  China’s home improvement and home furnishings industry was highly competitive. Prominent foreign players included B&Q plc (the United Kingdom’s largest home improvement and garden centre retailer) and IKEA (a Swedish company which had located eight of its 10 biggest stores in China). Prominent domestic players included Easy Home (a furniture retailer with approximately 50 stores that marketed high-quality brands from around the world) and Ayd Home Furnishings (one of the largest retail furniture mall operators). Many other local operators worked in the brick-and-mortar space. Major competitors in the e-commerce space included Jia.com (which sold home furnishings and decoration) and the home improvement retail businesses of Tmall.com (the country’s largest B2C platform) and JD.com (another online B2C company).An important characteristic of the home improvement and furnishings industry in China was that Chinese consumers preferred the do-it-for-me (DIFM) model over the do-it-yourself (DIY) model. The latter was typical of retailers in North America and Western Europe which offered semi-finished products and simple tools to go with them thereby enabling customers to complete the work in their own homes. Chinese preferred finished products that were ready to go with no additional work needed. Their preference was both historical (i.e. driven by the low availability of tradespeople low labour costs and the need for convenience) and cultural (i.e. the DIFM model carried a premium in the mindset of a Chinese consumer). Another characteristic was aggregation at the point of sale of diverse product categories from diverse manufacturers. The system had evolved in China because product manufacturers had found it expensive to develop their own distribution channels or invest heavily in their own brands. They pooled their resources to build a one-stop shop a mall in its own right to attract foot traffic and generate sales volumes that would justify large investments in marketing. As a result the mall rather than the company was the brand. Consumers recognized and trusted mall brands over individual product brands. This approach was in contrast to the North American and Western European trends of standalone firms such as Home Depot becoming brands in their own right and marketing diverse products under a single brand. A recent trend was that many home improvement and home furnishings retailers in China were moving beyond their traditional brick-and-mortar presence and launching online shopping; however the transition was creating tensions for many of these retailers. For a majority of the industry products physical factors such as touch were important at the point of sale. Retailers were struggling with providing the suitable customer experience.China’s CHANGING CONSUMER PROFILEChina was in a state of transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. The transition had been triggered by several government actions aimed at increasing national incomes. For example the Chinese government was progressively increasing the retirement pension coverage in urban areas (it had increased by 40 per cent from covering 250 million people to covering 350 million by 2015). It was also launching several financial-sector and industrial reforms which would lead to new job creation countrywide. The process of urbanization was also fuelling consumption-led growth. The consumption of upper-middle-class and rich families was estimated to account for 55 per cent of all consumption and to contribute 81 per cent to the total consumption increment by the end of 2016.An important trend in China’s consumer profile was the growing weightage of the “mainstream” consumer (defined as having an annual income of between $16000 and $34000) accompanied by a shrinking weightage of the “value consumer” (defined as having an annual income of between $6000 and $16000). The percentage of value consumers among the urban population was expected to decrease from 82 per cent in 2010 to 36 per cent in 2020 while during the same period the percentage of mainstream consumers was to increase from 6 per cent to 51 per cent of the urban population (see Exhibit 2).The mainstream consumers would comprise 167 million households or nearly 400 million people who would be the trendsetters for consumption. In terms of spending patterns three broad shifts had already become evident in China. First mainstream consumers would be more willing to spend on discretionary items (which included home improvement and home furnishings) as a result of those items becoming affordable to increasing numbers of consumers. Discretionary categories were forecast to show the strongest overall growth at 13.4 per cent between 2010 and 2020 (see Exhibit 3). Second mainstream consumers would be trading up to high-priced goods because they were aspirational about the way they lived and their perceived social standing. Third mainstream consumers would be among the most dedicated and sophisticated of online shoppers and would seek such shopping conveniences as easier price comparisons unique assortments of products freshness of goods quality of service and a social networking experience.China’s online retail market was already the world’s largest with e-commerce accounting for more than 13 per cent of the country’s total retail sales of consumer goods. In top-tier cities roughly 90 per cent of Internet users and 70 to 80 per cent of consumers as a whole were shopping online. As Chinese consumers enjoyed the options and transparency available online they were also becoming increasingly choosy often visiting four to five sites before reaching a purchase decision according to McKinsey research.Overview of RED STAR MACCALINERSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015. In mid-2016 it announced an IPO on the A-share market. By the end of 2016 RSM had opened its 200th mall. It had in fact announced in 2012 its goal of opening its 200th mall by 2020. The goal had been accomplished four years ahead of schedule. By June 20 2016 RSM had become China’s largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in terms of three metrics: number of shopping malls (181); operating area (11814928 square metres) and geographical coverage (129 cities). The company had generated revenue of ¥8.76 billion and net profits of ¥4.37 billion for the year ending December 2015 (see Exhibit 4). RSM had 17086 full-time employees. Its mall tenants had their own employees only at the sales counters.CheChe had founded the company in June 1986 with capital of ¥600. A high-school dropout CheChe had taken up carpentry with his apprentices in the city of Changzhou in the province of Jiangsu. By 1988 they had put together 500 sets of furniture and sold them for $80000 before setting up a furniture warehouse in 1992. It was a year later that CheChe thought of leasing a shopping mall focused on furniture. He rented a decrepit building divided it into small shops and rented them out to small individual furniture traders. The idea became so successful that he replicated the model to establish 20 similar malls in cities big and small in Jiangsu Province. Within a year he had progressed to purchasing freehold land in metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai on which he built malls. In 1998 CheChe switched to the franchise business model. Franchising required less capital on his part because the investment was shared with the franchisee. The model ensured faster geographical expansion nationwide. Said CheChe:In 2003 we launched garden-style malls which are environment-friendly and followed it up in 2005 with what we called “experience shopping” by combining the Chinese traditional store mode with the Western shopping mall mode. In 2008 we opened a new park-style home furnishings mall in Shanghai as a flagship store for home furniture brands from around the world. Built on an investment of $1 million and housing more than 2500 individual stores the mall has a monorail the first of its kind in the world spiralling its way up and down six floors ferrying shoppers. In 2014 we brought in the concept of “spatial art” wherein live theatre performances averaging 40 per annum are held at RSM malls for shoppers to enjoy free of cost.The business model of RSM was built on a combination of portfolio shopping malls and managed shopping malls. By June 30 2016 RSM had 56 portfolio shopping malls and 125 managed shopping malls (see Exhibit 5). The former were spread over a total area of 4457050 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 95.4 per cent. The latter were spread over a total area of 7357877 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 92.2 per cent. Portfolio shopping malls offered comprehensive services to their tenants including designated shopping space staff training sales and marketing daily operations and management and customer services. In exchange RSM received a fixed monthly rent and management fees. Managed shopping malls provided full-scale operating services to their business partners including site selection construction consultation design and decoration tenant sourcing and daily operation and management. In exchange RSM received fees during different stages as part of the contract management agreements.Most of the portfolio shopping malls were located in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities providing recurring and predictable operating income through rent and management fees. Most of the managed shopping malls were located in Tier 3 and other cities. They were asset-light. Said CheChe: Our hybrid expansion model is one of a kind in the Chinese home improvement and furnishing industry. It has created high barriers to entry. It is difficult to replicate. We have firmed up prime locations in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities for our portfolio shopping mall footprint. There is nothing left for our competitors present or potential to source. We also have deeply entrenched industry relationships supporting our managed shopping mall footprint. Our success with the hybrid model has led to a virtuous growth cycle for us our partners our tenants and our customers.RSM was shifting its focus from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where most of its malls were located to smaller county-level areas where urbanization was accelerating.RSM had expansion plans for the future in its core business of mall development. It had identified attractive market opportunities in the 2500 Tier 3 and other downstream cities across China. According to RSM each such city could support at least one branded shopping mall. RSM would have a first-mover advantage on the strength of its asset-light strategy which could generate rapid growth and high returns on capital without straining the company’s cash flow. It had already shortlisted the cities it planned to expand into in the next three years based on size population local market conditions and the disposable income of residents. The company was working on launching a “mini mall” format of 15000 to 30000 square metres in some of those cities.Since its inception RSM had positioned itself as a trading platform for the home improvement and home furnishings business. The imminent launch of the 1001 Strategy had led to the company being repositioned as a “home-centred” enterprise that was extending its reach to five interrelated industries: residential real estate home decoration home commodities (e.g. appliances vases and curtains) finance and service. The company was also entering into three non-core sectors aimed at reinforcing its core offerings. The first was consumer and vendor financing. Customers were in need of financing because of the high costs of home improvement and home furnishings products. Vendors were in need of financing to cover their rental expenses and procurement costs. RSM had taken the first step in this regard by establishing a consumer financing joint venture with Haier and Greentown in December 2014. It had applied for its own consumer financing licence. The second non-core section was logistics and fulfilment services. By leveraging the company’s existing nationwide footprint these services were meant to provide so-called “last-mile services” such as warehousing assembly and delivery. These services helped vendors manage their inventory better and reduce their costs of operations and enabled customers to track their shipments from the comfort of their homes. The services enabled RSM as a company to aggregate its orders and deliveries leading to better control over resources. It also enhanced the stickiness of manufacturers vendors and customers. Another potential area of related diversification was home design services which prevailed at the upstream end of the industry value chain. RSM was planning to identify talented home design professionals invest in their start-ups and endorse their business with its premier brand. In exchange the start-ups would agree to purchase 80 per cent of their home improvement and home furnishings products from RSM shopping malls. The move was aimed at promoting agile and nimble innovators within a large organization. In addition RSM was also expanding into bulk procurement services connecting home improvement and home furnishings suppliers and vendors with construction contractors and real estate developers. It was focusing on small- to mid-sized developers who did not have the scale to set up their own centralized procurement. RSM was the first in the home improvement and furnishings retail industry in China to implement a comprehensive enterprise resource planning system which was known internally as “Star Cloud.” It had been rolled out across the group at a cost of ¥80 million. Star Cloud was serving two objectives: it enhanced operational management particularly with regard to inventory and it helped commercialize the data collected through its system to better analyze consumer preferences. Said CheChe:The home improvement and furnishings industry is characterized by product offerings where physical touch remains a valued aspect of the purchase decision. Hence an online strategy will be successful only when combined with a physical mall network. The shopping experience is an integral part of our brick-and-mortar stores. Our online platform will be designed around the customer experience and our strategy is to leverage our shopping mall network to offer a synchronized shopping experience for our consumers.THE WAY FORWARDRSM’s 1001 Strategy had two components: building 1000 malls as physical infrastructure and building one Internet platform.On the physical front RSM had shown evidence that it could deliver. Having already built a total of 181 malls by mid-2016 RSM opened its 200th mall at the end of 2016. The company had then set a new target of building 1000 malls.The new malls would still be part of either portfolio shopping malls or managed shopping malls. They would be designed to upgrade from home malls to family malls permeating not only Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities but also key counties from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The new malls would be integrated into the local business community infrastructure and the public facilities serving local residents and consumers.On the digital front RSM had already designed a mobile application (app) for its malls in Shanghai and a peer-to-peer platform for furniture buyers commercial tenants and factories partnered with the malls. The way ahead would involve replicating these offerings enterprise-wide. Lao Li the company’s president had outlined three 100-day plans for implementing the omni-channel strategy: launch the fundamental platform in the first 100 days; launch the full chain product in the second 100 days; and open for sharing and collaboration in the third 100 days. In deploying the digital medium Lao Li needed to manage the tension between the traditional brick-and-mortar model and the e-commerce model.Executing the 1001 Strategy would also be an opportunity for RSM to take a fresh look at determining its core competitiveness. Lao Li saw the emerging competitive advantage in terms of three components: RSM as a brand RSM as a repository of omni-channel talent and RSM as a digital enterprise. Lao Li was keen that the user interface be easy and convenient to handle and that all the complexity should be limited to the back end. Simplicity should be the hallmark of the 1001 Strategy. He was keen on having no more than four layers of reporting relationships (i.e. President → Person in charge of the business unit → Person in charge of department → Common employee). This reporting structure was in contrast to the approximately 17 to 18 layers prevalent in traditional enterprises of the size of RSM.

In 2016 the company had been successfully established in eight countries. It was clear that Costco’s next steps would have to build upon this momentum and that the company would have to expand operations. For any retailer selecting new countries and an appropriate entry mode was of utmost importance as different markets presented different challenges and considerations. Before the company could create an expansion plan it was necessary to analyze the entry methods it had used in its prior expansions to understand the factors that had contributed to each success. What would be the best method for entry based on existing barriers in terms of culture and operational constraints?Costco Wholesale CorporationHeadquartered in Issaquah Washington Costco was the largest membership warehouse club in the United States with 481 warehouses in 43 states and Puerto Rico. Costco had more than 80 million members and employed more than 200000 full- and part-time employees around the world. The company sold brand name products at low prices and high volumes and offered ancillary service departments such as gas stations pharmacies food courts optical centres one-hour photo services hearing centres and travel services at its warehouse locations. Costco also offered its own private label brand Kirkland Signature at its warehouses. Some of Costco’s global competitors were Walmart Inc. (Walmart); Walmart’s membership club Sam’s West Inc. (Sam’s Club); Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon); Metro Inc. (Metro); Carrefour Group (Carrefour); the Home Depot Inc. (Home Depot); and Best Buy Co. Inc. (Best Buy).Global Expansion to DateCostco’s 2014 sales totalled US$112.6 billion of which $32.1 billion was from international operations. That year the company’s international operating income saw more growth than Costco’s total operating income (see Exhibit 2). In the five-year period ending in 2014 sales from the company’s international branches showed a significant increase compared to its U.S. branches (see Exhibit 3).Costco’s international expansion began with its entry into Canada in 1985; by October 2015 Costco had established 206 warehouses in eight countries outside the United States as well as online storefronts in Canada the United Kingdom Mexico and China. Several other retailers such as Carrefour Walmart and Tesco PLC (Tesco) boasted a larger global presence than Costco but the success the company had managed to achieve in all eight of the international markets it had entered was noteworthy (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Costco employed a variety of global expansion strategies in each of the eight markets as detailed below.CanadaCostco entered Canada in 1985 opening a company-owned warehouse in Burnaby British Columbia. Costco’s major competitor from the United States Price Club opened its first warehouse in Montreal in 1986 after reaching a joint venture agreement with Steinberg Inc. a grocery chain in the French-speaking province of Quebec in Eastern Canada. Price Club and Costco merged in 1993. By 2015 Costco had expanded its operations to 90 locations across nine provinces in Canada.Costco initiated a dual strategy in Canada that was an extension of the company’s strategy in the United States. Firstly Costco mimicked its U.S. growth strategy by expanding geographically into the largest metropolitan areas on the country’s east and west coasts. Secondly owing to cultural similarities Costco stocked its Canadian warehouses with products that closely resembled the product selection available in its American warehouses. Fascinated by this American-style shopping experience Canadian consumers were increasingly drawn to Costco and the company expanded to 24 Canadian warehouses (including Price Club warehouses). In 1992 Costco and Price Club had 12 warehouses each in Canada.A growth in consumer preference towards lower priced higher quality products brought increased competition. Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws) the country’s largest supermarket retailer opened its first membership warehouse the Real Canadian Wholesale Club in 1991; this was soon followed by Walmart which entered the market in 1994. Canada’s appeal as a key international base increased after the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) in 1987 which eliminated many trade barriers between the two countries. After the agreement came into effect several retail chains including Costco increased their presence in Canada growing competition in the Canadian retail industry. This competition resulted in lower prices to the benefit of Canadian consumers. Given Canadian consumers’ desire to save money Costco’s commitment to low prices was a convincing argument; consumers invested in the company’s memberships and maintained their loyalty year after year. According to Costco’s 2014 annual report the membership renewal rate in Canada was 91 per cent on par with its American rate during the same period.MexicoCostco (Price Club) entered Mexico in 1992 through a joint venture (JV) with one of the largest Mexican supermarket chains Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB de CV (CCM). In 2012 Costco purchased CCM’s stake in the JV and as of October 2015 the company owned and operated 36 stores in 18 Mexican states. Mexico had a history of protectionist trade policies that limited the amount of cross-border trade with U.S. companies. As negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) progressed major retailers in Mexico started approaching U.S. retailers about possible partnerships. NAFTA was signed by Canada Mexico and the United States to remove trade barriers among the three countries. The agreement came into effect in 1994. Attracted by Mexico’s large urbanizing population and a growing middle class large U.S. retailers such as Costco and Walmart capitalized on the opportunity to establish a presence in Mexico. In Mexico Costco was in direct competition with Sam’s Club which had aggressively expanded to 22 locations in the three years following its entry in 1991. Costco’s strategy was to open its warehouses in locations where Sam’s Club had no presence and win memberships through a first-to-market advantage. These shoppers were enticed by Costco’s guaranteed lower prices which led to an increase in the volume of purchases they made during each visit. These consumers associated foreign-made items with positive attributes such as better quality and reliability displaying a strong preference for them over locally made counterparts. This encouraged Costco to adapt its offerings and import non-food items. As the prices of imported goods dropped following NAFTA Costco’s warehouses became a principal source of American-made products.United KingdomCostco entered the United Kingdom in 1993 opening its first store in Essex after reaching a JV agreement with French multinational retailer Carrefour. Price Club also entered the market by forming a JV with a privately-owned retailer Littlewoods Organisation PLC in 2000; Littlewoods’s stake was sold to Costco. In 2003 Costco purchased Carrefour’s stake in the JV and by 2015 Costco operated 27 locations across the United Kingdom. As a wholesaler Costco’s entry into the United Kingdom an industrialized and developed nation with wealthy citizens gave the company significant leverage to operate at a cost base lower than its local rivals. As it had in other countries Costco operated its U.K. stores as strictly no-frills-style warehouses that contained only essentials and avoided facilities such as dressing rooms which wasted floor space. Costco did not invest in a paid advertising strategy; however the local media extensively publicized several aspects of the company such as its lower-than-average markup of 11 per cent building a positive image of the company for consumers. Such publicity also attracted the attention of local retailers who began slashing prices in anticipation of a price war. Conventional supermarket markups ranged from 21 to 40 per cent making the British some of the highest-paying consumers in the Western hemisphere. However the recession of 1991 resulted in a substantial reduction in consumer confidence which in turn made the UK consumers more price conscious. This was the perfect opportunity for Costco to lure UK shoppers by its low price guarantees for bulk purchases.Costco faced strong resistance during its entry into the United Kingdom. The three big local retailers—Tesco J. Sainsbury PLC (Sainsbury’s) and Argyll Group PLC—filed a lawsuit that questioned Costco’s wholesaler status and its qualification for less stringent planning controls which included access to commercial and industrial land at lower cost than the higher priced land allocated for retailers. Costco’s warehouse-style set-up and bulk product supply at discounted prices convinced the High Court to regard Costco as non-retail and to clear Costco to open its first store in the country.South KoreaIn 1994 Costco granted a licence to Shinsegae Department Store (Shinsegae) a major South Korean retailer to open and operate a warehouse club store in Seoul. This became Costco’s first store in Asia. In 1998 Costco purchased the warehouses from Shinsegae and subsequently formed a 94 per cent JV with the same partner. By 2015 the company had expanded to 12 locations in South Korea. Costco introduced local shoppers to the lower price higher quality value model supplying a limited range of products in bigger quantities. South Korea’s relatively large households favoured Costco’s wholesale approach over the prevailing harin (discount) store format. Costco granted an exclusive licence to Shinsegae to run daily warehouse operations and the warehouse adapted products to the tastes and preferences of affluent and well-educated shoppers who valued product quality products with health benefits and customer service. This localization meant that Costco was more successful in this market than most other foreign retailers. In 2014 Fortune reported that Costco’s warehouse in Seoul had recorded the highest sales of any Costco worldwide and had earned the title of “busiest Costco in the world.”Between the early 1960s and the late 1990s South Korea had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Foreign retailers however were largely barred from this growing market—primarily because of government controls over land development zoning regulations and restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI). Liberalization attempts during the 1990s led to the entry into the South Korean market of foreign retailers such as Walmart Carrefour and Tesco but the government’s continued preferential treatment of local retailers proved costly for foreign players. Walmart and Carrefour exited South Korea in 2006. Tesco announced its departure from the market in September 2015.The South Korean government implemented several policies to protect the interests of smaller retailers in the country: these included mandatory store closures on alternating Sundays restrictions on store operating hours and zoning restrictions that affected big box retailers. Although other local retailers such as E-Mart and Lotte Mart had successfully won court injunctions against the Sunday closures Costco suffered adverse media criticism store boycotts and fines when it kept its stores open on Sundays.TaiwanCostco entered Taiwan via a JV with the nation’s largest department store chain President Group opening its first store in Kaohsiung in 1997. By 2015 Costco had expanded to 11 locations in the country.Costco positioned itself as an American retailer with a distinct fondness for local tastes. The company offered products such as Kirkland brand beef steak cut into thinner slices to meet the buying preferences of local shoppers who used beef steak in hot pot a staple Taiwanese dish. Such localization strategies enabled Costco to compete against traditional wet markets. Wet markets sold fish meat fruits and vegetables usually in the early mornings. Costco capitalized on its foreign retailer image and imported about 35 per cent of its products which attracted the country’s younger population. After Taiwan liberalized foreign investment in 1986 and became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 several international retailers entered the Taiwanese retail market. The retail market became highly competitive and this led some foreign retailers to exit; Makro exited the market in 2003. In 2005 Carrefour took over Tesco’s stores in Taiwan after both companies agreed to an asset swap agreement. Even with Costco’s best efforts the company registered losses during its first five years of operation in Taiwan.Costco’s return policy was a major hit with Taiwanese shoppers. Unlike local retailers Costco encouraged its shoppers to return any items that they were not happy with; even a half-eaten watermelon could be returned if it was not sweet. This lenient return policy created free word-of-mouth advertising that helped the company recruit new customers. More importantly the loyalty of existing customers increased as illustrated by a sharp rise in customer retention rates from 45 per cent in 1998 to more than 80 per cent in 2010. JapanCostco established its first warehouse in Japan in 1999; the wholly owned subsidiary was in Hisayama. By 2015 the company had expanded to 24 locations in Japan. Few thought that Costco would be successful in Japan where the average house was only 60 per cent of the size of a house in the United States and rooms averaged a 40 per cent higher occupancy rate. This raised concerns that Japanese houses lacked sufficient storage space for the bulk merchandise Costco planned to supply. Japanese customers tended to favour quality over price. General merchandise stores and supermarkets were easily accessible within short distances so Japanese customers did not expect to travel long distances to a Costco warehouse for frequent purchases. Considering these concerns the Japanese people questioned the suitability of the warehouse club format to Japan.In Japan Costco targeted the wealthy segment of the population people who had access to private transportation and made less frequent shopping trips. Costco enticed these consumers by stocking Japanese staples—several varieties of fish green tea and seaweed—as well as imported goods and brand name merchandise that resonated with brand-loyal quality-conscious consumers. Costco also targeted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that purchased in bulk for resale. Several SMEs preferred Costco’s approach to low pricing over the quantity-based discounts that other Japanese wholesalers offered. By offering excellent customer service and a generous return and refund policy Costco focused on developing trust with these SMEs to ensure their continued loyalty. Such measures ensured that Costco continued to grow in the Japanese market while other international retailers had to exit the country. Carrefour and Tesco announced their exit from the market in 2005 and 2012 respectively.Australia Costco’s first company-owned warehouse store in Australia opened in 2009 in Docklands a suburb of Melbourne. By 2015 the company had expanded its operations to 8 locations in the country.Costco effectively recognized several attributes that were important to Australian consumer groups. It offered multiple payment options including cash electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) and credit cards. In order to keep costs down Costco strictly restricted payment options available to its customers in other countries. As Australian consumers favoured Australian-made products over imports Costco strategically included several local products in its offerings. This openness and flexibility provided Costco with an early advantage in penetrating the duopoly that had previously characterized the Australian food retail market. However for the five-year period ending in 2014 Costco accumulated losses of $44.5 million in Australia. Several factors were involved. Restrictive Australian planning and zoning laws delayed the approval and building of Costco’s first store. Next local regulations prohibited Costco from providing some of its typical services such as insurance and pharmacy. Lastly Costco suffered a major setback with coupon promotions: Australian shoppers did not understand or appreciate coupons and so Costco was forced to roll back most of its major coupon offers.SpainIn May 2014 Costco’s first wholly owned warehouse opened in Spain in the city of Seville. The company opened its second warehouse in the capital city of Madrid in October 2015.Costco’s entry into Spain was well received by the local population thanks to extensive local media coverage of the company’s anticipated product offerings unique business style and employee welfare schemes. Costco also gained the attention of suppliers at both local and national levels who were eager to forge business links with the warehouse giant. While it met its domestic product needs in Spain Costco also planned to use these suppliers to supply products to its other locations worldwide. Costco’s entry into Spain occurred during a period of economic uncertainty. Spain’s economic recovery from the recession of 2008 began in late 2013. However as regional economic problems continued in the European Union Spain’s high unemployment rate posed a substantial threat to Spain’s recovery. In mid-2015 Spain’s unemployment rate was 22.4 per cent compared to the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent. If disposable income remained low the purchasing power of Spanish shoppers would be hindered and they would not approach bulk wholesale purchasing with the same enthusiasm as shoppers in other markets. Furthermore Spain’s old-age dependency ratio was projected to hit 48.7 per cent by 2035. As the country’s fertility rate was also considered low Costco would have to adapt its offerings to grow profitably in this market.Costco’s Global Strategy: Key Success FactorsIncreasing Member Recruitment and RetentionCostco was a pioneer in the membership warehouse club model which required customers to purchase yearly memberships to shop at warehouses. Members benefited from Costco’s lower prices and an increase in customer savings offset the cost of the membership fees. Costco offered two basic membership types: Gold Star memberships for individuals and Business memberships for businesses. For an additional fee each of these memberships could be upgraded to the Executive level which guaranteed shoppers 2 per cent cashback on valid purchases made throughout the year. Although Walmart’s Sam’s Club also offered cashback to its customers it set a yearly cap of $500 per customer. Costco’s no-cap cashback presented a convincing incentive for frequent shoppers to purchase Costco memberships. Moreover Costco allowed its customers to cancel memberships at any time during the year and offered reimbursements of the unused portion of the membership fee. This hassle-free membership model allowed Costco to record a high membership compound annual growth rate of 7.1 per cent in the five years from 2010 to 2015. Complementing the high membership renewal rate in the United States and Canada Costco’s international operations saw a significant 88 per cent increase in its membership renewal rate in 2015. As revenues from membership fees contributed more than 75 per cent of Costco’s gross profit recruiting and retaining members was a key focus.Leveraging the Kirkland Signature BrandKirkland Signature was Costco’s in-house brand introduced to offer premium quality products at prices that were 10–20 per cent lower than those of other national brands. In 2014 Kirkland Signature products contributed 25 per cent of Costco’s sales a significantly higher penetration rate than other warehouse club house brands (18.1 per cent). Without the need to invest in promotional activities Costco was able to strengthen the Kirkland Signature brand by introducing several new products across a broad range of categories every year. As of 2014 Costco typically earned a profit margin of 15 per cent on its in-house brand products compared to 7–10 per cent for other brands. Costco began to use third party e-commerce channels such as Google Express and InstaCart seeking to make Kirkland Signature products available to a larger consumer base. Limiting the Range of Products to Enable Operational ExcellenceCostco’s primary business model was built around the strategy of stocking a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) promoting sales of a limited range of products. A typical Costco warehouse stocked approximately 3700 SKUs less than many other big box retailers. This strategy offered Costco several advantages. First it allowed Costco to assign a greater area of the warehouse to each employee which established higher productivity rates and increased overall profitability. Second it allowed Costco to focus on a smaller number of suppliers which resulted in lower transaction costs. Costco’s transaction cost savings came from lower negotiation costs and reduced policing and enforcement costs. Lastly it meant that Costco had a higher inventory turnover than its competitors. In August 2015 Costco’s inventory turnover ratio was 11.64. Costco was able to sell inventory to its customers before having to pay its suppliers for those products which significantly reduced the level of working capital it needed to maintain. Applying a No-Frills Wholesaling ApproachTypically retailers set aside a sizeable portion of their budgets for marketing store layout and decor. Costco minimized its operating costs through its warehouse store format distribution system and marketing. Costco’s warehouses had a minimalist design with bare cement floors and high sparse ceilings. Floor plans were designed for economy and efficiency ease of product handling and inventory control; and products were displayed on industrial type pallets to facilitate stacking and stocking. To reduce electricity costs Costco installed many skylights sensibly placed throughout the store to utilize natural light. Costco avoided intermediaries in distribution; it purchased its merchandise directly from manufacturers. Goods were typically delivered to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to its warehouses which resulted in significant cost savings. Although the company had direct purchasing relationships with many national brand name merchandisers it did not rely extensively on any one supplier as it followed a supplier diversification strategy.Costco did not employ public relations staff. The company used free word-of-mouth advertising to promote its value proposition. The company’s promotional materials typically took the form of coupons for existing members and direct emails to potential new members and stayed away from traditional marketing methods to keep costs low.Meeting Local Consumers’ Needs and WantsCostco adapted well to each country it entered. The success or failure of its entry ultimately depended on understanding the needs and wants of customers in each given market. In countries such as Taiwan where there was high retail competition Costco partnered with a strong local retailer to gain its first foothold in the market. This allowed Costco to study the unique tastes and preferences of Taiwanese customers and then adapt its product offerings to meet the demands of this local consumer base. Costco succeeded in keeping its customers happy making it easy to retain them year after year. Its “no questions asked” return policy allowed Costco to stand out. Implementing Human Resources Policies that Foster Employee RetentionEmployee retention was widely recognized as a major problem in the global retail industry. Costco’s employee turnover rates however painted a more positive picture. The company’s average turnover was generally low around 17 per cent and this rate dramatically dropped to just 6 per cent for employees who had completed the first year of their tenure at the company. This was a direct result of Costco’s generous human resources policies. In 2006 Costco paid an average hourly wage of $17.00—72 per cent higher than the wages offered by its rival Sam’s Club in the United States. These wages were also supplemented by generous benefits: 82 per cent of Costco’s employees were covered by health insurance and 91 per cent were covered by retirement plans. The company’s contributions towards these benefits were also typically higher than those of its rivals. As a result Costco’s employees were more engaged in the workplace and this contributed to increased employee loyalty job performance and productivity and to better customer service.Key Issues and Strategic OptionsIncreasing the Share of Total Revenue from International Operations Despite international success Costco’s share of revenues from operations outside of its home country continued to be insignificant. In 2014 just 29 per cent of the company’s net sales came from its international operations. A further cause for concern was that Canadian operations contributed 16 per cent of Costco’s total revenue. The United States and Canada therefore continued to be dominant markets for Costco. In comparison Carrefour the French multinational retailer earned 65 per cent of its revenue in 2014 from its international locations which spanned 32 countries through Latin America Asia and Europe. Costco’s dependence on its U.S. and Canadian markets made it vulnerable to regional uncertainty and could significantly affect the company’s revenue growth.Some of Costco’s challenges included increased competition and changing government regulations in international markets. Mature markets such as Japan presented intense competition and a lack of growth opportunities for Costco. In Japan the shifting preferences and lifestyles of consumers led to an increased preference for convenience stores over department stores and supermarkets. As a result Costco also competed with convenience store chains such as 7-Eleven Lawson and Family Mart. Furthermore political and legal changes in international markets had generally been unpredictable. This was exemplified by the South Korean government’s laws protecting small family-owned shops at the expense of international big box retailers; non-compliance posed reputational as well as monetary risks. Finding Entering and Expanding into New Markets with the Intention of Diversifying RiskAccording to the AT Kearney 2015 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) China was ranked as the best country for retail growth in 2014. Despite slower overall growth in 2014 the country’s retail sector continued to show rapid growth at 11.6 per cent. Forecasts put China’s retail sector on track to grow to $8 trillion by 2022 encouraging major multinational retailers to expand into the country. Although Costco successfully entered the Chinese market in late 2014 and had opened an online store its presence in the country was only minor. Furthermore stiff competition from both local and international retailers suggested it would be risky to pursue aggressive expansion in China due to a loss of significant revenue and income-earning potential.Mexico was the only other country on the GRDI list where Costco had established a presence. The Mexican retail sector showed a relatively lacklustre growth rate of 2.4 per cent in 2014. Without organic growth the existing players in the industry sought ways to grow their revenue through diversification. Although Costco had a strong presence in Mexico with 36 stores further expansion could be difficult due to market saturation.The GRDI list included 28 other countries with significant retail sales growth potential but Costco was unfortunately absent from these markets. These countries presented both opportunities and challenges for Costco to explore new markets and identify the most attractive options for its next market entry.Increasing Investments in Multi-channel Retailing to Attract Tech-Savvy Consumers In the last two decades the retail sector had witnessed several major technological innovations one of the most significant of which was multi-channel or omni-channel retailing—providing customers with the convenience of shopping through a variety of channels: physical stores social media and websites. Several big box retailers including Walmart had invested heavily to prepare for multi- or omni-channel retailing. Costco on the other hand had lagged. For example South Korea had the highest smart phone penetration in the world: more than two-thirds of the population owned a device and consumers increasingly used their mobile phones to purchase products online. Although the company had an online presence in five countries (the United States Canada Mexico the United Kingdom and China) its online activities were separate from its warehouse operations.What was Next for Costco?With a global presence established in eight distinct markets how could Costco establish itself as a leading transnational retailer? Costco had managed to build upon successes and grow despite turbulent economic conditions. The company had successfully positioned itself as a market leader broken stereotypes and followed unconventional business strategies. As the global retail industry experienced intensified competition top global retailers faced challenges to operate and expand. Although Costco had climbed the global retailer ranking the company faced challenges and uncertainties.In 2017 Costco had selected specific modes of entry for each of its expansions. Walmart still held the top international retailer position and future countries of interest included France Iceland China and India. Costco could not afford to be viewed as hesitant on the international stage and faced some key questions for the future: How could Costco leverage its experiences and continue its expansion successfully? What would be the best method for entry based on existing barriers and culture and operational constraints in these countries? Based upon Costco’s business model and the potential for a large consumer base should Costco enter densely populated Asian countries such as China and India?Exhibit 1: Top 10 Global Retailers Worldwide 2013Source: Deloitte Global Powers of Retailing 2015: Embracing Innovation 2015 accessed July 11 2018 www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Consumer-Business/gx-cb-global-powers-of-retailing-2016.pdf.Exhibit 2: Costco Operating Income and Warehouse CountSource: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed December 3 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 3: Costco Sales RevenueSource: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed December 3 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 4: Costco’s Market Entry Mode and Current Level of Ownership by CountryNote: JV = joint venture.Source: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Reports 1998–2014 accessed May 2 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 5: Costco Wholesale Corporation 2015 Key Facts Note: Warehouse numbers were as of December 31 2015.Source: Created by case authors based on data from Costco Wholesale Corporation Annual Report 2015 accessed May 2 2018 http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&p=irol-reportsannual.Endnotes

The summit had been an eclectic assembly of technology (tech) elites and the initiative envisaged digital solutions for smooth land registration adding transparency accountability and good governance at every stage of the process. There were numerous competitive challenges for Surana and Jain from various tech giants. This was the first time they felt anxious about their proposal which was the result of a year of research and various experiments endeavouring to provide excellent solutions to current processes by using blockchain. Surana and Jain were able to develop a proof of concept for land records on a private blockchain in a cloud-based environment. Their live demonstration of the proposal was well received by the conference attendees. The challenge was whether the government of Andhra Pradesh would consider the solution and engage on a long-term basis with the company for blockchain solutions in land registrations. The government was critically analyzing the challenges and outcomes of implementing the proposed solutions. Would Snapper�s journey be acknowledged in the annals of the country�s digital revolution?SNAPPER FUTURE TECH private limitedPromoted by Surana Jain and Avnish Gupta Snapper was incorporated as a private limited company in 2017 with its registered office in Pune Maharashtra. In 2017 the magazine CIO Review assessed it as �one of the most promising start-ups in blockchain technology� for having significantly contributed to the implementation of blockchain since 2016. Snapper deployed expertise from diverse industries and created a niche in delivering solutions that were easy to integrate with minimal disruption to existing systems. It thereby delivered high-performance efficient scalable and secured solutions. The company built numerous products and solutions across various industries such as insurance health care and supply chain and had forayed into the execution of e-governance (see Exhibit 1).The company�s ethos was centred on a strong conviction about blockchain enforcement; it considered blockchain to be as competitive and innovative as the Internet itself. One underlying premise of commercial transactions was the sanctity of agreements made by the parties in mutual trust and good faith. These voluntary obligations were actionable promises or sets of promises. The proposed technology brought participating parties into secured settings through blockchain. The company�s solutions were driven towards contributing to a secure transparent efficient and automated future through futuristic technologies embedded in the contracts. BACKGROUNDSituated in the southeast of India Andhra Pradesh was the eighth largest of India�s 29 states and had the second-longest coastline in the country. As of the 2011�2012 census the state had a literacy rate of 67.35 per cent and an urban population of 29.47 per cent out of a total population of 9.67 million. In 2017 the total land under non-agricultural use was 2.03 million hectares. From 2012 to 2017 the state registered a growth rate of 13.33 per cent against 7.1 per cent of the national gross domestic product.The state had worked toward reconstruction to create an information technology-enabled state-of-the-art infrastructure. In furtherance of this the state government framed three different policies on information technology electronics and innovation and start-ups. The main objectives and thrust of these policies were to create renewed infrastructure incentives and human resource development and to nurture good governance. The state government of Andhra Pradesh also gave the utmost attention to generating positive investor sentiments by creating high-quality infrastructure and enabling a business environment through the ease of doing business. In 2016 it ranked first in the �Ease of Doing Business Rankings� in India which led to further investments in technological advancement and reforms in both the public and the private sector. Of the 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam (popularly called �Vizag�) the second-largest city in the state with an area of 550 square kilometres was a popular site for hosting business conferences. Vizag was fondly called the �Jewel of the East Coast� for its location on the eastern shore of India nestled among the hills of the Eastern Ghats and facing the Bay of Bengal to the east. In October 2017 the government of India�s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology hosted the Blockchain Business Conference in Vizag. The invitees included blockchain experts start-ups corporations leading executives regulators entrepreneurs policy-makers and academics from around the world. The agenda was aimed at blockchain technology its application and its impact on the financial services industry. The conference offered one-of-a-kind opportunities for the invitees to demonstrate innovations led by blockchain technology and its imperative role in bridging gaps among current processes and prominent contemporary global technological advancements. According to Nara Lokesh cabinet minister of information technology in Andhra Pradesh��In recent years we have seen new business models in different sectors questioning the established way of doing businesses. Blockchain technology is the disruptive platform that will provide a new model of doing business across the verticals.� Representatives from the departments of banking and insurance trade finance capacity building and research and development supply chain logistics ports and logistics governance and regulations participated in invited sessions and focus group discussions and exchanged views on applications and proofs of concept. The conference provided various opportunities such as round tables start-up challenges start-up showcases investor connections customer connections and student workshops for participants so that they might understand implement and prototype different problem-solving methods and techniques using this disruptive technology.EXISTING LAND REGISTRATION PROCESS IN INDIAThe land record data and its maintenance were administered by the National Informatics Centre. The executive authority was the registrar an official of the state government who supervised and controlled all land registration processes. These processes relied completely on the assumption that the seller and buyer had a fiduciary relationship (i.e. a relationship of good faith and trust). All negotiations between the participating parties on the area of land being offered for sale the price per square unit of area and the date of transaction/ownership transfer were agreed upon privately. Thereafter if a consensus was reached on all terms and conditions the participating parties entered into an agreement to sell. The agreement matured into a sale when the aspiring buyer registered him/herself and raised a �request of purchase� on the government online portal for land purchases and sales. He or she also had to pay the fiscal stamp duties and registry fees online through either e-stamping or obtaining a physical paper to be stamped. Once the formalities and duty payments were concluded the aspiring buyer and seller had to schedule an appointment for their visit together at the sub-registrar office for physical verification biometric verification and photographic recording of the data. Following the verifications and documentation a token for their appointment with the registrar was generated. At the registrar�s office also called the tehsil office another round of manual verification in the presence of a minimum of two witnesses was executed. Finally the ownership transfer certificate was generated (see Exhibit 2). There were civic departments such as development authorities municipal corporations the electricity department and the water supply department that functioned daily to facilitate development infrastructure and civil processes. Once ownership was transferred to the new owner the buyer was required to file applications with all these departments separately and proceed to transfer the title in their records. This required further documentation and verification. GAPS IN THE LAND REGISTRATION PROCESS The land registry process required the participation of land registry executives who were vested with discretionary powers to decide on whether titles could be transferred. At times these interventions led to malpractice abuse of power corruption and inefficiency in the system. Land transactions assumed that all averments made by the participating parties were done in good faith and trust. Buyers checked the sellers� ownership claims through a process of due diligence. This was generally an expensive exercise as lawyers had to verify the documents by submitting applications in the registrar�s office for authentication of land record data. The onus was on the buyer to ensure that the seller�s title was valid. Similarly third parties such as banks non-banking financial institutions and retail lenders also faced similar issues of due diligence when approving loans for a property. Banks also engaged legal advisors and scrutinizers to check the authenticity and validity of land ownership. The cost and effort to ensure a perfect bona fide financial transaction was high. Furthermore under the current system land records could not be retrieved in the case of natural calamities. The land registry processes were paper-based and fragmented making transactions costly and inefficient and requiring double registration that was vulnerable to tampering. There was no synchronization of the land registry processes among the various departments.As per reports on fraud in India real estate and infrastructure was the sector perceived as most vulnerable to fraud and losses in India after financial services. The development of a robust leak-proof and authentic process was required�a system that could lead to accountability auditability availability and integrity of the data it recorded.BLOCKCHAINA blockchain was an electronic ledger that was distributed over a business network to facilitate the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets. The transactions and assets in this tech chain could range widely�from tangible assets such as land money and cars to intangible assets such as smart contracts. The concept of blockchain came into existence in early 2009 in the form of Bitcoin; the first bitcoin was �mined� by Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2008 Nakamoto stated in an email �I have been working on a new electronic cash system that is fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third party.� At its core blockchain was a combination of existing cryptography tools and known computer science to develop a network in which parties could interact directly with each other without any trust between them. Blockchain developed a structure in which to store data in blocks which were combined in a chronological chain. Each block was linked with another block cryptographically (see Exhibit 3). In short blockchain could be defined as an enabler for authentication and authorization in the digital world that prohibited the need for many centralized administrators. Blockchain could be further classified into public and private chains. The public blockchain network was not limited in its management and anyone could participate. It could be maintained by anyone with enough computational power. The main drawbacks to such chains were privacy and scalability; therefore �private blockchains� were introduced. These were based on a trusted permissioned network. They were efficient networks in terms of scalability and compliance with regulatory requirements and helped organizations to improve efficiency and security. They also helped to reduce costs and time and enhance trust. Private blockchains enabled organizations to share selected data with each other; in this structure the organizations were termed �nodes.� Though secure and efficient private blockchains may have been vulnerable to manipulation due to their centralized governance.Hyperledger Fabric was the foundation for private blockchain-developed applications. Through projects hosted by the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric enabled confidentiality scalability and security in business environments. It also provided a �permissioned network� which enabled membership processes and access rights. It confirmed the possibility of low-cost confidential transactions and computations. Finally it helped in automated business processes by leveraging the embedded business logic in smart contracts across the network. According to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2018 blockchain would take five to 10 years to mature and deliver transformative changes.INNOVATIVE SOLUTION PROPOSED BY SNAPPERSnapper had proposed a blockchain solution for land registrations (see Exhibit 4). It provided a cloud-based architecture using private blockchain. Before the blockchain could be applied most applications included the creation of digital property data. The proposal emphasized creating awareness of this digitalization among the public and put forth the creation of blockchain-enabled records that included various fields such as usernames; unique identification numbers; mobile phone numbers of the land owners; and boundaries marked with latitude and longitude coordinates for neighbouring plots roads and so on. This created consolidated data of all the properties owned by an individual and stored in the cloud including their personal and government identification (ID) for each property. A block to which a unique hash was assigned represented and contained this data for each property. For a blockchain-enabled title transfer process Snapper proposed that the seller could share the details (i.e. area address etc.) of the property with an interested buyer through a common online portal (see Exhibit 5). This portal facilitated interactions through a unique personal ID allotted to its registered users. Once the details were shared a notification was generated at the buyer�s side of the portal where he or she could then quote a price for the property after reviewing the details. The seller could accept or decline the offer or begin a bargaining process. Once payment terms were agreed upon and finalized the buyer could request transfer of ownership from the government registry. Based on the land circle rate (i.e. the minimum rate set by the state government on which sale or transfer of property could be agreed) and property size fiscal stamp duty rates associated with the property were automatically filled in by the system. Upon payment of these fees a token code generated as an indication of all successful payments and agreements was viewed by the registrar and other officials.The buyer and seller were required to make only a single visit to the registrar�s office at the scheduled date and time. The property title was stored in a smart contract which was locked with the private keys of both the current owner and the government registrar. An agreement by both parties (i.e. the buyer and the seller) was required for initiating the transfer of ownership of the property. The registrar would then capture the biometrics of the seller (i.e. the current owner) and enter their own private key into the system to initiate the process of transfer as per smart contract norms. Thereafter by taking the biometrics of the buyer a new owner would then be added to the property�s history in the form of a new block added to the chain. The newly added block would have an updated hash and a smart contract; this in turn would be locked by the new owner�s (i.e. buyer�s) biometrics and the government�s private key. This locking of the smart contract constituted a proof of ownership transfer. As ownership and title of the property were transferred the details of the new ownership automatically triggered real-time updates to the records of various departments such as water municipal tax and other civic bodies.the BENEFITS OF USING THE BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOLUTIONThe real advantage of using blockchain was that it provided a level of safety to the user in carrying out transactions with other anonymous parties in the network without relying on third parties such as banks and the government. This innovation could drastically reduce the cost of trust by providing a decentralized approach to transactions. For example prior to the 2008 economic crisis banks and government bodies played the role of a trusted third party between transactions. But banks paid out hundreds of billions of dollars to cover their losses thus contributing to the economic meltdown. This is an extreme portrayal of the cost of trust. Blockchain challenged the entire concept of for-profit intermediaries. Blockchain provided safe inroads for due diligence about the proof of existence (at a point in time) proof of process (linkage to other documents) and proof of audit (verification of changes) for digitally encrypted recorded documents. As a result it improved record keeping and data management and helped to eliminate corruption in the transfer of titles. Apart from this significant cost cutting was possible in that blockchain minimized back office and administrative costs. The automated and simplified processes enabled the integration of various departments so time delays redundant data entry and reworking could be avoided. It provided a one-stop shop for all property-related transactions so that inefficiency and data discrepancies were avoided. This led to easy verification of property by banks for loans on property or for purchasing property which currently required various verifications by the banks to ensure the authenticity and integrity of land records. Data was consolidated and the transaction history of a property was fully trackable in the blockchain ledgers. With blockchain implementation an owner could share the public key with the banks so that it could be used for authentication. Since data was stored on the distributed ledger with a biometric key land disputes were minimized and impersonation was avoided. As blockchain prevented data tampering conflict resolution would be easy. The decreased cost on legacy land registry processes required huge transaction costs due to the presence of various intermediaries. Blockchain could remove these intermediaries thereby reducing the cost of the title registry. To illustrate farmers had to pay a document writer _5000 or more to prepare registration papers. With the implementation of this technology the digital documentation cost would be reduced dramatically as all registry documents would be generated automatically after the registration was completed. One window would lead to the next and after authentication the ledgers would automatically close and lead to new blockchains. Blockchain stored accurate identities locations property boundaries and so on at all departmental locations so clean title records could be provided to avoid land disputes. With the implementation of this technology land owners would have a durable and tamper-proof registry of data on the cloud with multiple backups which would be unaffected by any kind of natural or human-imposed calamity.THE DILEMMAAfter�the successful completion of the Blockchain Business Conference Surana wondered whether the government of Andhra Pradesh would consider the suggestions they had made on land records and registration using blockchain-enabled technology. A bigger question for Snapper was whether it should consider other dimensions of technology acceptance (like creating awareness in people and training the users) in its proposal or if it should continue to remain technology specific only? Were business government and society ready for a new technology disruption? Were the assurances of safe secure and transparent land registrations convincing enough for the government to consider blockchain implementation?exhibit 1: Snapper future tech Solutions portfolioNote: BSFI = Banking Financial Services and Insurance.Source: Snapper Future Tech (website) accessed January 15 2019 http://snapperfuturetech.com/index.php?#about.exhibit 2: Schematic diagram of existing LAnd registration processNote: SRO = sub-registrar�s office.Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit 3: How Blockchain works Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit 4: proposed blockchain-enabled Solution of Land record and REGISTRATION  Source: �Property Records Registration� Snapper Future Tech accessed January 15 2019 www.snapperfuturetech.com/index.php?#media.exhibit 5: Schematic diagram of blockchain-enabled Land Registration processSource: Created by the case authors.

(Luckin) were still hovering at the $2 level a sharp drop from their May 2019 initial public offering (IPO) price of $17. During that period the once privately-owned start-up which had reached the $1.0 billion benchmark of a unicorn in 2018 had managed to lose most of its market value.The downfall of Luckin could be traced to its April 2020 public disclosure that its second- and third-quarter unaudited financial reports as well as its fourth-quarter guidance could no longer be relied upon. This change was a dramatic downfall for a young company that had not yet turned a profit since starting in 2017. So far the company had relied on a continuous inflow of fresh funds to finance its growth. It was easy to see where the investments went. From only nine coffee stores in 2017 the technology-driven company had built a 4500-branch stronghold in just two years and had been able to surpass the 20-year efforts of Starbucks in China. By the end of 2019 Luckin had attracted 40 million customers with its strong marketing and promotions.Yet the company�s fortunes fell as quickly as they had risen. Immediately following the company�s disclosure of accounting fraud the market for Luckin shares crashed and brought the company�s valuation down to less than $1.0 billion. The stocks were delisted from the Nasdaq exchange in early July and began trading on the less-stringent over-the-counter (OTC) Pink Open Market at about $2. At that point Luckin had an estimated cash balance of $780 million which was subject to claims by creditors investors and regulators. Without a fresh infusion of equity and with mounting liabilities Luckin�s financial standing was at risk. Should current investors hold on to their shares or should they dispose of them? Was there a chance that Luckin could survive the scandal so that investors could recoup their investments? What could the company do to restore investor confidence and regain its path to becoming the market leader in the coffee industry in China?Beyond the damage to Luckin�s reputation the scandal had reinforced the call of US regulators to apply its securities laws to all listed firms without exception. The Senate-endorsed Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act aimed to do just that. If this bill passed into law what would be the implications to current and future listings of Chinese firms on US exchanges? The RISE of LUCKIN COFFEELuckin Coffee (ru� x�ng k_f_i) was the brain child of Jenny (Zhiya) Qian. The idea of establishing a technology-driven on-demand coffee business came to her when she developed a strong liking for coffee to sustain her energy levels during extended hours working as chief operating officer (COO) of UCar Inc. (UCar). UCar was an online car-hailing service that had been spun off from China Auto Rental (CAR) China�s largest car-rental company. Both companies were founded by Charles (Zhengyao) Lu. CAR was founded in 2007 and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd. (SEHK) in 2014 while UCar was established in 2015 and listed on China�s New Third Board Market in 2016. Qian served as CAR�s executive vice-president and COO before moving to UCar. Lu who became Luckin�s chair invested as the company�s first angel investor through Haode Investment Inc. an asset management firm he established with his wife Lichun Guo and other family members. Together with Qian and other investors they registered Lucky Coffee Inc. in June 2017 in the Cayman Islands and later changed the company name to Luckin Coffee Inc. They subsequently established Luckin Coffee Investment Inc. which owned 100 per cent of Luckin Coffee (Hong Kong) Limited in the British Virgin Islands. The Hong Kong�registered company had five wholly owned subsidiaries including the operational firm China Luckin (see Exhibit 1). Qian and Lu seemed to work well together. They also brought in other UCar and CAR team members such as Jian Liu Jinyi Guo and Fei Yang who were appointed as COO senior vice president and chief marketing officer (CMO) respectively. Qian and Lu applied the same strategies they had used in the other two companies to launch the Luckin brand. Their formula was to overwhelm the market with physical presence and predatory prices to drive out competition even if this was at the expense of profit. They also used the capital market to fuel growth.Luckin�s appeal was straightforward. The company introduced a �new retail� model by changing the user experience through its company-developed mobile app that allowed it to gather real-time data on sales and customer preferences. The app was also able to generate heat maps to determine where to locate future stores. The information was meant to help the company reach its target: to be the number-one coffee shop in Asia with 10000 coffee shops by 2021. The timing of Luckin�s entry into the market could not have been any better. For one thing the market for freshly brewed coffee was growing. China�s per capita consumption of coffee in 2018 was only 1.6 cups versus 388 cups in the United States. A report from Frost and Sullivan projected the country�s average coffee consumption of freshly brewed coffee would increase to 5.5 cups per capita by 2023. Moreover a 2018 survey revealed that Chinese preferences were shifting from international to local brands. The shift was created by two related factors: the rising tension between China and the United States and a greater need for Chinese consumers to tighten their belts in view of economic uncertainties. Thus a home-grown coffee shop that sold affordable products was a good alternative to more expensive international brands.From only nine coffee shops at the beginning of 2018 Luckin grew to 525 stores spread over 13 cities by May 2018. By then the company had sold 18 million cups to 3.5 million customers. However to grow even faster the company needed more funds. In July 2018 the company was able to raise $200 million from GIC Private Limited (Singapore�s state investment fund) China International Capital Corporation Limited (one of China�s leading investment banks) Centurium Capital (a Chinese private equity investment firm) and Joy Capital (a local venture capitalist). Centurium Capital and Joy Capital had also invested in CAR and UCar. With the additional infusion Luckin reached the $1.0 billion valuation benchmark required to be classified as a unicorn.The number of stores quickly multiplied. From 800 stores in August 2018 the company had reached 2000 stores by the end of that year (see Exhibit 2). To help reach its new market Luckin partnered with Tencent Holdings Ltd. the owner of the WeChat messaging service. The growth attracted the attention of US-based asset manager BlackRock Inc. (BlackRock) resulting in another investment infusion. At this point Luckin had a valuation of $2.9 billion. In pursuit of its store growth and marketing strategies Luckin continued to burn cash at a rapid pace. The company�s pick-up stores were small�just large enough to accommodate the baristas the coffee makers a serving counter and a few stools. In 2018 most of these outlets were located in the lobbies of buildings and shopping malls in Tier-1 cities such as Shanghai Beijing Guangzhou and Shenzen which made rent very expensive. The company also continued its promotions�such as a free first cup of coffee; a buy two get one free deal; a buy five get five free deal; and free delivery through its business partner SF Express for minimum orders. The large scale made it impossible to generate store profits. At the end of 2018 the company reported losses of $241.3 million; and in the first quarter of 2019 its losses were already $88.0 million (see Exhibit 3). By this time Luckin had a base of 16.8 million customers who had consumed 90 million cups of coffee.Luckin continued to be aggressive and in January 2019 hired Reinout Schakel as its chief financial officer (CFO) and chief strategy officer (CSO). The only non-Chinese-speaking senior executive was tasked with dealing with Western investors. One such investor was Credit Suisse Schakel�s former employer whose then�chief executive officer (CEO) described Luckin as the �dream client� and Lu as the �poster child� for what Credit Suisse wanted to do. Together with Morgan Stanley and two Chinese investment banks Credit Suisse underwrote Luckin�s successful IPO on the Nasdaq in May 2019. Beyond its initial $100 million application the company raised $561 million on its offer of 33 million American depositary shares (ADSs) representing 264000 Class A ordinary shares. As a result of the IPO the company�s valuation increased to $10 billion which the company expected to quadruple by 2020. Buoyed by additional funds and investor confidence Luckin continued to increase the number of its stores and company-owned subsidiaries (see Exhibit 4). By August 2019 the company had reached about 3000 stores mostly located in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities as most of the Tier-1 cities were already fully saturated with some stores located only 500 metres apart. Meanwhile it was reported that Steven Cohen�s Point72 Asset Management had acquired 5.1 per cent of Luckin for $390 million. Luckin also disclosed that it had partnered with Middle Eastern Americana Group in order to expand into the Middle East and India and with Europe-based Louis Dreyfus which would supply orange juice. Earlier the company also announced that it would be establishing separate Luckin Tea Stores under a partnership model to sell the tea drinks it had been selling in the coffee shops. In January 2020 the company revealed it had transacted with 40 million customers and reached its target of 4500 stores. These accomplishments paved the way for even greater growth strategies. With the intention of entering the unstaffed retail market with Luckin Coffee Express and Luckin Pop the company announced it was offering $400 million in aggregate principal amounts of convertible senior notes which would be due in 2025 with a put option in 2023 as well as 12 million ADSs priced at $42 each. The company later disclosed that it had received net proceeds of about $446 million from the note offering and $418 million from the ADS offering. That same month its stock price reached its highest level of $51.38 closing at $50.02 on January 17 (see Exhibit 5). COMPETING WITH STARBUCKSLuckin�s mission from its outset was to surpass Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks) in terms of its number of stores. While there were several international brands in the market�such as Costa Coffee the McDonalds Corporation Pacific Coffee Tim Hortons Inc. and Luigi Lavazza SpA�Starbucks was the market leader by a wide margin. Some reports pegged its share of the Chinese market at 80 per cent before Luckin entered the picture. While Starbucks had introduced coffee to China in 1999 it was Luckin that made it possible for more Chinese people to enjoy the drink increasing the demand for coffee. The path Luckin opted to take contrasted greatly with that of Starbucks (see Exhibit 6). The Chinese firm was intent on making its presence felt by being affordable and accessible; it also had a coffee blend that had received international recognition thanks to its coffee consultant Hidenori Izaki. Luckin�s coffee was priced 40 per cent lower than Starbucks� and cost even less when combined with promotions. Luckin also introduced coffee delivery before Starbucks even though the international firm had considered the delivery option much earlier. Further Luckin required all orders to be made via its mobile app while Starbucks allowed customers to order and pay for their purchases in the store. This way the local firm acquired information about its customers and their purchasing patterns which allowed it to be more targeted in its promotions.Luckin�s promotional spending was to be offset by its lower rental expenses due to its smaller coffee shops. Compared to its competitors�which had an average store size of 100 square metres (m2) to accommodate dine-in customers�Luckin stores averaged 40 m2. Further as an aspirational brand Starbucks had to be located in high-visibility high-traffic locations which made its rents more expensive. Luckin stores were pervasive but the company did not need showcase store locations like Starbucks. Consequently Luckin overtook Starbucks in a number of stores by the end of 2019 (see Exhibit 7). In 2019 Luckin had an average of six store operations employees per store.ACCOUNTING FRAUD: DISCOVERY and extentWhile Luckin had no timetable for declaring profits it proclaimed on November 13 2019 that its store margins were finally in the black for the first time since its founding. Investors� positive response to the news was reflected by rising stock prices. However the proclamation also prompted unsolicited surveillance of store operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 by an anonymous group that gathered hours of store video coverage and thousands of receipts as the basis for their analysis which refuted Luckin�s claims of store profitability. This group�s 89-page report suggested that Luckin had taken deliberate actions to deceive its investors. The report was sent to the investment research firm Muddy Waters Research which in turn shared the file publicly on its Twitter account on January 30 2020. Luckin was quick to deny the allegations and went immediately back to business as usual. Nonetheless the next day in a practice known as short selling Muddy Waters Research borrowed third-party shares and sold these to investors with the intention of paying back the borrowed shares at a later date when it would be able to buy Luckin shares at a lower price. Not wasting time Luckin�s auditor Ernst & Young (EY) through its local partner EY Hua Ming LLP began auditing the company�s financial records. Suspecting falsified transactions EY requested related documents from top management which they later used to confirm their suspicions. On March 19 2020 the board formed a special committee to conduct its own investigation. The results of the investigation confirmed the presence of falsified sales transactions that could only have been executed with the cooperation of the CEO COO and individuals who reported directly to these two executives. The internal report further indicated the presence of related-party transactions that had allowed funds to be transferred out of Luckin�s� coffers. The findings were disclosed by the committee on April 2 2020.By July 1 2020 the special committee declared that the investigation was substantially completed and divulged the news that over a three-quarter period sales had been inflated by �2.12 billion and expenses had been inflated by �1.34 billion (see Exhibit 8). The report indicated that as one method of inflating the sales figures the company had sold redeemable vouchers in bulk to businesses associated with its chairperson. To manage profit levels Luckin had also inflated its expenses. One method it had used was to create fictitious raw-materials purchases that bypassed the CFO but were approved by Qian. To avoid traceability documents relating to raw material suppliers that were affiliated with the chairperson were processed by a fictitious employee. The funds collected from these raw material purchases were presumably used to pay for the redeemable vouchers that were advanced to bulk buyers. Some of these businesses had been incorporated just prior to the IPO.CORPORATE RESPONSEWhen Luckin became aware that Muddy Waters Research had made the anonymous report public it was quick to deny the allegations. In a press release the company declared that its app-based business tracked store performance in real time; therefore the data was verifiable. Luckin further claimed that its internal control system was robust so as to ensure the integrity of its data. Consequently the company contemplated taking appropriate actions against those who had tarnished its reputation.When Luckin was informed of the accounting fraud by its auditor it formed a special committee comprised of three independent directors led by Sean (Xiaoheng) Shao to oversee the internal investigations. The company also retained the services of Kirkland & Ellis LLP as its independent legal counsel and of FTI Consulting as its independent forensic accounting expert. On April 2 2020 the committee publicly disclosed that the company�s 2019 financial statements were unreliable. The preliminary findings indicated that the COO and some of his subordinates had committed fraud. The suspected individuals were suspended as a preventative measure. Subsequently Luckin announced that the CEO and COO�s employment had been terminated and that they had been compelled to resign from the board. At the same time it was announced that the company�s senior vice president Guo would become interim CEO and would have a seat at the board.After this announcement the committee continued its investigation which involved the review of over 550000 documents and 60 witness interviews. It became evident that 12 complicit employees had to be terminated and disciplinary action taken against 15 employees. Moreover the committee also recommended the termination of relations with third parties involved in the fraud.Just as these investigations were coming to a close majority shareholder Charles Lu (see Exhibit 9) called for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) with the intent of removing Shao. Simultaneously the special committee announced its recommendation that Lu should be removed as board chair due to his failure to cooperate with the investigation. The committee declared that Lu knew or should have known about the fraudulent transactions�a claim that Lu denied. On July 13 2020 Luckin announced several changes in the board effective July 5 2020: Lu Shao and two of the original directors were removed; Guo was named CEO and chair and remained as the only member of the eight-person board that had been connected with Luckin before the scandal erupted. Other resignations and replacements had already taken place (see Exhibit 10). Despite the changes to the board�s composition some were still skeptical about the independence of the board because the replacements were perceived to have been personally selected by Lu. There were also speculations as to why Lu had allowed himself to be removed as both the chair and a member of the board. Some suspected that Lu wanted to divert attention away from his possible role in the fraud. It was also suspected that Lu�s removal had been pre-emptive and that Lu had expected to lose control of Haode Investments after the British Virgin Islands granted both Credit Suisse and Wall Street banks the authority to liquidate investments following Lu�s default on loans he had secured prior to the IPO with stocks in Luckin. Also some believed that Lu wanted relief from scrutiny since trading in shares of his non-related businesses CAR and UCar had been unfavourably affected and his shares in UCar had been frozen. In June 2020 Lu also stepped down as chair of CAR.The changes to the composition of the board were far from over. On August 3 Centurium Capital which held more than 10 per cent of voting shares requested that another EGM be scheduled to reinstate Shao as an independent director and to remove the two female directors Lu had brought onto the board.ACTION TAKEN BY REGULATORSThe Nasdaq was quick to react to Luckin�s public disclosure of accounting fraud. A few days after the announcement trading in Luckin�s stocks was suspended and before the six-week suspension ended in May 2020 Nasdaq warned Luckin that it might be delisted due to its failure to publicly disclose material information and the concerns raised by investors. A month later Nasdaq issued a second delisting notice due to Luckin�s failure to file an annual financial report for 2019. At Luckin�s request a hearing was set for June 25 2020 to allow the company an opportunity to be heard but Luckin withdrew this request a day before the hearing. Consequently Nasdaq notified the company that trading of its shares would be suspended as of June 29 2020 until delisting could take effect. As Nasdaq took action against Luckin US regulators coordinated with their counterparts in China to call for an investigation regarding the public disclosure of fraud. Unlike other countries which allowed the US regulators to directly audit the financial records of firms listed on its stock exchanges China granted US regulators no such authority. Under Chinese law only locally based firms were allowed to audit Chinese firms; the country�s secrecy law also meant that documents could not be brought out of China.Three Chinese government units worked together to determine the extent of the fraudulent transactions� the Ministry of Finance the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration for Market Regulation. They concluded that Luckin had violated accounting laws anti-competition regulations and the new securities law that had taken effect in March 2020 with its false advertising as well as its inflation of income and expenses. On top of applying administrative penalties to Luckin and related firms the Chinese regulators prepared to penalize and even prosecute the former chairperson for his involvement in the fraud.RESPONSE OF INVESTORSAs of December 2019 Luckin had 158 institutional investors holding 460 million shares. These investors were still enthusiastic even though Luckin as an emerging growth company was taking advantage of reduced public reporting requirements under US securities law. The company�s stock price steadily increased�far beyond the $17 it had reached at the IPO opening�as the company continued to provide updates on its targets. For instance the November 2019 announcement of store profits boosted the share price even further and the share price peaked at $50 after the company announced it had completed its second offering and fully subscribed its convertible senior notes pushing its corporate valuation to $12 billion (see Exhibit 11). While prices dipped slightly when the anonymous 89-page report was released by Muddy Waters Research Luckin recovered and reassured investors that it collected real-time data on sales and therefore all figures could be verified. However when Luckin admitted on April 2 2020 that financial statements were no longer reliable its share price tumbled to $6.40 and then to $4.39 a few days later. As investors rushed to dispose of their shares the volume of stocks traded on the Nasdaq reached 447 million within three days of the announcement. The trading volume was 10 times higher than during the previous 40 days combined and the unusual volume prompted the suspension of trading. After a six-week hiatus shares opened on May 20 2020 at $2.52 and reached their lowest level on May 22 at $1.39. By the first week of July 2020 Luckin was delisted from the Nasdaq and immediately began to trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market under the ticker symbol LKNCY:OTC. Stocks had since been trading at the $2 level.The exodus from Luckin began even before the scandal erupted. Point72 Asset Management was able to reduce its holding to 1.2 per cent as early as February 2020; Lone Pine Capital which held 14.5 per cent of ADSs pulled out on the day the scandal erupted; and Capital Group which held 9.2 per cent of Class A shares was able to exit a month later. BlackRock followed suit. Other investors suffered substantial losses and aimed to take appropriate actions against the firm. Those who had purchased shares from November 2019 to January 2020 joined a class-action suit filed in February 2020 after early allegations of fraud surfaced. Still others with damages that exceeded $100000 as a result of purchases during the same period were invited to join another class-action suit.Meanwhile the unsecured convertible senior notes which would have earned an interest of 0.75 per cent per annum and a conversion price of $54.601 per share in January 2025 had a value of 27.5 cents to the dollar in late April 2020. The notes were subsequently removed from the Standard & Poor�s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities exchange traded fund (ETF) (NYSEARCA:CWB) following Luckin�s delisting.IMPLICATIONS OF THE LUCKIN SCANDALThe Luckin scandal hastened the US Senate approval of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The bill was forwarded to the House of Representatives which had to approve the document before it could finally be signed into law by the US president. When enacted into law the bill would require all foreign firms that had raised funds or intended to raise funds from US investors through US stock exchanges or private endeavours to subject their financial records to the scrutiny of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Firms already listed on the boards would have to comply with the new requirements by January 2022 or face delisting. While most foreign firms already complied with US securities law those in a few countries like China which upheld its secrecy laws did not. However it was uncertain whether the law would actually be passed. There were concerns that enacting the law might backfire as Chinese listings generated economic activity. There were 230 Chinese firms with market capitalizations estimated at $1.8 trillion listed on US exchanges. These firms could readily list on other boards as they had already obtained the benefits of US listings such as improved enterprise valuation. Firms yet to be listed could opt to enter other markets since stock exchanges around the globe were known to compete for IPOs. Even China had eased the rules for IPOs resulting in dozens of debuts on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange�s ChiNext market. If Chinese firms listed elsewhere this would mean a substantial lost opportunity for the United States since Chinese firms had dominated global IPOs over the last 15 years. It could also lead to the closure of the ADS market which was the instrument used by foreign companies. Ninety per cent of the ADS market with capitalization of $860 billion was controlled by Chinese firms.Meanwhile Chinese firms were still in a rush to list on US boards in the hope that the two governments could still reach a compromise before the deadline for compliance with the audit records disclosure requirement. Ahead of the pack was Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited the largest independent cloud service provider in China. The company had raised $510 million in its IPO on the Nasdaq in May 2020. Like Luckin it had not reported any profits at the time of listing.The Future of LUCKIN COFFEEAs of July 15 2020 the Luckin board had been placed under the supervision of provisional liquidators Alexander Lawson of Alvarez & Marsal Cayman Islands Inc. and Wing Sze Tiffany Wong of Alvarez & Marsal Asia Limited. The appointment of liquidators was mandated by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands which had jurisdiction over the Cayman-registered Luckin. These �light touch� liquidators were expected to work with Luckin�s financial adviser Houlihan Lokey�a recognized expert for distressed firms�not to liquidate but to restructure the company and to negotiate with its creditors (see Exhibit 12). At the time of their appointment Luckin had unrestricted cash estimated at $780 million.What the new board intended to do to regain investor trust was still unclear. As of August 3 2020 the two independent female directors who had received their directorships only on July 5 2020 had submitted their resignations ahead of the September 2 2020 EGM that sought to remove them. Among the executives the CFO appeared to still remain at Luckin while there had been no announcements regarding the replacement for the COO who had been fired. There had also been no word on the CMO who had been active during the early days but who appeared to have quietly faded from the limelight just prior to the IPO. It was speculated that his absence was necessary in order to divert attention from his criminal record which might be discovered as investors conducted their own due diligence.Could Luckin survive over the next few months or years or was bankruptcy within sight? Beyond the hype over its technology Luckin was a real company and was visible through its stores across China which were reported to have reached at least 6000. If records were to be believed the company had 40 million transacting customers as of December 2019. Immediately after the news of the accounting fraud scandal broke throngs of customers were reported to have lined up at Luckin stores to redeem coupons in fears the company would shut down and render their coupons worthless. The demand surges led to over 325000 daily downloads of the mobile app (compared to its usual 45000 downloads)�the app crashed. Was this an indicator that Luckin�s �new retail� model could not work without the promotions?EXHIBIT 1: Luckin Coffee Inc.�corporate structure (as of may 2019) Notes: WFOE = wholly foreign-owned enterprise; VIE = variable interest entity.Source: Luckin Coffee Inc.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-03On Monday June 11 2018 intern Jane Smith sat at her desk at a prestigious investment firm looking at the file for the US retail store chain Bon-Ton Holdings Inc. (Bon-Ton). She tried to recall her first-year financial accounting class. Her mentor at the firm had asked her to analyze Bon-Ton’s financial condition as the investment company was managing some client portfolios where Bon-Ton stocks were present. Smith did some initial investigation and discovered that the store was not doing very well. Moreover the US retail industry had been experiencing a systemic meltdown since 2017. More than 15 US retailers had filed for bankruptcy in 2017 the most in the last six years. The 100-year-old company Bon-Ton was no exception. In 2017 it had announced store closures in five states and on January 16 2018 it had entered into forbearance agreements with some of its lenders after the grace period of a US$14 million debt payment expired. On January 31 2018 it announced store closures at 42 locations as part of its rationalization program. The company ultimately filed a voluntary petition for protection against bankruptcy and for reorganization on February 4 2018 under chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Thinking about the risk of retaining Bon-Ton stocks in the client portfolios Smith wondered whether it would be feasible for Bon-Ton to stay afloat and revive its business. How were its competitors faring? Could Bon-Ton survive and if so how? While researching retail companies that had gone bankrupt Smith came across a tool to predict bankruptcy Altman’s Z-score. She planned to complement her analysis with the bankruptcy prediction findings to arrive at a comprehensive analysis of Bon-Ton and recommend a course of action for her firm.ABOUT THE COMPANYBon-Ton Stores Inc. was a department store chain in the United States founded in 1898. The company’s stores offered “fashion apparel and accessories for women men and children.” Its products also included “cosmetics home furnishings and other goods.” As of 2017 the company operated through more than 250 stores in 24 states and the majority of its stores were leased. The company was headquartered in York Pennsylvania which was its administrative and sales support hub. The merchandising and marketing divisions were based in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The company owned and leased distribution centres in Illinois Pennsylvania and Ohio; operated a furniture warehouse in Naperville Illinois; and leased an omnichannel fulfillment centre in West Jefferson Ohio. The company operated under seven retail nameplates across the United States: Bon-Ton Carson’s Younkers Herberger’s Elder-Beerman Boston Store and Bergner’s.BON-TON’S BUSINESS MODELValue PropositionBon-Ton promoted itself as a store that offered “better brands better savings” and it carried a broad collection of quality goods at favourable prices. Bon-Ton stores provided an assortment of nationally distributed brands of apparel accessories footwear cosmetics and home furnishings—for example Anne Klein Calvin Klein Jessica Simpson Kenneth Cole and Under Armour. It also offered exclusive private brands like Laura Ashley Ruff Hewn Relativity and Studio Works. Bon-Ton’s private brands made unique and exclusive fashion products available at compelling price points contributing to competitive differentiation and customer loyalty. The costs associated with in-house private brands enabled Bon-Ton to realize a favourable profit margin.Customer RelationshipThe primary target consumers of Bon-Ton were “women between the ages of 25 and 60 with average annual household income of $55000 to $125000.” The company also targeted a “broader audience” that included men and children.Bon-Ton focused on excellent customer service in order to develop long-standing relationships with its customers. It provided training programs to build an efficient sales force for customers and in addition to phone and online support Bon-Ton had sales associates dedicated to customer sales assistance in selected stores. Many departments had self-service centres for customer convenience. Bon-Ton also implemented a “Let Us Find It” program to assist customers in finding preferred items at other store locations or through the company’s omnichannel assortment which enabled customers to order merchandise for delivery directly to their addresses. Bon-Ton also expanded its order-fulfillment locations to serve omnichannel orders that were directed to store locations. In 2016 Bon-Ton introduced mobile capabilities and provided customers with a “Buy Online Pick Up In-Store” convenience program. To gain customer loyalty it also had a private-label credit card program which offered cardholders rewards including advanced sales notices discounts and event invitations.Vendor ManagementBon-Ton served as a distribution channel that helped merchandise vendors reach their target customers. The company created relationships with vendors by evaluating their sales and profitability and making purchasing decisions based on these analyses. As was prevalent in the industry Bon-Ton received allowances from some of its vendors when sales did not meet specified margins. It also received support from some vendors in the form of allowances and reimbursements for costs incurred to promote and sell on behalf of the vendors. MarketingBon-Ton engaged customers through a multichannel marketing program that included traditional print media broadcasting and digital media. Bon-Ton used localization and personalization strategies in its email and direct marketing to individual customers. Besides advertising and sales promotions it offered purchase incentives and in-store events such as designer appearances and fashion shows to build a solid customer base. Bon-Ton also tried to connect with people by participating in charitable causes and events.Inventory ManagementBon-Ton had a centralized planning and allocation team for all its stores; this team included staff who supported regional and local planning and allocation. The company operated a pre-distribution model “through which we allocate[ed] merchandise on our initial purchase orders to each store. This merchandise [wa]s shipped from our vendors to our distribution facilities for delivery to designated stores.” Bon-Ton had a “reactive distribution technique” for stores with high customer demand. The technique leveraged electronic data interchange inventory management technology to effectively move and deliver prelabelled merchandise to individual stores and it used high-speed automated conveyor systems and hand-held radio frequency devices to track merchandise. Bon-Ton’s third-party carriers distributed merchandise to the stores where most of the merchandise was held. Bon-Ton monitored inventory levels following a seasonal pattern and maintained inventories to support both offline and online sales.ABOUT THE FOUNDER AND chief executive officerMax and Samuel Grumbacher started Bon-Ton in 1898 as S.Grumbacher and Son a one-room store on Market Street in York Pennsylvania founded by Max and Samuel Grumbacher. It had come a long way and now operated in approximately 2.2 million square metres (24 million square feet) in around 260 stores in 24 US states under the different nameplates.Tim Grumbacher had been involved in the company’s management since 1977 and had been the chairman of the board of directors and strategic initiatives officer since June 2013. Kathryn Bufano held positions as president chief executive officer (CEO) and director. After August 25 2017 William Tracy the former chief operating officer took over the CEO role after Bufano stepped down when her contract ended. Although the firm had posted annual losses under Bufano’s tenure Bon-Ton’s press release announcing this change gave no specific reason for Bufano’s resignation. Bufano supported Tracy as he moved into the new role and Tracy stated that he appreciated the board’s confidence and support during his transition.PAST PERFORMANCEBeginning in 2014 Bon-Ton’s downturn was prominent and this was reflected in the company’s share price (see Exhibit 1). Its sales and margin performance were below expectations that year resulting in a greater net loss than that of the prior year. However according to Bufano “It was a year of both challenges and accomplishments.” She felt confident in the long-term potential of the company saying that while the performance was “disappointing we believe the progress we made on our strategic initiatives will contribute meaningfully to future profitability and growth.” In the fall of 2014 the company started a “Voice of the Customer” brand positioning program supported by the tagline “Your Store. Your Style.” According to Bufano this served “as the embodiment of our customer focus and commitment to delivering localized and relevant fashion across our many channels—our brick-and-mortar stores website and app.” Even after executing customer-centric strategies Bufano felt that the company had failed to reflect its accomplishments in the financials (see Exhibits 2–4). In 2016 Bon-Ton realized a “net cost savings of $31 million which was $7 million above the high end” of the company’s target. According to the CEO’s statement in the annual report “2016 was a year of progress for Bon-Ton despite the ongoing challenges that we faced from the retail environment.” The company paid off a $150 million asset-based term loan and $57 million in outstanding principal on its 2017 senior secured notes which slightly improved its liquidity and overall capital structure. However the company still ended up with a net loss of $63 million as of January 2017—around $6 million more than that of the previous year (see Exhibit 2). In 2017 the company continued to meet losses. Sales decreased and the bottom line plunged (see Exhibits 2–7). In the company’s Form 8-K for the first quarter (Q1) of 2017 Bufano stated Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift. That said our omnichannel business once again generated double digit growth and we continued to expand our merchandise offering with highly recognized brands as well as exclusive and private brands that resonate with our customer. Bon-Ton planned to focus on its omnichannel strategy and expand its merchandise portfolio to appeal to customers. Internally Bon-Ton was looking to roll out a profit improvement initiative to achieve additional cost reductions in fiscal 2017. In Q2 2017 as per Bon-Ton’s earnings call the company was optimistic about sales in several categories such as fine jewellery young men’s denim and brands such as Under Armour Tommy Hilfiger and Vera Bradley. According to Tracy the new president and CEO Our cosmetic business performed ahead of our expectations driven by the strength in the fragrance category. We are also pleased with the continued momentum in our e-commerce business which saw a double-digit increase during the quarter. . . .We made great progress on our cost reduction plan as we reduce SG&A [selling general and administrative expenses] by $20.7 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization] was $9.1 million an increase of $6.6 million compared to last year’s second quarter. Second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA includes $12.1 million in benefit from gift card breakage and gains in our real estate transactions.Bon-Ton planned to expand its merchandise offerings “focusing on five core areas” of “gifting cold weather merchandise activewear denim and private and exclusive brands.” Bon-Ton planned to launch FAO Schwarz and expand its Discovery Kids product and its previous success with pantry offerings influenced the company to consider expanding its specialty food business with national and key local brands.RESULTS AND OUTLOOK FOR THE YEARBon-Ton’s third-quarter report of 2017 indicated that there had been progress on a number of strategic initiatives. The report showed that Bon-Ton did the following:Experienced strength in key merchandise categories and brands and drove continued double-digit growth in our omnichannel business (reflecting sales via our website mobile site and our Let Us Find It customer service program) as compared to the third quarter of 2017;Continued to effectively execute on a number of profit improvement initiatives substantially reducing our selling general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for the quarter; andMaintained careful inventory controls as we reduced inventory by 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2016.At the same time the company faced continuing challenges. Sales at stores decreased 6.6 per cent because of warm weather and subdued footfall at malls. Revenue realization was less from proprietary credit card operations miscellaneous revenue departments and gift-and-merchandise return card breakage. Shifts in the mix of merchandise led to a markdown rate that affected gross margins and was in turn intensified by a decrease in the gross margin. Net interest expense increased from the previous year due to a spike in weighted average interest rate and expanded debt.The company’s cash flow from operations and up to $880 million in borrowings provided a source of working capital. The company had planned capital expenditures; beyond these its main cash expenses would be for servicing debt and financing during peak selling seasons.Bon-Ton’s quarter-wise financial performance in 2017 reflected the challenging situation (see Exhibits 5–7). The company indicated that it had started evaluating potential strategic alternatives and engaging consultants for financial restructuring.CHALLENGES In 2017 many retail players closed their stores and planned for more closures in 2018. Many retailers in the United States filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to overburdening debt a decline in footfall and pressure from competitors. Some of the troubled retailers were Sears Payless ShoeSource Inc. Abercrombie & Fitch Toys “R” Us and Gymboree Group Inc. Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were expected to acquire a large amount of the industry’s gains. Amazon had been the chief competitor to all the other retail players. Some other department store industry leaders such as Dillard’s Inc. Kohl’s Corporation Nordstrom Inc. Macy’s Inc. and J.C. Penney Company Inc. were also facing challenges in the current market condition (see Exhibit 8).A Forbes report on retail sales for June 2017 provided “a sobering look at the current state of American retail.” Although year-on-year total sales were up for the first half of 2017 the estimated figures for May–June 2017 were lower. With some exceptions (electronics; appliance stores; sporting goods; and hobby book and music stores) most reporting categories showed monthly declines: “Even non-store retailers . . . reported a 2.8% dip. Overall June retail and food services sales dropped 3.2%” compared to the previous month.Department store and retail companies were affected by consumers’ shifting shopping patterns: from shopping in brick-and-mortar stores to buying through online retail channels and using smart phones and social media. Certainly Internet shopping had been “replacing the hassles of in-store shopping.” Online shopping not only gave consumers “access to more products often at a cheaper price” but it also saved “huge amounts of time when people need a specific item.” Forbes also reported that men were “spending more on clothes. This is an interesting trend especially now that Walmart has acquired men’s clothing retailer Bonobos. Men are paying serious attention to their presentation both at work to advance their careers and in their personal lives when casual attire is called for.”The US retail industry which included mass merchandisers national chain retailers and specialty retailers became highly competitive as online retailers emerged and mobile technology and social media expanded. Competition in the industry revolved around “price quality and selection of merchandise reputation store location advertising and customer service.” While Bon-Ton competed with similar department stores and many other retailers “including store-based mail-order and internet retailers” many of its competitors were in better shape (see Exhibit 8).Moreover prevailing economic conditions and various economic factors affected consumers’ spending habits especially with respect to the merchandise that Bon-Ton stores sold. “Reduced consumer traffic in traditional shopping malls” where most of the Bon-Ton stores were located had caused a decline in the company’s financial condition and operating results.Customer traffic and conversion both in stores and online had important effects on sales and in-store sales were highly dependent on the geographical locations of stores. As demographic patterns changed many of Bon-Ton’s current locations had lost appeal. Financial conditions that affected the operators of some shopping malls where Bon-Ton stores were located had also affected the company’s sales.Declining operating performance and a severe liquidity crisis meant that vendors might demand accelerated payments resulting in “a significant adverse impact” on Bon-Ton’s operating cash flow and liquidity. As of January 28 2017 the company had a total debt of $989.3 million which included capital lease and financing obligations.This indebtedness curbed Bon-Ton’s ability to “replenish inventory at competitive prices and terms generate sales and maintain . . . stores” and price increases for “merchandise raw materials fuel and labour or their reduced availability” threatened to increase the company’s cost of goods further damaging its financial results. To create an online presence Bon-Ton invested in technology and made operational changes which increased customer traffic but did not significantly affect the company’s bottom line. The “cost to ship merchandise to customers and the competitive pressures to offer free or reduced shipping” as well as the “significant cost to provide and maintain the infrastructure and systems necessary to operate [an] omnichannel business” all led to lower margins.The turnover rate in the retail industry was very high. Bon-Ton faced significant costs—for example for wages and benefits such as health care—to attract and retain key employees.Bon-Ton’s real estate exposure was significant. The company owned or leased approximately 260 stores. Its store lease agreements included both a fixed rent portion and a variable portion based on the sales percentage at each location. These agreements also prevented stores from closing before the contracts terminated although some stores that were in economic distress were allowed to close. However leases and other obligations restricted Bon-Ton’s ability to close unprofitable owned or leased stores and forced the company to operate some locations at a loss. Moreover a decline in real estate values posed a risk to Bon-Ton’s borrowing.ANALYSTS’ OPINIONs ABOUT THE COMPANYSmith also went through some analyst reports. Neil Saunders a retail analyst of GlobalData (data and insights solution providers) noted that Bon-Ton’s offerings were undifferentiated and unclear and had become increasingly irrelevant to consumers. “Many of Bon-Ton’s stores were in areas where the availability of branded fashions and home wares was traditionally poor” Saunders said. “However while this once made them a focal point and a destination for local shoppers the internet has done much to change this dynamic and has made the stores less relevant.”Another analyst made a similar comment. “Bon-Ton is kind of a microcosm of the department store industry” said Philip Emma senior analyst for restructuring intelligence firm Debtwire. “Their business model is selling brand-name merchandise that consumers recognize in a mall-based setting—and that’s the segment of retail that’s had the biggest struggle.”ALTMAN’S Z-SCOREOne of the most popular bankruptcy prediction models was developed by Edward I. Altman in 1968. Altman applied a statistical technique called multivariate analysis to a mix of financial variables to detect the likelihood of solvency in times of distress. Each company was given a score (Z-score) calculated through a discriminant function of the five variables weighted by coefficients. The model had been revised several times for different contexts (e.g. for private firms). The Z-score model for non-manufacturing firms and for companies in emerging markets outside the United States was introduced in 1995 (see Exhibit 9). The Z-score model excluded industry-sensitive asset-turnover variables from the last revised model to minimize the industry effect.CONCLUSIONOn February 6 2018 Bon-Ton announced that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware had approved its voluntary petitions for financial restructuring. With existing losses and significant loans what actions might put Bon-Ton back on track? What measures could the company take to fight bankruptcy? Smith prepared to analyze these questions from the perspectives of both Bon-Ton and an investor in order to present her findings to the investment company.EXHIBIT 1: BON-TON—STOCK PRICE CHANGES Source: Excerpted from “The Bon-Ton Stores Inc.

However recognizing that Johnsen could push her appeal further and slow the progress on starting the project the committee decided to offer Johnsen a senior director position at the advertised level of EX-02 but still as a temporary secondment.Johnsen saw the committee’s decision as a victory. She was confident she could demonstrate her value over the year and that the director general Landon Kokomo would make her position indeterminate without question. There was also the possibility that she could use the temporary position to parachute into a permanent position at an even higher grade.In September 2019 Johnsen submitted the papers finalizing her leave of absence from her current permanent position. She hesitated for a few moments before signing the last of the documents—she was voluntarily giving up security in a job she found familiar and enjoyed. But she reminded herself her performance appraisals had always been good and although she was giving up a secure position the leave guaranteed her an equivalent-level job with the federal service upon her return in case the new position did not suit her career goals. Besides she was confident that she would surpass expectations as she had always done before.She had successfully navigated the temporary contract process when she first started working for Public Services. If necessary she could do so again.Success for JohnsenTransition into the new position went smoothly for Johnsen. With her raise Johnsen was able to afford a new condominium in a boutique development in downtown Ottawa Canada’s capital city. Her hours were long but she found the work on the science and technology project even more fulfilling than she had expected. She enjoyed the challenge of establishing new processes such as building team structure hiring staff and launching new projects. She also enjoyed being in the milieu of science and technology. The challenges went beyond how to ventilate a building or improve the efficiency of heating and air conditioning. Instead she was having to consider how to use store and dispose of chemicals. Ventilation systems needed to accommodate storage of everything from viruses to chemicals to waste. The job’s one-year term was long enough for Johnsen to establish the specifications for “greening” one of the research laboratories at the National Research Council. It was an older laboratory with an historical footprint. Her specifications if followed would preserve the historical footprint meet the required standards for environmental impact and still complete the project within budget—almost unheard of in the federal civil service.The team Johnsen had put together included some talented people. One team member Kristof Warden was an architectural technician who specialized in adaptive reuse of older buildings. Several other people had also been actively recruiting him but Johnsen convinced him to join her team where he would have scope to grow. His ability to translate Johnsen’s ideas into plans were largely responsible for the success of the project with the National Research Council.Johnsen’s performance review for the duration of the one-year position was coming up within weeks. She had not found another permanent position during this term but she was confident that her current position would be made indeterminate. She had met all required goals for the year and success with the changes in this particular laboratory would provide the science and technology project with a green laboratory that boasted a preserved historical footprint.Concern for KokomoKokomo had also been preparing for Johnsen’s evaluation. He had assigned her a project with enough challenges to engage her but with minimal risk that she would step outside her scope of authority. Kokomo ensured that the project was located in Ottawa where he could supervise Johnsen’s progress closely. There were days when he regretted that choice; he felt stretched meeting his own goals let alone constantly monitoring Johnsen’s work. This was not how he imagined spending the last few months before retirement.Initial feedback from people involved in Johnsen’s project had been good. She had built a solid team and her casual candid approach was serving her well with negotiations. Kokomo was concerned however when Warden accepted Johnsen’s offer over those of other team leaders. Warden was an asset to the department and Kokomo wanted to be sure that he remained with the project for the long term. However it did not take long before Warden came to Kokomo with concerns. Johnsen was taking credit for Warden’s work claimed Warden. Even more upsetting she was holding him back from his full potential. She would often assign Warden menial tasks and suggest how he could do the things he specialized at differently. Kokomo had heard rumours that Warden was looking for work on a different project. Kokomo was becoming accustomed to the high turnover rate associated with Johnsen’s working style which did not seem to be improving. However losing a team member as valuable as Warden would be an unpleasant experience. Employees at the National Research Council laboratory had also complained to Kokomo about Johnsen’s behaviour. Apparently she was continuing in her tendency to be proprietary about buildings she was working on and had begun to treat the laboratory employees as though they were her employees working in her laboratory. The laboratory supervisor threatened to pull his building out of the project if Johnsen were not replaced. Retrofitting plans were in place and would come in under budget if realized as proposed but none of it would succeed without the co-operation of the laboratory supervisors.The final challenge seemed to be Johnsen’s pursuit of perfection. She acted as though she knew she was being closely observed and treated her secondment to the EX-02 position as a test she intended to pass. Johnsen would allow nothing to go wrong under her watch. She was unable to accept failure or anything less than perfection as the end product. However her team members often felt demoralized. They argued that their work was innovative and required advancing with less-than-perfect proposals in some cases. This was the only way to learn about what worked and what did not work. But Johnsen was unsupportive of their efforts and ideas unless the promise of the project was the outcome Johnsen expected. She pushed the team hard often leaving staff members feeling crushed by her criticism and warnings of failure.The ReviewOn a warm September 2020 morning Johnsen dressed carefully for her virtual performance review. The COVID-19 pandemic that had been raging across the country and the world since earlier that year had made the working environment particularly challenging. However Johnsen had mastered virtual meetings telephone calls and distanced on-site reviews. She was feeling confident about the next step in her career. Johnsen’s confidence evaporated however when she logged into the virtual meeting room and noticed that a human resources director had logged into the meeting with Kokomo. She was also concerned that Kokomo seemed to be avoiding Johnsen’s gaze although it could have been only the camera angle.After everyone was settled Kokomo looked up at Johnsen and announced “Mattie I’m going to be brief and direct and then we can discuss your options. We are not renewing your secondment. With restructuring through the pandemic your previous position no longer exists but we will support you in finding work at your previous level of pay in another department.”

However CGPL would continue to work towards alternatives including sourcing of competitive and alternative coals to best contain the onslaught of under recovery.Tata Power email statement April 12 2017An email statement from Tata Power on April 12 2017 failed to communicate the financial challenges being faced by the CGPL power plant. A later news headline however clearly encapsulated the plant�s survival risks and its commercial viability when it stated �Tata Power Offers to Sell 51% of Mundra Plant for _1.�The judgement by the Supreme Court of India [Supreme Court] dated April 11 2017 brought closure to a long-standing demand for an increase in the electricity tariff on account of the increase in the price of Indonesian coal. The Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) Regulation No. 17 2010 had hiked the royalty and tax on coal mined from Indonesia to bring the price of coal mined from Indonesian mines at par with the international market. This had resulted in the price of Indonesian coal rising from US$70.70 per metric ton in 2009 to $118.40 per metric ton in 2011 affecting the commercial viability of electricity-generation plants in India that were based on Indonesian coal. These plants constituted 7.5 per cent of the national generation capacity contributing a significant 15 gigawatts (GW) of electricity in an electricity-deficient country (see Exhibit 1). Tata Power India�s largest integrated private-sector power company owned and operated the 4000-megawatt (MW) CGPL India�s second-largest coal-based generation plant. Using superior boiler technology the plant was one of the most efficient in the country using 1.7 million metric tons of coal less per year compared to plants of similar capacity. In 2007 Tata Power had bid an electricity tariff of _2.264 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) which was one of the lowest-ever bids in the country. On account of the high price of input coal (i.e. imported coal from Indonesia) CGPL was making continuous losses since its commissioning in 2013 eroding Tata Power�s equity in CGPL.Indonesian coal-based private power plants had arisen in India in response to a change in government policy brought about by the Electricity Act 2003. To reduce the national electricity deficit the act aimed to deregulate the electricity sector unbundle the electricity value chain (generation transmission and distribution [GTD]) allow private investments in generation encourage efficient use of electricity upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure reduce transmission and distribution losses and emphasize renewable energy options. CGPL was the first of the 12 4000 MW Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) to be set up in the country as part of the new act. A greenfield plant CGPL attempted to (a) address the problem of poor-quality domestic coal by importing coal from Indonesia (b) leverage private-sector finances for public infrastructure and (c) bring in private-sector management to address public-sector inefficiencies.Paradoxically the policy-makers regulators tribunals and courts appreciated that the change in the price of Indonesian price had made it commercially unviable for the power plants to generate and supply electricity at the contracted rates. However the stakeholders disagreed on the interpretation of contractual clauses which would allow a tariff increase. Primarily the dispute was about either adhering to the letter of the contract which would lead to a significant private and public loss or following the spirit of the contract which would result in a public gain on account of survival of the private plants. Those in favour of following the spirit of the contract (some public distribution organizations and consumer organizations such as Energy Watchdog and Prayas) argued against any tariff increase as the tariff was competitively determined and contractually agreed upon. The private power plants however sought an increase in the tariff to survive arguing that their survival was in the public interest. The power plants further argued that as they were the most efficient producers in an energy-deficit country their shutdown would be a national loss.While the courts regulators and policy-makers concluded that no relief was possible under the contract their interpretation did not solve the problem faced by Tata Power�the management and owner of CGPL. Tata Power had to decide what to do with the cash-bleeding power plant which having eroded its equity required an immediate infusion of cash. It was estimated that the plant would incur losses 10 times the invested equity over the power plant�s lifetime (i.e. a loss of _475 billion over the 25-year concession period). It remained to be determined whether Tata Power should�or more importantly could�close down the plant.The INDIAN ELECTRICITY SECTORElectricity was introduced in India in 1879 by the private firm P. W. Fleury & Co. The Indian Electricity Act 1910 allowed private companies to generate and supply electricity. By 1950 a significant 630 MW of the nation�s total 1731 MW generation capacity was in private hands. However post-independence in 1947 the Electricity (Supply) Act (1948) paved the way for increased investment in the sector and the government started to dominate making substantial investments. However as the twenty-first century approached the electricity infrastructure in the country failed to keep pace with the demand growth and the energy deficit in the country was pervasive (see Exhibit 2). This was often attributed to insufficient public investments with less than 10 per cent of the electricity generation in the country stemming from the private sector in 2003.ELECTRICITY REGULATION IN INDIABefore 2003 the electricity sector was dominated by central and state governments and its regulation was aimed at efficient coordination among the multiple government agencies through government rules and procedures. For instance the power plants sought fair compensation for changes in input costs that were not in their control�typically these were changes in the price of coal. As coal was supplied by another government agency a procedure for passing through the impact of changes in the price of coal from generators to distributors was developed (i.e. a coal-cost pass-through mechanism).The Electricity Act 2003 sought to address the sectoral problems of complicated governance and the national energy deficit. As a consolidation act it replaced the older statutes and laws brought the different rules under a single regulation and established a structure (see Exhibit 3). Simultaneously the act endeavoured to unbundle GTD put in place a competition policy to enable the addition of electricity generation capacity reduce the high electricity tariffs improve efficiency in GTD and develop a more reliable distribution system. The opening paragraph of this important legislation highlighted its multiple objectives:An Act to consolidate the laws relating to the generation transmission distribution trading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to the development of electricity industry promoting competition therein protecting the interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas rationalization of electricity tariff ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies constitution of Central Electricity Authority Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.The Electricity Act 2003 stipulated that the government could adopt an electricity tariff �if such tariff has been determined through transparent process of bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.� Private-sector participation in electricity generation was encouraged by allowing an electricity tariff to be determined through a competitive bidding process (section 63 of the act). Detailed guidelines for procurement of electricity through two alternate open bidding modes were issued and the supply of electricity was operationalized through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power supply agreements signed between the power producer and the state-owned distribution organizations.TATA POWERFor over 100 years Tata Power had played an important part in the Indian power sector. Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata the founder of the Tata Group (Tata) was a pioneer and had been quick to recognize that �Clean cheap and abundant power is one the basic ingredients for the economic progress of a city state or country.� This recognition had guided Tata�s investments in the power sector since then starting with the establishment of the Tata Hydro-Electric Power Supply Company in 1910. Tata commissioned India�s second hydroelectric project of 72 MW in 1915 later amalgamated with the Andhra Valley Power Supply Co. Ltd. in 1916. Tata Power was registered as a subsidiary in 1917 and in 2016 the government of India issued a postage stamp to recognize Tata�s century-long contributions to national development. For Tata Power it had been a century of invisible goodness and 100 years of pride in caring for customers employees community and environment while playing an important role in nation building.In 2017 Tata Power was India�s largest integrated private power company with a considerable international presence. It had an installed generation capacity of 10857 MW with a significant presence across electricity transmission distribution and trading. The DEVELOPMENT OF COASTAL GUJARAT POWER LimitedWith the Electricity Act 2003 in place and the objective of supplying �Power to all by 2012� the Indian government announced its intentions to set up 12 4 GW UMPPs through a public�private partnership model. The first plant was to be set up near Mundra Port in the state of Gujarat. Power Finance Corporation Ltd. (PFC) a government organization conceptualized the project as a build own and operate project and significantly de-risked the project before inviting private bids for setting up and operating the plant. The power plant was conceptualized as a coal-fired port-based power plant using coal imported from Indonesia. As part of project re-risking land water and coal blocks were identified environmental clearances were sought and PPAs were signed with different state governments for electricity sale. A special purpose vehicle�CGPL�was incorporated on February 10 2006 for this purpose. The project aimed to provide electricity to five states with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited being the lead procurer for 1850 MW of generated electricity. After significantly de-risking the project PFC invited bids for CGPL ownership. For this project contractual documents had to be drafted afresh as they involved imported coal and coal had thus far not been imported for power plants. The bid was to be decided based on the lowest-quoted levelized tariff with an annual coal price escalation of 3.46 per cent allowed for inflation. The allowed cost escalation in coal prices was based on 12 years of historical price trends reported by an expert study.Tata Power participated in the bidding for CGPL. It quoted a tariff of _2.264 per kWh with 55 per cent of the fuel cost fixed and not to be inflation adjusted. As Tata Power�s quoted tariff came out to be the lowest a letter of intent was issued to the power-generation company. This was one of the lowest tariffs competitively discovered in the Indian electricity sector. Tata Power purchased the entire shareholding of CGPL from PFC to make it a wholly owned subsidiary and Tata Power was now responsible for the financing construction operation and maintenance of the project. The project envisaged a consumption of approximately 12 million metric tons of coal imported from Indonesia per annum. In 2007 Tata Power acquired a 30 per cent stake in two Indonesian thermal coal companies owned by PT Bumi Resources PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin Indonesia and in 2012 it signed a long-term coal-supply agreement with Indonesian firm PT Antang Gunung Meratus.Of the 12 UMPPs conceived by the government of India CGPL was the only one that progressed on schedule. More than half of the UMPPs were not bid out and the bids that were floated could not be finalized. However the five 800 MW generating units of CGPL were commissioned between March 2012 and March 2013�well before their scheduled commissioning dates. The early commissioning was attributed to in-house tendering and coordination by CGPL and Tata Power. The plant created 5000 construction jobs and 700 operational jobs. The project was constructed at the cost of _175 billion which included equity of _42.5 billion a loan of _58.5 billion and external commercial borrowings of $1.7 billion. The plant used supercritical technology which saved fuel and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. In comparison to subcritical power plants the project avoided burning 1.7 million metric tons of coal per year thus averting carbon emissions of 3.6 million metric tons per year. The greenhouse gas emissions from the plant were 750 grams (g) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kWh compared to India�s national average of 1259 g of CO2 per kWh for coal-based power plants.The IMPACT OF CHANGE IN INDONESIAN MINING LAWOn September 23 2010 the government of Indonesia promulgated a new regulation�MEMR Regulation No. 17 2010. The law aimed to align the export price of Indonesian coal with the spot prices of coal in the international market while prohibiting sale below this price. This new regulation significantly affected the spot price of Indonesian coal and the MEMR�s thermal coal reference price (known as Harga Batubara Acuan [HBA]) rose from $70.7 per metric ton in 2009 to $118.4 per metric ton in 2011 (see Exhibit 4).As per PPAs signed by CGPL a maximum increase of 17 per cent over five years (i.e. 3.4 per cent _ five years = 17 per cent) in the electricity tariff was allowed on inflation. However the rise in coal prices was 150 per cent (from $50 at the time of the bid to $116 in 2012). Further for CGPL 55 per cent of the tariff change on account of the coal price change was fixed. The abnormal increase in the price of Indonesian coal made CGPL commercially unviable at the low quoted electricity tariff rates. It was estimated that the plant would incur a loss of _475 billion over the 25-year concession period (see Exhibit 5). Seeking relief CGPL approached both the electricity purchaser (the state government of Gujarat) and the central government (the government of India�s Ministry of Power). The ministry responded that �PPA is a legally binding document exclusively between the procurers and the developer. Therefore any issue arising therein is to be settled within the provisions of PPA by the contracting parties for which Gujarat being the Lead Procurer may take necessary action.� National electricity generation capacity of 15 GW was similarly affected as it was also based on imported Indonesian coal. Seeking relief many other private power plants also went knocking at the different government doors. One of the most important of these was the request made by Adani Power Limited (Adani Power)  to CERC the primary regulatory body on July 5 2012. Adani Power made a plea to CERC to either discharge Adani Power from the performance of the PPA on account of frustration or to evolve a mechanism to restore the petitioners to the same economic condition prior to the occurrence of the change in law. It was further suggested that relief could be provided to Adani Power (and other power plants based upon Indonesian coal like CGPL) through three possible routes�change of law (that the �change of law� clause of the PPA be read to include foreign laws) force majeure (that the new law by the Indonesian government be viewed as a force majeure event) or public interest (that failing the first two possible routes relief may be provided under section 79 of the Electricity Act 2003). CERC in the capacity of the regulator was mandated to protect the interests of both consumers and producers and it needed to exercise its authority and provide appropriate relief. CGPL requested CERC to allow an increase of _3 per unit in the tariff.The mission of CERC a statutory body functioning under the purview of the Electricity Act 2003 was to (a) promote competition efficiency and economy in bulk power markets; (b) improve the quality of supply; (c) promote investments; and (d) advise the government on the removal of institutional barriers to bridge the demand�supply gap and thus foster the interests of consumers. CERC deliberated on the numerous requests of the power plants and gave a decision that became applicable to all power plants impacted by the Indonesian coal price increase. In an interim order dated April 2 2013 it did not admit compensation claims under the provisions of change of law or force majeure; however considering the larger public interest it provided relief under section 79 of the Electricity Act 2003. It constituted a committee to compute the applicable tariff increase. Based on the committee report which was supported by a detailed study by KPMG CERC passed its final order on August 16 2013 wherein a formula for the compensatory tariff was proposed. It was estimated that for 2013�14 the affected power plants would obtain a relief of _0.5240 per kWh. Before the order could be implemented it was restrained as there was an appeal pending in the case before the Supreme Court.In parallel Energy Watchdog (a non-government agency) Prayas (an authorized consumer representative before CERC) and several state electricity utilities filed appeals with APTEL a quasi-judicial multidisciplinary expert appellate body. APTEL clubbed all similar cases which had grown to more than 30. The full bench of APTEL passed an interim order on April 7 2016 wherein it firstly recognized and vetted CERC�s jurisdiction to treat the case under section 79 and secondly re-examined CERC�s arguments negating claims under force majeure and change of law.APTEL reversed CERC�s decision that proposed that relief be provided under section 79. It argued that the public interest clause could not be invoked once the tariff had been competitively determined. However agreeing with CERC APTEL did not view the change of law provisions to include changes in foreign law and dismissed compensation under its purview. APTEL considered the change in Indonesian law as a case of force majeure interpreting the force majeure clauses broadly to argue that force majeure included all aspects that frustrated the execution of the contract. APTEL remanded the case to CERC to determine the impact and the extent of the compensatory tariff to be provided considering this new interpretation. CERC finalized its analysis in December 2016 providing relief to the extent of the difference between the coal price based on the coal sales agreements and the free-on-board price of coal ex-Indonesia (i.e. the benchmark price as per the Indonesian index or the actual price paid for the purchase of similar quality coal whichever was lower). Experts were of the view that this compensation amount would be far less than what was provided earlier by CERC. This judgment was put before the Supreme Court for ratification with other similar cases awaiting a decision.The Judgment OF THE Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court explicitly looked into each of the aspects of public interest force majeure and change of law. In a departure from normal practice the attorney general of India suo moto appeared before the court on behalf of the Union of India and conveyed that the electricity sector having been privatized had largely fulfilled the object sought to be achieved by the 2003 act which was that electricity generation being delicensed should result in the production of far greater electricity than was earlier produced. He urged the court not to disturb the delicate balance that the act sought to achieve and has been able to successfully bring private investments into energy generation (see Exhibit 6). The final judgment in the case was passed on April 11 2017. The court argued that the Indonesian policy change did not alter the fundamental basis of the contract to warrant invoking of force majeure provisions. Alternative modes of performance were available to the power plants to fulfill their contractual obligations. As the contract on the whole did not get frustrated the pleas for compensation on account of force majeure were disposed of stating �changes in the cost of fuel or the agreement becoming onerous to perform are not treated as force majeure events under the PPA itself.�In regard to compensation on account of change of law the court argued that �though change in Indonesian law would not qualify as a change in law under the guidelines read with the PPA change in Indian law certainly would.� And it remarked that �in so far as the applicability of clause 13 to a change in Indian law is concerned the respondents are on firm ground.� It went on to interpret a July 2013 change in Indian energy policy and another change in January 2016 to be valid grounds for providing compensatory tariff under change of law.In conclusion the court set aside the APTEL judgment and CERC orders for the compensatory tariff and directed CERC to �go into the matter afresh and determine what relief should be granted to those power generators who fall within clause 13 of the PPA.� As the relief would now be applicable from 2013 and 2016 and not from 2011 (when the Indonesian policy change took place) this relief would be much lower than initially computed.The Supreme Court judgment was viewed as a victory by many.OPTIONS BEFORE TATA POWERIt was a desperate situation for Tata Power�s Mundra power plant and for the other Indonesian coal-based power plants. Their request for a compensatory tariff had been heard and dismissed at the highest level. The decision of what to do next had to be made.A difficult option was to do nothing. A strategic decision had to be made to account for the huge accumulated losses (see Exhibit 5). With continued losses anticipated over the project�s life cycle long-term sustenance was doubtful. Operationally the plant was fast exhausting its coal reserves and would soon run out of cash. Reducing plant output would bring normative plant availability below 80 per cent and attract penalties from the power procurers. This would also attract the ire of the government as the governments of five states would have to purchase power at rates that were 50 to 60 per cent higher to meet their industrial commercial and domestic power needs.Another difficult option was to temporarily or permanently shut down the plant. Any kind of shutting down would again displease the governments. Further with no revenue stream debt servicing would become problematic. Moreover a plant that was temporarily shut down would still require expenses in wages and plant upkeep with the plant�s generation capacity lost forever. Even in the future if the plant were recommissioned it would involve extra costs. The upsides of shutting down the plant in reducing operational losses were unlikely to be large due to the annuity nature of the concessions. Permanently shutting down the plant would imply declaring bankruptcy in which case the losses incurred thus far would become permanent and lenders would be required to take a cut. With most of the lenders being public-sector banks the outstanding debt would be added to the list of non-performing assets and public money would be at risk. The problems were most serious for the state of Gujarat which had become power surplus with the commissioning of Indonesian coal-based power plants. These plants were supplying 48 per cent of the state�s electricity requirement. On becoming power surplus the state had stopped planning and setting up new power plants had become a low priority. No new plants were expected to get commissioned in the near future.The senior management of Tata Power also had to account for the opportunities unfolding due to the opening of the Indian electricity sector and growth in the renewables sector (see Exhibit 7). Private power-generation capacity was continuously increasing and new opportunities were emerging in renewables and in the transmission and distribution of power. All were seeking active private investments. These sectors provided huge growth opportunities for private players like Tata Power for whom the electricity sector (i.e. generation transmission and distribution) was the core sector. In this case coercive or rash action taken by Tata Power would hurt its relationships with the government and likely compromise both existing business lines and future opportunities.The management of Tata Power was left with a decision to take on CGPL a bleeding asset. While it had offered 50 per cent of the plant to the government for _1 the government was unlikely to respond as it would not take on a bleeding asset. Further the offer did little more than signal the severity of the problems faced by Tata Power.The management had to decide whether to continue making losses or shut down the plant with few other options in sight.Exhibit 1: ELECTRICITY Deficit IN INDIA HISTORICAL TRENDSSource: Central Electricity Authority Ministry of Power Government of India Growth of Electricity Sector in India from 1947�2020 October 2020 accessed February 8 2021 https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/pdm/2020/12/growth_2020.pdf.Exhibit 2: SECTORAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND IN INDIA HISTORICAL TRENDSNote: MWh = megawatt-hour.Source: Central Electricity Authority Ministry of Power Government of India Growth of Electricity Sector in India from 1947�2020 October 2020 accessed February 8 2021 https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/pdm/2020/12/growth_2020.pdf.

As engineers and designers we break down big problems into a series of smaller but interconnected pieces that together bring desired outcomes.Prateek NarangPrateek Narang founder of ColoredCow a web services company had a good reason to be impressed by his company�s growth. His company reported net revenues of _725 million in 2016 which reflected an increase of 140 per cent over 2015 (see Exhibit 1). Narang had set up his company less than three years earlier in 2014. As he assessed the growth figures in early 2017 he was filled with hope for the future. He began charting out a strategy for 2020 and set a revenue target for his company of _2.5 billion. Given the company�s small size as well as its involvement in multiple projects in many different areas the target was very ambitious. ColoredCow�s business to date mainly involved working with start-ups and small and medium enterprises to implement their Internet business ideas. Narang began building a strategic growth plan for the company remaining mindful of ColoredCow�s challenges and opportunities. His company�s current growth was a result of word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied customers who helped him reach more customers but it was time to look ahead and give his company some direction and focus. Narang realized that he had to address some important business issues: What technical and digital capabilities would ColoredCow need to implement to achieve success in the future? What possible scalability issues was the company likely to face? What should ColoredCow�s strategic plan for growth look like? What marketing strategies should ColoredCow devise to increase its customer base and achieve the ambitious revenue target of _2.5 billion by 2020?THE COMPANYNarang started ColoredCow in August 2014 with an initial investment of _200000. With great zeal and effort he was able to convert his ideas into reality. Beyond the whimsical company name Narang put his heart and soul into his venture. He always dreamed of owning a company where the possibilities would be endless. Despite already having a rewarding job Narang could not resist the urge from his entrepreneurial spirit to set up a venture of his own. Narang had worked for nearly 15 years in the information technology (IT) industry which helped him build expertise in both computer hardware and in software and applications. His previous jobs had all required him to help build the organization from the start. After graduating with a bachelor�s degree in technology his first job was with the Mohali India division of Tata Interactive Systems in 2000 where he was among the company�s first few employees. In December 2004 he joined the National Cash Register as the company�s first employee for the new IT centre in Gurgaon India. These jobs helped Narang develop an entrepreneurial character which defined him as someone who was able to resolve ambiguity and was not afraid to take risks.Capitalizing on Passion and OpportunityNarang believed that a successful start-up needed more than just great ideas�it needed �a passion to make a mark and solve real business issues.� He shared his philosophy and desire to create a venture of his own with Scott Hurst a fellow attendee at a conference for the programming language PHP in Atlanta Georgia. One year later Hurst called Narang to ask if he was still eager to start a new venture and introduced him to two other entrepreneurs named Hector Javier and Randi James who asked Narang to help them run a software development company. Narang�s networking abilities and self-confidence helped him continue on his journey. A few months later Narang was introduced to the founders of a U.S.-based software development company that needed an expert Java programmer. He managed to complete that assignment while holding another full-time job. He worked for the software company after office hours from a caf�. His passion for the work made it easy to adapt to different circumstances and work environments. Narang gained the trust of his clients by delivering quality and timely results beyond their expectations. His work was cost effective but Narang also provided an understanding of his clients� culture considerable amounts of experience and a strong work ethic. More clients began relying on him and as the amount of work started to grow Narang recruited two people to form ColoredCow a team of expert service providers. Around that time Stanford University had organized a 21-day event for Indian entrepreneurs called Innovate Delhi. Narang had attended the event and was awarded one of the conference prizes for his work which had further fuelled his dream of building his own organization. Meanwhile the software company that Narang had joined as a programmer was split into two different businesses which became two clients for Narang�s team to provide technology services.  Reaping Rewards In January 2015 Narang was referred to the founder of a technology start-up in Canada�s engineering industry who was building an application to better manage and maintain machines. Through this association Narang met Eric Smith the owner of a start-up in the health care industry who needed help. Narang further developed the small health care application to the point where the company was acquired by a large NASDAQ-listed health care company and Smith was appointed chief technology officer of that firm. The success from this venture and the ability to build a major application from the start became Narang�s first major breakthrough. As ColoredCow continued to grow he recruited more expert employees. Five members of his team were deployed to work exclusively on the health care project for one year. However Narang continued to seek new opportunities in all areas of the IT industry. Although his focus had been mainly on web-based applications Narang took on a project for a non-government organization (NGO) to manage its social media profile. That NGO eventually became a regular client and Narang launched his flagship product ManageMyNgo. Narang later rebuilt the application in a partnership with the Haryana State Government in India. Narang insisted on creating a favourable customer experience with any of his clients. He believed that people considered client experience more important than any other aspect of the collaboration. Towards that goal he made sure to meet all expectations and to be open available and accommodating.As his work increased Narang hired more employees who shared his vision to develop his business. At the start of 2017 ColoredCow had 16 employees. He carefully chose new members for his team to whom he would delegate his work which allowed him time to develop new work opportunities. Services OfferedAs a web services company ColoredCow offered management services and applications including enterprise portals knowledge management systems information architecture content management systems transition from proprietary to open-source solutions and content migration. ColoredCow used pragmatic techniques to manage people projects and risk in an effort to create successful projects and teams. ColoredCow became a software development company for Internet and mobile applications specializing in web-based usability and business. The company�s strategy of offering good-quality projects at reasonable prices which had helped it grow right from the start continued to be a business asset.THE INDIAN IT INDUSTRY AND THE CHANGING SCENARIOThe size of the global market for outsourcing IT services was estimated at US$124�130 billion. As the world�s preferred choice for outsourced IT services India accounted for as much as 67 per cent of the market. With an employee strength of nearly 10 million the Indian IT outsourcing sector was poised to grow at 12�14 per cent in the 2016�2017 period and was expected to triple its annual revenues to US$350 billion by 2025. Indian companies were considered about three to four times more economical in their provision of IT services than U.S. companies which contributed to India�s dominance of the global outsourcing market.India boasted over 4200 start-ups and ranked third among international start-up networks. IT sector revenues were projected to reach US$146.72 billion by 2018. India�s Internet penetration had increased considerably over the previous decade enabling a marked rise in the country�s e-commerce industry. The surge in Internet availability provided the perfect conditions for growth in IT outsourcing. India�s health care IT market had also benefited from the enhanced Internet use reaching a value of US$1 billion in January 2017 which was expected to almost double by 2020. Similarly the country�s e-commerce market was projected to reach US$700 billion in the business-to-business industry and US$102 billion in the business-to-consumer industry by 2020.India also saw an increase in international investment in the country�s IT industry over the previous decade especially in the sectors of computer hardware software development and IT services start-ups. Between April 2006 and March 2016 the Indian IT sector received US$21 billion in foreign investment. In 2006 start-ups garnered 307 deals worth US$14 billion. In 2005 foreign investment for small and medium business amounted to US$11.6 billion. The market research firm Zinnov reported that this figure would rise to US$25.8 billion in 2020 based on the premise that nearly 12 million of the 51 million businesses in this industry increased their potential by using newer IT products.Over the previous decade the number of Indian start-ups had increased exponentially. By the end of 2020 more than 11500 new businesses were expected to enter the market and create jobs for over 250000 people. The unusually rapid growth could be attributed to favourable conditions opportune mergers and well-timed funding. Many start-ups in the IT industry that were now benefiting from great inflows of funds had endured more difficult times in the past so their fortunes had improved.However in January 2017 the Indian IT industry was feeling some adverse effects from the new political landscape in the United States. The U.S. market which was crucial to Indian IT companies was expecting major changes as President Donald Trump introduced new and stricter immigration policies that could have a considerable impact globally. Yet according to Ajay Kolla the founder and chief executive officer of a prominent job portal these changes could also work in India�s favour because of India�s �cost effectiveness superior domain knowledge and availability of quality talent� all of which were attributes that U.S. companies would find hard to overlook.CHALLENGES FOR COLOREDCOWColoredCow had more work than it could deliver in its current size. Referrals and repeat customers had helped generate generous amounts of revenue. According to Narang scaling up the business was a missed opportunity despite warnings regarding the complex processes and challenging funding requirements. Having an expansion plan in place early in the business life cycle was as crucial as starting the business itself he felt. Narang believed that a solid business plan with well-defined milestones and triggers would support growth and that his business preferred to focus on growth.Narang had found it easy to launch the business but scaling up remained a challenge. Usually small businesses had a clear plan that defined their growth and success over a specific period. However ColoredCow�s business was spread across too many IT sectors. The company was eager to fulfil the needs of a wide variety of clients which meant that it was still struggling to establish stability and consistency in its operations. Because it was a small organization a considerable amount of ColoredCow�s work was completed manually without automated tools to record the numerous tasks. Yet the company eventually realized that it was critical to assess and optimize internal tools to streamline its multiple operational activities.ColoredCow needed to resolve several issues if it was going to meet its self-imposed revenue target of _2.5 billion by 2020. Narang expected that the business would need 75�100 employees to achieve such a milestone. He also hoped to build a direct sales channel.

Copyright � 2017 Richard Ivey School of Business Foundation 					Version: 2017-05-18In December 2014 Ashutosh Garg chairman and managing director of Guardian Lifecare Private Limited (Guardian) went back to his office in Gurgaon India after holding a meeting with a group of private equity holders in his company. Founded in 2003 Guardian had become the second-largest player in the Indian pharmaceutical retail market within a decade of its launch. It was positioned as a friendly neighbourhood pharmacy and it served 7.5 million customers each year through more than 230 stores across India. Now Garg wanted to inject more funds into the next growth phase of the company.Traditionally the Indian pharmaceutical retail market had been plagued by several structural weaknesses such as the widespread sale of spurious and substandard drugs customers� lack of education and awareness a poor overall customer experience and low margins caused by the market�s highly fragmented nature. Placing customer centricity at the core of its value proposition Guardian had focused on addressing these structural weaknesses to build a successful chain. It found unique ways to engage its customers and keep them satisfied and loyal in an industry that traditionally did not treat its end-users as primary customers. As Garg prepared to take Guardian through the consolidation stage by opening 300 more stores across the country he needed to analyze the long-term challenges that Guardian would have to meet while seeking to maintain its high growth in an emerging market like India.Company Background Guardian Lifecare Private Limited was founded in 2003 by Garg as a pharmacy retail chain under the Guardian brand. Within a decade it had became India�s fastest-growing chain of health wellness and beauty stores with over 230 across the country and one new store added every week. Built on a strong platform of reliability and customer centricity the company had a presence in 26 cities and was expanding rapidly. Positioned as �the Chemists India Trusts� Guardian�s customer premise was based on providing �reliable medicines� in a retail environment that was uniquely branded. Around 2004 Guardian entered into an exclusive tie-in with GNC Holdings Inc. (GNC) America�s bestselling nutritional supplement brand. The alliance with GNC helped position the pharmacy retail chain as one that was more concerned with the wellness of the customer (see Exhibit 1). To position itself as a friendly neighbourhood pharmacy Guardian began with a unique proposition called Guardian Health Chronicle. This four-page health and wellness supplement was circulated for four years with the Hindustan Times and Dainik Jagran in both English and Hindi in the National Capital Region. Later Guardian Health Chronicle was changed into a magazine format and sold through Guardian retail stores. This unique marketing initiative helped Guardian stand out from the �mom-and-pop� pharmacies and organized competitors. Rural India continued to be a huge dumping ground for spurious and substandard medicines. In rural and semi-urban India Guardian positioned itself by the name �Aushadhi� a Sanskrit word for medicines. Aushadhi stores were opened with the idea of dispensing reliable and genuine medicines to rural communities. Thereafter Guardian launched its own private label called Guardian Brands. It had an exhaustive range of more than 285 stock-keeping units and the number kept growing. The range comprised nutrition sports nutrition vitamins hospital care health care personal care body support mineral water and diapers. The uniqueness of Guardian�s success lay in its focus on customer centricity which differentiated the company from its competitors in terms of improved customer experience.Pharmaceutical retailingPharmaceutical retailing was unique from other retailing in several ways. It was one of only a few industries that did not treat its end-users (patients) as primary customers. Pharmaceutical companies treated the doctors who prescribed their medicines as primary customers and the retailers that sold their medicines as secondary customers. Companies generally spent millions on promotions targeting doctors whereas patients who paid for their medicines generally did not feature in marketing plans. The traditional focus on doctors as the most important component resulted in a great power imbalance in the pharmaceutical value chain. All over the world pharmacy retail chains were moving from sick care to health care. This change brought changes in the role of the pharmacist who was no longer expected to only dispense medicines as scribbled on a patient�s prescription. Rather the pharmacist was expected to maintain the patient�s drug profile provide information about drugs and their use and offer support in disease management services. This increased role could become possible only when the industry became organized and was run professionally.The most important stream of income for commercial pharmacies in developed countries was derived from dispensing managed care prescriptions and this practice was developing in India as well. With increased access to cheap health care insurance Indians were spending more and demanding better health care facilities. With the entry of organized retail chains the pharmaceutical retail industry had undergone considerable changes. These chains provided a better customer experience in terms of ambience cleanliness air conditioning and store staff training. In addition they provided loyalty programs where customers got points for their purchases which could be redeemed at the stores. The programs also helped customers get attractive discounts at hospitals and diagnostic centres with which the retail chains had tie-ins. pharmaceutical industry in IndiaThe Indian pharmaceutical market was the third largest in the world in terms of volume and the 13th-largest in terms of value. It was dominated by branded generic drugs which constituted nearly 70 per cent of the market followed by over-the counter (OTC) medicines and patented drugs at 21 per cent and 9�per cent respectively. The Indian market was showing signs of healthy growth and was likely to be in the top 10 global markets by value by 2020. It was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 to 20 per cent and reach between US$50 billion and $74 billion in the coming decade. India was a significant producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulations. Its pharmaceutical companies included global players in generic drugs and vaccines. Most of the major players operating in India were multinational companies that were foreign-owned and were already generating more than 75 per cent of their revenue outside India. Robust economic growth had increased the buying power of India�s middle class and propelled the growth for health care services in general particularly medicines. Also the emergence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular diseases and cancer had increased the demand for medicines (see Exhibit 2).Evolution of the Organized Pharmaceutical Sector In 2014 the Indian pharmaceutical industry was primarily unorganized. With the entry of branded pharmacy retail chains the industry was expected to get more organized. There were a few big players that dominated the organized pharmaceutical retail sector in the country such as Guardian Pharmacy (Guardian Lifecare) Fortis Healthworld (Ranbaxy Laboratories) Reliance Health and Pharma (Reliance Retail) Apollo Pharmacy (Apollo Hospitals Group) Dial for Health (Zydus Cadila) MedPlus Health Services and Frank Ross Pharmacy (see Exhibit 3).Pharmaceutical Retail Market in India Several significant developments marked the Indian pharmaceutical retail market between 2005 and 2012 with the advent of retail chain pharmacies being significant among them. Consolidation was increasingly becoming an important feature of the Indian pharmaceutical market which traditionally was highly fragmented and unorganized. Foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in India was still not permitted and this was hampering the ability of the organized players to raise money for growth. The pending legislation on foreign direct investment if passed would intensify competition in the pharmaceutical sector. Moreover the widespread sale of spurious and substandard drugs in the country (the World Health Organization reported that 35 per cent of the world�s spurious drugs were produced in India) had forced authorities to crack down on illegal drugs. Subsequently the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare declared dozens of drugs commonly sold in India �not of standard quality.� Market Size and Growth Only 20 to 30 per cent of the approximately 800000 pharmacy retail outlets in India were run by organized retail companies; the rest of the market was dominated by traditional/local chemists. The modern pharmaceutical market had seen significant growth with large-scale investments made by Indian pharmaceutical companies since 2005. Consequently modern health-conscious Indian customers had numerous pharmacies jostling for their attention (and money). These pharmacies offered great choice to consumers. Various factors had contributed to the increase in pharmaceutical retailing in India. Sanjeev Dani regional director of Ranbaxy India and Middle East enumerated them: Rapid urbanization and the growth of the healthcare industry the introduction of premium high-end medicines the introduction of hospital chains�which has a cascading effect on healthcare delivery�the start of professionalized pharmacy chains and the ministry�s proposal to allow consumer stores to sell OTC medicines are all responsible for the growth in pharmacy retailing. According to Garg organized pharmaceutical retailing was in keeping with the trend toward organized retail in virtually all industries. With pharmaceutical retailing becoming more and more organized and a large number of retail formats coming up consumers had greater choice with respect to quality price and variety. Apart from providing an upscale shopping ambience at no extra cost most of the branded pharmacy retail outlets provided value-added services such as home delivery prescription records reminder services state-of-the-art pharmacies special diabetic care sections self-diagnostic equipment natural foods baby care products skin care and toiletries. Garg stated: �The credibility and emotional bond has to be developed with every customer and organized pharmacies are working towards developing such bonds. We go through a detailed process of checking medicines before these are put on the store shelves.� With pharmacy retail outlets emerging on a large scale local chemists seemed to be quite concerned about their future. Brushing aside their fear Garg said �The market is very large and both the organized and unorganized pharmacy retail outlets will co-exist peacefully.� The organized pharma retail segment was expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent over a period of five years from 2013. Besides being a one-stop shop for all health needs of consumers the confidence these retail outlets instilled in consumers as a source of genuine medicines gave them a competitive edge. However it would take some time for the consumers to switch from their trusted neighbourhood pharmacists even though retail chains held some clear advantages over the conventional pharmacists (see Exhibit 4). Considering this organized chains were in a phase to build a network that was future-ready. Guardian�s Value PropositionOverall Guardian�s value proposition was enhanced with a three-pronged approach: customer centricity backed by unique customer experience with the added benefit of value-added services (see Exhibit 5).Customer CentricityLong before the first Guardian store opened Garg had spent many days observing the buying behaviour of customers and the selling behaviour of the counter staff at various chemist shops. He found that every stage of the purchase process was unhygienic and lacked transparency. He cited the examples of chemists trying to clean bottles of cough syrup with dirty rags or blowing into paper bags or putting spit on plastic bags in order to open them just before a sale. This was unacceptable when selling medicines and yet Indian customers did not seem to care. Also the Indian consumer habit of not taking a bill for the purchase meant that if there was a problem with the medicine there was no way to establish that the medicine was purchased from that particular chemist. In rural areas most medicines were directly dispensed by the chemist based on the patient�s symptoms. Patients would be given one or two tablets which would be gulped by them then and there. The name of the medicine was never discussed and because chemists were dispensing loose tablets they could charge anything they wanted.These observations helped Garg develop a strong conviction that the unorganized sector would present a big opportunity for growth for any player who could improve on the customer experience even marginally. Virtually no organized player was present in the market and clearly there was space for a new player to make a significant difference. Garg foresaw a huge value proposition that could be unleashed if customers found the right ambience and levels of cleanliness backed by transparency in billing and adequate availability and reliability of medicines at Guardian stores. Based on these insights which many market research agencies had failed to gather Guardian�s foundation was laid. Customer ExperienceA pharmacy was one of the only businesses theoretically where every single person was a potential customer. A fallacy existed among doctors in urban India that by not prescribing the most expensive medicine the patient might think that the treatment recommended was not good enough. However linking �getting well� to the �price of the tablet� was a little far-fetched. On the other hand many doctors in rural India prescribed generic medicines where the prescription was linked to the cost of the medicine and the patient�s ability to afford it.A pharmacy was the only retail format that had a conversion ratio in excess of 85 per cent. This meant that more than 85 per cent of customers who walked into a pharmacy normally ended up buying something. Customers normally did not go to a pharmacy simply to browse. Thus monitoring the conversion ratio was important. Equipped with this insight Guardian closely monitored the conversion ratio in stores very carefully and if the conversion ratio dropped this was cause for alarm.Based on the insights gained by observing and analyzing the buying behaviour of customers along with market research Garg identified the following top five drivers of a delightful customer experience at a pharmacy: Location: Customers wanted easy access to their pharmacy. They did not like to spend much time parking or paying for parking. Customers also preferred to buy medicines from stores that were close to their home; stores close to their place of work came a distant second.Sales assistance: Pharmacists were generally the first point of contact for customers when they wished to understand which medicines were prescribed by their doctor and the side effects of those medicines.Availability of products: The general experience of most customers was that their chemist was not able to provide them with all the medicines that they needed when they visited the store. Given the large number of medicines doctors had to choose from when they wrote a prescription and the equally large number of new brands and new medicines being developed and aggressively marketed by pharmaceutical companies ensuring 100 per cent availability was always a big challenge for any pharmacy. At Guardian attempts were made to ensure that it provided as many medicines as possible and home-delivered medicines that were not available in the store.Trust: The problem of fake medicines was rampant in India and most customers were beginning to recognize this because of the good work done by the Indian government. Customers had begun to look at expiry dates more closely and to ask for a printed bill. However the percentage of people who actually asked for a bill or checked the expiry date of a medicine was still relatively low and as such the problem and fear of fake medicines loomed on the horizon.Ease and speed of billing: When customers walked into a pharmacy they wanted to get their medicines quickly and leave as soon as possible. They were generally not willing to wait or browse. While this was normal behaviour for any customer at a chemist�s shop the expectation of a quick turnaround was enhanced because most chemist shops in India were counter stores and did not give customers an opportunity to browse and look at other products while waiting for a prescription to be filled.To get the customer experience right from the beginning Guardian resorted to three broad approaches for addressing key issues that arose from time to time: (1) create a database for customer profiling and update it periodically; (2) categorize customers using demographic and psychographic analysis for customizing customer interactions; and (3) get timely and appropriate information for taking necessary actions.Value-Added ServicesGuardian enhanced its customer centricity and customer experience with tailor-made value-added services to suit its category of customers. These value-added services included creating new wellness categories like sports nutrition herbs and remedies sexual health weight management and beauty care�all through an exclusive alliance with GNC. The alliance helped Guardian position itself in relation to its competitors in terms of providing for the wellness of the customer. The wellness positioning was backed up by loyalty cards for customers like Extra Valu Card GNC Gold Card and Senior Citizen Card. Guardian attempted to cover each customer touch point and to maximize the value offerings by mapping the specific stages in the customer lifecycle so that the right message could be delivered to the appropriate customers at the right time. Guardian also attempted to understand what made companies lose customers and developed insights on what drove away customers. Indian customers were as demanding as customers anywhere in the world but they were willing to listen to the retailer�s point of view as well especially if sales assistants were well trained and their knowledge and understanding of the products seemed credible. In building a customer-centric organization Guardian tried to instill certain qualities in its employees as described below:  Tolerance: It was generally believed that most customers gave a store three opportunities. If they met with disappointment of any kind more than three times it was unlikely they would come back to shop at the store. Given that most stores repeatedly disappointed customers Guardian had been fortunate to have more opportunities from its customers. This insight led to significant improvement in the service levels offered by each store in the Guardian retail chain.Price consciousness: The Indian consumer was known to be price conscious. Discounts markdowns and other value-based offers were always picked up quickly. Guardian was able to differentiate its offering in terms of �value for money� compared to �cheap products of poor quality� knowing well that the price of the products had to be right but the quality must not be compromised.Avoidance of billing delays: Customers were not willing to wait for more than 30 seconds to get the bill pay and leave after medicines had been taken from the shelves. This became difficult especially if there were several customers in the store. To handle the problem Guardian created additional billing points. Also a small ledge was created beneath the counter in busy stores where medicines could be taken out in small plastic buckets and kept out of view of the customer. Complaints of billing delays dropped sharply immediately after such steps were taken. At the same time Guardian trained its customer-care executives to walk up to waiting customers engage them in a dialogue and talk to them about promotional offers of Guardian brands and other products.Not offering discounts: At Guardian discounts were generally not offered except in some government hospital stores or to senior citizens. However Guardian offered a discount in the form of loyalty points on all purchases.Smart ways of handling the non-availability of medicines: When a customer walked into a pharmacy and handed over a prescription the standard practice was that the chemist placed the prescription on the counter and then told the customer whether the medicine was available. More often than not if a prescription could not be filled right away the customer took back the prescription and walked over to the next store in the same market. To tackle this problem pharmacists at Guardian stores were instructed to keep the prescription in their hand and not on the counter. They would then tell the customer which medicines were available at the time in the store and offer to home-deliver the remaining ones in an hour.With this technique the customer would not be able to grab the prescription and walk out of the Guardian store to its competitor. The moment this plan was implemented the prescription conversions increased substantially and Guardian had many more satisfied customers. Garg emphasized that the custody of the prescription was the key to making a sale. Furthermore Guardian developed insights about what upset a customer and came up with six ways for understanding them (see Exhibit 6). Gaining such in-depth insights about customers was not something that just happened. It came from extracting insight from all major customer touch points and channels in the organization. Guardian gained significantly through its three-pronged strategy of creating a value proposition for the customer which helped in (a) developing Guardian as a brand through differentiated experiences; (b)�boosting revenues which resulted in both top-line and bottom-line growth; (c) improving customer loyalty; and (d) lowering costs by reducing the customer churn rate. ChallengesThe organized pharmaceutical retail sector was emerging in a big way in India yet the opportunity horizon and sheer size of the Indian market was too large for any sizable impact to be created quickly. The Indian consumer was beginning to accept shopping as an enjoyable experience. Consumers particularly the younger generation were willing to pay a premium price for the shopping experience. It was possible that over the next decade or so Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities or other parts of India would experience a significant portion of retail transactions through organized retail while in other parts of the country traditional shops would still be dominant.Organized retail players in India were constantly on the lookout for �adequately developed real estate trained manpower [efficient] logistics and supply chains and well placed legislation to support the growth of this �industry.�� The organized sector was at a cost disadvantage compared to its unorganized counterparts. Pharmacies or small entrepreneurs often did not pay taxes and employed child labour for home delivery and other such assistance. Even a law that dictated that pharmacies had to be air-conditioned was rarely observed. Every person on the payroll of an organized player had to be paid a salary and other benefits applicable under law. Thus high expenses and low revenues were forcing many in the organized pharmaceutical retail sector to adopt hybrid business models in which a combination of ownership and franchise stores was used to survive in the competitive scenario.Another model to emerge was the e-store model through which consumers could order drugs online. The Indian government had been lax in regulating e-commerce functions in India despite a pressing need for e-commerce laws. One area that was clearly neglected was the regulation of online pharmacies that were�blatantly ignoring�Indian regulatory compliance rules. A dominant majority of Indian online pharmacies were run in an illegal and unregulated manner. By 2014 many such pharmacies were already under the regulatory scanner. The Food and Drug Administration in the state of Maharashtra raided 27 online pharmacies�in Mumbai. It also ordered the filing of First Information Reports against Snapdeal.com an online marketplace based out of India as well as its chief executive officer directors and distributors for the online sale of prescription drugs in violation of Indian laws. In addition to high costs the organized pharmaceutical retail sector struggled with poor penetration in rural areas which needed to be sorted out to make the sector more competitive. Other issues were the complex distribution structure and fragmented nature of the sector which resulted in low revenues per store. The complex distribution structure�consisting of carrying and forwarding agents wholesalers stockists and sub-stockists�opened up several entry points for spurious and substandard drugs and the general apathy to embrace technology made the problem worse. As pointed out by several experts organized pharmacy retail chains going national required significant investment; as such spreading their presence across various cities in India was a tough call. Retailing in this sector was not just about the front end but involved complex supply chain and logistics issues as well.In the organized pharmaceutical retail sector the development periods were long institutional funding was difficult and there was little or no government support. The belief among top retail chains in the country was that the sector would see large investments coming once the current ban on foreign direct investment was lifted and joint venture issues were resolved; however that could be two to three years away. Being successful in organized pharmaceutical retailing in India essentially meant drawing shoppers away from the next-door mom-and-pop pharmacies to organized stores. This transition could be achieved to some extent through pricing so the success of retailers depended on how well they understood and squeezed their supply chain. Other factors included providing value-added services such as home delivery and the availability of a range of health care products equipment and consultants. A major factor was convenience shopping where organized stores had an edge over traditional pharmacy stores.The Road Ahead According to Garg Guardian was in the consolidation stage (stage 2) in the three-stage lifecycle of a company: build consolidate and grow. In the first stage the focus had been on building the first 200 stores through the sheer brute strength of the people at Guardian as everyone came together for concerted action and showed commitment in achieving the target.Implementing the consolidation stage in which about 300 stores would be added would require painstaking effort because it demanded strong systems to be in place to pull the organization together with a common sense of purpose. Supply chain issues were being given priority in this phase.The third stage in which another 500 stores were to be opened would require the organization to build mature systems that were tried and tested to overcome the daily problems faced by start-ups. The role of senior management would be once again crucial in guiding the company through uncharted waters as Guardian would expand in multiple regions in India. Strong commitment by the founder and top management was needed in implementing an expansion strategy of this magnitude. The focus of senior management would need a shift to managing the external environment well. Growth through franchising and acquisitions was an area that Garg was closely looking at to maintain Guardian�s lead as one of India�s fastest-growing pharmacy retail chains. As pharma retail was taking the organized route in India the opportunity to acquire and grow into a large chain was turning out to be a definite possibility. Though Guardian was one of India�s leading chains there was little hype in the media about its success. As Garg aptly put it creating hype had nothing to do with the resounding success of Guardian: �Let my stores do the talking and let my customers be the judge.�Exhibit 1: Guardian STORE LAYOUTSource: Guardian Pharmacy.Exhibit 2: PHARMACY RETAIL MARKET IN INDIA: DRIVERS TRENDS AND CHALLENGESNote: OTC = Over-the-counter; OTC or non-prescription drugs could be dispensed without a doctor�s prescription.Source: Adapted by the authors from Netscribes Inc. �Market Research Report: Pharmacy Retail Market in India 2015� SlideShare July 28 2015 accessed May 19 2016 www.slideshare.net/ResearchOnIndia/pharmacy-retail-market-in-india-2015-sample.Exhibit 3: KEY PLAYERS IN organized PHARMAceutical RETAILINGNote: _ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = _61.905 on December 1 2014.Source: Compiled by the case authors from the respective company websites and Rita G.

Steve Loftus was driving the 11-kilometre commute from his home in Springwater to his office in Barrie Ontario. Traffic was light and Loftus was reflecting on the way he had been coping with COVID-19 during the previous two weeks. He was also examining his options going forward for dealing with a situation that was unprecedented in terms of its fluidity and uncertainty.As founder and president of Innovative Automation Inc. (Innovative) a custom machine builder Loftus was facing a singular dilemma: How should he ensure that the internal channels of communication at Innovative remained open as its employeeslike everyone else in the rest of the province and indeed the rest of the worlddealt with an unknown virus? He was also facing a related predicament: How should Innovative enforce social distancing which had been mandated by the provincial government in its bid to contain the spread of the virus at its manufacturing facility in Barrie?COVID-19In December 2019 a cluster of cases of an acute respiratory illness known at the time as Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) had surfaced among residents of Wuhan in the province of Hubei in central China. Evidence suggested that the virus had spread to humans via transmission from wild animals being illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the City of Wuhan. In mid-February 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) named the illness “coronavirus disease” (COVID-19). On March 11 WHO declared COVID-19which had by then spread to more than 200 countries and whose cases numbered more than 5.9 million worldwidea pandemic due to its global nature. A survey of the first 425 cases in Wuhan found that the median age of the patients was 59 years 56 per cent of the patients were male the elderly and those with coexisting conditions showed higher rates of mortality and there were no cases in children less than 15 years of age. On March 17 the Government of Ontario announced that it was declaring a state of emergency in the province under section 7.0.1 (1) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and was using “every power possible to continue to protect the health and safety of all individuals and families.” The order banned public events of more than 50 people. In a related order on April 3 the provincial government designated 44 businesses as “essential businesses” that would be allowed to stay open. Manufacturing was one of these. Innovative could thus keep its facilities open.INNOVATIVE AUTOMATION BACKGROUND Innovative was founded in 1989 by Loftus and two others. The company manufactured machinery that was tailored to the specific needs of firms in the automotive sector. Having built up skills over the years in designing building and installing customized machineryranging from a CA$50000 retrofit to a $5-million high-tech automation systemthe company had expanded its services to move from the development of vehicle sensing systems to the application of energy efficient systems. It had also moved beyond the auto industry toward other end markets such as medical device manufacturing.The company had grown by building lasting relationships with customers and being flexible in responding to customers’ needs as well as on its singular value proposition of focusing on the total cost of ownership for each customer as opposed to the purchase price. A lower cost over the lifetime of the machine improved uptime and reduced repair expenses together compensated for the slightly larger initial investment for a customer. The custom machinery that Innovative built was hand-made and artisanal.Innovative’s customers were primarily within the North American Free Trade Agreement regionCanada the United States and Mexico. The company’s principal geographic market was Mexico which on the strength of the high standards and competitiveness of its labour force had become the world’s fourth-largest producer of luxury vehicles. In 2017 Innovative worked with the Business Development Bank of Canada to create an international business development plan centred on expansion to Europe and consolidation in Mexico.In February 2018 Innovative relocated to a new 63000-square-foot (6000-square-metre) state-of-the-art facility in Barrie. By then Barrie had become one of the fastest-growing business and manufacturing hubs in Ontario. With its residents’ median age at 37 the city was a hot spot for young educated entrepreneurs who enjoyed its big-city convenience picturesque landscape recreational activities focus on family and above all short commute times. With provisions nearby for hiking and camping during weekends the lifestyle offered by Barrie was a mix of city and country which many of its residents preferred.Innovative had a total of 129 full-time employees in 2019 up from 106 in 2017. The core operations team comprised three categoriesmechanical teams which were developing and assembling automation systems from the first bolt forward; electrical teams which were building wire systems; and programmer teams which were building control systems. In addition to full-time employees the company had between 1025 engineering or business students on a regular basis as apprentices. Over 40 per cent of the company’s staff was under the age of 30.Innovative had established an ongoing a partnership with a local college in BarrieGeorgian Collegefor hiring and training its students. The partnership gave the company first pick of talented graduates from the school’s engineering program and in turn provided students with valuable industry experience through co-operative (co-op) work placements. Rather than hire experienced people from competitor firms or make lateral recruitments Innovative believed in home-grown employees: choosing them directly from college supporting them through co-op programs and giving them hands-on training. Of late the company had also started hiring at the high-school level and financing these students’ education through the college. This was Innovative’s way of building an educated and motivated cadre of employees. In February 2016 Innovative undertook an employee satisfaction survey to get a sense of what working at Innovative meant for each of its employees. The survey results were used by the company’s senior management to develop a vision statement: “Be the first choice provider of automation solutions to global leaders in manufacturing.” It was followed by a mission statement declaring that Innovators “Lead globally: providing our customers with quality automation solutions”; “Lead the industry: providing our employees with a safe challenging and rewarding work experience”; and “Lead locally: enabling our team to enrich our community.” A similar employee satisfaction survey conducted a year later reinforced employees’ commitment to both the vision and mission statements.The management group at Innovative tracked various performance metrics in a bid to get a sense of the organization. These included sales forecasting shop loading project profitability cost overruns process changes in a project and employee scheduling. Floor space scheduling was an important metric as it was unique to the company’s business of custom manufacturing. Once a machine built on the company’s premises was shipped out after 1215 weeks the large floor space would be idle and it was important to ensure that it was quickly filled with a new custom sales order. This was unlike the typical assembly line operations of most standard manufacturing facilities.As part of an effort to diversify beyond custom manufacturing in 2019 the company developed a product called RoboTape. It was the company’s first attempt at making products for off-the-shelf sale. Standard products would have lower margins but they also involved far less engineering. RoboTape was scheduled for launch in March 2020 at a tradeshow in Detroit but this was delayed due to COVID-19. RoboTape automated tape application which was a predominantly manual process and could be strenuous and inconsistent. The product also made tape application speedier by enabling the tapewhether foam double-sided or feltto be fed robotically. The product consisted of two main components: a bulk spool feeding system known as a “payout” and a tape apply head. Innovative’s long-term plan post-launch was to set up an assembly line for the manufacture of RoboTape for which Innovative owned the intellectual property and had applied for a patent. The plan was also to set up RoboTape’s manufacture as an independent business and monetize it through spin-off or outright sale. Innovative was also developing a new platform to launch a slew of standard products from its premises.The company had sales revenue of $53 million in 2019 (see Exhibit 1) when its export sales exceeded domestic revenues for the first time in a number of years. The company was aiming for revenue of $80 million with about 200 employees at its current location before setting up a new set of operations focused likely on standard products at new premises. The transformation would require financial engineering and marketing resources. While the company could mobilize the first two easily it would have to sharpen its marketing skills as marketing had been limited for a long time to high-value custom sales. SARS PROTOCOLS Innovative had put protocols in place in early 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was affecting Canada. Like COVID-19 SARS involved an unknown virusthere was no prior knowledge of how it was being transmitted how long patients would be infected or how best to treat it. But SARS was only moderately contagious and did not turn into a full-blown pandemic. Surfacing in China in November 2002 SARS had spread across the globe within weeks. About 8500 persons worldwide were diagnosed with probable SARS leading to over 900 deaths. The Canadian outbreak in February 2003 was largely centred in Toronto; all three deaths in Canada due to SARS had also occurred in Toronto. There were two types of protocols Innovative developed at the time: (1) communication protocols (which set in motion bulletin boards and emails as the principal sources of employee communications) and (2) cleaning protocols (which prioritized several processes pertaining to workplace hygiene). As part of the latter the company had not only identified “common touch surfaces” requiring cleaning but had also made it mandatory for these surfaces to be cleaned three times every day. The surfaces included all tables and chairs; all countertops; all hand railings; all door handles; all phones; and all company vehicles including the steering wheel gear shifter radio dashboard doors and door handles.The protocols were updated in 2009 during H1N1 a novel influenza A virus that had been first detected in Mexico in mid-April that year spread quickly to the United States and was first identified in Canada in late April. There were several thousand cases of H1N1 in Ontario with 120 fatalities. H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on June 11 2009.FIRST RESPONSES TO COVID-19During the last week of February 2020—three weeks before the provincial and federal governments in Canada issued emergency orders—Innovative took a fresh look at its long-standing SARS playbook. The company had been executing its protocols rigorously on a daily basis. The cleaning of all common touch surfaces three times a day had also continued. A quick decision was made to keep all common doors open to ensure walk throughs and to pre-empt people from touching doorknobs or handling doors. Innovative also decided to launch a special COVID bulletin board to be managed by a senior executive. The company’s manufacturing manager took personal responsibility for the daily bulletin which was to relay facts and updates on COVID-19 as sourced from credible authorities including Health Canada; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a US federal agency; and WHO.The company also proposed to employees early on that anyone who did not want to work could take voluntary layoff. Four people took advantage of the offer based on age and pre-existing conditions as well as on anxiety over the situation in general. The last reason seemed common; several employees were frightened by the situation as it was unfolding and wanted to shelter at home. But they also wanted their paycheques.The management team decided to meet regularly at 3:30 every afternoon to deal with issues of common concern regarding COVID-19. The team set up a group of five employees to brainstorm about the health risks the company would need to plan for and to recommend proactive measures that management could take. These employees were to serve as the resource base on COVID-19 and were the designated “go-to” group for validation of a point of view. The company had invoked travel restrictions by early March. No employee would travel outside Canada without permission and those already out of the country either for work or for vacation would be allowed re-entry onto the company premises only if certified by their family doctor. The company created a sign-in sheet for all outstation employees; they had to review and confirm that they understood their share of the responsibility in ensuring the health and safety of company employees already in the building. Innovative also restricted the number of visitors to its premises. No salespeople would be allowed into the building unless the visit involved something critical. The result of these restrictions was that Innovative had only four visitors in the first two weeks of March. The exceptions were drivers from courier and transportation firms who were required to interact with employees in the company’s shipping and receiving department. Wearing personal protection equipment such as gloves and face masks during all working hours became compulsory for those employees. The company began preparing a list of employees who were not required to be physically present at their workstations and in late March it notified each of them that they could work from home. The notification had been preceded by groundwork undertaken by the company’s information technology (IT) department which had to ensure that the transition would be seamless. By early April Innovative had over 50 per cent of its employees working from their homes.The arrangement still left the other half of the workforce numbering a little over 60 stationed in the building every day. Many of these employees were in manufacturing and were required to work with their hands. One of the early decisions that Innovative had made was to stagger lunch breaks into three separate streams so that no more than 20 people at a time came into the lunchroom which normally held 160 people. People found the sight amusingthe lunchroom spread out tables rearranged 10 or 12 feet apart and only one person at a tableuntil it was no longer funny.The half-hour management meeting soon moved online. This meeting was meant to give every manager and team leader a sense of what was happening the progress being made that day and any issues that needed to be addressed. In the early days the meetings sometimes stretched for an hour. But within weeks of half the workforce working from home they were finishing 510 minutes ahead of schedule. There were fewer actionable items on the agenda. The meetings came to be more about communicating and staying in touch rather than making decisions.STABILIZING RESPONSESOne of the early problems that surfaced as employees started working from home was that Internet connectivity and Internet speed in the area around Barrie were not as fast as in a metropolitan area such as Toronto and its suburbs or even in Barrie itself. Many employees lived in the surrounding rural areas which had poor Internet service. While Innovative as a company could not do much about the situation it had to come up with options other than email as a reliable form of communication with employees. Alerts Delays in email communications were also caused by the fact that not everybody was on the company’s email roll call all the time and less so when they were outside of their workspaces. Innovative created a mobile application (app) that would generate an alert system akin to the amber alert system. The app was based on satellite communications and was linked to each employee’s smart phone. The company sought permission from all employees to have their cell phone numbers. An alert provided the most up-to-date information in near real-time. BiasesThe COVID-19 crisis had hit home at Innovative when the best friend of an employee’s uncle died due to the virus in its early days in Canada. The employee was shaken. A colleague working in the same room with this employee believed that COVID-19 was stage-managed and part of a conspiracy. She was becoming vocal in sharing her belief with others in the office. It was necessary for management to intervene and clarify that while individuals had a right to their personal beliefs they would have to be careful in articulating these with others however close the individual may have been with other employees. The task was delicate because management had also been noticing some biases suddenly arising at Innovative. People were taking positions both implicit and explicit. An employee biased against China for example was uncomfortable with media narratives that highlighted the Chinese origins of the virus. An employee biased against the United States for whatever reason would well believe social media accounts suggesting that the virus was developed by the United States and planted in Wuhan China. Misinformation What was being referred to as an “Infodemic” in medical journals by then had also hit home at Innovative. It was a term used as early as February 15 by Dr. Tedros Adhanom director general at WHO when he said “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.”Clearly there was a great deal of COVID-19-related misinformation in social media content. It was also clear to the management at Innovative that if employees were not receiving regular updates they would fill the information vacuum with whatever they had picked up elsewhere whether it was accurate or not. The company’s bulletin board which displayed authoritative information from credible sources was part of the arsenal to fight misinformation. But Innovative had to step up. A study entitled “Trust and the Coronavirus” conducted in 2020 between March 6 and March 10 by Edelman a US public relations and marketing consultancy firm headquartered in New York had shown that businesses had to be sources of reliable and timely information on the coronavirus for their employees. Based on responses from 10000 participants across 10 countries (Brazil Canada France Germany Italy Japan South Africa South Korea the United Kingdom and the United States) the survey found that 63 per cent of employees trusted their employer more than they trusted the government or news sources for information about COVID-19; 74 per cent worried that there was a great deal of fake news and false information being spread about the virus; 45 per cent said it was difficult for them to find reliable and trustworthy information about the virus and its effects; and 85 per cent said they needed to hear more from scientists and less from politicians.  However steering employees away from misinformation coming at them from several sources—including some mainstream media outlets that largely delivered what Loftus believed to be “opinion-based information”—was not easy.OPPORTUNITIES IN A CRISISOne of the ways of blunting the edge of misinformation was to promote positive feelings amid the vast negative imagery prevalent around COVID-19. An engineer at Innovative’s plant knew someone who was involved with delivering materials to first responders and paramedics. This person told the engineer there was a shortage of face shields at the local hospital and suggested it would be great if Innovative could dedicate a line at its plant to making face shields for the hospital. This was on a Thursday afternoon. The engineer got approval from the company and by Friday had put together a supply chain. He and two colleagues stayed overnight to design the workflow. They ordered the raw materials on Saturday received the raw materials the following Tuesday afternoon and had the prototype ready that night for quality inspection at the local Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre. The hospital released a purchase order on Thursday. Innovative produced 100000 shields over the next two weeks. The goal from then on was to produce 80000 shields per week. A team of 12 was formed to work full-time on the dedicated line. Manufacturing face shields presented an opportunity for the family members of company employees to get involved and many family members volunteered to join the team of 12 and work on the assembly line full-time. It was important from a safety standpoint that these volunteers were either adult children siblings or spouses of people already coming into the production facility and staying together as a family so that they would not pose a risk to other people in the plant.Children of employees were invited to create works of art displaying their appreciation for the commitment and dedication of frontline workers who were already being seen as heroes. Each face shield was accompanied by a unique piece of art done by a child of an Innovative employee (see Exhibit 2).Ecosystem COVID-19 was also an occasion to look outward at the ecosystem of which Innovative was part. Although the current contracts were stretched in terms of deadlines the plant was running at capacity. The machine shop was in fact running at 110 per cent capacity with 44.2 hours per employee per week leading to an overtime situation. A suggestion was put forward at the management meeting for Innovative to subcontract those overtime hours to one of the company’s small vendors struggling with a lack of orders. The suggestion was readily accepted. It would not only help the vendor stay in business during COVID-19 but also ensure that Innovative’s supply chain would emerge intact once normalcy was restored. It also allowed employees to look beyond themselves for opportunities to help others in need. Further it offered a new sense of the workspace one that everyone would take responsibility for guarding conveying the idea that a person’s workspace was more than their own; it encompassed the idea of everyone working together.  The approach gained ground when Innovative supported a sandwich shop across the street by placing about 60 lunch orders on two different days each month. The owner of the sandwich shop had been forced to close because of official mandates but could at least pay her rent with the earnings from Innovative’s lunch orders and thus stay afloat. It was possible that the shop would be able to reopen when Innovative resumed its normal operations sooner or later and when the ecosystem it was part of returned to its original form. The success with the face shields production fuelled the company’s initiatives in manufacturing standard products which had been put on hold. There were fresh orders for face shields from four hospitals in the province. It seemed easy for Innovative as a machine builder to set up a line to build one-off products. There had already been calls from both the federal and provincial government for businesses in the private sector to become involved in fighting COVID-19. For example on March 31 the federal government committed $2 billion to finance businesses that were retooling their factories to produce urgently needed diagnostic testing kits ventilators and personal protective gear. On April 2 the Government of Ontario pledged $50 million for businesses to retool their manufacturing operations for COVID-19 equipment as part of the Ontario Together Fund. Businesses were asked to submit their proposals for review by the provincial government. Simultaneously Next Generation Manufacturing Canada an industry-focused not-for-profit organization dedicated to positioning Canada as a world leader in advanced manufacturing capabilities pledged an investment of $50 million in what it called Supercluster funding to support companies in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic by building a Canadian supply of essential equipment products and therapeutics.Ventilators were in short supply worldwide. A ventilator pumped oxygen into the lungs of a patient who was having trouble breathing. It did not cure COVID-19 but it helped the patient survive until the lungs resumed functioning on their own. Innovative started working on a prototype for a ventilator. In contrast to a face shield a ventilator was a Class II medical device under the regulations of Health Canada meaning that Health Canada’s approval of the device’s manufacture and marketing was more stringent. Innovative was planning a basic ventilator that could work in emergency rooms where demand was high.CHALLENGESLoftus had to ensure that the essential work of tracking ongoing projects and running the organization was combined with the equally essential task of preventing the spread of COVID-19. But he had to balance those two priorities. Managing Employee Communications Loftus had recognized the importance of communication as new protocols were being stabilized. There had been a gap in communication for a day or two early on due to issues with email connectivity. As it turned out the gap was serious. Loftus sensed that this gap in communication had elevated stress levels for employees who were feeling isolated and looking for signals of stability and leadership. A corrective tool had been quickly installed in the form of an alert as described earlier. This had addressed the situation.A more important area of concern was the polarization being created by misinformation. This was elevating stress levels in the organization in its own way. Establishing a single source of truth at Innovative would serve as a bulwark against misinformation. The bulletin board and the alert were both helpful and effective but were they adequate? There was no way that Innovative could ask employees to switch off news channels at home and rely only on Health Canada’s online bulletins for information.Loftus faced three specific dilemmas around managing internal communications:Over-communicate or over-edit? This dilemma was typical of all leaders even in ordinary times; it took on a unique dimension in the extraordinary times that COVID-19 represented. Leaders had to determine the extent to which they could be open and honest versus the extent they needed to be guarded and follow a script.  Is the chain of command working? It helped in this dilemma that Loftus’ personal operating style—informal friendly and laid back—was in alignment with the demands of the time. However the same could not be said of team managers at the lower rungs of leadership with whom shop-floor employees were in regular contact and it was well known that employees relied on their immediate supervisors in making sense of the personal implications of any major change.Stay calm or display confidence? There was no rule book for this situation. In the face of a difficult situation if a leader displayed excessive confidence or appeared overly calm amidst difficult conditions he or she could lose credibility.Manage social distancing in manufacturing operations. Custom building a machine was a simultaneous rather than sequential process. Tradespeople from multiple disciplines worked at the same time on a machine: machinists did the fabrication welders joined metal parts electricians did the wiring and lighting plumbers fixed the pipes and so on. Those operations at Innovative now had to be turned sequential. A linear progression would lead to staggered hours and slow down the goal. The contracts would have to be stretched carrying the potential risk of loss of orders.  An important task from a health and safety point of view was to ensure that whoever was working on the machine wore personal protective equipment and maintained the stipulated physical distance of two metres from another person. (Typically employees often stood between one and two metres apart.) Loftus thought of a lighter way of enforcing the discipline: One of the founding partners of the company was short but had long hair. He was asked to stand with his hair straight up which extended the length of him to two metres and was photographed in that posture. The photograph was displayed on the shop floor as a gentle reminder of the two-metre distance that everyone had to maintain. Loftus himself walked around the plant with a fibreglass light-reflector sticknormally placed at his driveway in winter to show snowplough drivers the edge of the drivewaythat was two metres long. Everybody chuckled on seeing Loftus wave at them with the stick but were also reminded of the distance they had to maintain for safety. In addition workplace entrances and exits were limited to unidirectional flow. Common walking paths if less than two metres in width were signed as one-way passages. Washrooms had “occupied” and “vacant” signs. However even with these measures committing people in a manufacturing environment to social distancing would remain an area of concern until self-regulation became the new normal.EXHIBIT 1: INNOVATIVE AUTOMATIONREVENUE STATEMENTSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: ARTWORK BY AN INNOVATIVE AUTOMATION EMPLOYEE’S CHILDNote: Each face shield given to health workers was accompanied by a work of art created by employees’ children.Source: Company documents.

Meanwhile the stock price of MSIL kept increasing amidst robust financial performance from the company (see Exhibits 1 and 2). In the annual general meeting of MSIL held on September 4 2015 R. C. Bhargava the chairman of MSIL attributed the delay to amendments in the Companies Act 2013 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India requirements. On October 27 2015 MSIL finally sent a letter to all shareholders asking them to vote on the proposal announced by the board in 2014. The shareholders were given the option to either cast their vote electronically or send a postal ballot form by December 15 2015 at the latest. According to the letter sent to shareholders MSIL would enter into two related-party transactions with Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG). First SMG would manufacture cars and supply them to MSIL on a no-profit-no-loss basis for an initial period of 15 years. Second SMG would pay yearly lease rental of ₹49.9 million to MSIL for using the land owned by MSIL. MSIL management tried reaching out to institutional investors prior to the shareholders’ voting. In August 2014 MSIL hired Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited and Axis Capital Holdings Limited two investment banking firms to persuade the minority shareholders to vote for the proposal. Management also planned roadshows in Gujarat to explain the details of the plan and its benefits to MSIL to institutional shareholders. The proxy firm advisers were still not convinced of the benefits of the proposed structure. Hetal Dalal of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) in a letter dated November 24 2015 urged the minority shareholders to vote against the proposal. Dalal argued that SMC’s earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was lower than that of MSIL and that it had never made any business sense for SMC to operate the Gujarat plant. MSIL also had a large surplus of funds and the company would find it difficult to achieve the same return on equity that it had achieved earlier. According to Dalal’s letter MSIL would lose control of the company to SMC and the proposal was against the interests of the minority shareholders of MSIL. The minority shareholders needed to decide on their course of action before December 15 2015. They could either vote in favour of the proposal—in which case SMC would operate SMG as a 100 per cent subsidiary—or they could vote against the proposal. If the majority voted against the proposal MSIL would operate the Gujarat plant as its own division. This was what the market had expected prior to January 2014. The minority shareholders could also simply vote with their feet by selling their shares. According to the amended versions of Section 188 of the Companies Act 2013 and Clause 49 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India listing agreement MSIL needed the permission of only a majority (more than 50 per cent) of the minority shareholders.

Li’s organization published newspapers that were targeted toward the Chinese community in Toronto Canada. Li was requesting a long-term loan of CA$100000 so his company could fund a salary for a new full-time journalist. Adeel knew this loan would be the first long-term loan to TCG in over 15 years. Scrutiny from her superiors would be high so she had to make the appropriate recommendations for IBoB.TORONTO ONTARIOWith a population of 2.8 million Toronto was the largest city in Canada and was well known as the country’s centre for financial services. However with nearly 90000 businesses in Toronto that provided jobs for over 1.4 million people Toronto was also a technological tourism and media hub for all of Canada. Toronto was home to nine post-secondary institutions including five universities and four colleges and was considered one of the top 10 most liveable cities in the world. Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area were also known worldwide for their multiculturalism and diversity. Almost half the city’s population included residents who self-identified as visible minorities and approximately 50 per cent of Toronto’s population originated from a foreign country. People came to Toronto for many reasons including access to jobs education and the lifestyle the city provided. In particular Toronto was a preferred destination for Chinese immigrants. The Chinese community comprised over 12 per cent of the city’s population and represented the second largest ethnic group.THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING INDUSTRYThe Canadian newspaper publishing industry was made up of large national companies that owned local and national brands and small community print newspapers that operated in niche markets. Canadian newspaper publishers differed by type of reported news and frequency of published papers. In addition to print online content was a differentiator and publishers provided access to this content in different ways. Some offered free online availability; others required subscriptions. The industry produced $3.6 billion in sales in 2016 with an average profit margin of 10 per cent and had over 28000 employees nationwide including publishers editors and journalists. Canadians read news for two main reasons: to stay informed and reading for leisure. Although the number of Canadians who read newspapers was difficult to track the circulation of printed papers decreased from 35.6 million to 30.4 million between 2011 and 2015. The industry was struggling and expected to decline in revenue by a yearly average of 4.4 per cent between 2016 and 2021. Increasing online readership was the biggest driver of these trends. Newspaper publishers were now making approximately $15 less for every traditional print advertisement they replaced with an online advertisement. The news industry in general was also extremely competitive and had seen tremendous proliferation in content media such as blogs YouTube channels podcasts and other social media platforms that were replacing traditional outlets as sources for news. Moreover the trend toward online consumption lowered barriers to entry and caused the industry to become even more competitive resulting in the onset of new foreign competition to the Canadian market. In order to remain competitive in this challenging environment publishers had to cultivate a credible brand and attract good journalists who were capable of delivering high-quality material.THE CHINESE GAZETTE HistoryLi immigrated to Toronto from China with his wife Nancy in 1989 and started a newspaper in 1992. Although Li had no previous business publishing or writing experience he believed his passion for current affairs and his sense of civic duty to make wrongdoers accountable would help him succeed as a publisher. Li was forced to shut down his business in 1994 after being unable to produce profits. He took this time to read meditate and reflect on what he had learned from this failure.Two years later Li gave the newspaper business another try. With no employees Nancy and Li did all the writing publishing and marketing of the newspaper. Revenues grew every year until the global recession of 2008 when TCG once again was on the brink of bankruptcy. However Li’s financial savvy carried TCG through these tough economic times and revenues eventually returned to pre-recession levels.TCG became a leading newspaper for Toronto’s Chinese readers. The company was the third largest Chinese newspaper in Toronto with a weekly circulation of 26000 newspapers. Although Li was content with the business and proud that it had supported his wife and two children he believed he could make the newspaper even more successful. At 55 years of age Li wanted to improve the business so that one day his children would have the opportunity to take it over and provide for their own families. OperationsTCG’s headquarters were located in Scarborough a sub-riding within Toronto. The company acquired six employees who were dispersed across sales writing and editing graphic design and distribution. Li and his wife managed the business together and split the functional workload. Li oversaw sales. Nancy was the paper’s editor. Twenty per cent of TCG’s news was on China 50 per cent on local news 20 per cent on editorial columns and 10 per cent on investigative journalism. The newspaper was published three times a week and distributed at Chinese grocery stores throughout Toronto free of charge. TCG also maintained a website and a social media account on the popular Chinese platform WeChat. Readers could access TCG’s articles through both online sources. The company earned revenues primarily by charging businesses for advertisements but Li found that classified ads were also a strong source of cash for the business.CompetitionLi considered the publications 51.Canada and YorkBBS to be TCG’s main competitors. He believed both organizations attracted a growing reader base because they responded quickly to customers’ changing tastes for online content. While TCG remained focused on print newspapers 51.Canada and YorkBBS won market share as the first Chinese publishers to provide online news in the Toronto market. However neither competitor offered English translations of their Chinese-language articles which Li believed was a key differentiator. Providing articles in two languages—English and Mandarin—allowed TCG to give newly immigrated families the comfort of their native language while practising reading and understanding English.THE PROPOSED EXPANSIONLi also believed his newspaper was different from competitors because he encouraged TCG journalists to write about controversial topics and use their platform to hold public figures accountable which was a journalistic value that he felt other newspapers did not uphold. He told Adeel “I am constantly on the side of my readers. I have a passion for delivery and want them to know the truth.”With sales in 2016 of almost $500000 and strong cash reserves Li’s business was running well but he wanted to increase readership. He felt that several controversial topics went unreported; because he was occupied with operating the business he was unable to write about them himself. Li planned to expand by hiring a young ambitious journalist with a desire to change the status quo a willingness to ask hard questions and the drive to uncover the truth. A fresh journalist on the writing team with a mandate to exclusively report controversial topics could further differentiate TCG from competitors and ultimately attract more readers.With his daughter in university and his son working full time Li felt that their independence gave him freedom to take on more financial risk to support his goals for TCG. Bank funding would allow Li to continue growing the business and pursue his initial vision of TCG as a trustworthy investigative newspaper for the Chinese community. Li also wanted to move away from daily operations by starting and hosting a YouTube extension of the newspaper. He was well respected in the Chinese community and was regularly asked to be a guest speaker on local television news stations. However because of the operational demands of the paper he had to turn down these invitations. With a bank loan to fund a new journalist Li would have time to accept and attend these media appearances.  Historically Li preferred to fund operations with cash generated from the business and personal savings. After a bad experience with a bank when he first started up Li pledged to finance as much of the newspaper as possible with non-bank sources. He eventually took out a mortgage through a bank to fund the purchase of company headquarters but paid it off soon after. Although Li preferred to finance assets with in-house sources he recognized that in order to expand he would again need the bank’s help and was willing to take on debt. Li expected that it would take three months to find a suitable journalist upon approval of the loan. Although he was unsure exactly how much the journalist would increase TCG’s revenues Li estimated that annual sales would increase by 5 per cent (conservatively) to 15 per cent (optimistically). In line with industry trends Li believed that business was moving toward more online publication and expected gross margins to increase to 41 per cent of revenues the next year. He credited this subsequent decrease in cost of goods to reduced variable costs associated with online distribution which was typically less capital-intensive than publishing print newspapers. Li also anticipated delivery and freight to decrease to 3.5 per cent of revenues and utilities to decrease to 0.35 per cent of revenues because of reduced printing and distribution activities. He also expected professional fees to increase by 0.17 per cent of revenue to help make the online publication more reader-friendly and visually appealing. Li wanted to drive growth in readership; therefore he expected to increase the advertising and promotion budget to 0.25 per cent of revenue. If approved the $100000 loan would be paid back over six years with annual principal payments and interest charges of prime plus 2 per cent. Li planned to use the entire $100000 over the next two years to fund the new journalist’s salary with a planned annualized rate of $47500 for the first year (see Exhibits 1 to 5). DecisionAlthough Adeel had met Li only a few times she could tell he was a passionate and charismatic business owner who needed IBoB’s funding support to realize his company’s vision and expansion plans. However she was still concerned about the risks associated with issuing a loan to a company that was in a struggling industry. She also worried about conducting business with a client that had no prior relationship with the bank. Did this $100000 loan request deserve to be approved? Adeel settled in to review TCG’s file.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-06-08Moderna Inc. (Moderna) headquartered in Cambridge Massachusetts was a biotech start-up that had been led by St�phane Bancel since 2011. It was one of the front-runners in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca) among the other active companies in the race (see Exhibit 1). On November 23 2020 Moderna became the second pharmaceutical company to announce success in third-stage clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). Moderna�s announcement came immediately after larger rival Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech SE (BioNTech) had reported the third-stage clinical trial results of its own COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). Moderna had struggled in the past to find contract manufacturers for the production of its vaccines. For the production of its COVID-19 vaccine it had strategic partnerships with Switzerland-based Lonza Group AG (Lonza) and Spain-based Laboratorios Farmaceuticos Rovi S.A. (Rovi). Bancel commenting on Moderna�s manufacturing capacity said that scaling up manufacturing was �going to be bumpy.� Moderna required cold storage of the vaccine at _20 degrees Celsius and it was working on establishing cold storage facilities and a different version of the vaccine that could be stored at a milder temperature. According to the World Health Organization cold storage logistics were not well developed globally. Every year a significant amount of vaccines were wasted due to temperature management issues. In addition to the challenges around cold storage Moderna also had not yet marketed any other vaccine and had never established a medicine distribution channel. On the other hand Pfizer had its own manufacturing facilities in Kalamazoo (Michigan) and Puurs (Belgium) and Cambridge UK-based AstraZeneca had contract manufacturing lined up for development of its COVID-19 vaccine with Asian and European companies. AstraZeneca�s vaccine did not require cold storage and could be retained at refrigerated temperatures. On the consumer front according to a study by Pew Research Centre by September 2020 49 percent of Americans were unwilling to be vaccinated for COVID-19 and were protesting vaccination on social media. In November 2020 Moderna was planning to apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the COVID-19 vaccine to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Media sources expected FDA officials to meet on December 10 2020 to discuss Pfizer�s COVID-19 vaccine EUA and on December 17 2020 to discuss Moderna�s COVID-19 vaccine EUA. As vaccine manufacturers were getting into the competition of �My vaccine is better than yours� could Moderna ultimately win in the race to produce an effective vaccine for COVID-19? Given the uncertainty in consumer demand for a COVID-19 vaccine should Bancel plan Moderna�s manufacturing capability based on end-consumer demand or instead focus on seeking contracts with different countries� governments? BACKGROUNDFounded in 2010 Moderna had strategic alliances for drug development programs with AstraZeneca and Merck & Co. Inc. apart from several government agencies. The company had been named a top biopharmaceutical employer in the Science and Science Careers� Top Employers Survey for five consecutive years (20152019). Moderna launched its initial public offering in December 2018 raising $600 million and industry experts considered it biotech�s largest initial public offering. Since then its shares had fallen by 34 per cent due to the non-commercialization of any of its medicine or vaccines. Further by July 2020 heavy investment in Moderna�s messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology had still not made it profitable. However between January 2020 when Moderna announced its research and development venture into a COVID-19 vaccine and November 2020 as COVID-19 vaccine development progressed its share price increased by approximately 800 per cent (see Exhibit 2). In 2020 Moderna had 21 mRNA development candidates (vaccine projects) in its portfolio with 13 in clinical studies four of which were on a profit-sharing basis with Merck & Co. Inc.By July 2020 Moderna had received $955 million in funding for the development of its COVID-19 vaccine from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services. As Moderna�s investment in research and development for COVID-19 vaccine development increased its net losses also increased compared with 2019 (see Exhibit 3). In August 2020 Moderna had 25 employees.According to Andrew Lo professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management vaccines had the highest success rate (40 per cent) among different types of drugs but very few companies pursued vaccine development. Lo said �In fact right now there are only four big pharma companies that are focused on it.�  He added �A number of them have left the space and smaller companies have gone bankrupt or are not developing vaccines anymore.� This lack of vaccine development occurred because the returns on vaccine development investments were very low amounting to a few million dollars. More than 30 companies ranging from biotech start-ups to large pharmaceuticals were racing to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine due to the global crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmaceutical companies� key concern was balancing speed with safety as scientists worried about political influences on vaccine development. The longer pharmaceutical firms tested vaccines before launching them the greater the probability the vaccines would be safe and effective for humans.FOCUS ON A COVID-19 VACCINETo develop a COVID-19 vaccine both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech used mRNA technology (see Exhibits 1 and 4). With this technology �unlike conventional vaccines which are produced using weakened forms of the virus RNA vaccines can be constructed quickly using only the pathogen�s genetic code.� RNA vaccines worked �by introducing into the body a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence that contains the genetic instructions for the vaccinated person�s own cells to produce the vaccine antigens and generate an immune response.� Messenger RNA promised lower vaccine development costs as it was an easily replicable process. Bancel said �We call mRNA the software of life.� He added �You can copy and paste the information into a lot of drugs by using the same technology.� The implication was that the process for developing the mRNA was similar for all vaccines. Depending on the disease being targeted scientists needed to alter only the vaccine�s genetic sequencing which they could easily design in a few hours using computers. As scientists used a standardized process to develop mRNA technology-based vaccines pharmaceutical firms could use the same manufacturing process and facilities to develop different vaccines. Furthermore Moderna�s process used less expensive raw materials (water and enzymes) which also lowered the overall costs. In 2016 Moderna had failed to develop a vaccine for a Zika virus-related disease. Up until early 2020 Moderna had been working on a vaccine for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). When Bancel observed the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus which was similar to MERS�s genetic sequence he decided to shift the company�s focus toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine. When Bancel pushed for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine Dr. Stephen Hoge president of Moderna expressed concerns. Hoge believed that this focus on the COVID-19 vaccine could jeopardize Moderna�s efforts in developing other drugs that had more significant commercialization potential. However according to Bancel a COVID-19 vaccine would be a �once-in-a-lifetime opportunity� to save lives. If clinical trials of the vaccine went smoothly the company could be producing millions of doses ramping up to what Bancel suggested could be �dozens of millions of doses per month toward next year [2021].� Commenting on the potential of mRNA Bancel said �The reason we were able to do the vaccine in 63 days from sequence to injecting the first human is because we have invested more than $2 billion of capital over the last 10 years.� While developing an mRNA-based vaccine Moderna scientists used mRNA to carry a copy of the genetic sequence of the COVID-19 virus (also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 i.e. SARS-CoV-2) that prompted the human body to produce antibodies to that virus. The mRNA carried the instructions from a person�s DNA telling the cells what to do. Moderna synthesized mRNA with instructions for attacking a disease or pathogen.Commenting on Moderna�s ability to conduct trials a few days after decoding the genome of the COVID-19 virus Penny Heaton chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Research Institute said �It�s amazing just how fast we�ve gotten to this point.� She added �It�s like six years of work has been compressed into six months.� Some infectious disease experts such as Paul Offit chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Children�s Hospital of Philadelphia also expressed concerns about the speed of vaccine development. Citing the example of the Rotavirus vaccine Offit said the speed with which pharmaceutical companies were working toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine was the very reason for caution. It had taken pharmaceutical companies 25 years to develop a vaccine for the Rotavirus. After the first vaccine attempt researchers had to further work on the vaccine to remove its side effects. Until November 2020 no drug approved for human usage had been developed using mRNA technology. In clinical trials Moderna�s COVID-19 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated and produced immune responses in trial participants. After two doses the vaccine produced neutralizing virus-fighting antibodies in the human body. These antibodies were four times higher than those found in patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Vaccine researchers noted that some of Moderna�s COVID-19 vaccine volunteers developed neutralizing antibodies while others developed binding antibodies. According to researchers it was the neutralizing antibodies they were interested in. Moderna�s COVID-19 vaccine had caused minor side effects in several patients during the first phase of clinical trialsfatigue chills headache muscle pain and pain at the injection site. CHALLENGES FOR MODERNAEarly Challenges Moderna had in development more than 20 experimental drugs and vaccines for cancer infectious diseases and other conditions but none was close to being commercially available to patients. Historically it had been difficult for Bancel to recruit top scientists as Moderna had just $2 million of funding in 2011. In Moderna�s early stages a key concern for industry experts was whether Bancel and his research team could get mRNA an unstable molecule into human cells. Moderna had spent several years refining a solution for this process using microscopic capsules known as lipid nanoparticles to ferry the mRNA into the cells. Once the mRNA was induced the process by which it created disease-fighting proteins was less challenging. However when Moderna developed a flu vaccine during its early years several contract manufacturing companies had turned down the opportunity to manufacture the vaccine. COVID-19 Vaccine ChallengesFor manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccine Moderna allied with Lonza a contract manufacturing company with the aim of producing 1 billion doses a year. Moderna expected the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine to be produced by July 2020 at Lonza�s US manufacturing facility; the partners would then gauge the situation to determine whether it would be necessary to take on �additional production suites across Lonza�s worldwide network� in addition to the manufacturing suites Lonza said it could make available for vaccine production in Switzerland. In July 2020 the US government decided to monitor Moderna�s phase-three clinical trials and it wanted close monitoring of trial participants. Executives at Moderna resisted the demands of scientific experts to closely monitor changes in trial participants� oxygen levels which could signal dangerous complications for those who might contract COVID-19. While other pharma companies complied with this close monitoring Moderna considered the recommendation to be a �hassle� that slowed development. Later Moderna agreed to some monitoring. Thus Moderna�s launch of phase-three clinical trials was delayed due to its relative inexperience and its staff�s lack of expertise in overseeing the most critical phase of human trials. The US government did not face similar problems with established drug makers such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson who were also working on COVID-19 vaccines. Moderna denied any missteps but acknowledged �differences of opinion� with the US government experts involved in the unprecedented effort to deliver a vaccine within only months. Moderna clarified that its team included people who were experienced in running multiple large-scale trials. In October 2020 Moderna also signed a contract manufacturing deal with Rovi which was working on expanding its production line for the COVID-19 vaccine. With this arrangement Moderna intended to accomplish its goal of manufacturing 1 billion vaccines in 2021. Some contract manufacturers such as Texas A&M University mentioned that they could cater to the pharmaceutical orders for traditional antibodies-based vaccines of pharma companies such as AstraZeneca Sanofi SA and Novavax Inc. but they could not manufacture the mRNA technology-based vaccines that Moderna was using. Richard Braatz a chemical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said �The mRNA approach is the one with the most unknown unknowns.�On November 16 2020 Moderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine efficacy was 94.5 per cent. Experts believed it was a game changer as the vaccine had been developed using the innovative mRNA technology.THE PFIZER AND BIONTECH ALLIANCE In March 2020 Pfizer announced it would extend its partnership with BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA technology-based vaccine to efficiently leverage both companies� expertise and resources. Mikael Dolsten Pfizer�s chief scientific officer and president of worldwide research development and medical said We believe that by pairing Pfizer�s development regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech�s mRNA vaccine technology and expertise as one of the industry leaders we are reinforcing our commitment to do everything we can to combat this escalating pandemic as quickly as possible.Pfizer was the second-largest pharmaceutical company in the world and offered �medicines vaccines medical devices and consumer healthcare products for oncology inflammation cardiovascular and other therapeutic areas.� Pfizer planned to deliver 1.2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. Although Pfizer had been a later entrant in the COVID-19 vaccine development race it was the first to apply to the FDA for an emergency COVID-19 vaccine release.BioNTech was a company based in Germany that provided biotechnological solutions such as treating tumours in cancer patients. Apart from Pfizer BioNTech worked with multiple global pharmaceutical collaborators including Eli Lilly Genmab Sanofi Bayer Animal Health Genentech Genevant and Fosun. THE ASTRAZENECA VACCINEAstraZeneca based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom was working with Oxford University toward a COVID-19 vaccine though it was doing so through the traditional vaccine technology. Its vaccine used a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination the surface spike protein is produced priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body. This modified cold virus stimulated �both antibodies as well as high levels of killer T-cells a type of white blood cell that helped the immune system destroy infection.� Oxford University�s Jenner Institute started a clinical trial of the vaccine in April 2020 with 1100 people. According to Kate Bingham the UK government�s Vaccine Taskforce chair the leader of the AstraZenecaOxford University COVID-19 vaccine Sarah Gilbert had �leapfrogged other vaccine contenders to the point where it will likely finish vaccinating subjects in its big 10000-person efficacy trial before other candidates even start testing on that scale.� Virus experts including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci cautioned about AstraZenecaOxford University�s approach with Fauci saying �You�ve got to be careful if you�re temporarily leading the way [versus] having a vaccine that�s actually going to work.� Between June and July 2020 all three companiesModerna Pfizer and AstraZenecaentered into phase-three clinical trials. The likelihood of success for a drug moving from phase one of clinical trials to phase two was about 63 per cent while the metric was sharply lower at 31 per cent for progression from phase two to phase three. However once a company cleared phase three the drug�s chances of reaching the new drug application stage was 58 per cent. To manufacture and distribute approximately 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca collaborated with the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. the world�s largest vaccine manufacturer. AstraZeneca also signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments globally. The company announced that it would make vaccines available globally on a non-profit basis; it could thus limit the pricing power of companies such as Moderna whose share price had increased significantly in 2020 in anticipation of profits from the COVID-19 vaccine. An AstraZeneca spokesperson said �The vaccine�s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval.� However in November 2020 controversy arose related to AstraZeneca�s third-stage clinical trial results. According to experts the issues related to the vaccine dosage given to some clinical trial participants. Also the company had pooled trial results from two different countries Britain and Brazil. Experts considered these issues a deviation from the standard practices followed in reporting drug and vaccine trial results.SUPPLY AGREEMENTS Moderna and Pfizer each received contracts from the US government to supply 100 million doses. Both companies also received COVID-19 vaccine supply contracts from governments in Canada United Kingdom and Japan. In August 2020 Moderna received a supply agreement with the US government for an initial 100 million doses of mRNA-1273 soon followed by an agreement from the Canadian government to supply 20 million doses of mRNA-1273. In October 2020 Moderna signed a contract with the government of Japan to supply 50 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Due to the limited supplies of each vaccine available initially only 20 million Americans were expected to be vaccinated with Pfizer�s COVID-19 vaccine by the end of December 2020. The European Commission negotiated with AstraZeneca on behalf of the 27 European Union (EU) countries and secured a vaccine purchase contract of 300 million dosages with the flexibility of adding another 100 million. Under this alliance the AstraZeneca vaccine was to be made available to all non-EU countries in Europe. Bancel planned to provide 500 million1 billion worldwide vaccine doses by the end of 2021 though in 2020 the company expected to supply only 20 million doses. CHALLENGES DELIVERING COVID-19 VACCINES According to the World Health Organization due to cold storage logistics issues 50 per cent of vaccines were wasted each year. Cold chains in developing countries were so scarce that any vaccine shipment to these countries was a futile effort. The International Air Transport Association based in Canada claimed that providing a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 8 billion people i.e. the world population would require 8000 Boeing 747 cargo aircraft whereas Moderna Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines required two doses for complete effectiveness. Cold storage of the vaccines added to the global logistics problem as not all cargo planes were equipped with a low-temperature facility. Experts highlighted that this need for cold storage could make it difficult for two-thirds of the global population to access the COVID-19 vaccine. United Parcel Service began to invest in frozen storage facilities in Louisville Kentucky and Venlo Netherlands with the storage facility sites exceeding the size of a football field. These two cold storage farms had the potential to store vaccines at _80 degrees Celsius. Moderna�s COVID-19 vaccine required cold storage at a temperature of _20 degrees Celsius while Pfizer�s COVID-19 vaccine required storage at _70 degrees Celsius. The AstraZeneca vaccine required refrigeration at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. After thawing Moderna vaccines could be kept in a refrigerator for 30 days while the longevity of Pfizer�s vaccine after thawing was five days. Moderna�s vaccine was durable in regular refrigeration for 30 days because Moderna had mastered the method of strengthening lipid nanoparticles that were the structural backbone of any vaccine. Other techniques to enhance a vaccine�s stability included adding inert preservatives to the liquid used to store the concoction or modifying the nanoparticles� structure to better protect the RNA strand from deterioration in warmer temperatures. Some vaccines such as those for measles and yellow fever were shipped in a freeze-dried format and were reconstituted with water before they were administered. Experts were of the view that something similar was possible for COVID-19 vaccines. Juan Andres chief technical operations and quality officer at Moderna commented on the cold storage issue:We believe that our investments in mRNA delivery technology and manufacturing process development will allow us to store and ship our COVID-19 vaccine candidate at temperatures commonly found in readily available pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators. This was because storage in normal refrigerators for up to 30 days after thawing enabled normal distribution and flexibility to make wider-scale vaccination possible in the United States and other parts of the world.However after the struggles the United States had experienced regarding adequate supply chains for COVID-19 tests masks and personal protective equipment experts were concerned that the same issues could arise in supplying vaccines. Caesar Djavaherian an emergency room physician and the chief clinical innovation officer at Carbon Health said �There�s almost an assumption that once a vaccine is created and approved then everyone is healthy and fine but the operational component is pretty complex.� He added �We�ve never tried to administer vaccines to 100 million Americans in a short period of time.� According to media sources several aspects of COVID-19 vaccine transportation were susceptible to risks. For example bad weather could delay delivery flights; freezers on refrigerator trucks could fail; vaccine shipping containers could remain stuck on the tarmac; coolers could leak; every time a freezer was opened to move things in and out the stored vaccines could be harmed; or every breach in temperature control could potentially degrade the vaccine�s efficacy.Pfizer�s vaccine shipping system could hold up to 5000 doses of its vaccine at the requisite temperature of _70 degrees Celsius for 10 days as Pfizer intended to ship using dry ice. Pfizer was also spending more than $2 billion to develop its distribution network so that shipping of its vaccine containers would be on a just-in-time basis to the places that needed vaccines to bypass the need for warehouses. Although this strategy could help regional clinics and small hospitals avoid the need for storage facilities the availability of the required large amounts of dry ice remained a challenge. Pfizer was also working on a chemical formula that could sustain the vaccine at a less cool temperature. Aliasger Salem chair of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Iowa said �They�re [Pfizer is] working on a powder version that would have even less cold requirements but it�s a work in progress.� A spokesperson for Pfizer also mentioned that it was expecting to release a different COVID-19 vaccine in 2022 that could be stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. Although AstraZeneca required a chilled (rather than frozen) supply chain according to sources maintaining a proper chilled chain was also very sophisticated similar to frozen vaccines.THE CONSUMER RESPONSE TO COVID-19 VACCINESAccording to doctors and epidemiologists �herd immunity� would be difficult to reach as it required 70 per cent of the population to be vaccinated. Nevertheless in an August 2020 survey by Gallup Inc. 35 per cent of Americans said they would prefer not to be vaccinated even if it was free. A September 2020 study conducted by the Pew Research Center found that almost half of participants would not get vaccinated if a vaccine were available to them at the time the study was conducted (see Exhibit 5). Moreover historically some individuals not in favour of vaccines would spread rumours about a vaccine. For example when a vaccine for mumps was launched anti-vaccine individuals spread misinformation that the mumps vaccine could lead to autism causing an overall decline in demand for vaccines. In terms of COVID-19 vaccines anti-vaccine individuals were misinforming others on social media stating that the vaccine contained monkey brains or that it was a Central Intelligence Agency plot to take over the world. The record speed at which companies were developing COVID-19 vaccines was a genuine concern among people as it questioned such vaccines� safety. The US government was expected to respond to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines through public education campaigns. Dr. Francis Collins director of the National Institutes of Health stated �We haven�t done a good job of getting [coronavirus vaccine] information out there. Speaking for myself I think I underestimated the level of public resistance� adding �I didn�t expect it to be that widespread.� Michael Caputo an assistant secretary for the US Department of Health and Human Services said �We see more vaccine hesitancy with the COVID-19 vaccine than with other vaccines. We know that. This concerns us of course.� A spokesman for �Operation Warp Speed� assured the public that a public education campaign would �soon focus� on vaccine education. Operation Warp Speed was the US President Donald Trump administration�s �national program to accelerate the development manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics (medical countermeasures).� Chelsea Clinton who did vaccine advocacy work with the Clinton Foundation commented that the �power of the anti-vaccine movement should not be underestimated.� In 2019 the anti-vaccine movement was very prolific on social media for the measles vaccine. Clinton remarked �Unfortunately the anti-vax content is much more viral much stickier than the pro-vaccine pro-public health pro-science content.�In the past the United States had mandated vaccines unless they should be avoided for religious or philosophical reasons. In 1901 Cambridge Massachusetts mandated the smallpox vaccine for all individuals above 21 years of age with a fine of what was equivalent to $150 in 2020 for those who failed to follow the mandate. In the United States the last smallpox outbreak occurred in 1949. Legally employers in any industry in the United States could compel their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Even consumers could be mandated to show COVID-19 vaccine certification to visit any public place including restaurants and shopping malls.The ROAD AHEADBancel had consistently cast his company�s mRNA technology which he called the �software of life� as a breakthrough in the vaccine development�s speed and effectiveness. He said �We are not aware of anybody else who can do this at this scale with this focus at this speed.� According to Peter Pitts former FDA associate commissioner and president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest a New York-based research and educational organization in the development of a vaccine �Often the higher the boasting the lower the chance of actual success.� Regulators and a company determined a vaccine�s actual efficacy after all the evaluation of all volunteers in a clinical trial. Generally regulators and companies considered a vaccine effective if it had an efficacy of 60 per cent or aboveand efficacy above 90 per cent was entirely unheard of though companies such as Moderna and Pfizer had made these claims based on a very small sample. Maria Bottazzi co-director of the Texas Children�s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston said about the efficacy of several COVID-19 vaccines �Let�s wait until the final data.� She added �Let�s also wait to see the peer-reviewed publication that will highlight the science behind the press releases.� According to media reports it was too early to declare a winner in the COVID-19 vaccine race as it was unknown how the vaccines would perform on population demographics at large. What could Moderna do to gain a competitive edge over other leading pharmaceutical companies?EXHIBIT 1: LEADING COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATESNote: mRNA = messenger ribonucleic acid.Source: �U.S. Approves First Coronavirus Vaccine to End the Pandemic� Bloomberg December 12 2020 accessed December 12 2020 www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/; Katie Jennings �How Much Will a Covid-19 Vaccine Cost?� Forbes November 17 2020 accessed December 10 2020 www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2020/11/17/how-much-will-a-covid-19-vaccine-cost/?sh=6078a985576d; Peter Beaumont �Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine to Be Sold to Developing Countries at Cost Price� Guardian November 23 2020 accessed December 10 2020 www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/23/oxford-astrazeneca-results-covid-vaccine-developing-countries; Sissi Cao �Here�s How Much COVID-19 Vaccines Will Cost from the 5 Frontrunners� Observer August 5 2020 accessed December 10 2020 https://observer.com/2020/08/covid19-vaccine-price-comparison-moderna-pfizer-novavax-johnson-astrazeneca/.EXHIBIT 2: MODERNA SHARE PRICE (JANUARY TO NOVEMBER 2020) (US$)Source: �Moderna Inc.

He realized his company which he had set up in 2007 was growing and doing reasonably well in the Indian pharmaceutical market. By 2016 the company had achieved sales revenue of ₹500 million and by 2017 it had registered a 31.8 per cent growth over the previous year and achieved sales worth ₹670.2 million (see Exhibit 1). Kureshi thought it was natural for the company to set an ambitious growth target of nearly 50 per cent in 2018 aiming for a net revenue of ₹1 billion.He set the target for the current year keeping in mind his vision for MRL in 2020: a pan-Indian presence and sales revenue worth ₹2 billion. By 2017 MRL had a strong footprint in the western states; in order to realize his vision Kureshi decided to expand rapidly over the next year expanding into the northern part of India in July 2018 the southern part in October 2018 and the eastern part in March 2019. To do so the company had to answer a few urgent questions that would be key to deciding its sales targets: How should the sales organization be designed? What would be an appropriate sales force structure? Should the company opt for a generalist sales force structure or a specialist sales force structure? What was the optimal size for the sales force? What processes should the company follow to design the sales territories?company BACKGROUNDMaha Research Labs which was set up in 2007 with an initial investment of ₹3 million five employees and seven brands was a manufacturer and supplier of pharmaceutical products including included imports and exports. During its initial three years the company had marketed its products in eight sales territories and Kureshi had taken care of all the marketing and sales activities. The company began its expansion in 2010 by marketing 22 brands in 10 sales territories. By December 2017 the company had a portfolio of 50 brands and 75 employees. The company was committed to delivering high-quality international-standard products to Indian and overseas markets. It followed good manufacturing practices and all of its products were procured from government-approved pharmaceutical companies that adhered to proper quality controls.MRL’s product line included analgesics antibiotics anti-allergy medications cough syrups and a range of nutritional products (see Exhibit 2). Its product portfolio was focused and its distribution network was broad: three carrying-and-forwarding agents and more than 100 stockists distributed its products to customers through retail pharmacies in different sales territories (see Exhibit 3). This network gave the company distinct strategic advantages that facilitated both integration and consistently good performance in the competitive pharmaceutical market. SALES MANAGEMENT AT MAHA RESEARCH LABSThe company’s biggest promotional investment was its sales force—people who worked hard to build customer relationships with the right focus and targeting enhance call efficiencies acquire new customers and increase the accountability of resources. Kureshi believed that an effective sales force was essential for pharmaceutical companies and central to maximizing coverage improving sales and optimizing costs. He felt that a well-structured organized and forward-looking sales force would guarantee consistent revenue growth and profitability. According to Kureshi “a more organized and efficient sales force meant less wasted time and more productivity.”Sales OrganizationUntil 2017 MRL had thrived with a location-based sales structure and a generalist sales force. The generalist salespeople sold all the company’s products in their designated sales territories. This approach was similar to the structure of most competitors with a product range such as MRL’s. The sales team was divided according to geography. The major advantage of following a location-based structure was that it reduced selling expenses avoided duplication of effort and reduced the travel burden on individual sales representatives. The company tried to maintain parity between the number of sales representatives and the number of customers in each geographical region.Pharmaceutical companies that had specialized ranges of products for cardiology cancer and diseases of the kidney lung and liver preferred a specialist sales force structure. Most leading and multinational pharmaceutical companies were moving toward a specialist sales force structure as generalist salespeople might find it difficult to explain new complex and high-margin drugs. A specialist sales force structure was expensive and it involved duplication of sales efforts and increased travel time for the sales team.While MRL’s decision regarding sales targets hinged on past performance the decision regarding sales territories depended on the number of potential physicians in a particular area. As of March 2018 MRL’s sales force was made up of 50 professional sales officers (PSOs) and seven area sales managers (ASMs). Eight PSOs grouped geographically reported to an ASM. The ASMs were answerable to a zonal sales manager who reported to Kureshi. Each new PSO underwent 14 days of training at the company’s facility and all PSOs attended an annual week-long refresher course in the same facility. ASMs worked with each PSO for three days each month for field training and performance reviews.Role of a Professional Sales OfficerPharmaceutical selling differed from regular selling and the PSOs were the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry in India. They were directly responsible for both generating demand and ensuring an unhindered supply of products in their sales territories. In terms of demand generation the PSO’s role was similar to that of a missionary: selling by persuading physicians and other health professionals to prescribe the company’s products. This role included reaching out to physicians to share knowledge on product formulation usage and dosage; taking feedback about products; addressing queries and complaints; keeping physicians aware of recent developments in the industry; delivering samples; and building a rapport with individual physicians. The PSO’s job was to get more physicians to write more prescriptions to help increase sales revenue and profits.On the supply side the PSO ensured that products were available for consumers by reviewing the sales data and stock levels of retail pharmacies and dealers. PSOs were also responsible for product withdrawals due to breakage or expiry. Hence they acted as intermediaries between the company and its customers. The non-selling responsibilities of PSOs included maintaining records (e.g. client-information analyses of sales data) and preparing various reports (e.g. daily call reports expense reports travel plans and monthly reports). MRL also used its sales force to gather information on customers changes in the general market environment and key consumer insights. The most important skills and competencies companies sought in PSOs were good communication skills a result-oriented focus good product knowledge good negotiation skills and strong ethics.PSOs were required to make at least 10 physician calls and six pharmacy visits per day and a minimum of 220 physician calls and 132 pharmacy visits per month. They also had to divide their time between physicians in different categories spending 50 per cent of their time dealing with A-class physicians 30 per cent with B-class physicians and 20 per cent with C-class physicians. The PSOs each had 180 customers of which 50 were in class A 100 were in class B and 30 were in class C. They also had to achieve the required growth of value and volume targets on monthly and yearly bases.Sales ProcessMissionary selling was the main sales style used in pharmaceutical selling; thus a PSO’s role was to convince physicians of the effectiveness of a branded medicine they could prescribe for their patients. Missionary salespeople were also referred to as detailing salespersons. Detailing which involved discussing the features and benefits of products with physicians and pharmacy retailers provided a platform for physicians to learn about products’ indications dosages side effects and prices. Kureshi stressed the importance of the sales force’s effectiveness in the different selling activities; it was critical for PSOs to execute marketing priorities. PSOs were required to follow a disciplined planned calling system for regular visits to physicians pharmacy retailers stockists and hospitals. PSOs were also instructed to detail no more than three products to each physician in order to maximize the likelihood that physicians and others would recall the brand.THE INDIAN PHARMAceutical INDUSTRYThe Indian pharmaceuticals market witnessed growth at a compound annual growth rate of 17.90 per cent during 2005-16 with the market increasing from US$6 billion in 2005 to US$36.7 billion in 2016 and it was expected to reach US$55 billion by 2020. The primary growth drivers for the industry on the demand side were an improved standard of living increased accessibility of drugs the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases increased penetration of health insurance and a thriving export market. On the supply side primary growth drivers included a skilled workforce and low-cost manufacturing capabilities. The industry also had ample government support in the form of several key reforms and investment commitments.By 2020 the Indian pharmaceutical industry would likely become the sixth-largest in the world by absolute size. Some notable trends in the industry included increased expenditure on research and development (R&D) growth in the export of generic drugs (20 per cent of the global market) due to the national industry’s cost advantage value creation through joint ventures and acquisitions (more than 70 per cent of all merger and acquisition deals in the past three years) international expansion and reduced wait times for drug approvals and new facilities.The pharmaceutical industry was divided into four segments: (1) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) producers; (2) formulators; (3) contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS); and (4) biosimilar markets. The API producers manufactured common and generic drugs. These firms had low bargaining power and played on high volumes. However a smaller number focused on niche drugs and enjoyed high margins. With a 7.2 per cent market share India was the world’s third-largest generic API merchant. It was also the global leader in terms of drug master file applications in the United States. Most Indian companies started as API producers but with the advent of patents in 2005 and increasing competition some had moved up the ladder to become formulators (e.g. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited). While the API producers dealt with bulk manufacture of drugs the formulators made tablets capsules and other formulations. The domestic market for formulations was US$11.2 billion in 2016. In 2016 India was the largest exporter of formulations by volume and 12th in terms of export value.The third segment CRAMs was where India’s skilled workforce and cost-effectiveness gave a distinct advantage to this fragmented industry of more than 1000 players. The last segment the biosimilar market segment was small (US$300 million in 2015 in India) but was expected to grow to US$40 billion by 2030 as a large number of biosimilar drugs would be going off patent in the United States.While the top four players in the highly competitive Indian pharmaceutical industry held 20 per cent of the market share the top 10 companies held 39 per cent of the market share. The first strategy of these companies was achieving cost leadership through the acquisition of API producers. Second they invested in R&D to achieve differentiation; and third they focused on new markets or segments. The opening of the country to 100 per cent foreign direct investments and India’s attractiveness as a manufacturing hub meant that domestic firms would soon face tough competition from financially robust international players.Future opportunities seemed bright for the industry in India because of its genetically diverse population which would likely be a magnet for investment in the clinical trials market. Rising incomes were expected to increase the demand for high-end drugs which would likely pave the way for high-end drug production in the country. The rural market which accounted for 70 per cent of the population was largely untapped so there was high-demand growth there and firms were investing in expanding their distribution structures. However with the presence of innumerable pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical marketing industry in India had become hyperactive and this put pressure on the operating expenses of companies such as MRL and affected their future growth opportunities. Government price controls on many medicinal products further reduced the profitability of the pharmaceutical companies.MISSION 2020MRL’s target was to have a pan-Indian presence with sales revenue worth ₹2 billion by 2020. The company planned to build on its strong presence in western India and expand across northern southern and eastern India in three phases through 2018.Sales Force ExpansionAccording to Kureshi in 2017 India had approximately 900000 doctors distributed across urban semi-urban and rural areas in different zones of the country. Most pharmaceutical companies using the generalist sales structure followed the strategy of having their PSOs each with a physician list of 220 doctors meet 10 physicians and six pharmacy retailers daily. The PSOs with companies that followed the specialist sales structure aimed to meet seven physicians and four pharmacy retailers daily and had physician lists of 160 doctors each. MRL aimed to target 10000 A-class physicians 18000 B-class physicians and 7000 C-class physicians in each of the four zones. Its PSOs were expected to make visits to each of these categories of physicians at a specific frequency: they were to meet with A-class physicians every fortnight with B-class physicians every month and with C-class physicians every month and a half. MRL wanted its PSOs to work at least 22 days a month making the mandatory 10 physician calls and six pharmacy retailer visits daily as well as devoting 20 per cent of their time on non-selling activities such as training and administrative tasks. Following an industry analysis of competitors Kureshi’s team suggested that MRL should locate 75 PSOs in the north 70 in the south and 60 in the east with the intent that each PSO would achieve a yearly sales target of ₹8 million. THE DILEMMAMRL was poised to expand helping to realize Kureshi’s vision of achieving sales revenue worth ₹2 billion by 2020. While the company’s location-based sales structure had helped it achieve steady growth since its inception in 2007 would this same sales force structure continue to be successful as MRL expanded over the next year? Sales targets depended on past performances and sales territories on the number of potential customers in a particular area. Would MRL need to revisit the decisions on its sales targets and its design of the sales organization now that expansion was imminent and the ₹2 billion revenue target had been announced to be achieved by 2020? Would Kureshi do better to opt for a generalist or specialist sales force structure? While the existing sales model had worked so far would the expansion plans affect the optimal size of the sales force or the process MRL should follow in designing its sales territories?EXHIBIT 1: SELECTED FINANCIALS FOR MAHA RESEARCH LABS 2013–2017 (IN ₹ MILLIONs)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; ₹65.03 = US$1 on March 25 2018.

It had capacity for up to 300 people although at that time Qualtrics employed only about 60 people in Ireland. Plans for global expansion were aggressive—to grow the business by many multiples and to fill the office within three years. Ryan Smith the chief executive officer (CEO) of Qualtrics had travelled to Dublin for this event. During his visit he sought to discuss the approach to quickly building Qualtrics’s EMEA operations with Dermot Costello the recently hired managing director for Ireland. It was critical to decide on the company’s next steps. Company BackgroundThirteen years after it was launched Qualtrics a U.S. software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm based in Provo Utah was continuing to experience significant and exciting change. Established in 2002 Qualtrics initially focused on building sophisticated user-friendly online survey tools. After years of operating the company on little capital and steady growth in revenue and despite external economic effects including the U.S. financial crisis of 2007/08 Qualtrics’s expanded product offering experienced increasing traction in the market. At this time many cash-tight companies started to replace their costly market research contracts with cost-effective do-it-yourself online surveys. Seeing tremendous growth potential the founders brothers Ryan and Jared Smith together with their father Scott M. Smith and family friend Stuart Orgill took on US$70 million in venture capital funding in 2012 to spur growth. Qualtrics like many other digital platform companies had recognized a multibillion-dollar global opportunity that the founders were keen to capture. As a result of its continued success Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 to accelerate growth particularly in international markets. With the abundant opportunities that international markets presented Qualtrics’s management was excited but equally concerned about balanced and sustained growth. On the one side management was conscious of the economics of many software and online-service markets. In these markets the mantra was to prioritize firm growth over margins and cost structure—to “grow fast or die slow.” However the company was unwilling to accept that it needed to choose between aggressive growth and maintaining cash-flow positivity. Qualtrics was equally committed to both goals. At the same time Ryan was aware of the dangers of overly aggressive expansion after the company lived through the dot-com tech bubble of the early 2000s: We’ve seen companies “fuel the jet.” They put the gas line in the jet [secure major funding from venture capitalists] and they’re paying for the gas and they let it fly. Hopefully one day it’ll fly on its own and you can pull the gas line out. But if they got to hold the line out before that thing is ready to fly it all falls. We’ve seen that in the dot-com bubble. Indeed Qualtrics needed to make some difficult and far-reaching decisions regarding its international expansion especially in relation to its expansion in the EMEA region and the expansion of its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland. The company principals wanted to play their cards right by focusing on the most lucrative opportunities within the EMEA region. Also management including Costello was aware of the immense task ahead to quickly develop its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland from which most of its EMEA expansion would be driven and coordinated. industry backgroundThe versatility and disruptive nature of online survey software delivered as cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) enabled firms to compete and indeed disrupt different markets. An industry born within the digital age online survey software provided an electronic platform for survey development use and analysis for market research product testing and customer satisfaction. Qualtrics had chosen to focus on three markets: market research customer experience and employee insights (see Exhibit 1). The market research industry was fundamentally premised on enabling firms to acquire additional information and insights on their target market; consumer preferences for products or product innovations; and potential needs of firms’ existing or future customer base. On the other hand customer experience management related to the process by which firms developed an understanding of consumers’ perception of their product and/or service to build a more extended relationship with their consumer base including operationalizing responses to customer feedback. Finally employee insights allowed firms to gauge the level of engagement among their employees evaluate and review their performance and acquire insights into potential opportunities for growth and development. These three markets showed evidence of strong growth as firms sought to become more data-driven in their decision making by integrating technological methods to gather process and analyze data in a more comprehensive and instantaneous manner. Online methods of collecting data facilitated the capture of a broader respondent base than was feasible with existing manual methods especially as the digital revolution had led to a greater use of mobile devices to complete surveys online. Moreover all of these markets could be disrupted by new technologies as many of these tasks were traditionally performed by administrative functions or outsourced to expensive third-party providers. In this respect Ryan estimated that companies spent $30 billion annually on outsourcing research projects to consulting firms. Depending on the market Qualtrics faced different competitors. In one sense Qualtrics had no direct competitors because no other company offered the full suite of products that could bring together insights from multiple internal functions to deliver holistic business insights that cut across market research employee insights and customer experience. In another sense Qualtrics had many competitors because it was competing on three separate fronts: customer experience employee insights and market research. Although Qualtrics was aware of competitors its leadership was clear that they did not pay much attention to them and remained focused on forging their own road. growth of Qualtrics The roots of Qualtrics dated back to the 1990s when Scott M. Smith then a professor of marketing at Brigham Young University became passionate about using the Internet to speed up market research (see Exhibit 2). Ryan in his early twenties at the time started to work on developing his father’s idea in the basement of the family home. Their goal was simple: to make sophisticated research simple using an online survey product. In pursuit of this goal they crammed racks of servers into closets of their home resulting in frequent power outages until eventually they bought a generator on eBay and located it in their garden. The current management imagined that many candidates who were invited for an interview with Qualtrics in the early days of operation never appeared spooked by the odd-sounding instruction to walk around the house to the basement door. Despite their idiosyncratic office space by 2006 Qualtrics was generating $1.3 million in revenue with 15 staff while still working from the basement of the Smith home. These early years and the experience of working with little capital embedded a deep sense of frugality and “scrappiness” in the company. The Qualtrics ProductIn terms of its product the Qualtrics offering was renowned for its sophistication ease of use and functionality. Initially Qualtrics focused on a niche market—universities—which in many ways was a result of Scott Smith’s personal experience. This target market allowed Qualtrics to build a top-notch online survey product by responding to the preferences and functionality requirements of demanding users— academic researchers. Although universities remained an important segment for Qualtrics it now served the three markets outlined above: market research customer experience and employee insights. Its SaaS offering was positioned as an insights platform built around value propositions that helped businesses gather data that would enable better business decisions. Most of Qualtrics’s revenues came from business customers including such major companies as JetBlue GE Yahoo and healthcare.gov. Ryan the CEO of Qualtrics emphasized that the advantage of the company’s offering related to it being an easy-to-use platform that didn’t require significant training or support thereby enabling all users to gather valuable insights for their organizations. In addition one of his favourite selling points was the product’s capacity to provide rapid-response insights or “fast data” to inform companies’ decision making instead of an overreliance on backward-looking approaches such as “big data.” The strategy seemed to pay off. Qualtrics started to gain more traction in markets than its competitors and generated substantial growth in revenues. In 2015 Qualtrics had more than 7000 clients running an average of more than 2 million surveys a day on the platform and the company was cash-flow positive. Having focused primarily on its U.S. expansion Qualtrics opened additional offices in Washington DC (in 2014) and Dallas (in 2015). Qualtrics’s Organizational CultureQualtrics management believed that it had created a special organization. Its unique characteristics included its customer orientation and sales culture. The goal was to have everyone focused on the customer. For example during the early days of the company if a customer called for assistance and had to wait longer than three rings for the phone to be answered a red siren flashed and low-pitched bells rang in the office alerting the entire company to drop what they were doing to pick up the phone and help a customer. The workplace also had a distinctly casual atmosphere where employees wandered around in jeans and T-shirts and employees described the organization as “fun” “energizing” and “stylishly nerdy.” At the same time Qualtrics was extremely results-driven with a heads-down hard-working approach. Ryan was a great believer in radical transparency and ensured that vast information on critical decisions and day-to-day operations were accessible to everyone within the organization. This transparency included for example visibility of employee performance allowing staff to approach top performers to learn from their expertise. On the Qualtrics intranet available to any company employee each team and department listed its quarterly goals; and each individual from the CEO to the newest intern listed their weekly activities and reported on how they had done the previous week. Hiring talented people with a tight person-organization fit was critical to Qualtrics management to ensure a high level of brainpower was available within the organization to work out any business challenge or problem. Although Ryan was not concerned about the culture of Qualtrics changing as the firm expanded he wanted to ensure that every decision made within the company bettered the organization. Given the rapidness of change in the technology industry Ryan also knew that Qualtrics needed to remain entrepreneurial and innovative: “We were successful in the basement we built a profitable company that’s valued over a billion dollars. . . . But we know that none of that’s going to matter anymore. How are we going to compete in the future? Our business is really like many start-ups in a row.” As Qualtrics focused on international expansion embedding entrepreneurship in its international offices to the same degree as it was part of the culture at the headquarters in Utah was integral to delivering on its long-term vision. Qualtrics’s Sales ModelThe heart of Qualtrics was its engineering and development department where new products were innovated. In addition Qualtrics had developed a large high-performing and proactive sales organization that was responsible for much of the company’s progress thus far. Indeed management believed that Qualtrics succeeded first and foremost because of a great product and an unparalleled sales force. Qualtrics largely used an inside-sales model whereby salespeople located in the organization’s offices engaged remotely with the customers over the phone. This cost-effective approach originated out of necessity during the early years of Qualtrics when there were insufficient funds for travelling to meet with customers face to face. Although Qualtrics had an effective inside-sales machine and trained young motivated graduates into their sales roles the reliance on an inside-sales model could face limitations when dealing with large businesses for high-value and more complex enterprise deals where personal interactions were critical to closing deals. Qualtrics management was also aware that many competitors invested in hiring seasoned field sales executives and that its inside-sales model might need adaptation when serving international markets on a larger scale and with greater geographic scope.Qualtrics FundingIn 2006 Qualtrics moved into a more conventional office space in Provo. In light of steady revenue growth Ryan convinced his brother Jared to join the company in 2009 to oversee the engineering and product efforts. It wasn’t an easy task as it required Jared acclaimed to be one of the elite engineers in Silicon Valley to quit a senior high-powered job at Google where he had previously helped in setting up the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. Jared had for example worked for several years in Beijing to help run the Google China office. During this period Ryan also warmed to the idea of seeking venture capital funding to support Qualtrics’s next growth phase. Pursuing venture capital funding was a far-reaching decision for the four founders who had treated their equity as gold and strongly preferred to maintain their financial and operational independence. Moreover as the company was not necessarily in need of cash this decision altered its approach to seeking investment. In fact Qualtrics was in such a strong position that it had its choice of experienced investors who would act as a sounding board for major decisions. In 2012 Qualtrics signed a deal with Accel Partner’s Ryan Sweeney (whom Ryan Smith had known for three years) and Sequoia Capital’s Bryan Schreier (whom Jared had known for seven years and was part of the team that had set up and scaled Google’s EMEA operations). Both Ryan Sweeney and Schreier became Qualtrics board members. The two venture capital firms offered to invest $100 million but Qualtrics ultimately decided to scale it back to $70 million. To further accelerate growth Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 led by Insight Venture Partners Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital. This deal valued Qualtrics at more than $1 billion. Rapid international expansion Ryan had a strong vision of Qualtrics becoming a global firm. However in 2013 only 3 per cent of revenues came from outside the United States with 10 per cent of Qualtrics customers located in Europe. Before Qualtrics expanded to Europe multilingual sales reps would work European hours in the Provo headquarters starting their sales duties early in the morning to bridge the time zone differences between the United States and Europe. This model followed Qualtrics’s philosophy of “nail it then scale it” so when the decision was made to expand internationally there was already a strong base group of customers and referrals ready to go. Initially Qualtrics opened a small office in Dublin in fall 2013. Dublin was an attractive location for Qualtrics because of the city’s technology ecosystem the availability of a multilingual and well-educated workforce and its proven track record as an EMEA regional headquarters location for technology firms such as Google Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter. Believing in the “nail it then scale it” model the Dublin office initially served as an experiment with one person working from the cheapest office that Qualtrics could find to prove the potential in the EMEA market. Around this time Costello a seasoned executive experienced in developing regional operations for software firms was hired to oversee this expansion. Similarly John D’Agostino an experienced executive in growing and leading international sales operations was hired as executive vice president of Global Sales at headquarters. The Dublin office quickly grew so much so that it ran out of space! In May 2015 about 20 months after first locating to Dublin Qualtrics Dublin moved into a large office in a prime city centre location.  At this time Qualtrics employed 700 people most of them at the Provo headquarters and had 60 people working in the Dublin offices. Both the Provo and Dublin offices were ready to scale up: wide expanses of open floor space were ready to be filled with new hires. The Dublin office had capacity for 300 employees. Although Dublin was thus far the only international Qualtrics office Qualtrics management saw opportunities beyond the EMEA region. One of its next moves for example was to set up an office in Sydney Australia. At this time Ryan mentioned: “I feel we’re only 10% of where we can go” and it was his intention to “go big.” Qualtrics was in “hyper-growth mode” and ready to scale and grow aggressively internationally. Ryan and Costello weren’t interested in cautious and slow international growth typical for many other firms. Rather they wanted to capture the potential illustrated by the Dublin office and internationalize across the EMEA region at a highly accelerated pace. It was their target for EMEA to generate 30 per cent of total revenue in five years which would require a yearly growth by many multiples. Ryan was committed to taking a “big bet.”The Next StepsIt was now Costello’s task to deliver on these bullish targets for the EMEA region and he knew that a clever approach was needed to achieve these goals. A couple of decisions had to be made. By May 2015 the Dublin office performed sales (mostly inside sales and field sales) and support activities and it relied on the U.S. headquarters to supply the other value chain activities such as product engineering localization marketing and financial/legal undertakings. However it seemed that the existing structure could quickly become inadequate. To support such a significant EMEA business a largely self-sufficient European business would be required whereby Dublin was the hub with satellite offices in selected countries across the region. This model raised the question of which value chain functions Costello should prioritize in developing and the optimal time for building out these functions. For example although Qualtrics had started to localize its software for some European markets as expansion broadened more country-localized versions needed to be added. Doing so involved not only translation challenges but also technical adjustments. For example within the online platform tailoring the system to a European audience required specific additions such as ensuring the appropriate punctuations for decimal-denominated numbers and Microsoft Excel integrations. Within the current model such localization requests needed to be sent to headquarters as was the case for marketing legal and finance support. Given the growth of the business in EMEA these requests became more frequent. Dublin time was seven hours ahead of the time in Provo Utah thereby requiring extensive efforts to manage the time zone differences. Another activity was recruitment which was currently handled by a local external provider. However given the importance of recruiting the appropriate talent (and much of it in a short time period) questions arose about whether this hiring should be performed in-house. Yet doing so would require significant investment and diverting resources from building out the sales team which was ultimately the key driver for revenue generation. Questions also surrounded the scalability of an intense on-boarding program that often saw new hires spending some time in the Provo offices. Also when setting up the EMEA headquarters Qualtrics saw the value in experimenting with different country markets using small-scale efforts initially to gauge the receptiveness of various country markets to its offering. Costello and his team also had a feeling that large markets and countries that were early adopters of technology would be high-potential opportunities. They noticed that the EMEA market was generally receptive; however certain countries seemed to be easier to crack than others and Qualtrics saw early wins from its initial efforts. In addition certain countries were sensitive about data security and showed some reservation toward SaaS offerings while customers in other countries were price-sensitive and hesitant to pay price premiums. To effectively allocate resources a more selective approach was required that prioritized certain markets. This approach would allow Costello to focus resources and build sales and support teams for countries that showed the greatest potential. The issue was how to prioritize this approach to ensure the most lucrative markets were selected first (see Exhibit 3 for a list of some countries and indicators). Also certain urban areas such as London (United Kingdom) seemed particularly attractive given some significant customer wins and the presence of many large firms within a tight geographic radius. Decisions also needed to be made in relation to the company’s go-to-market approach. For example in Eastern European markets the Qualtrics pricing model positioned in the middle to upper market was perceived by many companies as uncompetitive leading to questions of adaptation. Moreover if Qualtrics envisioned larger and more complex deals with enterprise customers would it be sufficient to rely mostly on a young inside sales team or would it be worthwhile to hire more seasoned sales reps and open offices across Europe to avoid time-consuming travel between Dublin and the European locations? Last but not least retaining the entrepreneurial culture was paramount including in particular the entrepreneurial “scrappiness” and “self-service” culture that was at the heart of Qualtrics. Yet transitioning toward a multinational corporation would increase not only the scale of the business but also its internal complexity which could hamper the flexibility nimbleness and agility needed to continuously recognize and exploit opportunities. This internal complexity also raised the question of how these entrepreneurial cultural values could be deeply embedded within a rapidly growing EMEA business where structures and processes needed to be developed to grow the business and integrate a considerable number of new hires.As Ryan and Costello celebrated the opening of their new office in Dublin Costello was highly cognizant that he needed to quickly decide on and execute Qualtrics’s next steps to pave the way for delivering on the ambitious growth targets for the EMEA region.Exhibit 1: Qualtrics’s target markets Source: “Customer Experience” Qualtrics 2016 accessed January 15 2017 https://www.qualtrics.com/customer-experience/.Exhibit 2: Qualtrics’S national and international expansion Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: Country indicators for qualtrics’s expansion plans (2014)Note: GDP = gross domestic product; SaaS = software as a service; unless otherwise indicated the information indicated for this sub-region refers to the average of the included countries.Source: Created by the authors using: “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD; “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG; Doing Business Understanding Regulations for Small and Medium Enterprises (Washington D.C.: World Bank) 2013 accessed January 15 2017 www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2014; “Travel Math Calculator” Travel Math accessed January 15 2017 www.travelmath.com/; information provided by Qualtrics management.Endnotes

Liberty was an insurance company in South Africa and part of Liberty Holdings a leading financial-services group with representation in 24 countries across the African continent. As he drove along the highway he was aware of the ramshackle housing that lined the tarmac. He felt grateful for his recent exposure to this side of the city that had less privileged communities living there and wished more people could have exposure to these communities. He was considering the dilemma of how to encourage more business leaders at Liberty to get involved and ultimately contribute to improving the country’s public-education system.Traditionally the budget for community development would come from his company’s corporate social investment (CSI) budget. In Terblanche’s case however the opportunity to partner with a secondary school principal in an underprivileged school was less like CSI and more like a unique leadership and personal-development journey. Terblanche wished that more of his colleagues could have access to this opportunity for personal growth through the non-profit organization Partners for Possibility (PfP). He realized that he could encourage business units to use their marketing budget to sponsor individual managers to participate. That would mean using the schools’ infrastructure for brand-marketing purposes to justify the investment. He considered the implications (particularly the ethical implications) of using the schools in the company’s corporate marketing strategy.BackgroundOn arriving at the school Terblanche was greeted with smiling faces and felt welcomed. He noticed the well-kept lawn and colourful flower beds not at all what he had expected from a township school. Terblanche remembered his apprehension before his first meeting with the principal Lindiwe Ginya with whom he had partnered during the leadership-development journey of PfP. He had been surprised at how dynamic she was. He had expected a grey-haired career educator behind the desk but Ginya was energetic youthful and determined. Terblanche felt privileged to have been her cheerleader over the previous 18 months and was impressed by what she had accomplished. With Ginya as principal the school had achieved a pass rate of 84 per cent in 2016 and 93.9 per cent in 2017—compared to 69.9 per cent before her arrival. The achievement was all the more remarkable knowing that 30 per cent of these pupils came from child-headed households in the poorer Soweto communities. Ginya had been a teacher for over 20 years. She explained that when she started teaching she was employed after very little study. Later she was inspired to further her education and became interested in management. She likened her educational experience to a veil being lifted from her eyes as she began to realize that the way the school she worked in was being run was not how it was supposed to be. She completed both a master’s degree and a PhD focusing on the strategies employed by female school principals in disadvantaged areas. By the time she joined the PfP program and met Terblanche Ginya was running George Khosa Secondary School determined to make a difference to 1200 children the school’s teachers and the community in which she found herself.In one of his previous roles Terblanche had had an opportunity to expand STANLIB’s investment management business on the African continent. At the time STANLIB was jointly owned by Liberty and Standard Bank Group Limited (Standard Bank). In his role Terblanche visited 13 African countries. He experienced this role as if he were on a great safari dealing with the products and customer needs of these emerging and undeveloped economies. He considered it a unique opportunity which not many people would receive and continued to benefit from the experience. Standard Bank had extensive presence through its retail-banking business across the continent. Liberty having an interest in STANLIB also had aspirations in Africa and therefore eventually pulled Terblanche from STANLIB into Liberty’s head office.Terblanche was currently responsible for the relationship between Standard Bank and Liberty. There was a myriad of Liberty products that were being sold through Standard Bank channels. In turn Liberty had several bank products that the insurance company was offering through its own channels. With a high percentage of Liberty’s customers having relationships with Standard Bank bancassurance was a growing model. South Africa’s Liberty Group LimitedBased in Africa Liberty was a wealth-management group established more than 50 years earlier as the Liberty Life Association of Africa. The company had a reputation for developing and implementing innovative products and services that assisted customers with building and protecting long-term wealth. These included life insurance health insurance retail insurance pension plans funeral plans endowment plans income-protection plans provident-fund solutions and employee benefits. Liberty operated across South Africa Nigeria Namibia Swaziland Botswana Uganda Kenya and Lesotho and was headquartered in Johannesburg. In 2017 Liberty had 2.5 million policies in force. The company reported revenues of R62744 million for the fiscal year (FY) 2016 with operating margins of 10.2 per cent.Liberty aimed to be the preferred supplier of wealth-management services in Africa. The company operated according to five key guiding principles: involvement which reflected Liberty’s humanity and empathy; innovation which revealed the organization’s ingenuity and curiosity to find a better way; integrity which involved a commitment to fairness and the honouring of promises; insight which was the product of knowledge and understanding; and action which indicated a commitment to making things happen. Liberty was a subsidiary of Standard Bank.Standard Bank Group LimitedStandard Bank was a financial-services organization offering a broad range of transactional-banking savings borrowing lending investment insurance risk-management wealth-management and advisory services to individuals businesses and corporate clients. The bank operated in 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and was also headquartered in Johannesburg. Standard Bank reported interest income of R108060 million for FY 2016 an increase of 18.1 per cent over FY 2015. The bank operated through three business units: personal and business banking corporate and investment banking and the wealth business represented by Liberty.Terblanche’s personal leadership journeyDuring the Apartheid years Terblanche grew up in the affluent suburbs in Johannesburg in a typical white middle-class home. He went to the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit (named in Afrikaans one of South African’s 11 official languages) later renamed the University of Johannesburg. Terblanche received a law degree and completed his articles to qualify as an attorney. He started his corporate career in Standard Bank in project finance and later moved to investment management. Terblanche described his interest in social issues as a process that came with age and maturity. He had been building his career for just over 20 years and expected to further his career for about 15 more years. For a long time he had felt that his career was about what he could extract personally from his employer. More recently he had found himself looking back on what he had achieved and beginning to believe it was time to give something back. He had thought that his future career success would not only be measured by his paycheque but also by the contribution he would be making in the organization he had been part of for more than 20 years. He had set out to play a more meaningful role in the organization he served and to assist in moulding the next generation of leaders. The role of mentorsTerblanche had benefited from a mentor relationship he had with Johan Minnie to whom he had reported a couple of years earlier and who was currently head of sales and distribution for Liberty. Minnie had funded his own participation in a PfP program and was enthusiastic about the benefits for his own leadership development his organization and the education system as a whole. Minnie’s passion for PfP sparked the interest of Terblanche. Meanwhile Terblanche also had the benefit of meeting several of the leaders and principals who were on the PfP program at a workshop he attended. The energy and the special relationships between the partners touched him and he realized that this was something he really wanted to be involved in. Terblanche contacted Minnie and inquired about whether Liberty could sponsor him. Through Minnie’s lobbying Liberty sponsored Terblanche and four other partnerships in 2016. Once Terblanche had experienced the program’s value—not only for himself but also for the management team in the longer run—he presented the benefits of the program to the Liberty CSI team which subsequently agreed to fund five additional programs for the 2017 year.an Industry with heartTerblanche did not plan for a career in life insurance. It was only after he joined Liberty that he realized the importance of the industry in a developing economy. Every day millions of rand would flow into the economy due to life insurance claims being paid. These claims were often used to maintain the lifestyle of policy holders who would otherwise have been destitute after a catastrophic event affected them or their family. In 2016 Liberty paid out more than R3 billion in claims to policy holders. This money went straight into people’s pockets to support them in achieving their life goals. Terblanche bought into this higher purpose to the extent that he was able to see past the industry’s history of mis-selling and overhyped marketing. For him the value was delivered in the claims that the industry paid and in ensuring that they honoured their commitments to their clients. To illustrate his belief Terblanche remembered a story about witnessing an interaction between a manager and his claims team. The team had received a claim from the family of a long-standing client who had recently committed suicide. According to the policy terms suicide was excluded as a claim event under the particular circumstances. However the manager made an executive decision. Based on the company’s relationship with the client the manager instructed the team to pay the large claim. Terblanche felt that this demonstrated the heart of the industry and Liberty’s culture in particular. This incident encouraged Terblanche’s buy-in to the benefits of life insurance and helped him understand the importance of life insurance in society specifically in the lower market segments of South Africa and the rest of Africa. Terblanche realized that life insurance was a mechanism for wealth creation particularly for the creation of what he called “generational wealth.” For example Liberty sold simple life insurance products via Standard Bank to the lower market segments where clients would pay a premium of approximately R100 per month. In return clients would receive up to R200000 in life insurance coverage. Often when a client died the family lost a breadwinner. In such cases the R200000 payment would be the single largest asset that that family would ever have. If managed carefully it could benefit the next generation as well. For example this money could allow children access to tertiary education help pay off a home or enable the purchasing of a business. For Terblanche this phenomenon exemplified the culture of Liberty as a business with heart. Employees at Liberty believed that they were fulfilling a very important function in the life cycle of South Africa particularly in the country’s fight against poverty. Liberty’s ethos and Partners for Possibility’s objectivesEducation was important to Liberty. This interest went back as far as the founder Sir Donald Gordon. His philanthropy had founded the Liberty Foundation which supported education and a separate company called Mindset Network which was an educational-media non-governmental organization chaired by his son-in-law Hylton Appelbaum. Liberty’s CSI objectives had been focusing on education for several decades. Therefore Terblanche was sure he could elicit support from Liberty’s CSI business unit for the PfP funding as well as from Liberty’s executive committee. It was important to Terblanche to convince them to support PfP because he believed that it went to the heart of Liberty’ values the CSI unit’s objectives and the general challenges South Africa faced in education. In the past Liberty had funded the publication of exam papers in the national press to prepare students for the exam but if the groundwork in the schools was not in place it would be all in vain because the results would not be achieved. Terblanche thought that if the CSI budget of corporate South Africa could be consolidated it would be a substantial amount that could be used in a meaningful manner. Maybe the example of publishing past exam papers in the national press was of some value but was this the most impactful way to spend the CSI budget and could its financial effectiveness be measured? Was it truly meaningful to the kids writing exams? On the other hand the PfP program allowed him to get truly involved in accordance with Liberty’s guiding principles. For Terblanche the program actually faced the enemy—the educational challenge. He was grateful for the opportunity to help improve things alongside others in the trenches of the educational war. To him this was far more meaningful and satisfying than for example writing a cheque to a media company to publish past exam papers.Alignment of purposesAt Liberty the message was consistent—the intention of the organization was to secure clients’ financial freedom. This value proposition was pushed down the organization to everyone who worked at Liberty. For example whether cleaning windows or developing products all employees were part of the value chain. They enabled the company to deliver products that would pay a benefit to someone when it was most needed and that would allow the clients to maintain or improve their quality of life pass wealth on to their family or educate their children. It touched a heart string. For Terblanche it was a spiritual experience; he was in a place where he fitted in and had purpose. He was driven not only by what he did for the organization but also by what the organization allowed him to do for himself and for his community. He wondered whether he would have managed to get involved with PfP without having been at Liberty: he liked to believe that PfP was fulfilling a growing personal need and that he would have eventually found a way to make a difference. The experience and the support Terblanche had been given by his many bosses and mentors at Liberty could now be plowed back. Terblanche did not think that this was the type of dialogue he would have had many years earlier. It was only when he realised how he had changed that he fully understood the culture of the organization. He was in the fortunate position of being able to explain the organization’s purpose to the younger generation. He had been mentoring several young people in recent years which he had found incredibly fulfilling. It felt like a switch from pure capitalism into something that was a bit more social in nature. Therefore Liberty was the right place for him because of the culture value proposition and values that the organization stood for. The partnershipThe PfP opportunity had created a link between the educational burden of the country and the culture at Liberty that represented a higher calling to address massive social challenges. The social challenges started with a poor education system which led to chronic unemployment and ultimately to poverty. The education system was a key factor; it would produce better learners who in turn would produce better tertiary students and a healthier society. Terblanche did not see resource constraints as the challenge facing the education system; adequate funds were available. However the management of these funds was flawed. His own experience had showed him that with few resources and little management experience school principals were nevertheless responsible for shaping thousands of lives.For example Ginya Terblanche’s partner in the PfP program had 1200 teenagers in her school and 35 educators which meant that approximately 35 kids were relying on one educator. Terblanche perceived dysfunction in the school system which somehow expected the principal and educators to deliver results without adequate support.The first meeting between Terblanche and Ginya was spent talking about their personal lives and what had led them to this point in their careers as well as sharing their joint objectives for the PfP program. The commitment they made to each other on day one was that the program was mainly about the children. It was also about delivering a better product for them so that when they walked out of the school gates at the end of their grade 12 year they would be better prepared for the real world. When the two partners met Ginya had been in the role of high school principal for just over six months. South African public educationIn January 2017 The Economist rated South Africa’s education system as one of the worst in the world. The magazine reported that in 2015 South Africa was ranked 75th out of 76 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s league of education systems. In 2016 the Trends in International Maths and Science Study a quadrennial test taken by 580000 pupils in 57 countries consistently ranked South Africa at or near the bottom on various criteria despite some improvement since 2011. South Africa fared worse than countries that were generally regarded as less developed on the continent. Of all children who had attended school for six years in South Africa 27 per cent could not read compared to 4 per cent in Tanzania and 19 per cent in Zimbabwe. Of all children starting school in South Africa 37 per cent went on to pass the matriculation exam and only 4 per cent eventually earned a degree from a university.These poor results occurred despite public spending on education being at the comparatively high level of 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Ginya explained that children in the most disadvantaged areas did not pay school fees. In a government school like hers the government paid the school R1177 per child per year. Therefore for a school of 1200 children there was a budget in 2017 of R1.2–1.3 million to pay for textbooks stationery and service maintenance of the school’s facilities. The government also paid to feed the children twice a day and paid teacher salaries directly. Teachers were generally underskilled to deal with the social and economic challenges of the communities they served as were school managers. Principals were usually appointed without any regard for their managerial experience or expertise. Ginya’s PhD recommended that beyond the seven years’ teaching experience currently required each potential school principal should attend a management course rather than being placed in a management position without any preparation as was currently the case. Terblanche’s contribution Ginya soon experienced the benefits of her partnership with Terblanche which offered her more structure and created more capacity around her. For example one of the first changes Terblanche and Ginya initiated was to raise the skill level of her immediate support staff. Liberty sponsored a basic course for Ginya’s personal assistant (PA) which allowed the PA to spend time with that of Terblanche’s and other PAs of Liberty executives. Another educator was offered an opportunity to learn from a high-level project manager at Liberty to better understand how a project was managed including defining a project’s scope and monitoring its progress. One of Ginya’s staff members spent time at Liberty’s human resources department to better understand key performance areas and career management. Although it was generally a simple concept for a corporate institution the process was not common in public service education. Ginya was responsible for developing career paths for her staff with limited support from the Department of Education and little preparation for the role. To make matters worse the department often called meetings at the last minute and without notice which hampered the schedules of the educators. Historically the school had a very poor pass rate record. In September 2015 when Ginya started work at the school the pass rate was 69 per cent. Through her efforts passion and strategy the school managed to increase the pass rate to 84 per cent in 2016 and aimed for a 95 per cent pass rate in 2017. The goal was going to be incredibly difficult to achieve but the school had a program in place. The most important intervention was a one-week revision exercise for all students. The school had raised funds to host all of the students in a guest house in the Magaliesburg area for that week. The educators dedicated their time and the school governing body was also involved. The event was very successful. The learners were in a focused environment patiently supported by the educators to prepare them for the final exam. It was the catalyst needed for the students to develop the confidence and motivation to study.In the community where the school was situated there were problems with teenage pregnancies drugs and assault—even the practice of Satanism had emerged within the school. Ginya who was often the only adult in the school children’s lives offered support and encouraged them to pass exams and lift themselves out of their poverty-stricken environment. With his involvement in PfP Terblanche initiated several school programs including sports days a garden project and career days which also involved some of his colleagues. Partners for Possibility’s interventionThe award-winning social change initiative PfP was the flagship program of the global non-profit organization Symphonia Leadership Development (Symphonia). The South African wing of the organization Symphonia for South Africa had been in operation for only six years and had already tapped into the knowledge and skills of business leaders to help school leaders develop their skills. By focusing on enhancing the leadership skills of principals the PfP program was expected to alleviate one of the major problems facing the South African school system. The ultimate goal was to achieve quality education for all children in South Africa.Business leaders and school principals at under-resourced schools partnered in a year of carefully designed leadership-development processes that aimed to develop the principal’s capacity to lead the school with the goal to improve education outcomes at the school. Individual business leaders or their companies paid approximately R80000 per partnership for the costs of the program which included the school principal’s involvement for one year. In the six years since its inception over 500 partnerships had been established—in most cases with measurable benefit. But PfP program supporters argued that it was not simply the school leaders who benefited from the partnership; participating companies observed that their leaders had grown and honed their own leadership skills by learning more about how to do business in a South African context how to influence without direct authority and how to act and lead in complex situations where answers were not apparent. In other words both members of the partnership were learning new skills that helped to lead change in complex and ambiguous environments.Robyn Whittaker the stakeholder engagement lead of Symphonia for South Africa recalled that the PfP program was founded in 2010 when Louise van Rhyn the director and founder of Symphonia became the first business leader to partner with a school principal in an effort to improve a school’s education outcomes. Symphonia was licensed to deliver a range of the world’s best leadership programs which were also used to develop participants in the PfP program. These programs included Nancy Kline’s Time to Think and Peter Block’s Flawless Consulting and Community Building workshops. Van Rhyn believed that it was the responsibility of organizational leaders to engage and harness the collective intelligence of people around them and to engage their workforce with a sense of enthusiasm and possibility. This philosophy drove the structure and process of PfP.Although a primary goal was to ensure that the principal left the program with the energy and confidence to lead the school through a change process that would enhance the quality of the education it delivered PfP went one step further: it aimed to create readiness for change through an aligned and cohesive management team within the school that was capable of energizing the community of teachers and engaging the parents and community that surrounded the school to achieve the vision of quality education for all school children.Once the business leader and the school principal had established a relationship they attended a range of interventions together which both cemented the relationship and enabled each partner to develop new skills. They came together for three to five hours each month to grapple with real challenges at the school in an action–learning format. Eight to 10 partnerships commencing at the same time were then linked together in an activity called Community of Practice which met frequently during the year-long program to share experiences and provide mutual support. The participants also participated in monthly leadership coaching sessions and were expected to provide reports and complete journal entries.As a result of these interventions the principal and the executive developed techniques to enhance their thinking and the thinking of those around them. The partners developed the ability to create generative relationships and the skills to deal with challenging people and difficult situations in a complex and ambiguous environment. They also developed skills and tools that enabled them to mobilize stakeholder support for the vision of improving the quality of education at the school level.Making a differenceAccording to the PfP program over a period of two years a participating school could expect to see a confident and competent principal effective management of the school and more motivated teachers. The teachers would be able to achieve better coverage of the school curriculum as a result of reduced absenteeism and more involvement in professional development activities. Parents would be more engaged and would attend school meetings more regularly while the broader community would support school initiatives.By June 2017 PfP had involved 500 school principals and 500 business leaders. This meant that the program had reached 12700 teachers and enhanced the lives of 406000 school learners and their 180000 families. Schools had received new resources and had access to a broader range of cultural enrichment and sporting activities as a result of their participation in the PfP program. In many schools like Ginya’s there had been measurable improvements in the academic results that were achieved.Interestingly the positive impact of the PfP program was not limited to the school principals in the partnership; the executives also reported positive enhancements to their leadership skills because of their exposure to more ambiguous and complex environments than they were accustomed to. The executives experienced the process of building stronger and deeper relationships with stakeholders they had little or no formal power over. They also gained a much deeper understanding of the value of diversity.Growing the partnerships in LibertyIn 2016 five partnerships were funded by Liberty; in 2017 another five were funded. Assuming that favourable feedback was received Terblanche intended to grow the number of partnerships in future years. In 2017 the cost was R85000 for an executive’s involvement which also covered the cost of the partner principal’s participation in the program. Because Terblanche’s role was based in the organization’s head office the people he had nominated and later been accepted into the program were all based in Johannesburg and Pretoria. However there was great interest from other South African provinces including KwaZulu-Natal Free-State Eastern Cape and Western Cape. Several Liberty leaders indicated their interest in participating. Some of them would receive funding from other sources but central institutional funding through the CSI team would resume at the end of the year after budgets were confirmed. Terblanche’s aspiration was to grow the number of partnerships and build a body of evidence around the program’s benefits. He wanted to assemble colleagues internally to discuss the experience and in the process hopefully motivate other people. He believed that the CSI funding for these partnerships was only one possible source; the business units could fund the partnerships he thought specifically those that had a marketing budget. Great benefits for the Liberty brand would potentially result from participating in PfP as he had discovered. In particular benefit was felt through the schools and the school infrastructure and surrounding communities which represented markets that Liberty had yet to tap into. Terblanche considered contacting the branding team to suggest installing Liberty brand banners at the schools hosting information days selling products and providing services to clients directly from the school locations. If successful in making the initiative more nationally represented the Liberty footprint could reach areas that were currently not available. Coincidentally Liberty’s emerging consumer-market team which focused on the lower market segments was closely aligned with the areas where these previously disadvantaged schools were located and where the partnerships were established. Going forwardDespite the lack of support from her superiors Ginya had used her own efforts and credentials to rise above her peers. Other principals were contacting her for advice on how to better manage their schools and districts. Ginya was invited to Harvard University and to Atlanta Georgia in the United States to share her research and experiences. She was a bright star and would probably rise above her current environment. Thanks to her personal achievements growth opportunities were opening up for her and she would invariably move up. However there were several questions to consider. What would happen to the school after Ginya’s eventual departure? Would Terblanche stay with the school or would he follow Ginya? Was his partnership with the individual principal or with the school? How would he motivate even more of his colleagues to get involved? How could branding and social responsibility projects relating to the schools be better managed?

Sethi was the chief information officer of Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) the world’s largest two-wheeler company. Although HMCL and other companies in the industry carefully considered safety features for their vehicles it was not enough. Road safety was also dependent on the driver and other factors in addition to the safety features of the vehicle.By the end of 2017 after Sethi had undertaken many road safety initiatives and awareness campaigns he was faced with a dilemma. There was no easy way to measure the success of the road safety marketing campaign and he had already spent a significant amount of money on the program. Now he had to decide whether to continue or end the program. THE COMPANYIn 1984 Hero Cycles Ltd. (Hero) of India and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (Honda) of Japan entered a joint venture to manufacture two-wheelers in India. The joint venture Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (Hero Honda) grew rapidly. In December 2010 Hero and Honda decided to separate and Hero bought out Honda’s stake. The company was re-named Hero MotoCorp Ltd. in July 2011 and in the subsequent month it revealed its new logo. HMCL aimed to provide “world class mobility solutions with renewed focus on expanding [the] company’s footprint in the global arena.” By March 2017 the company had sold more than 70 million units of two-wheelers since its inception and had an annual capacity of 8.1 million two-wheeler units. The company had a market share of 51 per cent in motorcycles in India. The company also sold two-wheelers across 35 other countries.HMCL had a net revenue of ₹313 billion and a net profit of ₹34 billion in 2016–17. It had an excellent return on capital employed—49 per cent—and earnings per share of ₹169 (see Exhibit 1).The company focused on social activities an initiative that came from its founder Brijmohan Lall Munjal who had once stated “We must give back to the society from whose resources we generate wealth.” HMCL’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities were branded Hero We Care and organized around four key initiatives: education safe riding the environment and girl child empowerment (see Exhibits 2 and 3). The education program aimed to promote education with a special focus on girls; the safe riding program aimed to promote road safety by addressing issues that led to road accidents; the environment program promoted cleanliness and making India green; and the girl child empowerment program targeted girls aged six and above from the underprivileged sections of society with the aim to help and support them in their overall development. Awareness among people about road safety was a key area for the company and was enabled through social and electronic media.During 2016–17 HMCL spent ₹851 million on CSR activities amounting to 2.4 per cent of the company’s average profits over the previous three years. As required by law the company had also formed a CSR policy and a CSR committee to oversee corporate spending in that area. The company had performed well financially and its social development initiatives had been well received. The road safety program had worked well in terms of grabbing people’s attention. The question uppermost in Sethi’s mind was whether the awareness generated by the road safety program had actually led to behavioural change and an impact on the ground. He was concerned that while people might have approved of the program they may have forgotten its message over time. What could he do he wondered to measure its success and determine the future direction for the program?TWO-WHEELER INDUSTRY IN INDIA By 2016 the Indian automobile industry was one of the largest in the world. The automobile industry accounted for 7.1 per cent of India’s gross domestic product. The two-wheeler segment was the leader in the industry with 81 per cent of the market share. The growth had resulted from a growing middle class and a young population.The two-wheeler industry was composed of three product categories: scooters motorcycles and mopeds. The industry had evolved significantly since its inception in 1950 and had grown rapidly with annual sales of over 20 million units in 2015–16 (see Exhibit 4). Two-wheelers constituted the bulk of sales in the automobile industry. Apart from HMCL the three major companies in the Indian two-wheeler industry were Bajaj Auto Ltd. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. and TVS Motor Company.Bajaj Auto Ltd.Bajaj Auto Ltd. manufactured motorcycles three-wheelers and automotive parts. Its Pulsar brand of motorcycles was very popular.Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd.Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. manufactured motorcycles and scooters at its plants in Manesar Haryana; Tapukara Rajasthan; Narsapura Karnataka; and Vithalpur Gujarat. It offered popular models such as Activa and Deo in the scooter segment and Shine in the motorcycle segment.TVS Motor CompanyTVS Motor Company was primarily an automotive parts manufacturer. It had collaborated with Suzuki Motor Corporation to venture into the motorcycle space in 1982 but the companies had subsequently separated. TVS Motor Company produced strong brands such as Scooty in the scooter segment and Apache in the motorcycle segment.There were several other relatively smaller players in the Indian two-wheeler industry including Yamaha Motor Pvt. Ltd. Royal Enfield (manufactured by Eicher Motors Ltd.) Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt. Ltd. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. and Piaggio Vehicle Pvt. Ltd. (see Exhibit 5).The FutureIn 2017 new developments were taking place in the automobile industry in India. New advances in electric vehicles—including automobiles trains aircraft and ships—were increasingly being announced. By 2030 100 million electric vehicles would need to be deployed to reach the target set by the United Nations Framework on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement. The Indian government had said that India could cut its energy demand by 64 per cent by making its transportation industry electric which had significant implications for India’s automotive sector. In a move toward making this happen the Indian government had set up the National Electric Mobility Mission. The mission planned to create a potential demand for between 5 and 7 million electric vehicles by 2020. These vehicles would include buses light commercial vehicles two-wheelers and three-wheelers and electric cars. Most automobile companies had announced plans for electric vehicles and even the cab sharing company Ola had started a pilot on electric vehicles in India. Almost all major motorcycle manufacturers in India had scheduled launches of electric two-wheelers from 2018 onwards. HMCL: KEY STAKEHOLDERSProducts and Customer PreferencesBy 2017 consumers’ preferences in the two-wheeler market were evolving. Higher disposable income increasing urbanization and infrastructure turnaround were leading to structural and segmental shifts in the two-wheeler industry. The increase in scooter contribution to the industry was visible. The growth of premium motorcycles in the industry was led by the emergence of women buyers and millennials. To cater to a wide range of customers HMCL produced vehicles at different price points (see Exhibit 6).HMCL’s branding was characterized by the following traits: patriotic (i.e. the pride of being Indian) trusted (i.e. reliable honest caring and responsible) innovative (i.e. technology- and future-driven) young (i.e. aggressive and fast-paced) open (i.e. not selective or exclusive but inclusive and talking to everyone) and confident (i.e. big and omnipresent).SuppliersThe company had a large network of suppliers that produced the parts for the manufacture of motorcycles. Cost management at its suppliers was critical for HMCL to operate efficiently and be competitive in the market. The company ran a Green Vendor Development Program which was a supply-chain initiative taken to extend corporate environment responsibility down the supply chain.DistributionHMCL had an extensive sales and service network spanning more than 6000 customer touchpoints. These were a mix of authorized dealers service and spare parts outlets and dealer-appointed outlets.PROMOTION AND BRANDING AT HMCLHero was known for its strong brand recognition and it had successfully capitalized on this recognition. After the separation from Honda the company had rights to the Hero Honda brand until 2014. However the company realized that it needed to push a stand-alone brand. Hero carefully crafted its brand elements and ensured that they aligned with the company’s values. Hero chose the new name Hero MotoCorp with the word moto connoting motorized two-wheelers. Its global aspirations were indicated by the launch of the new brand in London in August 2011. The new logo was contemporary and futuristic in style with a three-dimensional “H” in red and black. The red in the logo stood for energy passion and confidence while the black stood for solidity and premium quality.Before the separation Hero Honda’s tag line had been Desh ki Dhadkan (The Heartbeat of the Nation)—a big success especially at events like the Cricket World Cup in 2003. The new tag line was Hum Mein Hai Hero (There is a Hero in Each One of Us). This helped the company connect with the consumer at an individual level.As part of the corporate brand makeover during 2011–2013 the company launched the Billion Voices program. The aim of the program was to use crowdsourcing as a means of attracting customers toward the brand. The company leveraged the increasing popularity of social media and the Internet and millions of people uploaded videos of themselves singing “Hum Mein Hai Hero.” Selected videos were combined into an advertisement and were broadcast on commercial television channels. Beyond promoting the corporate brand the company also released a series of product-specific advertisements. By 2013 the corporate rebranding program was essentially complete.In August 2016 timed to coincide with the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio the company launched the Hero Come Home Safe campaign. The campaign featured anxious family members from young children to grandparents waiting for their loved ones to return home safe. The minute-long spot was part of Hero’s CSR initiative Ride Safe India (see Exhibit 7). It was aimed to sensitize consumers by linking road safety to family bonds. The campaign generated close to 15 million views on social media platforms.Several automobile manufacturers also launched safety campaigns around the same time. Car manufacturer Ford India Pvt. Ltd. rolled out a Raksha Bandhan advertisement in July featuring Indian film actress Kalki Koechlin. The commercial showed Koechlin tying a rakhi on her own wrist as she drove off. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. rolled out eight television commercials urging customers to drive safely by wearing a seat belt following lane driving avoiding phone calls while driving and not driving drunk. Chevrolet India Ltd. piloted its first safety campaign Drive with Care during the monsoon season—a time when fatalities (of car passengers and pedestrians) increased.The slew of safety advertisements were linked to the public’s perception that vehicle safety was lacking. In May 2016 five Indian cars failed crash tests due in large part to the absence of airbags. The Global New Car Assessment Program a U.K.-based safety and testing organization had conducted the tests. Also in June 2016 the Advertising Standards Council of India reissued its guidelines for automotive vehicles which it had formed in 2008 clearly stating that no advertisement campaign should show reckless driving or stunts that required professional driving skills. Stunts depicted in advertisements were required to come with a disclaimer. The guidelines also urged two- and four-wheeler manufacturers to promote safe practices including wearing helmets fastening seat belts and not using mobile phones while driving.ROAD SAFETYIndia had the second-longest road network in the world and the government planned to add 30 kilometres of road per day. Therefore India’s growth depended on automobiles. An increased road network along with rising incomes led to an increase in the number of vehicles. At the same time there was a general lack of awareness of basic traffic rules road signs traffic lights and security precautions mainly due to lax standards in issuing licences and outdated traffic laws. A lack of road safety awareness coupled with weak policing of the roads led to the common occurrence of people driving without seat belts or a driver’s licence. Because the Motor Vehicles Act which governed traffic and vehicles in India had not been updated since 1988 safety features in automobiles were low in priority. Motorists were reluctant to help accident victims for fear of getting involved in long drawn-out court cases. Medical help was often late to arrive or unavailable. Safety initiatives undertaken by the government and non-governmental organizations had little effect.According to the World Health Organization’s 2017 report Managing Speed a major factor in road safety was rapid urbanization. Road traffic death and injuries could be attributed to the increased number of vehicles on the road; more traffic in urban areas had also led to a higher level of pollution resulting in respiratory diseases. Faster vehicles improved mobility and travel times but increased the rate of road accidents and caused more severe injuries at higher speeds. The World Health Organization suggested four approaches to improving road safety: safe speeds safe road users safe vehicles and safe roads and roadsides (see Exhibit 8).The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways reported 480652 accidents and 150785 deaths in India in 2016. According to the Managing Speed report “Approximately 1.25 million people die every year on the world’s roads as a result of road traffic crashes.” The importance of road safety was marked by the fact that it had become a part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. By 2020 the objective was to reduce the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 50 per cent.STRATEGIC ELEMENTS OF ROAD SAFETY PROGRAMSHMCL’s strategy to address safety issues was based on three main factors:Behavioural change: HMCL attempted to effect behavioural change through Traffic Training Parks where both adults and children learned about road safety and adopted good habits. Children were considered significant influencers. When a child asked the parent to wear a seat belt or a helmet the parent was compelled to comply.Formal education: Road safety classes were conducted in Delhi and through the Student Police Cadet program which trained 2200 students. The program considered children to be change agents and influencers within their family and society in general. The program was eventually expanded to colleges and universities. HMCL trainers used audiovisual equipment and mobile vans to motivate people through street play.Awareness: To ensure that behavioural change and formal education reached its target the company used social media and mass media (primarily television). The message was delivered in three different segments: Come Home Safe Afterlife and Buddy. The message in the Come Home Safe series was “Your family is waiting for you so be safe.” The Afterlife series focused on what would happen if the driver died. The Buddy series which focused on steps to take to be safe acted like an alter ego that pointed out mistakes and suggested corrective actions (e.g. “Listen to yourself.”). The promotions were delivered on a sequential basis. The company aimed to attack the safety issue by focusing on the individual first then on the family and finally on society. It pushed the message recipient to think about family (the Come Home Safe series) and about oneself (the Buddy series) otherwise there would be dire consequences (the Afterlife series). The approach attempted to raise awareness educate people and create social pressure. Having raised awareness about road safety the company engaged in ground-level activities to encourage safe driving.RIDE SAFE INDIA PROGRAMHMCL engaged in multiple activities to address issues that led to accidents and fatalities on the roads including the Ride Safe India program which became the company’s flagship CSR activity. Within a year of scaling up Ride Safe India was recognized by the Indian government’s Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The program also involved the police forces of various Indian states in running various road safety awareness campaigns for two-wheeler riders most of which were focused on school students. Participants underwent a structured training module aided by world-class training facilities. For building awareness around road safety the team from HMCL participated in activities including walks online campaigns blogs social media engagements and safety-focused “sensitizing” films.Traffic Training ParksThe objective of the Traffic Training Parks was primarily to address one of the root cause of road fatalities—driver error. Traffic Training Parks were set up in the cities of Gurugram Delhi Lucknow Hyderabad Nagpur and Rourkela and were adopted by HMCL to run its road safety programs. Some of the activities undertaken at the parks included two-wheeler riding training programs for all drivers. The training parks were equipped with riding simulators safety riding tracks stretches of road with varying conditions and safe-riding equipment. The trained faculty educated participants on road safety through specially prepared audiovisual aids. Student Police CadetsThe Student Police Cadets project was aimed at making students ambassadors of road safety while grooming them to become model citizens. The project run at schools in Gurugram involved sessions on road safety awareness traffic management community development skills leaderships skills disaster management and waste management. The project also involved physical training for children along with outdoor activities and sports. Awareness ProgramsTo spread awareness of the importance of road safety HMCL ran major social media campaigns on road safety. The company interacted with thousands of individuals through its sensitizing content delivered over Facebook YouTube and Twitter. The viral Afterlife videos had an impressionable message. The Buddy series which included a collection of animated videos on road safety for schoolchildren was given to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for its use. Various other videos were broadcast on prime time television during the UEFA EURO 2016 soccer championships and the Rio Olympics to reach the masses. The Ride Safe India program (see Exhibit 9) covered many people across many states. Over 160000 individuals including students teachers police personnel and HMCL customers participated in Traffic Training Parks and road safety awareness programs. About 1.2 million people participated in a road safety competition organized in association with the Delhi Police. The message of safe riding through 2400 various activities during National Road Safety Week reached 75000 individuals. Twenty-two hundred students from 50 schools enrolled as Student Police Cadets in association with the Haryana Police. Six Traffic Training Parks were operational in six states.LEVERAGING SOCIAL media TO GAIN SCALEWhen Sethi took over as the head of CSR at HMCL he quickly realized the potential of information technology to leverage the company’s CSR efforts. He used the Internet to spread awareness about the girl child empowerment program and to encourage people across the country to support the cause. Technology and social media increased the scale of HMCL’s CSR initiatives as Sethi explained:What were once silo efforts towards CSR were now being turned into holistic endeavours that were visible and had an impact on the ecosystem. . . . The way we wanted to use social media was to make sure that the right message is delivered to the right people using the most relevant medium. Targeted communication was done on a large scale helping in scaling up the awareness attempts.Sethi launched a video social media campaign for Hamari Pari (Our Angel) which was HMCL’s program for underprivileged girls. The response was remarkable with 2.8 million views on the first day and trending on Twitter for eight hours. “The social media campaign created such a buzz on girl empowerment with many celebrities and also Facebook lauding the social cause” he said.HMCL’s videos on social media promoting road safety received 28 million views. Sethi explained how they were distributed: We at Hero MotoCorp have been utilizing the power of social media a lot over the years in our marketing efforts. So when we were planning to find ways and means to supplement our CSR efforts and to create mass awareness on areas like girl child empowerment child education and road safety leveraging the power and reach of social media—be it Facebook You Tube Twitter or others—became a natural choice. We created some nice films and videos on these themes and the response has been fantastic with many of them getting 1 million plus views. We also used Twitter to create awareness among youth on safe riding. We did an hour-long tweet chat with youngsters to educate them on road safety. . . . As part of our Ride Safe India initiative we have also partnered with UP [Uttar Pradesh] Police in their Responsible Citizen program with Gurgaon Police as part of the Student Police Cadet Program and with Delhi and Telangana Police to create awareness on various aspects of road safety.A Time to IntrospectSethi was pleased with the growth of HMCL’s CSR program particularly the Ride Safe India program. He was also pleased with the success of the company’s social media campaign. Road safety was being discussed in the national media and many states had started making helmets mandatory. Although he was proud of the achievements to date he knew that there was much more to accomplish but he was unsure how to proceed: We have made a decent start. It’s a long road but hopefully a safe road. We do all these programs in schools and universities; [we] run social and mass media campaigns. Has this led to a reduction in accidents? I don’t know. Is it leading to people becoming safer? I don’t know. When you are spending so much money on this is it really bearing fruit? One way to look at it is to say that today more than 250000 families are more aware about road safety and therefore making roads a bit safer. Also compounding the problem is [that the] population is increasing roads are getting congested and chances of accidents [are] increasing. That is the dilemma I’m facing. Should we keep concentrating on the three approaches of behaviour change education and awareness? Or should we try something radically different? Should we dump road safety altogether and try something different. What should I do?EXHIBIT 1: HMCL KEY FINANCIALS (STAND-ALONE)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹63.85 on December 31 2017Source: Hero MotoCorp Ltd. Hero MotoCorp Ltd.

The boy with an office bag has a toy in his hand in place of a steering wheel. The girl holds on to his shoulder acting as if the duo is on a bike. They ask onlookers to join in while running before they fall abruptly on a carpet. The boy stays motionless on the ground while the girl looks on. A crowd gathers to see what has happened. Two other boys join in and here starts an impromptu street play. One of them points out that the crowd gathered is looking for tamaasha (entertainment) as there is action drama and emotion in this story (the accident). He goes on to deliver the message: when there is an accident do not gather there for the entertainment call for an ambulance instead to help the victim. The gathered crowd applauds the act while the film ends with this line from Ride Safe India: “Don’t be a bystander. Help accident victims.”Video 2Another video narrates a story through the eyes of a fly. The fly says that as a young man in its previous birth he always looked for danger and that is why he would not ride a bike but “fly” it. He died while riding a bike because he was not wearing a helmet. As the fly moves around the house it is attacked by everyone and this makes the fly feel as if it is living on the edge just as the young man did in the past life. The film ends with the line “Don't bank on the afterlife. Always wear a helmet while riding.”Video 3Another video follows a similar pattern as the video described above this time through the eyes of a snail. The snail reveals that in its previous life as a human it hated waiting for anything and that green or red lights on a traffic signal did not matter to him. So one day as he ran across the road a car ran over him and ended his life. Now he is back as a snail and has been waiting to cross the road for the last three hours.CampaignsAfterlife Series IndiaCampaign Insight: There is shock value in becoming a creature in the next life.Campaign Objective: Promote safe riding among youth by shaking them up and informing them about the perils of not driving safely.Come Home Safe Series IndiaCampaign Insight: Ride safe for the one who is waiting for you at home.Campaign Objective: Bring to the fore the sensitive issue of road safety.Buddy Series IndiaThe Buddy series is a collection of 40 animated videos on various aspects of road safety—such as wearing a helmet wearing a seat belt etc.—where the “Buddy” tells road the right way to practice road safety.Source: “Afterlife Series” YouTube videos posted by TheHeroMotoCorp last updated November 8 2016 accessed May 6 2018 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjoUvhEO2OPhS1B0TUsLb0fhrmfD6Pfwr; “Hero Come Home Safe” YouTube video 1:00 posted by TheHeroMotoCorp August 5 2016 accessed May 6 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_FNqL1w5I.

Lee was attending the Open Day conference held by the smart supply chain Y business division at JD.com (JD). Lee was a member of the US National Academy of Engineering and widely considered the father of the modern supply chain. Speaking at the event Lee stated that there were three challenges facing commerce today: increasing uncertainty; changing technological political and economic environments; and more partners with varying interests.Over the previous 15 years JD had remained committed to independently operated products and logistics. It had put in place a digital supply chain powered by its business and technological capabilities. Retail currently featured diverse consumption scenarios personalized consumption needs and a shift of consumption upgrades to rural areas. These changes in consumption presented new challenges for the supply chain. How could it cope with these challenges?During the Open Day conference JD�s vice-president Chen Lin who was also the head of the company�s platform ecosystem department its boundaryless retail division and its smart supply chain Y business division stated that �the only way out for the supply chain is collaboration. Nothing else can increase supply chain efficiency.�In the age of boundaryless retail JD claimed that its retail platform was closest to the consumer and had started to shoulder the responsibility of initiating collaboration across the supply chain. JD was attempting to reconstruct and standardize the complex supply chain ecosystem through technology. At the Open Day event the company released a blueprint titled �End-to-End Supply Chain Control Tower 2.0� (see Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2). Through this future-oriented platform JD and its partners could collaboratively plan the supply chain and visualize its key nodes and performance. They could collaborate in aspects such as procurement and sales inventory logistics and channels. They would also be able to optimize costs efficiency and user experience. Still end-to-end collaboration faced difficult and complicated challenges. This was especially true for enterprises from traditional industries because their digital capabilities were very uneven. Chen�s team had been building a collaboration platform and mechanism that allowed mutually beneficial outcomes and sustainable development for both retailers and suppliers. However two major difficulties had arisen in the process. What should be the focus of collaboration between JD and its suppliers and how could JD enable upstream suppliers to perceive the value in collaboration to lead them to increase their participation?Accumulation of Supply Chain Management CapabilitiesTo power intelligent transformation JD�s Y business division was established on November 25 2016 (originally as a business unit). With a focus on building the technological capabilities needed for the smart supply chain Y aspired to drive the intelligent transformation of traditional retail through artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. Strategies for optimizing supply chain decision-making were proposed based on big data analysis and optimization algorithms for operations. These strategies were then translated into smart supply chain software and solutions with assistance from JD�s procurement and sales departments.Over the years JD had brought intelligent decision-making backed by big data and AI algorithms to all nodes of the supply chain to empower its partners. With big data and AI algorithms JD�s Y business division had built three platforms: intelligent forecasting operation optimization and simulation. These three platforms supported Y�s smart supply chain management capabilities.JD�s Y intelligent forecasting platform leveraged approximately seven years of experience in sales forecasting. Through in-depth research on various forecasting models and applicable scenarios its experience and models could be replicated in other fields and gradually opened up. The operation optimization platform fed a wealth of data algorithms models and business experience related to inventory optimization selection pricing and performance to the simulation platform. The simulation platform could generate solutions to improve supply chain and e-commerce performance. Existing inventory models and the dynamic pricing system could be a starting point for developing collaboration simulation solutions that covered multiple scenarios throughout the supply chain. All stages of the supply chain could be combined in the same model to connect it with marketing. At the same time common simulation solutions were presented for typical scenarios.Intelligent ForecastingJD�s Y business division could forecast output at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level to help managers make sales strategies and inventory plans for JD self-operated products. This way products that users wanted could be transported to nearby warehouses in advance.With accumulated big data on consumer portraits Y had created over 20 forecasting algorithms used in machine training including hot products seasonal fluctuations long-tail segments and new product recommendations. This allowed the company to select the best method to forecast consumer needs. By incorporating factors such as sales gross merchandise volume and sales margin daily sales of SKUs in the next 91 days could be forecast and updated for each regional distribution centre. Intelligent ReplenishmentJD�s Y business division had mastered an array of common replenishment models that were suitable for all products including best sellers with low and high demand fluctuations products with seasonal life cycles and long-tail products with low sales. With sales forecasting and current inventory information the intelligent replenishment system could automatically calculate the suggested daily replenishment quantity for each SKU in each regional distribution centre for the next 91 days. The system would then automatically place purchase orders. Employees only needed to set parameters such as the replenishment position cycle and date for each SKU. The system would automatically place orders for the optimal quantity as necessary. By the end of 2018 JD had been automatically placing more than 85 per cent of its purchase orders. Dynamic PricingDifferent models were tailored for millions of SKUs using price-to-volume flexible-pricing models and AI algorithms. This meant that optimal prices were dynamically set for many products. Automatic pricing for all long-tail products allowed the system to handle over 80 per cent of day-to-day non-promotional price adjustments.Based on this capability JD had a series of software-as-a-service platform services targeting internal purchase and sales departments as well as external suppliers. These services included supply chain collaboration supply chain trend analysis and intelligent forecasting and planning.Development of the Supply Chain Collaboration PlatformWhen JD started its intelligent transformation in 2017 it adopted a vision of boundaryless retail. At the back end boundaryless retail referred to an integrated supply chain or a complete system that combined the supply chain with products inventory and commodities. This system facilitated the operations of brand suppliers. At the front end boundaryless retail meant that JD could meet consumer needs anytime anywhere. This required more partners to join forces in the ecosystem. How could JD bring together the widest range of partners and remain an attractive operation? While advancing the boundaryless retail strategy JD began constructing a platform and mechanism for supply chain collaboration.JD had over 30000 registered suppliers which were categorized under two types by purchase amount: small and medium-sized suppliers and strategic suppliers (mostly major brands). While improving consumer experience JD continued to meet the differentiated demands of suppliers. JD�s Y business unit worked to thoroughly consider all aspects when planning the supply chain collaboration platform on the basis of Y�s accumulated technological capabilities.The blueprint �End-to-End Supply Chain Control Tower 2.0� was released during JD�s Open Day conference to set out the overall design of the platform. To plan and monitor the operation of the entire supply chain the control tower served as the brain that would build a digital visualized platform for precision management. This process allowed suppliers to monitor sales; forecast replenishment; and manage inventory orders and logistics.The platform provided different functions for three types of suppliers. For suppliers with strategic collaboration the functions provided included collaborative planning forecasting and replenishment (CPFR); joint business planning (JBP); vendor-managed inventory; and just-in-time production. For suppliers with efficient collaboration the functions provided included electronic data interchange (EDI) manufacturer drop-shipping and automatic supplier selection. For suppliers with end-to-end collaboration the functions provided included end-to-end supply chain services (e.g. product introduction product selection and purchase) financial services (e.g. settlement payment and marketing) and reverse supply chain services (e.g. trial and after-sales services).The vendor collaboration (VC) platform integrated end-to-end supply chain services and was recommended for small and medium-sized suppliers whereas CPFR was promoted for major brands.Enabling: Collaboration with Small and Medium-sized SuppliersApproximately 80 per cent of suppliers were small and medium-sized enterprises but their contribution to the total purchase volume was only 20 per cent. To ensure a consistently favourable shopping experience for users these suppliers had to be well maintained. Their own technological and operational capabilities varied greatly.In the past purchase and sales management had largely been manual processes. JD mainly focused on strategic suppliers. Therefore it sometimes failed to carefully manage small and medium-sized suppliers. In turn the suppliers felt overwhelmed when doing business with a giant organization such as JD. For example in 2019 JD registered a total turnover of over �2 trillion and a net income of �576.9 billion. Small and medium-sized suppliers were forced to deal with JD�s various divisions marketing systems finance systems and logistics groups at the same time. The issue was finding a solution for lean collaborative management. JD�s solution was to allow basic collaboration by offering end-to-end supply chain services including product introduction product selection and purchase through the VC platform. This enabled the suppliers with certain capabilities to manage smart supply chains.The VC platform allowed small and medium-sized suppliers and JD to work together on data sharing and collaborate on product price and purchase. For data sharing the VC platform provided inventory out-of-stock and sales forecasting data to help suppliers introduce and select products. For product collaboration JD provided product attribute tags that allowed suppliers to create and maintain product information on the VC platform. For price collaboration suppliers could manage price maintenance confirmation and other aspects. For purchase collaboration automatic replenishment was enabled when purchase orders were placed. Suppliers could access forecasting and replenishment information and purchase suggestions were sent to suppliers for independent processing. The automatic replenishment system could only provide the replenishment position and quantity. However when multiple suppliers were qualified the purchase and sales systems might not know how to evaluate and choose between different suppliers.Earlier problems faced in the collaboration between JD and small and medium-sized suppliers were resolved by the VC platform which presented the entire purchase collaboration process in a unified interface. With no manual labour required from either JD or the supplier capabilities such as sales forecasting intelligent replenishment and supply chain trend analysis could be offered to small and medium-sized suppliers. Still several questions remained. How could JD effectively enable suppliers and collaborate with them? What was the right level for enabling small and medium-sized suppliers and to collaborate with them? The answers to these questions depended on the willingness and capabilities of suppliers to become more connected and integrated which JD was exploring.Integration: Collaboration with Strategic SuppliersAccording to Chen the supply chain had gone through three stages of development. In the beginning the manufacturers dominated the supply chain. Then the distributors took the lead. Eventually user demand had become the driver. Against such a backdrop the retailer�supplier relationship was expected to see drastic changes. All parties were exploring the future development of the supply chain and their roles in it. Strategic suppliers which mainly consisted of major brands comprised only 20 per cent of over 30000 JD suppliers but accounted for 80 per cent of all purchases by value. Similarly in the computer consumer electronics and communication sector (known as 3C products) and home appliances 10 per cent of suppliers accounted for over 90 per cent of purchases by value.Unlike small and medium-sized suppliers most major brands had established practices in production marketing and supply chain operations. What was the best way for JD and strategic suppliers to integrate their capabilities? JD had to find a way to bridge the disconnect between strategic suppliers and the platform in the supply chain (see Exhibit 3) and then translate those back-end capabilities into front-end applications. JD also had to gain consumer insights through big data and AI to increase supply chain efficiency and value for major brands. This would reduce the multiplier impact on strategic suppliers caused by a so-called �bullwhip effect.�After the establishment of the Y business division JD enhanced its collaboration with strategic suppliers through technology that used different forms of co-operation at all levels including EDI CPFR joint business planning and consumer-to-manufacturer strategies. In January 2015 JD and the global technology group Meda began connecting their systems to share basic data such as orders sales and inventory. By the end of April the two companies had transferred 5 million pieces of data. In 2016 JD began co-operating with global food and beverage giant Nestl� S.A. (Nestl�) on collaborative forecasting and replenishment. In 2016 this project received the Efficient Consumer Response China platinum award. In addition to data sharing the two companies co-operated on forecasting and replenishment. Specifically they worked on precisely adjusting supply frequency and quantity improving online availability rates and optimizing inventory. Nestl��s forecasting was 85 per cent correct during China�s Singles� Day (or Double 11) shopping event in November of that year. JD focused on solving issues such as uneven distribution among warehouses redundant stock and shortages during promotions. JD�s availability rate increased by 12 per cent and Nestl��s order fulfillment by 27 per cent. The improved availability rate resulted in an annual gross merchandise value boost of over �3 million for Nestl�. In 2017 JD and Lenovo Group Limited established smooth collaboration in terms of EDI CPFR order acceptance and palletized transportation. EDI enabled smooth exchange of purchase orders between the two companies. When an order was placed the purchase information was automatically displayed on the suppliers� system without requiring complex and repetitive operations. The time required to place an order was reduced by at least 66 per cent. As for account checking EDI allowed the prompt sharing of invoice information and solved a problem that had made sales discount not visible during manual account checking. That same year JD and Aux Group Co. Ltd. started collaborating in demand planning supply scheduling replenishment planning and order execution. In 2019 JD and Vinda Paper Co. Ltd. launched a consumer-to-manufacturer co-operation program that resulted in favourable sales of a kitchen paper product customized for JD users thanks to online data insights.Among the suppliers that worked closely with JD two major companies followed considerably different paths after adopting systematic solutions of supply chain collaboration with JD. The two notable companies were Boge and Meda.Collaboration with BOGEBeginning: Perfect MatchJD�s supply chain collaboration with Boge one of JD�s earliest strategic suppliers was an ideal example. The EDI model was gradually replaced by CPFR during a transition that was not that difficult because both companies had powerful technological capabilities according to Davis Zhao Boge�s supply chain director. Boge was one of the first brands to adopt CPFR across the globe. With sufficient technological capabilities it implemented functions such as automatic reply and appointment through EDI while many domestic brands could only reply manually. The CPFR model was first adopted in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market which featured full stock and short purchase lead time. If a customer placed an order 14 days in advance Boge promised to promptly supply products 99.5 per cent of the time. CPFR driven by market-side information was a great fit for the FMCG industry.Practice: Market-Oriented Collaborative Forecasting and ReplenishmentExecutives at JD and at Boge would set annual sales goals offline at the start of the year. The CPFR system would then run online using standard procedures for automatic collaborative forecasting and replenishment.Collaborative ForecastingThe goals of major brands always differed from those of retailers. For example the brand might have been focused on one product to advance its strategy while JD could decide that another product had a better selling ability after intelligent forecasting based on historical data. Collaborative forecasting required both parties to share data and agree on the goal. Boge would start by sending key information such as product lifecycles and brand promotion campaigns to JD through system synchronization. Information connectivity was a premise for collaborative forecasting. The information and data Boge provided was directly transferred to JD via EDI. New data provided by strategic suppliers plus JD�s own data was imported into the intelligent forecasting system. The product the supplier wished to promote was then matched with a suitable sales forecasting model. The system could then export a 91-day dynamic sales forecast.Boge�s own decision model mainly targeted enterprise businesses. For the e-commerce industry its computational accuracy was inferior to that of JD but the accuracy of collaborative forecasting was 8�10 per cent higher compared to JD�s independent forecasting. Boge was able to directly exploit the benefits of high collaborative forecasting results.Automatic Replenishment and SupplyCollaborative forecasting results were also provided to the intelligent replenishment system as source data. Unlike one-side replenishment by JD when using the CPFR model Boge set parameters such as lead time safety stock supplier delivery time multi-warehouse support relationships and purchase frequency in the system. Information input by the strategic supplier could increase the accuracy of the 91-day replenishment plan. When a purchase order was placed the availability rate based on Boge replies was higher. The replenishment information and logic would also be synchronized to Boge�s decision-making system. With the automatic reply function Boge could automatically make an appointment for warehousing.Boge�s supply chain director Zhao spoke about the successful collaboration of the two companies at JD�s Y business division Open Day conference. Zhao stated that Boge and JD had upgraded to an end-to-end operations system that enabled fully automated lifecycle operations that covered forecasting ordering appointments and account checking. Operations had become more reliable while incidents of out-of-stock and platform inventory were significantly reduced. Consumers were enjoying a better experience with optimized platform operation efficiency and reduced costs. More importantly Zhao noted system and data connectivity had become the foundation for intelligent technologies to assist in making operational decisions (see Exhibit 4).Collaboration with MeDaMeda was one of the first brands to benefit from exchanging historical data such as orders sales and inventory with JD through EDI. For example sales of a machine called the Meda Mite Controller kept decreasing despite no customer complaints or negative reviews being received. The reason for a decline in sales was discovered in the JD customer service records. The records indicated that a specific filter was not included with the Mite Controller but when a complimentary filter was offered to customers sales of the machine rebounded.After the EDI system was launched Meda adopted a more intensive level of end-to-end collaboration and digital co-operation with JD aiming for collaborative forecasting and replenishment. Meda hoped to drive the supply chain with consumer data and to solve various problems in its supply chain operations (see Exhibit 5 Exhibit 6 and Exhibit 7). Despite a solid foundation for collaboration however new problems surfaced as the two parties intensified their collaboration.Beginning: Mismatch between E-commerce Demand and Product SupplyThe first barrier to a strong collaboration resulted from the characteristics of the home appliance industry. Inaccurate demand forecasting was a common problem facing this industry. Unlike the FMCG industry the consumption frequency of major appliances was low and repurchase time was difficult to forecast. Seasonal factors resulted in high swings in demand for major appliances. As consumer demand diversified the practice of matching production to demand replaced the traditional model of setting sales targets based on production. Along with inaccurate demand forecasting inventory management became a key issue. Overproduction resulted in an inventory backlog. Unable to confirm its e-commerce sales volume Meda chose to simply replenish out-of-stock items.Special requirements for logistics added uncertainty to the supply chain of major appliances. Many major appliances had special storage requirements. For example some could only be laid flat and could not be stacked. Some trucks arriving in JD warehouses could not be docked and unloaded. Procedures for manufacturing home appliances were much more complicated than production of FMCG. Using a flexible supply strategy to match e-commerce sales was difficult because it involved a series of adjustments to production scheduling mould replacement and new mould construction. Although most traditional home appliance manufacturers could only support monthly rolling planning Meda used a T+3 (i.e. transaction date plus three days) model but it still was no match for the fast turnaround time required by e-commerce.There was an obvious mismatch in production schedules between home appliances and e-commerce platforms. Appliance manufacturers hoped to lock in long-term demand to ensure smooth production scheduling. However e-commerce platforms wanted flexible replenishment that fluctuated with market demand. The result was a conflict of systems.Practice: From Collaborative Forecasting to Collaborative PlanningJD and Meda had to find a solution to their conflicting systems but it was difficult to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting for major appliances in the short term. Therefore the two companies focused on optimizing the supply plan in an effort to balance demand and supply over a certain period. The new system was completed and became operational in June 2019. Through a data platform that connected both systems JD shared its future sales and purchase plans with Meda while Meda showed its supply plans to JD. JD and Meda executives met to set annual goals at the start of the year. Through collaborative planning the two companies could modify forecasts in real time and integrate the software system with human experience.Communication and Adjustment Based on Supply Plan CollaborationThe first step was for the JD system to calculate a 91-day dynamic sales forecast and corresponding replenishment plan with information and data provided by both enterprises which would then be synchronized with Meda. Next Meda would create a three-month rolling supply plan an M+1 (i.e. one month plus one more month) monthly long-term plan and a T+3 (i.e. transaction date plus three days) weekly short-term plan. The schedules were based on annual sales goal breakdowns and on managing upstream suppliers and production lines. Meda then synchronized these plans with JD. Finally purchasing and sales employees from both JD and Meda focused on the supply and demand for the next two weeks. They manually adjusted the supply and demand plan to compensate for market demand fluctuations over the week. The software system also assisted in the decision-making process.Inventory Collaboration and ReplenishmentWith advance communication concerning supply and demand for the next two weeks no major errors occurred when JD purchasing and sales employees placed purchase orders. This new model was first applied to refrigerator sales which saw forecasting accuracy significantly increase from 55 per cent to 85 per cent. JD and Meda also made detailed purchase adjustments based on various temporary factors. When overages in supply occurred the inventory was increased in JD warehouses or collaborative warehouses. When supply was low JD would focus on selling products of other brands or launch pre-order sales for Meda. To facilitate real-time adjustments Meda transmitted most of its real-time process data including production data to the new system via an application programming interface. The system allowed JD workers at the front end to learn about production status and issues at the back end.JD warehouses had limited capacity so Meda followed JD�s example and expanded its own storage network. Wherever JD set up a large warehouse Meda also built or rented a similar facility to serve as a collaborative warehouse. Meda installed the JD logistics system so that when major appliances entered a Meda warehouse they were immediately registered as being available for sale on the JD e-commerce platform JD.com. Small discrepancies in supply and demand could be easily resolved through inventory adjustments.Delivery information sharing between JD and Meda had increased order fulfillment by 3 per cent and shortened the financial turnover period by 20 per cent. However according to Zhao Zhiming Meda�s director of e-commerce supply chain and experience collaboration was not a straightforward task. It required joint efforts by departments both inside and outside the enterprise (see Exhibit 5 Exhibit 6 and Exhibit 7).Challenges: Bumpy Road to IntegrationCollaboration with different suppliers required technological capabilities and various other elements unique to JD and its suppliers. Chen and his team had been studying the key elements of supplier collaboration by communicating with suppliers. Reviewing mistakes made in the past could help ensure smoother co-operation in the future. The Y business division Open Day conference was a great chance to listen to all parties involved. In particular five main challenges needed to be discussed.Challenge 1: Different Positions versus Smooth CollaborationSuppliers and JD departments had different points of view because their positions varied. Each department had its own set of key performance indicators (KPIs) and concerns. A brand supplier commented that the main difficulty in collaboration was that JD had only one team responsible for both procurement and sales while the supplier had two teams. The supply chain team focused more on procurement while the marketing team dealt with sales. When JD team members communicated with the supply chain team or the marketing team they were unable to reach an agreement because the two teams had different views. According to Zhiming it was wrong to talk with sales representatives about supply chain KPIs such as inventory turnover and lead time. They needed to know how much money they could make. In other words supply chain KPIs had to be translated into sales KPIs to persuade these workers.Challenge 2: Organizational Reform versus Stable Co-operationThe market was continuously evolving. To better satisfy market demand JD would adjust its organizational structure. In a closed meeting with JD a supplier�s head of the supply chain complained that JD�s organizational reforms of the previous year had had a major impact on brands. JD�s Y business division had changed its contact people several times forcing the supplier�s business specialists to explain the same story over and over again. But due to different understandings of the same information the execution could be at odds with the original goal. This issue weakened project continuity and increased communication costs. Supply chain collaboration required stable and intensive co-operation over the long term. Stability was needed not only in the organizational structure but also at the staff level. How could JD and its suppliers balance the uncertainty in organizational reforms and the need to maintain long-term relationships?Challenge 3: Standard Procedures versus Flexible AdjustmentJD�s purchasing and sales employees would sometimes slightly adjust the standard system to meet business needs which would sometimes annoy suppliers. There were standards for ordering products but the system rules might not necessarily be followed and adjustments would be made when JD placed orders. If the system rules were observed it was possible to optimize the system logic. However manual adjustment indicated a lack of understanding of the underlying logic. The random logic that was introduced made it impossible to optimize the system�s logic. This resulted in poor forecasting and unclear directions for optimization.Challenge 4: Diverse Scenarios versus Staff CapabilitiesThe effect of the collaboration system was maximized when it ran in specific business scenarios. However there were countless scenarios involved in supply chain collaboration. This required higher capabilities from product developers and business decision makers. Product developers were required to have a business mindset whereas business leaders responsible for making decisions had to be familiar with the products. All decisions had to be made in a systematic and forward-looking manner taking account of system availability ease-of-use and scalability.Challenge 5: Long-term Benefit versus Short-term CostThe main concern of suppliers could be summed up in two short questions: Is it profitable? How can we make a profit? Small and medium-sized suppliers placed a higher value on short-term profits and input�output ratios which would impact the level of engagement in collaboration. When it came to large strategic suppliers JD worked mainly with supply chain management departments which were generally viewed as cost centres. These departments faced pressure from decision makers and other internal collaborative departments. From a financial perspective collaboration was a cost-optimization project. It was very import

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-06-16It was a pleasant cold morning in October 2017 and Balaji Viswanathan founder of Invento Robotics (Invento) was eagerly waiting for his team members to join him in the corporate board room. An event manager for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) an international entrepreneurship event organized by the US and Indian governments had approached Invento with a mandate to build a unique humanoid robot that would locomote around the stage to greet Indiaâs prime minister Narendra Modi and Ivanka Trump senior adviser to the US president Donald Trump when the two would appear together at the summit in Hyderabad. Viswanathan was not interested in participating in the summit because of the money; the event was poised to be a platform to showcase what humanoid robots could do. The event would attract the attention of the international media and could propel Invento onto the international stage. Viswanathan was aware that the event might offer the perfect platform to expose Invento to many potential customers. It was thus imperative to design a complete marketing strategyâtarget customers product highlights distribution and advertisingâbefore heading to the GES.With just one year of research and development (R&D) thus far invested in the creation of its humanoid robot it would be difficult for Invento to finish casting casing and finalizing all product functions in only three weeksâ time which was when the robot was expected to be ready for the summitâs opening ceremony. It was likely that potential customers and industry stalwarts would bombard Viswanathan with questions about the robotâs features and price as well as information about how they could purchase a robot once unveiled to public eyes at GES. With so much on his plate Viswanathan was disconcerted about the complex marketing strategy decisions he had to make in the next few days.Invento RoboticsViswanathan Inventoâs chief executive officer (CEO) and founder completed a master of science at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2007 and a master of business administration at Babson College in 2014. After spending three years at his first job with Microsoft Corporation he returned to India where he started a set of entrepreneurial venturesNalandaU Agni Innovation Labs Zingfin and Limitlesssome of which were in India some in the United States. Viswanathan had a great deal of followers on the popular social media platform Quora where he regularly wrote answers to questions on topics such as history economics politics and society. As of 2017 he was one of the most followed persons on that platform. He enjoyed an extensive reach on other social media platforms as well.Viswanathan started Invento in Bangalore in 2016 with the aim to make robots relevant in the households of India. Invento designed and manufactured two product lines named Mitra and Mitri humanoid robots in male and female versions (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Humanoid robots were robots with features resembling a human being. The company wished to enable robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to reach the public in a way that would be similar to what personal computers had done for the computing industry. Inventoâs mission was to productize key inventions from the labs by combining research with business sense. The vision was to bring about a robotics revolution similar to those brought about by the iPhone in 2007 and personal computers in 1981. Invento built robotic stacks that sustained and provided a platform for delivering proprietary and third-party AI solutions (see Exhibit 3). See Exhibit 5 for Inventoâs balance sheet for the years ending 2017 and 2018.Robots made by Invento were equipped with four unique features. First they had a location-based awareness with a precision tolerance of a centimetre that enabled them to navigate through indoor spaces. The robots could be directed by voice to reach a particular location which was specifically useful for retail settings. Second gesture-based immersive voice conversations allowed the robots to understand non-audible cues in the conversation. Robots could also understand verbal exchanges ranging from a one-line command to a natural conversation. Third voice stacking with triggerless exchange allowed for a userâs face to serve as a trigger instead of having to use trigger words (such as âHey Alexa!â). Invento had developed proprietary natural language processing techniques that were utilized for this feature. Fourth Inventoâs distinct computer-vision stack combined with a computer-vision application programming interface (API) and TensorFlow models enabled the robots to detect emotions objects and faces. These features were distinctively present in Inventoâs products and put Mitra and Mitri a step above the competition.Most of Inventoâs clients recognized the high quality of the companyâs products. In interactions with Inventoâs senior leaders various companies had shown interest in humanoid robots and in deploying them. These positive testimonials were deemed of great importance and generated positive sentiments about the companyâs future.Market for Humanoid RobotsThe market size of humanoid robots also known as humanoids was valued at US$450 million in 2016. The use of humanoids was an increasing trend globally with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35 per cent from 2017 to 2024. The industrial robot industry had grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of 9.5 per cent between 2013 and 2017. As of 2017 China was the biggest market closely followed by Japan and Germany. However new markets such as Mexico India and Australia had displayed faster growth rates (see Exhibit 5).According to an industry profile on global robots published by MarketLine all strategic forces (buyer power supplier power degree of rivalry threat of substitutes and threat of new entrants) were equally high and played a relatively important role in the industry. Robots were internationally marketed products and a playerâs performance was decidedly based on the alignment of all strategic market forces. Buyers in the industry were mainly large organizations and multinational conglomerates that possessed the wherewithal to handle such large-ticket purchases. Suppliers were fragmented and globally dispersed. Extensive specialization in production resulted in high switching costs. Entry to market was restricted due to the intellectual property rights held by existing players. However new players were quickly emerging and were applying their knowledge to new developments and proprietary technology.Major international players included Japan-based SoftBank Robotics and China-based Amy Robotics and Sanbot Robotics (Sanbot) from China. Backed by the multinational conglomerate holding company SoftBank Corp. SoftBank Robotics was the worldâs leading humanoid robot manufacturer with three major offeringsa customer service robot a teaching assistant robot and an autonomous vacuum sweeper. The company had a wide global presence with offices in Tokyo Shanghai San Francisco Boston and Paris.Amy Robotics a Chinese humanoid manufacturer founded in June 2015 had research offices across the globe. It had development centres and offices in the United States Germany Japan and the United Kingdom. Amy Roboticsâ robot was supported by its state-of-the-art AI extensions in addition to well-developed hardware. Sanbot was also a Chinese robotics firm and had four major humanoid offerings differentiated by size: Sanbot Nano Sanbot Elf Sanbot Mini Elf and Sanbot Max. Sanbot offered an API service that enabled developers to build their own apps for Sanbot robots. Peppera robot built by Aldebaran a French robotics company later acquired by SoftBank Roboticswas possibly most similar to Inventoâs offerings. Inventoâs robots performed better than Pepper on several parameters including autonomous navigation inbuilt support for facial recognition and contextual conversations. Importantly Pepper was not available outside Japan and had multiple restrictions on its use and publicity. Apart from international competitions Inventoâs robots faced competition from Indian manufacturers such as Sirena Technologies.Viswanathan commentedThe key competitive advantage we are going for is being very focused on enterprise applicationsincluding integration into their [the enterpriseâs] systems security privacy and deployments. The robot is only as useful as it is integrated into an enterpriseâs systems. Our Chinese or Japanese competitors often lack this understanding of large software teams and enterprises.For example a humanoid in a hospital would require contextual integration and updatingâhardware to hardware hardware to software and software to software. The humanoid should know where to pick up and drop off medical instruments and medicines in operation theatres and pharmacies while updating the information system with inventory wait times and other elements. Even when a humanoid was great at navigation facial recognition and conversations integrating it with an enterpriseâs information technology (IT) system added multifold value.Indian MarketThe humanoid robot market in India was expected to follow the global trend although specific numbers varied with unreliable estimates. Nevertheless in terms of installation Indiaâs industrial robot market was the 11th largest in the world as reported by the International Federation of Robotics. Further in 2017 alone the country increased its robot production from $111.23 million to $124.27 million (i.e. by 11.7 per cent). The cumulative annual growth rate between 2013 and 2017 was 9.3 per cent which was less than the global CAGR of 9.5 per cent (see Exhibit 4). The general sentiment however was that Indiaâs market would soon increase significantly. The industry was expected to grow further as the country was expected to follow a steep economic growth trajectory. The countryâs gross domestic product was expected to grow by 7 per cent and companies intended to increase capacity and automate menial jobs an initiative that would result in higher sales of robots and robotic equipment.TARGET CUSTOMERSInvento positioned its humanoids for six major industries and sectors: retail finance health care government hospitality and education. Humanoids were becoming increasingly attractive for use in retail for their emotional engagement proposition. The robots could create an empathetic link with shoppers providing them a better shopping experience. Typical usage for robots in retail included offering greetings processing payments providing information and sales support services including surveying the shoppers. The finance industry used robots for personalized targeted positioning of financial products among other things; the expected use cases included employing the robots as receptionists for on-demand report generation and as recommendation engines. The health care industry used humanoids as health assistants for self-diagnosis and preliminary nursing. In the government sector robots could be used to create additional methods to deliver services in multiple languages. In the hospitality industry humanoids could be employed for the direct delivery of information and personalized services to customers (see Exhibit 3). They could also be used by educational institutions as a teaching-aid tool. In the service sector humanoid robots were considered a latent need and there were few manufacturers of service-sector robots. The finance and hospitality sectors were expected to drive a major share of revenues in the forthcoming year.Invento targeted Fortune 1000 companies that were looking for such humanoid robots. Its primary customers mainly belonged to two industries: (1) banking finance and insurance (BFI); and (2) IT. Some prominent names in Inventoâs portfolio included Barclays PLC HDFC Bank Limited Accenture PLC Infosys Limited and HCL Technologies. BFI customers looked for humanoids for customer engagement and product selling. IT customers on the other hand used robots to offer different solutions to their customers. Viswanathan explained âIn the next five years we believe almost every major enterprise in the world would use robotsin a way akin to PC [personal computer] entry into [the] enterprise world in the 1980s. The applications would range from customer engagement to sales visitor management security and employee engagement.âBeyond industry requirements Invento categorized its customers into two groups: vanity and sanity. The customers who made up the vanity segment were typically high-end users who took pride in owning a robot appraising it as a luxury good. Serving this segment resulted in higher margins but lower sales volumes. On the other hand sanity customers had a complex and long buying process. The perceived value for sanity customers revolved around the novelty of robots. With this segment the margins were lower but the sales volumes were much higher.Inventoâs closest competitor SoftBank Robotics targeted its robot Pepper to players in the hospitality retail banking and automotive industries. In the past SoftBank Robotics had engaged customers such as HSBC Bank in Manhattan New York and Courtyard by Marriott. HSBC Bank used Pepper for providing information to customers about financial products; directing customers to the appropriate staff; and even posing for selfies telling jokes and dancing for the audience. Courtyard by Marriott had observed an 11-point increase in customer satisfaction by using Pepper.ProductInvento had built a vendor supply chain to outsource many of the standardized components required in the assembly of robots. The final product was manufactured at Inventoâs Bengaluru plant. As the product specifications evolved rapidly it was a challenge for Invento to find appropriate vendors to whom it could outsource the relevant parts. As Viswanathan maintained the production of the robots would remain in India in the foreseeable future.The male version of the humanoid robot Mitra was five feet tall and weighed 50 kilograms. It could easily be disassembled carried and reassembled as per the requirements. It had a unique suspension system that enabled it to walk on surfaces as rough as earthen roads. The robot was equipped with a battery that had a working capacity of more than 12 hours on a single charge. It was also equipped with a screen speaker connectivity and Bluetooth support to allow it to carry out its daily operations (see Exhibit 1). Considering its size Mitraâs movement needed to be calibrated and controlled to safeguard it from toppling.Viswanathan stated âAutonomous navigation in an uncontrolled environment is the toughest problem to solve. Designing robots for [an] indoor environment eliminates the possibility of having a line-flow arrangement atypical of theoretical modelling.â It was apparent that training the user base for interaction with robots in environments such as retail settings was a tough task given that such places attracted people unfamiliar with humanoids.Mitri the female version of the humanoid robot was a new addition to Inventoâs product portfolio. The Mitri line of robots was designed to be a human-resource robot with its usage aligned to jobs like operating a reception desk. She was equipped with âsoft skillsâ such as etiquette which made this robot unique. Invento claimed Mitri to be Indiaâs first female robot receptionist. She constantly blinked her blue LED (light-emitting diode) eyes and looked around to register people in her database. She could register the emotions of the people around her and was programmed to frequently cheer up employees who were feeling low. Interaction with Mitri typically started at the reception area of a workplace where the interactor communicated to Mitri their details such as their name age workplace and the purpose for their meeting. Based on the registered data and data saved during any previous interactions Mitri would recognize the person with her wide eyes.Her head was spherical and had an antenna fitted to it. The body was cased in a plastic frame that was reminiscent of C-3PO from Star Wars. Like Mitra the body could be disassembled and packed easily. Mitri was also equipped with the ability to communicate in multiple languagesincluding Indic languagesthat were coded as needed. Both Mitri and Mitra came with a one-year warranty and a service-level agreement of 24-hour level-1 support. This could be topped up with an annual maintenance contract. Although the two robot lines were used for different purposes they had some overlapping characteristics. Viswanathan sometimes wondered whether sales of Mitri robots could cannibalize sales of Mitra robots. Were the products different enough to be targeted to different segments?Mitra and Mitri robots were discernibly branded. On a casual look Mitraâs name written in a satiny font was visible on the robotâs right arm and bottom wheels. The front of Mitra was loaded with a touch screenused for taking instructions that were beyond audio- or visual-based input mechanismswhose screen saver usually set to be the client companyâs logo could be changed. Mitri was available in bright colours such as yellow pink and violet. Mitriâs lower body was characteristically unique: it appeared as if the humanoid was wearing a frock or a robe (see Exhibit 2).PriceEqually challenging for Invento was what price it should charge for the Mitra robot. There was a perfect Goldilocks zone for pricing: set the price too high and the product would remain unsold; set the price too low and there was risk of leaving a surplus on the table. Further the pricing had to take care of recovering the costs. Apart from production costs the R&D costs were quite high for a specialized product like a robot. According to Inventoâs internal research other players in the market priced their product in a range of $12550$16730.It was difficult to gauge exact figures for production as most of it was done in-house and Invento did not have any pre-determined cost accounting system in place. Viswanathan estimated that Invento spent around $34863 per month as fixed costs. About four-fifths of these were salaries paid to staff and personnel. The R&D and design departments were deemed important from a product perspective and were expected to remain as such in the near future. Viswanathan recalled contemplating the pricing the previous year: âIt was confusing. Should we just add a flat margin to all over and above the cost? Should we estimate the âtrue valueâas MBA [master of business administration] grads put itand charge for that? Could we somehow peg the price to our competitors? In any case we canât push our gross margins to below 75 per cent.âSumit Roy Inventoâs chief revenue officer explained that either Mitra or Mitri would ideally be suited to replace a receptionist at for example a health care facility. The median salary of a receptionist in India was $2621 per year. In addition to this an average receptionist earned about $209 as a bonus and another $140 as commission every year. The humanoid robot could also be used for selling credit cards in a mall. In that case the number of credit card leads generated for the bank could be estimated. The objective for a start-up like Invento was not to maximize cost savings but to increase revenue generation through customer engagement an area where the company performed well. While making such calculations one could assume the average life of Mitri to be around five years.DistributionMost of Inventoâs sales had thus far been through direct sales. Inventoâs salespeople who were first trained on sales and product features contacted potential buyers and negotiated the purchase. Having a completely isolated sales department enabled the salespeople to close deals rather swiftly. The typical cost to company for a new salesperson at Invento was about $19520. Of this 70 per cent was fixed and the remaining cost was variable.The company lacked direct distribution partners. Most of its sales were driven through its own sales professionals. The company struggled to find distribution partners; small and medium-sized enterprises often lacked the resources and the right sales force to sell a complex product such as the Mitra and Mitri robots. Further executive sales representatives were difficult to train for non-traditional products. Invento was considering the idea of having an external sales agency driving the sales as the sales numbers were not yet certain. Even though the company had never entered any contract for independent sales representatives it was common knowledge that independent sales representatives could present new opportunities as a channel partner. They were apparently also less expensive than a regular sales force (until they closed deals). Most of them had no fixed charge and worked on commission. According to Inventoâs estimates independent sales representatives would command a commission of somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent of the order value. Important benefits of employing independent sales representatives were their vast knowledge of the territory in which they operated and their ability to work remotely.AdvertisingFor Invento public relations interaction with the press and social media played an important role in how it communicated to the public and disseminated critical information about the firm and its robots. Viswanathan himself was very active on social media platforms such as Quora and Facebook. He had a huge following on Quora that enabled communication on a large scale.Invento also participated in more than 20 international trade shows including CES and the World AI Show which often led to international client leads. CES was the annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association a standards and trade organization representing more than 2200 consumer technology companies in the United States. The annual event inaugurated in 1967 was currently held in Las Vegas Nevada every January. CES 2017 saw an attendance of 184279 people from around the world which substantiated its popularity. The World AI Show hosted international AI experts data scientists start-ups think tanks technology leaders government bodies and investors together in a single event aiming for the promotion and exchange of developments in the field of AI.Invento had a one-person public relations department that coordinated different activities. Viswanathanâs personal online presence was very strong and attracted significant attention for Invento and its robots as a result. When communicating with industry participants and businesses Invento highlighted the benefits of using humanoid robots and took such opportunities to promote its flagship products. It presented major statistics and data about the changing industry to prospective customers. Invento continued to emphasize to its prospective and current customers that robots were going to be present in all industries soon. It constantly reminded them that not utilizing humanoid robots could put their firms in a disadvantageous position competitively. Invento spent around $1394 on direct advertising but more than $27886 on indirect advertising (trade show participation travel etc.). In addition to the CEO the head of marketing and a sales executive there were four full-time personnel on Inventoâs sales team.The Way ForwardIn the short term participating in the GES would be an enriching experience for Invento. However Viswanathan still had challenges to face. As a start-up Invento was almost always bootstrapping itself out of its issuesbut would this method be sufficient in the long run? The foundations of a company were important and Viswanathan had to ensure that Invento had strong foundations. Invento had to work on the final outline of the marketing strategy comprising product price channels of distribution and promotion. Viswanathan and his team members were aware that this task would not be limited to three weeks. The bigger question concerned whether they could put a concrete marketing strategy in place that would boost their confidence when they inevitably met curious minds at the summit.Exhibit 1: Mitra RobotSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: MItri robot employed at smartworksSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Smart Kiosk Management Using Mitri robotsNote: TAT = turnaround time; AI = artificial intelligence; NLP = natural language processing.

(Sandu Pharmaceuticals) was a publicly listed company operating in the pharmaceuticals and health care sectors. Incorporated in 1985 the company traced its history back over more than a century. The third generation was at the helm of the firm in September 2016. Sandu Pharmaceuticals manufactured Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurveda was a traditional Indian system of medicine native to the Indian subcontinent and a popular form of alternative medicine. The demand for Ayurvedic medicinal products had seen an upswing not only in India but across many countries in Africa Europe and North and South America. Shashank Sandu the company’s director was in a “happy space” in his business. One day while chatting with his friends about opportunities for setting up manufacturing bases in countries outside India the conversation turned to the subject of grooming the next generation to run the business. This got Shashank thinking about how previous successive generations in the family had handled the challenge of absorbing family members into the business and in particular about whether he was doing enough to prepare the next generation to take over a business that was bound to grow more rapidly in the future given the growing concern worldwide about the cost of allopathic health care and demand for less invasive and more holistic treatments.The Business of AyurvedaIn 1899 Shashank’s grandfather and his four brothers all of whom were practitioners of Ayurveda (Ayurvedacharyas) decided to set up a business to formulate and sell Ayurvedic medicines. Their entrepreneurial venture was a direct response to the nationalistic Swadeshi movement and specifically to the call by one of the first leaders of the Indian independence movement Balgangadhar Tilak to  revive domestic products and production processes. Ayurveda was one of the world’s oldest holistic healing systems. Therapies were typically based on complex herbal compounds minerals and metal substances. This system of medicine had had a continual presence in the Indian subcontinent for more than 3000 years. However by the late 19th century Ayurveda and other traditional systems of healing were under threat not only from the British regime that ruled India and was skeptical about these systems but also from modern (allopathic) medicine even though allopathic formulations were far more expensive. Historically practitioners of Ayurveda made their own formulations. Sandu Brothers Private Limited (Sandu Brothers) was one of the early attempts to create an industrial-scale manufacturing and distribution operation focused on Ayurvedic medicines. As demand grew the company moved its factory to larger premises soon after its founding. The success of Sandu Brothers’ products was driven by a commitment to quality and a firm adherence to the basic tenets of Ayurveda.Since its inception in 1899 the business had expanded greatly; it had a pan-India presence and significant exports to 22 countries. The company had close to 950 employees out of which 30 were in management. About 100 employees were in manufacturing 400 were in marketing and sales 40 were in quality control and research 50 were in warehousing and logistics and the rest were categorized as workers. Though it stayed true to tradition in its use of ingredients the business incorporated modern pharmaceutical practices in formulation manufacturing testing and quality control. By 1998–99 the company had manufacturing units in New Mumbai and Goa as well as a full-fledged research unit. The company was not only growing its export market but also actively considering setting up units including wellness spas and centres outside India (see Exhibit 1 for the organization structure at the senior level.)During the past century allopathy had been at the top of the hierarchy of preference for medical systems in India. Since the nation’s independence in 1947 the Indian government had endeavoured to provide affordable health care using this “modern” system. However many Indians saw Ayurveda as an effective choice for managing certain chronic diseases and recognized its potential to promote overall well-being wellness and health with minimal side effects. Some popular formulations were believed to improve immunity aid in indigestion relieve musculoskeletal conditions like joint pain and promote healthy hair growth. However due to a lack of active government support and involvement this and other indigenous systems of medicines had languished for decades. It was only in 1995 that the government set up a department devoted to Indian systems of medicine under the Central Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A separate ministry dedicated to research development and education in various branches of non-allopathic systems was set up in 2014. In many countries around the world practices derived from Ayurveda were seen as being part of the family of complementary or alternative medicine and more recently were being integrated into general wellness applications and in some cases medical treatment.The Family in Family BusinessThe Sandu family belonged to the close-knit Karade Brahmin community which had been socially and politically influential in the Konkan and Goa region of Western India under various ruling dynasties before the area was colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Karade Brahmins typically served as village record keepers and accountants financiers tax farmers merchants in intra-Asian trade priests and diplomats. As a result of the Portuguese invasions the community had scattered to nearby regions where its members took up administrative vocations under the ruling dynasties and established themselves as landowners and traders. The community continued to be close-knit and it emphasized learning through both traditional and modern systems of knowledge. This focus inspired the five Sandu brothers to venture out of the traditional occupation of landownership and join the growing tribe of indigenous entrepreneurs who were trying to break the stranglehold of the British in the health care sector and many other sectors of the Indian economy.A majority of the founders’ sons had decided to join the family business. In most cases the sons either were not given a choice in the matter or did not even consider pursuing another career. For example Shashank’s father was admitted to the first batch of a top-notch management institution but the family urged him to forgo that opportunity and join the family business instead (he did however take a part-time management course at the same institution). Based on their aptitude the second generation members were put in charge of various aspects of the business. Some of them were trained in particular trades to make the job–person fit more appropriate. For example Shashank’s father had a business degree one of his two uncles was an Ayurvedic doctor and another was a printing technologist. Some of his cousins however had chosen to work in areas of the business that caught their fancy. Some had only a sinecure management position (e.g. in charge of transportation). The daughters of the family got married and moved away and were not expected to make any ownership claims. Daughters-in-law were not expected to join the operations but to preserve family peace and harmony instead.The joint family structure had been the norm in India for centuries and continued to be quite prevalent even in modern times particularly among business families. The Sandu family though close-knit had maintained separate establishments for the past few decades; Shashank’s grandmother had had the foresight to encourage the separation of the household to minimize conflicts. However the entire family spread across many households jointly participated in a number of prescribed religious rituals and festivals every year. The family aimed to abide by traditional Indian middle-class values:Health is wealth.A paisa saved is a rupee gained.Avoid all types of wastage—food electricity raw materials.Be frugal and live simply—take a bus if possible not the car.Good education and learning is a must and will last throughout your life.Respect elders even though you may think they are wrong.Growing up in a family imbued with a strong set of values still did not eradicate the problem of some family members blurring the lines between their entitlement as owners and their responsibilities as managers. The second generation had 15 male cousins (see Exhibit 2). Among them one family member decided to buy a luxury vehicle with money drawn from the business. Another decided to fuel his gambling habit from the business cash box. Some had unrealistic aspirations that they expected the business to support. One wanted to produce a movie which he expected the business to back rationalizing that the company’s product placement in the movie would help in marketing. Some members decided to start their own businesses using family resources without thinking through the consequences. For example one member started a car repair showroom within the factory premises without requesting the necessary permissions. Everyone wanted a personal car and a driver—paid for by the business. In some sense many family members viewed the business as an entity that existed to bankroll their whims and fancies.The Business in Family BusinessThe second generation continued to view the employees of the company as an extension of the family. Most of the workers were from the same region as the family. Many were second generation employees themselves. The approach to managing employees was distinctly paternalistic. The family’s belief in paternalism was severely shaken when there was strike in the factory in the late 1980s which led to the factory’s closure for nine months. The industrial unrest was fomented by external leaders who specialized in galvanizing employees to raise questions against real or perceived injustices. One of Shashank’s uncles was stabbed (he survived) there was sloganeering against the family owner/managers their effigies were burned and an atmosphere of terror and fear reigned. For the family it was a psychologically devastating time.Shashank who had just finished high school at that time was drafted into interacting with lawyers and courts as he was not targeted by the striking employees. The industrial dispute was eventually resolved through the use of various legal strategies but it had led to the closure of one unit and the shifting of the manufacturing base to regions with a more positive industrial climate. More importantly more nuanced thinking about the management–employee relationship emerged as a consequence of these events. From a strong emotional bond based on paternalism the relationship shifted to one in which commercial ties and economic value constituted important strands. The company ensured that the new plants did not have unions.Shashank recollected that from a young age it had been drilled into him and all of his siblings that in business a personal promise or verbal commitment was golden. Before the company went public in 1993 capital formation was primarily financed through personal loans. These loans were typically between two parties where one’s word of honour was paramount. However meeting the commitment to pay back the principal with hefty interest rates on the due date at periodic intervals was also a big challenge. Shashank said “I have seen my father and uncle crushed with stress about sticking to their commitment [to pay back on time].” The third generation insisted on changing the pattern of capital accumulation by accessing more formal channels. They had to fight their predecessors’ inherent fear of both loss of control and of disclosure requirements. There was a great deal of opposition from various family members to a public listing. Some said “How much do you want for your business expansion?—here let me write a cheque.” Ultimately there was only a mandatory dilution of 25 per cent of the shares to the public. The father and uncles took a pledge from the third generation telling them “You are only going to the public to generate money. Don’t ever ‘play the market’ because if you start playing the market your focus will shift from manufacturing.” See Exhibit 3 for the business value system that guided the family. By 2015 the family business consisted of the publicly listed pharmaceutical company as well as privately held companies and trusts that controlled various types of assets and discharged different types of responsibilities. As the business grew the family felt the need to introduce modern practices of manufacturing quality control and process orientation. In time the company’s manufacturing plants adopted aseptic techniques to improve quality with the entire process of converting raw material to products untouched by human hands. Rules for Joining THE Family BusinessThe family had never done any formal succession planning. But as Shashank and his siblings and cousins were growing up Shashank’s father and uncles who were involved in managing the business put in place some broad rules for working for the family business based on what they had learned from past experience. The next generation was told that joining the business should not be considered an entitlement. They were expected to earn appropriate educational degrees and work in an outside firm in a responsible position before they would be considered for a suitable role in the company. Shashank recalled:We were told categorically and repeatedly that we should get trained in roles that the business requires. The prime requirements in any business are marketing manufacturing and finance/legal. We were expected to gauge our aptitude before deciding on the role in which we wanted to specialize. For example during my summer holidays in high school I worked as an assistant clerk with one of our chartered accountants. I didn’t like it as a vocation but understood what an accountant does. Similarly my brother worked under a well-respected chartered company secretary. My cousin went to work in a pharmaceutical company as a research scientist and today handles the manufacturing and R&D [research and development].Shashank subsequently completed a master’s degree in business management from a reputed institute and worked for about three years in marketing at two well-known companies in the private sector. Recalling his stint at a fast-moving consumer goods multinational company he said:I was selling the product in Dharavi the largest slum in Asia. It taught me to respect the customer. The demand for the company’s products was naturally limited in such a poverty-stricken area. I had to think out of the box to get the shopkeeper to place an order for even a very small amount of products. Rejections were part of life there. I really learned the art of sales there. In my second stint I learned how to manage workers to ensure that production always kept pace with client demand.After about three years Shashank was invited to apply for a position in the family business. He was interviewed by an external expert and his salary was negotiated based on his last drawn salary.While discussing how the third generation was prepared for operational responsibilities Shashank said:We come with three types of baggage: (a) our personality (b) our character and (c) the perceived value placed by all those who surround us. The last type starts even with the nickname given to you. I and my siblings had domestic help who also did some light office work during the day. So their perceptions of us and what gets communicated among employees is also part of the baggage. Family members had their own set ideas of what we should do when we grew up. I think education and outside work experience helps a person overcome this baggage to a large extent.Talking about the norms of the business that were informally communicated to all (see Exhibit 4) Shashank recollected some conflicts within the family:Everyone wanted to join the business as their birthright. Everyone wanted the same salary. But can a business take this load? By the time the third generation was joining the business the distinction between ownership and management was becoming clear. Family members who didn’t fit the requirements were either eased out or were retiring anyway.There were family members who were not interested in contributing to the business. They were happy with the dividends they earned. Over the years such members were bought out (see Exhibit 5 for the changing pattern of family owners and managers). Shashank explained “Business is like a capitalist system. You need to constantly feed it with various types of expertise to be supplied by the family. There were some who didn’t want to be bothered. But those who were contributing to the requirements of the business started increasing their holdings.”SUCCESSION IN THE TRUE SENSEWhen a next generation member joined the business they had to learn the business and make their presence felt. Shashank recollected that in his initial days as a management trainee he spent two months in each department. While in the logistics department he realized that the carrying and forwarding agent was getting richly remunerated because of a flawed commission formula. He had this changed. Similarly he brought down the cost of bottling by negotiating a better deal with the bottle suppliers. He was able to do these things because people were willing to listen to him due to his position as a family member as well as his external job experience. Shashank recollected:People in the company are very smart. They figured out that I could make good decisions but they also separately got these decisions ratified by the big bosses (my father and uncles) as they didn’t know where the power centre was and they themselves had a different equation with the older power centres. At some point in time from both sides a line has to be drawn when the older generation says clearly “Don’t involve me” and the employees understand that the power centre has shifted.Recalling how he had had to fight his way in Shashank described an incident where a very senior professional in the company misrepresented facts to his uncle after ferreting out information from him through a junior colleague. Shashank had actually initially fed partial information to the concerned professional who then encouraged the older generation to essentially negate the proposal before it was even formally presented. In the formal meeting Shashank supplied the full information and had his proposal accepted. This was how he ensured that this particular person stopped pitting family members against each other. Shashank joined as management trainee in 1992 was promoted as manager (planning and development) in 1993 and became general manager (marketing) in 1994 and director in 1996.  With two brothers and two cousins (one actually belonged to the fourth generation but was referred to as a cousin) handling various roles in the business conflicts did occur from time to time. Typically conflicts between any two family members were openly discussed with the other two acting as arbitrators. Conflict was considered a healthy way to understand different perspectives of the business. Shashank explained that this way of resolving conflicts reflected the way things were handled in his family saying “Business is an extension of how the family is.”Role for family members who retireDBoth Shashank’s father and uncles retired upon reaching the age of 60 an occasion that was marked by an appropriate farewell function. After retirement each took some time off for religious tourism. After a few months they started coming back to the office and spending a few hours in the afternoon in offices assigned to them. None of them was part of the organizational structure. However their presence was welcomed as the operational managers used them as a sounding board. Many older employees dropped by to chat with them even about personal issues. The elders also looked after the religious traditions of the family planning family events such as get-togethers and weddings as well as various community events not connected with the business.current CHALLENGES OF the BUSINESS By the second decade of the 21st century 65 per cent of India’s population was less than 35 years of age. The challenge before the company was to present its products in such a way that it appealed to the young generation. The global phenomenon of aspiring to a healthy lifestyle was catching up in India as well. Shashank felt that opportunities to explore and expand in the Indian market were significant. To cater to modern sensibilities and lifestyle requirements the company had come out with individual pack sizes of its products which allowed daily doses to be carried easily in a purse or lunch box. The company was also thinking about creating certificate courses to allow practitioners to recommend correct therapies and appropriate doses.The Next GenerationThe fourth generation of the family comprised of the children of the four cousins involved in managing the business fell into various age groups ranging from toddler to college student. Shashank said:With the new generation it is a different story. They know the rules of joining but they may not even be interested in our business. Ayurveda is not exciting enough for a generation with many more avenues of success in the digital age. This generation doesn’t see joining the family business as a sacred duty or at the very least a responsibility. We have a family friend and advisor who interacts a lot with the children to understand their mindset and interests. We have to find ways and means to get the youngsters interested in what we do. For example we asked my college-going niece to host the program when the prime minister of Mauritius was visiting our factory in Goa to inaugurate a herbarium facility. We encouraged her and her college friends to come to Goa and go on a field trip to our state-of-the-art plant there which is a bonus as Goa is also a lovely vacation spot. When groups like this see how well managed the plant is our children start looking at their own property in a different light!It was clear that Shashank had been mulling over the future of the family business and in particular the role of the next generation as leaders (see Exhibit 6). While much of the preparatory work for the next generation was rather informal such as plant visits it seemed inevitable that Shashank’s attention would turn toward a more formal and planned approach for a smooth and seamless succession from the third to fourth generations. He wondered how other family businesses faced this inevitable event in their history and whether something could be tailored to fit the context of Sandu Pharmaceuticals.EXHIBIT 1: ORGANIzATIONal CHART (AT the BOARD Level AND ONE LEVEL Down)Note: HR = human resources; R&D = research and development; QC = quality control.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 2: GENOGRAMSource: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 3: BUSINESS VALUE SYSTEM PROFESSED BY THE FAMILYThe institution comes first then the family and then the individual (member).In the company’s progress lies your progress.Your surname does not assure you of anything.We are here to propagate the science of Ayurveda.Promise what you can deliver.Profit is not and should not be the only criteria for success.By manufacturing effective but affordable medicines we are serving society.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 4: FAMILY CODE OF CONDUCTInduction of family member occurs only if the business requires it not by right.Family members must be professionally qualified.Family members must have worked outside the business for at least two years.Compensation will be decided by an outside panel.Business needs are different from family requirements and one should not be confused with the the other.Management is separate from ownership.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 5: CHANGING OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ACROSS GENERATIONS IN the family’s PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSESNote: The management position held by the lone member of the fourth generation in the table is considered to be part of the third generation by the family and hence is indicated as such; *only the adult children of Shashank his brother and his cousins had shares allotted at the time of writing the case.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 6: Income statement across two financial yearsNote: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; ₹1 = US$0.0149 on September 1 2016; MAT = minimum alternate tax.Source: Company files.

(SingPost) appointed Paul William Coutts as the new CEO. With over 20 years of executive experience with global logistics and postal companies Coutts was well positioned and greatly anticipated to lead the group toward an integrated e-commerce logistics platform and a globally competitive business. However by April 2019 SingPost was plagued with service lapses and operational issues that generated complaints from customers and concerns from respective national agencies. Faced with increasing pressures from rising customer expectations surging mail volumes and the growing popularity of e-commerce SingPost needed to determine how to remain competitive and regain the confidence of its stakeholders. How could SingPost increase the robustness of its service recovery process to prevent the negative escalation of events? What measures could the company take to prevent these issues in the future? THE SINGAPORE POSTAL MARKETSingPost was one of four companies licensed to provide basic mail service in Singapore. Its three competitors were Asendia Management SAS DHL International GmbH and World Marketing Group. These three companies were originally granted Postal Services Operations Licences that allowed them to deliver letters weighing up to 500 grams each in addition to business mail and direct mail for marketers.  Singaporeâs postal service was privatized on April 1 1992. At that time SingPost received a 15-year exclusive right to deliver the post domestically and internationally over various forms of transport. The company was also granted a 25-year Public Postal Licence that provided SingPost the duty of maintaining postal boxes and providing basic mail service to anyone in Singapore. On February 5 2007 Singaporeâs minister for information communications and the arts announced that basic mail services would be liberalized on April 1 2007 which would allow other companies to apply for a Postal Services Operations Licence. Eventually SingPost delivered most basic mail in Singapore. The parcel delivery service industry was more competitive however with many different companies offering door-to-door delivery.SINGPOSTBackground For 160 years SingPost was one of the main postal service providers in Singapore delivering trusted and reliable postal services to homes and businesses. As a pioneer and leader in e-commerce logistics in Singapore SingPost operated in 19 domestic and international postal service markets. SingPost prided itself on delivering âend-to-end integrated digital mail solutionsâ and offering e-commerce logistic solutions such as last mile delivery and international freight forwarding. ProfitsSingPost experienced positive profit growth over the years. In financial year 2017â18 the company earned S$126.4 million in profits for a 278.4 per cent increase over the previous year (see Exhibit 1). The companyâs revenue in 2017â18 was S$1.46 billion for an increase of 8.6 per cent over the previous year thanks to growth in e-commerce activities in the postal and logistics services. On February 1 2019 SingPost announced revenue growth of 7.6 per cent for the third quarter of 2018â19 to reach S$441.4 million (see Exhibit 2). The increase was attributed to higher contributions from all business units during the global e-commerce peak season. Specifically in the post and parcel delivery segment growth in domestic and international e-commerce deliveries across the peak season resulted in a profit increase of 10 per cent on operating activities. However strong performance in the post and parcel segment and in the logistics and property segment was overshadowed by losses in US e-commerce businesses. Therefore overall profit from operating activities fell by 8.5 per cent to S$42.2 million (see Exhibit 2). Nevertheless domestic margins were reported to be âimproving on operating synergies from the ongoing integration of its postal and parcel last mile delivery networks.â ManagementIn the previous two years SingPost had undergone a major transformation in its organizational structure due to a series of departures at both the senior and board levels of management. Five directors including the groupâs previous CEO had resigned abruptly. The events caused a drop in both the companyâs share price and the confidence level of investors. It took SingPost more than one year to overcome the loss with the 2017 appointment of Coutts who was expected bring about a transformation and maintain the companyâs competitiveness in the global market. On April 1 2019 SingPost announced another major addition to the companyâs management with the appointment of Vincent Phang as CEO of postal services. Phang would oversee the post parcel and logistics segment for the companyâs Singapore business.Employee Management Systems The Singapore employment standards agency Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices identified SingPost as one of the best employers due to its promotion of an inclusive workplace culture. To maintain an open communication flow between management and its employees the company implemented regular employee engagement initiatives such as âTea with the Senior Leadershipâ and town hall sessions. All employees also had the opportunity to voice their feedback through the SingPost Voice of Employees Survey which formed the basis for SingPostâs solutions for workplace issues. Additionally SingPost rolled out various recognition programs starting in 2011 to reward the best performers from the respective regional bases. The awards were accompanied by monetary incentives to help motivate employees and to promote higher worker retention and loyalty.Current Service Operations SingPost categorized its mail and parcel delivery services into three areas: sending within Singapore sending overseas and receiving mail and parcels. Within the category of receiving mail and parcels SingPost offered various services designed to meet the needs of different customers. Customers could choose to hold and manage confidential mail and parcels to avoid missing delivery if they could not be home during the delivery time. Customers could ensure that they would not miss the delivery of their parcel by using SingPostâs new service called Pick Own Parcel Station (POPStation). Customers could collect their parcels from one of many SingPost POPStations at any time by using a single-use code. A similar service Locker Alliance partnered with widespread parcel lockers and collection points to allow customers to collect parcels at their convenience.  Rather than simply leaving mail or parcels at the customerâs doorstep SingPost employees would hold the item for the customer if no one was available to receive it. Customers could then request either a second attempt of a missed delivery or redirection of the item to a more convenient post office for easier pickup.Customers who preferred more management options for the delivery of their confidential mail could use a service called Hold Mail Service which would hold mail securely until it could be delivered in person. REPORTED INCIDENTSOverviewOriginally providing effective last mile delivery was considered SingPostâs unique competitive advantage. Over time however that standard became an expected service by all customers. Therefore in 2018 and in early 2019 SingPost received unfavourable publicity when various events were seen as failures in basic service operations. The incidents included mail being left on mailboxes discarded parcels false missed-delivery notices valuable parcels left on the doorstep and forged recipientsâ signatures on the proof of receipt. When these service failure incidents were ignored rather than being promptly addressed and rectified negative attention was cast on the company. SingPost was blamed for lack of accountability and explanation and customer complaints were met with generic responses.  Undelivered Letters Discarded Undistributed Flyers ConcealedIn January 2019 an Ang Mo Kio resident discovered stacks of unopened letters inside a trash bin and promptly proceeded to share the incident via a series of photos on Facebook. The 30â40 letters that were discovered included official mail from government agencies such as the Land Transport Authority and the Community Health Assistance Scheme. Under Singaporeâs Postal Services Act it was an offence for any officer employee or agent of postal licensees to destroy or discard any postal article.After an internal investigation by SingPost the police took over the case which led to the eventual arrest in late January 2019 a 29-year-old postal worker. SingPost issued a Facebook apology to residents of the affected housing blocks and offered assistance for the inconveniences caused by the lost mail.The Ang Mo Kio residentâs Facebook post showing the discarded mail was shared more than 6000 times. People took to social media platforms and online forums to voice their disapproval. Most people who commented expressed concern for what they perceived as an unnecessarily heavy workload for SingPost employees which was considered a sign of deeper underlying problems within the companyâs operations. However some comments suggested that the responsible postal worker should be punished. The discussion thread branched out to personal anecdotes of negative experiences with SingPost. One post described an event in which a SingPost customer service officer was unable to provide the address for the SingPost main office because the customer service function had been outsourced to India.Around that time another negative incident plagued SingPost. A small business owner who had paid S$7000 for the distribution of advertising flyers contacted SingPost to enquire about the status of his order and was sent photos showing the successful distribution of his flyers in various mailboxes. However the photos were later proven to have been digitally manipulated. On closer inspection all flyers in the photos shared the same unique identification marks which proved the successful distribution of only one flyer. It was alleged that SingPost staff had manipulated the photos to imply that they had completed the customerâs order without having actually performed their job. After the business owner contacted the police SingPost reacted by sanctioning the staff members responsible. SingPost received a strong critical response from angry consumers who felt that SingPost had intended to purposely mislead its customers had the fraudulent photos not been discovered.Issues with undelivered advertising flyers had occurred before. In February 2018 a SingPost worker was confronted by a customer who had reason to believe that his flyers were not being distributed after various bundles of letters were found unopened in nearby trash bins. Videos documenting the tense exchange showed the SingPost employee complaining that he was overworked having to deliver over 2600 letters per day. He also claimed that he was not compensated for overtime work and had no time to visit the doctor for his sore ankle. SingPost responded by dismissing the worker for failing to perform his duties. Leaving Failed Delivery Notifications without WaitingA December 2018 Facebook video depicted yet another negative account involving a SingPost worker. The video seemed to show the worker at the customerâs door for only a few seconds leaving a missed-delivery notice and going back to his vehicle before the customer could answer the door. When confronted the worker claimed he waited more than 20 minutes.SingPost investigated the event and issued a statement claiming that the worker had followed SingPost procedures by knocking several times without response and leaving a missed-delivery notice after waiting more than 45 seconds. Regarding the workerâs claim that he had waited 20 minutes SingPost explained that the worker was not fluent in English and was thus unable to express himself properly. The incident also raised the issue of whether 45 seconds was sufficient time for customers to set aside their daily routine to answer the door. Various other Facebook users joined the online discussion with their own unpleasant encounters with lost or delayed packages and letters. One user claimed that valuable parcels had been left outside the door apparently having been signed for despite the signature not belonging to any family members. Another user captured a SingPost worker on video leaving regular mail together with a failed delivery slip despite not carrying any parcels.SERVICE RECOVERY On January 14 2019 after a series of service lapses SingPost issued a public apology on its Facebook page. The company explained that approximately 3 million items were processed each day and the year-end was a very busy peak season for all staff members requiring 20 extra doorstep deliveries each day. Nevertheless SingPost promised to review operational procedures vigorously to increase the quality of its service. The company also announced that the workers who were involved in negative incidents had been dismissed. The Facebook post received responses from outraged customers who complained of unsatisfactory experiences. Others criticized the company for SingPost blaming peak periods when the issues had persisted for some time. Changes in Operation Procedures On February 7 2019 in response to the 2018 incidents SingPost announced immediate measures as part of a broad review of its postal operations. The measures were aimed at solving the most pressing issues within three to six months. One of the most pressing issues was the recent increase in workload resulting from the rapid rise of e-commerce especially in seasonal periods. SingPost planned to employ 100 additional workers to cope with rising delivery volumes and to increase the number of dedicated parcel collection counters and workers at post offices. The company also planned to work with government agencies and the Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore to upgrade worker skills and alleviate the large workloads.SingPost also addressed remuneration as part of its salary structure review. As of February 1 2019 workers would receive higher pay with incentives for successful deliveries of trackable items to the customerâs doorstep. Mail delivery shifts would also be extended to weekday evenings and Saturdays to reduce missed deliveries. Those workers who volunteered for the new shifts would receive overtime pay. SingPost also aimed to improve service levels at its core mail delivery service. Coutts announced other longer-term measures to address other issues raised. SingPost would also introduce new technology and infrastructure to improve the delivery process according to a specific timeline (see Exhibit 3).Other ImplicationsIn February 2019 Infocomm Media Development Authority fined SingPost S$100000 for a series of service lapses that occurred in 2017. In May 2017 SingPost had failed to achieve the standard of delivering at least 99 per cent of local basic letters within the Central Business District by the next working day. Later in the same year it had failed to achieve both 100 per cent delivery of local basic letters within two working days for a period of five months and 100 per cent delivery of registered mail for a period of three months. Although the February 2019 penalty was the heaviest fine ever levied by the national agency concerns were raised in Singaporeâs Parliament regarding the adequacy of the fine considering that nine service failures had been recorded in one year. Growth in E-commerce: Three-Year Transformation PlanIn addition to improving its operational procedures to offer reliable postal services SingPost sought to develop new revenue streams from the growing e-commerce trend. To strengthen its foothold in the e-commerce logistic market and counter the drop in domestic postal service SingPost developed a transformation strategy for its postal and logistic networks to be rolled out progressively over a period of three years. With a goal to become the regional last mile delivery and urban logistic partner of choice SingPost built up new capabilities on its existing e-commerce logistic solutions such as front-end website management warehouse and fulfillment international freight forwarding and last mile delivery. The logistics service Last Mile Platform was set up in 2018 to synchronize various last mile delivery solutions (e.g. courier service collection points and parcel lockers) into one platform. The platform was expected to enable enhanced flexibility convenience and control for customers. It merged services from multiple retailers and logistic providers from across Southeast Asia allowing customers to obtain their digital purchases from any last mile service provider on the network.MOVING FORWARDBy early April 2019 SingPostâs immediate operational changes were still in progress. Although the company did not have a monopoly in the postal market it held the only public postal licence in Singapore and had the largest market share. Therefore SingPostâs service was crucial and fundamental changes needed to be implemented. Despite the measures that were in progress SingPost needed to do to more to address deeply rooted operational issues and regain consumer confidence over the long term.EXHIBIT 1: SINGapore POST Ltd.

A novel coronavirus had sparked a global pandemic of COVID-19 and widespread lockdown of non-essential economic activities to avoid contagion. However for Harman Singh and his team at Yuno Learning Global Private Limited (Yuno Learning) not much had changed with regard to their work.Yuno Learning one of India’s leading live online training platforms for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) operated in a fully remote working mode. It held teaching sessions and preparatory tests online solicited customers online through various digital marketing channels and held work meetings over conference calls. Hence Yuno Learning did not have to close business during the lockdown. Further while the global health crisis was threatening to derail the economy in many countries and negatively affect employment online education was expected to see an upsurge as a result of a renewed focus on upskilling in a downward market.Website visits had indeed increased for Yuno Learning since the lockdown started in India; however course sales had stagnated. But this was not a new challenge; Singh had already been facing that challenge before the crisis hit the world. Yuno Learning among its peers already had an impressive website visit rate thanks to a broad-based marketing strategy the firm had adopted early to build brand awareness. The firm had also made efforts to attract leads from various affiliate sources. However as was the case with every other website only a percentage of the visits and leads converted to sales. Singh needed to solve that problem. How could he ensure that the maximum number of those who reached Yuno Learning through organic or paid marketing subscribed to the IELTS test preparation courses?ABOUT THE INDUSTRY: ONLINE EDUCATIONValued at US$101.1 billion in 2019 the education sector in India was one of the largest and fastest growing in the world. The sector was buoyed by India’s large population of youth projected to be the world’s largest population of youth in 2020. At the same time the government made education a fundamental right in 2010 creating a massive market for public and private providers of education for youth. India was also home to one of the largest labour forces globally which created a thriving market for professional training and certification. In 2018 the government of India allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the education sector expanding the market to encourage international players to enter India’s education space.Online education consisted of web-based distance learning through live or pre-recorded resources. It became popular in India as a result of the country’s affordable Internet rates (one of the most affordable globally) increased security in digital payments and widespread use of smartphones. The government of India actively encouraged digital adoption and digital education particularly in the rural areas through various policies such as Digital India e-Vidya Vahini Vision Digital India and SWAYAM. The result was that e-learning in India was projected to grow from $247 million in 2016 to $1.96 billion by 2021—making it the second-largest e-learning market in the world catering to 9.5 million users and growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44 per cent. In 2019 there were 3500 educational start-ups in India catering to primary and secondary education through online tuitions and supplementary training professional skilling and certifications and training for competitive examinations (see Exhibit 1).With a CAGR projected at 50.84 per cent the online test preparation segment was the fastest-growing segment in India’s educational industry projected to reach $90.75 billion by 2024. The segment included private and foreign players notably BYJU’s Pearson Education and Kaplan Inc. These businesses provided training for the Indian civil service and provided other screening examinations for government and public-sector jobs common admission tests for business schools medical and engineering entrance examinations and international screening examinations such as Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) the Graduate Management Admission Test and IELTS. Approximately 30 million Indians attended competitive examinations with more than 50 per cent appearing for the civil service and other government entrance examinations.IELTS TRAINING: THE GATEWAY TO INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONHome to the world’s largest youth population India featured prominently in international education. Driven by the competition at home many meritorious students sought to complete their education abroad. In 2019 India was among the world’s largest sources of outbound students second only to China. The top three destinations were the United States Canada and Australia followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.IELTS was conducted by IDP Education Limited an international education service and the British Council an international organization for cultural relations and education. The test of English language proficiency was compulsory for those who sought to migrate to English-speaking nations for education or work. IELTS scores were accepted in most countries that had English as the first language such as the United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand and the United States contributing to the popularity of the test among aspiring migrants to these countries. IELTS training alone was estimated to be a $150 million industry in India in 2019.The IELTS industry was highly fragmented with roughly 5 per cent of the industry falling into the organized sector. There were three types of providers: (1) local and regional coaching centres that delivered in-class training to students (2) online training institutes and (3) distance education institutes that provided educational materials for self-study. Some of these institutes such as the British Council Jamboree Education Private Limited Fateh Education Consulting Private Limited Triumphant Institute of Management Education Private Limited and Edwise International had a presence across India and even had branches outside the country. Others were well known at a regional level such as Megamind Consultants Private Limited and Manya Education Private Limited in north India and Camford Academy and IELTS Academy in the south. Start-ups also featured prominently in this sector with some of the popular companies being Magoosh and TheScoreBooster.com.Typical customers for IELTS coaching were students or professionals who were price-sensitive and wanted value for money. Customers generally subscribed to a preparatory course two months before they planned to appear for the examination. The in-class model of education usually attracted young students whereas working professionals preferred the more flexible options of online classes or self-paced study. Students also opted for the free media such as tutorials on YouTube free courses on Udemy and Coursera and free IELTS materials available on educational websites.The IELTS training industry also attracted students from other countries such as Bangladesh Malaysia Vietnam Sri Lanka Iran Turkey and Brazil.SINGH AND THE INCEPTION OF YUNO LEARNINGEducational innovations and entrepreneurship had always fascinated Singh. While undertaking his master of science in computer science at North Carolina State University in 2000–2002 Singh was the president of the university’s entrepreneurs’ network. It was also during this time that Singh developed an interest in the field of online education.In 2002 soon after he graduated Singh launched his first venture Sikhya Solutions which provided e-learning solutions to educational institutions such as Duke University North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina System. In 2006 Singh launched AuthorSTREAM.com (AuthorSTREAM) a free platform for sharing PowerPoint presentations which became the second largest platform of its kind. In 2007 AuthorSTREAM became a part of Singh’s next venture WizIQ a cloud-based platform for hosting online courses. In 2015 WizIQ was ranked among the world’s top five learning management systems with over 70000 courses catering to more than 4.5 million customers. By 2017 WizIQ had partnered with Microsoft Corporation to provide online teaching technology and services to the government of India for the SWAYAM initiative.In an interview with UpGrad in 2017 Singh saidThe most fundamental question one has to answer is why do they even want to be an entrepreneur. There are different reasons for different people. It could be the opportunity staring [you] in your face and you just don’t want to let it go. Jeff Bezos started like that. The other is that you really want to make a dent in the universe as Steve Jobs puts it and you get on an activist kind of mission to do that. Another is you just want to be your own boss and you want to start your own business. . . . For me it was definitely the more activist kind where can I really make a huge dent in the universe. And there I narrowed down to education because education has that possibility. . . . I was always interested in the education industry. I love teaching. I was a tutor in my career; I was a teacher at several stages. . . . I think I’m a good teacher. . . . And I was in a unique position as a technologist. [At] the same time I saw an opportunity. So . . . several things got together and [there was a] kind of a voice inside [that] said “This is my space.”As WizIQ was scaling new heights in online education Singh’s attention moved to a new opportunity. While on a trip to his hometown Chandigarh he noticed a surge in IELTS training advertisements indicating a booming market with possibilities for business innovation. Singh noticed that while IELTS training institutes were plentiful the presence of online training was relatively low. This absence of online training was a challenge for the aspirants many of whom were working professionals and could not make time for the regular classroom. Students from small towns were also compromised because city-based training centres were inaccessible to them. What was available online almost entirely depended on recorded video lectures limiting the scope for real-time problem-solving and interaction with the faculty members.Singh felt that there was a chance to make a difference by offering IELTS aspirants in India live online English language training which at that time was provided by only one other company in India IELTS Ninja. In November 2018 Singh launched Yuno Learning—a dedicated platform for delivering live online training for IELTS examination.YUNO LEARNING: STRUCTURE CULTURE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMERSSingh’s previous experiences in the software services business had taught him that often firms failed because of a lack of coordination between the marketing sales and product teams. Thus Singh kept the structure at Yuno Learning relatively flat facilitating interdepartmental coordination and flexible decision-making. He eliminated the slow email mode of communication and moved all discussions and coordination activities to Slack a popular online business communication tool. For daily internal meetings he implemented the use of Zoom meetings and Skype and had everyone in the business trained on using these tools.The core teams consisted of the instructors responsible for the design and delivery of the classes student evaluation personalized mentoring and demo sessions; the marketing team responsible for increasing traffic and leads (potential customers website visitors or others who shared their contact details for product enquiry); and the sales team responsible for converting leads and prospects into sales. The firm also used the services of a technical support team responsible for designing and maintaining platforms and providing information technology support to employees and students. That team and a finance team were outsourced operations (see Exhibit 2).Product Offering at Yuno Learning: Live Online ClassesYuno Learning used Zoom’s meetings and webinar platform for delivering live online classes and it used Google’s suite of products for other operational necessities. Students could select between a four-week focused course on writing and speaking skills or a six-week comprehensive course (see Exhibit 3). For a meaningful learning experience students needed to be equipped with stable high-speed Internet and functional English speaking and writing skills. The student base at Yuno Learning was almost entirely made up of individuals from India. Still there had been students from the United Kingdom and Dubai as well.Yuno Learning offered certain key value propositions to its customers. These included separate live training for each of the IELTS components—writing speaking reading and listening—which helped the student grow proficient in each area; recorded classes for revisiting the lectures at the student’s convenience; and more than 100 free practice tests. To ensure a comfortable live classroom experience and individualized attention to every student each group was limited to 10 students. In addition there were one-on-one live mentoring sessions for feedback on progress and speaking practice. All instructors had at least 10 years of experience in training for competitive examinations such as IELTS GRE and TOEFL.The live classes ran in four batches: morning afternoon evening and night all on weekdays. An instructor typically taught two batches in a day. Most students preferred to join the 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. classes. In the one-on-one live mentoring sessions students practised their speaking skills and received feedback from the trainers. Singh himself conducted many of these mentoring sessions.Apart from individualized mentoring Yuno Learning fostered peer learning. Students in a batch were connected to one another through WhatsApp groups where students could share queries and have their doubts clarified. Efforts were made to keep classes fun updated and personalized curated to the needs of the audience. Singh described Yuno Learning’s approach:The first thing you need to have in mind when trying to capture your modern learners’ attention is this: Don’t make them wait. This means you have to make your point right away; otherwise they will get distracted and you’ll lose them. . . . Grab their attention by explaining exactly how the e-learning course will improve their individual performance and how it will benefit their personal or professional lives. In addition make it brief; modern learners don’t have time to lose so tell them what they need and want to know and nothing more. This goes for the rest of e-learning course too; use bite-sized chunks of e-learning content to get your message across include only the most relevant data and consider using infographics which are very popular among modern learners as they make information very easy to grasp.Once a course was completed for a batch the instructor for that batch had a week off. During this week the instructor conducted demonstration (demo) sessions on the website for new prospects clarifying the design and content of the program and teaching a sample topic. Prospective students were likely to subscribe for a course if they liked the instructor who provided the demo and they typically preferred to take the course with that same instructor. At the end of each week all of the prospects who had newly subscribed to the course were assigned to one or more batches to be taught by the same instructor for the next four to six weeks.In addition to their regular pay the instructors received incentives based on the number of prospects who subscribed to the course after attending the instructor’s demo. This system encouraged the instructors to continuously improve their teaching and it provided the instructors with immediate feedback on the efficacy of their demos.Classes at Yuno Learning were highly rated for their interactive nature flexibility and individualized attention to students (see Exhibit 4).Marketing Channels at Yuno LearningThe marketing and sales teams were involved in attracting prospects and facilitating their journey on the platform to a subscription (see Exhibit 5). Paid marketing mainly consisted of Google Ads (contributing to about 46 per cent of the subscriptions) affiliate marketing with aggregator platforms such as Sulekha (26 per cent) and Facebook advertisements. Yuno Learning’s Facebook page had 8600 “likes” and its Facebook Group on IELTS preparation had over 2000 members.Content writers from Yuno Learning regularly responded to IELTS-related queries on the question-and-answer platform Quora. Content from the live classes was also posted on YouTube and Facebook. The paid and organic social media marketing efforts yielded another 17 per cent of the subscriptions. Organic search—Google page ranking referral traffic and direct searches—contributed to 8 per cent of the subscriptions. Organic marketing efforts also included the frequent blogs posted on the Yuno Learning website on various topics related to IELTS.Although Yuno Learning experimented with multiple marketing channels Singh decided that in keeping with prevailing industry practices the marketing team would reduce the focus on those channels where the conversion ratio (i.e. the number of subscriptions in proportion to the generated leads) would be less than 5 per cent.Multiple Funnels: The Customer Journey at Yuno LearningOnce a visitor reached Yuno Learning’s website the most direct path for them was to read the product descriptions and subscribe to one of the two paid courses. However the relative newness of the concept of live online classes in the IELTS space made it unlikely that visitors would readily subscribe without a demo or trial session. Hence Yuno Learning made provisions for trial sessions demos and other free content that was made available on the website with a free user account (see Exhibit 6).To attend a demo the visitor needed to create a free user account and then register for the session. On registration the visitor (now called a prospect) immediately received a welcome email from Yuno Learning detailing the offerings. The prospect also received a counselling call from a member of the sales team who gathered the prospect’s requirements and provided them with instructions for joining the demo session. The sales team also discussed with the prospect their preference for generic or academic IELTS problem areas for the curriculum and convenient schedules for joining live classes. The sales team observed the demos. At the end of the session the instructor briefed the sales team about the prospects who seemed promising. The sales team followed up with the promising prospects reassessing their requirements and matching them to the offering that best suited their needs. Those who subscribed for the paid courses were assigned to the next new batch.Yuno Learning also offered unlimited access to free practice tests to those who subscribed with a free user account. Because the IELTS syllabus seldom changed the battery of practice tests was created with a one-time effort from instructors—an investment with multiple returns. Free practice tests were a popular search online and this strategy was adopted in the hope of bringing search traffic to the website. Users of free practice tests were also contacted with a remarketing pitch for Yuno Learning’s paid courses.Before the demo sessions became the practice Yuno Learning had experimented with other forms of customer engagement. The paid courses were preceded by a free class format; prospects who established a free account with Yuno Learning were offered unlimited free live classes with no hidden costs. However the content of these free classes was limited to only a few topics from the syllabus. Those who enrolled in the free classes were connected to an automated system using emails text messages and WhatsApp. The system sent regular communication with reminders about classes and their times. During the class instructors were responsible for convincing the students of the value of the paid course. Prospects keen on purchase were approached by the sales team to close the deal while prospects who still seemed undecided became a part of the remarketing efforts through WhatsApp text messages Google Ads and emails. While this marketing strategy resulted in subscriptions Singh wanted to evaluate a few more strategies before finalizing the best funnel mix. Thus in mid-2019 the free classes were replaced by a free trial format.The free trials arose from Yuno Learning’s temporary experiment with open classes. Rather than assign students to classes in batches each open class was a stand-alone in terms of content and difficulty level making it possible for students to join a course at any point in time. The prospect of peer-to-peer learning was low in these classes because the students and their capacities were different in each class but the open class concept offered flexibility to learners who wanted to start immediately or had to miss a few classes midway. Yuno Learning offered a limited experience of these open classes as free trials allowing interested prospects to join two ongoing live open classes for free. For their access to continue beyond the trial period prospects had to pay for the full course. The open classes were however not successful because of scheduling issues and the instructors’ challenge in teaching an audience that changed daily. Participants also reported low engagement in the sessions due to the lack of peer-to-peer learning. Therefore open classes were discontinued after a short while in favour of the batch system.In mid-2019 the marketing team noticed that keywords related to IELTS mock tests were getting good traffic in Google Search. This meant that prospects were sometimes looking for not classes but practice for IELTS exams. Sensing vibrant traffic here Singh structured a new mock test-only course. This course consisted of four comprehensive mock tests for IELTS evaluated by Yuno Learning’s instructors and a live four-hour discussion with an instructor to clarify doubts and discuss scope for improvement. When prospects registered for the mock test course they were taken to a regular demo class to get a feel for the live discussion with an instructor.The initiative looked promising initially but as more and more prospects were consulted it became evident that the mock test market was flooded with free or low-cost mock tests. Also students cared little about the quality of the mock tests and looked for heavily discounted prices. Yuno Learning could match these prices only if it dropped the quality of its evaluation and decreased the number of evaluated attempts. The consultation would also have to be reduced from four hours to one hour at best. Singh was not willing to compromise on quality so the mock test-only course was taken down in early 2020. The team decided to hold the product until the market seemed ready for it. Free practice tests however were kept available on the website to draw organic traffic.Apart from those who engaged actively on the platform a significant flow of visitors came to the Yuno Learning platform but did not subscribe to any of the paid or free offerings (visit and drop). Other visitors would establish a free account on the website but never return for further engagement (register and drop). Then there were prospects with free accounts who expressed interest in a demo but did not attend it (interest and drop). There were also those who dropped out after attending the demo choosing not to subscribe (attend and drop). Some prospects attempted the free practice tests but did not subscribe to the paid offerings (practice and drop). Finally there were also cases although infrequent where customers subscribed to paid classes but did not attend them (subscribe and drop). Yuno Learning continued to engage these prospects and visitors through remarketing employing various channels such as emails WhatsApp paid remarketing advertisements and text messages (see Exhibit 7).By 2020 the live online IELTS coaching industry had seen many new entrants. Other players in this domain offered differentiated features such as a one-on-one classroom model at Mindmine Global and Simpli English and unlimited live classes and one-month trial access at E2Language (see Exhibit 8).THE DILEMMA: THE MOST EFFICIENT CHANNEL AND FUNNELThe core team met over video conference in April 2020. The pandemic seemed to weigh on everyone’s mind as the IELTS examination was postponed or cancelled in over 70 countries. When the conversation returned to work Singh notedThe COVID crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. Foreign travel seems out of the question for another quarter of a year at least. What is worse there will be a psychological impact of this crisis on people planning to move abroad for work or education. The virus has shown that countries worldwide developing or developed are equally vulnerable to such a pandemic; this might worry people about venturing away from home in a foreign land. At the same time economic turbulence might turn people to plan for alternatives. Lockdown gives them more free time than usual to invest in education. It is time we pace up our activities plug the holes in our strategies and ensure that we do not stray from the target due to the turbulence.Sunil from the sales team suggested “To pace up the straightforward way is to bring more people to the demo sessions. Leads have been up since we tied up with the affiliate firms. Sales have flattened as I can see but that could be due to the COVID crisis. I feel the affiliate model is working well for us.”Komal Sunil’s teammate agreed adding “However we need more hands if we must take care of all the leads we are receiving. I wish there was a way to know if a lead is actually planning a purchase or just browsing around but I guess we are helpless there.”Neil from the marketing team put his view forward:We have seen the organic direct and advertisement traffic convert better than the traffic from the other channels till now. Last year most of the students forwarded by the affiliate were interested only in local classroom coaching. This year amid COVID-19 I have a hunch that the leads from the new affiliates will be more open to online coaching. But we are yet to see this in results.Vinita the most experienced instructor offered her perspective:Every now and then in the demo classes I am finding many students have an erratic Internet connection. Even after all the preparation and effort the Internet connection is creating a poor experience for the students. Another problem is that some students are not able to keep up with the curriculum because their English is too weak. Around 10 per cent of our students take a refund and leave either because of technical issues or because they cannot keep up with the curriculum.“The first problem may have to do with customers who depend on low bandwidth mobile Internet” Neil observed. “Initially I believed that the low bandwidth was related to the location of the prospect. However the CRM [customer relationship management] reports show that such problems may surface even in metropolitan areas.”The team spent an hour brainstorming various solutions. They noted that the affiliate model was generating about 26 per cent of the total leads so more money could be invested there. The sales team needed more people to keep up with the additional traffic. On average each sales personnel made 20–22 calls a day each call lasting over 15 minutes to resolve queries and counsel the prospect about future directions. This led to backlogs. The chances of converting a lead who was approached after three days went down by 70 per cent.The sales team suggested that when a prospect dropped out after a demo a provision should be available to give the prospect a few ongoing paid sessions free of cost. This would help to convince the prospects of the value of the classes. The instructors observed that this practice would however affect the batch dynamics with new people requiring extra attention mainly because they needed to be convinced of the value of a subscription. Instructors recommended continuing with the practice of sharing occasional live sessions on Facebook and directing prospects there for an experience.The marketing team believed that while Google Ads was still a significant marketing channel for the business it was necessary to invest in other channels so that the overreliance on Google Ads could be mitigated. Although the organic channel looked promising it was a long-term wager for the business and would take another one to two years to generate a decent volume of prospects.As Singh went through the recommendations he noticed one trend. As usually happened in start-ups the early months of the operations were spent experimenting. The core team tried multiple channels to engage customers based on popular industry practices and patterns noticed in customer behaviour. Many of these solutions were intuitively appealing but a few of them were difficult to continue unless more resources were invested in them. While the innovator in Singh wanted to experiment his founder’s acumen told him that since resources were limited (Yuno Learning was presently operating on seed funding) it was essential that the money went to strengthening the route that earned the maximum dividend. He wondered if it was time to take stock and get rid of all channels with a conversion ratio of less than 5 per cent.As everyone fell quiet Singh concludedIt seems that we have tried a number of ways to bring people to our website and I would not be surprised if each has led to some form or other of customer engagement. In the early months our focus was on building word-of-mouth and awareness for our brand so we went all out when it came to engaging with customers. However every prospect we bring in imposes a responsibility on us to engage the prospect in the best possible way and to generate a positive customer experience. We must identify the workflow that smooths our operations and best engages the prospects.

Jain was reading a draft of the e-newsletter prepared by his design team that was intended to be sent to restaurants bars and pubs. Jain had recently started exploring these venues as a potential new customer segment. Jain was pleased with early results having already generated some orders from bars and restaurants but he wanted to plan a more aggressive marketing campaign for this segment. With the expected business growth however meeting the needs of new and different types of customers could pose a challenge for the company. Supply chain issues would have to be resolved effectively to address a rise in demand for the Homesake brand of products. Despite its relatively recent entry in the market Homesake had already become profitable. Jain wanted to continue to expand the company�s product portfolio but he had to plan carefully for an anticipated surge in demand. Homesake which was becoming a preferred supplier by international clients was expecting a growth rate of 60 per cent in the next three years. What challenges would accompany such a surge in demand? What business model should Homesake adopt for consistent growth in the future?The Home D�cor Sector in IndiaIndia�s home d�cor sector comprised items that were easily replaced or moved such as curtains wrought iron products decorative craft pieces paintings and house plants. Home d�cor items reflected the owner�s taste and created a sense of personal space wherever they were placed. These items were arranged according to the space and size of the room as well as the everyday habits hobbies and economic well-being of the individuals or family members in the household. The home d�cor sector included organizations within four main segments�furniture furnishings lighting and d�cor�with several large organizations and numerous local companies within each segment. Given the large presence of local companies the home d�cor sector was highly unorganized which had resulted in its relatively slow growth. Homesake had not yet entered the furniture and the furnishings segments of this sector. Although major companies such as Pepperfry Urban Ladder Home Town and several others had already established a presence in these two segments no one company was seen as strictly operating in a particular segment. Major retailers displayed products under all categories including furniture upholstery textile furnishings and decorative items. Several companies that had entered these segments also offered a variety of products under the home d�cor and furnishings categories. Some retailers such as Chumbak and Happy Unmarried had positioned themselves in the gap of fun-filled fashion and lifestyle products. Jain explained how he viewed Homesake�s competition:I don�t think we have competition. In fact we have identified gaps in the market and tried to fill them by designing products; others have just followed us there. But whichever category we enter we make a killing. No one can match the offerings or prices that we offer to our customers.In 2017 India was among the world�s top 3 largest economies in terms of gross domestic product. With an annual growth rate of over 7 per cent and a population of approximately 1.3 billion people India was one of the fastest-growing consumer nations for almost all products and home d�cor was no exception. The Government of India�s initiative Housing for All by 2022 was bound to provide a boost to the home d�cor sector which had an estimated value of US$20 billion in 2015. The home furnishings market had experienced a growth of 9.5 per cent per year until 2016 and this trend was expected to continue to 2020. Analysts believed that various trends had led to such growth including a rising real estate market wider availability of products and design thanks to online access and globalization improving lifestyle opportunities and an increase in disposable income.The Entrepreneur and His CreationsJain graduated from the Delhi College of Engineering in 2012. He wanted to pursue an MBA but decided to first gain some experience in the corporate world so he joined a finance company. In 2014 he partnered with a friend to start his first business venture called Connect to Career. The concept of Career to Connect was to assess students on the basis of a psychometric analysis of their profiles to help them identify better employment opportunities in the corporate sector. After a few months of operations Jain realized that there were major challenges to grow the venture so he decided to shut down the company by the end of the first year. During this time he become interested in supply chains and began studying them across industries and companies such as Videocon and the Indian railways. He was most fascinated by the supply chain management of the Dabbawalas in Mumbai a hot lunch delivery system for people at work. Jain explained his interest in supply chains: �[The] supply chain of any business is the most interesting thing. You understand the supply chain you understand the costs and margins. Understanding supply chains has helped me design the operations of Homesake better.�In 2015 Jain founded Homesake and entered the home d�cor sector. Homesake designed produced and sold products for home decorating including lighting tableware and wall hangings. The start-up began as an online business and gradually moved toward the retail model. Jain started Homesake with his own investment of _2 million which consisted of his own savings (65 per cent) plus a loan from his father.Jain�s father ran an exporting business for brass products in Moradabad India. His mother worked at home but was an exceptional designer as Jain explained: �My mother had been an inspiration for me to begin this company. She has an immaculate sense for designing spaces. Even today when I design something I show it to her. Her nod of appreciation means that it will be a hit.�The Homesake Business ModelVision and goalsJain had a keen interest in supply chains and believed that the success of any business depended on the efficiency of its supply chain. As he emphasized �What businesses in India lack is a seamless integration of supply chains so that they can control everything and ultimately this can benefit the customers. My aim always has been to create a seamless supply chain in the home d�cor segment.�Home d�cor came naturally to Jain as a business choice. With his father exporting brass handicrafts from Moradabad to many countries around the world Jain gained essential knowledge about sourcing raw materials hiring practices for artisans logistics and shipment procedures. However numerous concepts were new to him such as the procurement of materials other than brass creating designs and prototypes testing managing finances identifying customer segments and marketing products. He was also planning to enter a new business segment which would require additional unfamiliar knowledge. Jain�s objective was to develop a supply chain for Homesake that could create products cost effectively and sell them at affordable prices. As Jain explained �India has a huge number of artisans who are skilled in their crafts. I have seen that in Moradabad. I wanted to create products using artisans� skills and my understanding of supply chains. I see Homesake as a supply chain company for home d�cor products.�Homesake generated sales of approximately _2 million in 2015�16 _12 million in 2016�17 and _65 million in 2017�18. Jain was expecting to double this amount in the subsequent year (2018�19). He also projected growth of 100 per cent per year for the next three years. He aimed to reach a sales target of _1.2 billion by 2020�21. Homesake had 22 employees on its payroll (see Exhibit 1) plus 11 permanent supervisors who managed several groups of artisans.Purchase of raw materials processing designing and logisticsJain wanted to create a business model with few intermediaries allowing him more control over the procurement processing and shipment of goods. Therefore he decided to work with only five basic materials�wood iron brass ceramic and glass. All products were manufactured using these basic materials either alone or in combination. Jain sourced these materials directly from point-of-origin suppliers to avoid processing stages before manufacturing the final product. For example he would purchase tree logs from merchants which would then be sent to his trusted vendors for cutting into blocks and boards drying and treatment for moisture and termites. The wooden blocks and boards would then be transported to his factory at Moradabad to be shaped by artisans into various semi-finished elements of a particular product. Similarly he would purchase iron nuggets (instead of iron sheets or rods) brass blocks raw ceramic and raw glass. All these materials would then be passed on to vendors for further purification and processing. The materials were then stored at the Moradabad factory and warehouse for further processing by the artisans.Jain started the manufacturing process by drawing the designs for the products himself which were then manufactured by the artisans. He drew inspiration for his designs from hotels movies friends and the Internet among other sources. Jain also hired two qualified designers who were graduates from the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and from the National Institute of Fashion Technology in New Delhi. The job of the designers was to understand how customers used objects and to draw inspiration for new designs from that research. New ideas were discussed with Jain in regard to utility elegance colour and other aspects. Shortlisted designs were then brought to the Moradabad factory where Jain would discuss the design ideas with his product and production managers and with the supervisors who managed the artisans. Jain worked directly with 11 supervisors who managed the work of approximately 250 artisans. They deliberated on the feasibility of creating prototypes from the designs. Jain held two discussions each day with the supervisors to check on the progress of scheduling output received and challenges faced if any. Jain explained the need for his close supervision:Designing is the most time-consuming process for us. Our first level of discussion which happens at the Noida office sees that most of the times the designs are rejected since they lack the functional or the aesthetic appeal. Then the second level of discussion happens with the supervisors since we have to produce these items within a certain cost range. So sometimes we have to create as many as 18 pieces till we get what we really think can sell well.Once the prototypes were finalized the supervisors instructed the artisans to start making the products based on the specifications. The complete product was never manufactured as a single piece. Separate elements were created left unfinished and then shipped to the Noida warehouse where the semi-processed elements were assembled polished (or finished) and checked for quality. Jain believed in ensuring quality in his products so each product was checked multiple times. Packaging was also important for the protection of the products during transit as Jain explained:All of our products are decorative items so they are not sturdy. They have to be shipped with care. We use the best of the packaging material to package the product such that even if we drop the package from a height of 12 feet the product will not be damaged. We did all the experimentation with packaging and have identified the best way to ship our products.The final product was then labelled packaged and stored in the warehouse until it was dispatched to fill orders. Jain felt that it was important to have excellent content and images of the products on both the website and the newsletter so he hired a full-time photographer for all pictures and a writer to update product information regularly. Jain spoke about the uniqueness of Homesake�s products:The products that we make are DIY [do it yourself]. Customers can assemble the products on their own. Its plug and play such that our lighting category products come with an electric bulb as well! Moreover our products find a space in Indian homes. It just blends in as if it has been designed for such spaces or corners only. . . We are a pure product company. We want our customers to come to us to buy the product. The rest of the things such as experience and delight come later.Markets and customersHomesake generated most of its sales online. Its website was clean informative and well designed (see Exhibit 2). Homesake provided products under four categories�home d�cor lighting table top and gifts�with several sub-categories for each main section based on price range occasion and product use. Within the sub-categories consumers could browse and place orders for various products. After the customer placed an order it was aggregated based on design and volume before being forwarded to the product and production managers at the Moradabad workshop.Some Homesake sales were generated offline by traditional retail channels such as distributors and dealers including the popular furniture store chain Evok. In 2016 the ratio of online to offline (traditional retail sales) was 85 per cent to 15 per cent. Jain gradually shifted the company�s sales focus to increase traditional sales reaching a high of 30 per cent of total sales in 2017. He also hired a marketing manager to plan a marketing strategy for targeting traditional consumers in other segments with the goal of reaching at least 40 per cent of sales from traditional offline retail channels. Geographically most of Homesake�s sales came from Maharashtra followed by Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Telangana and Delhi. Homesake was equipped with an enterprise resource management system that helped Jain analyze purchase patterns among customer groups. He was able to gather information at the time of purchase such as the amount of time spent on the website locations from where more purchases were being made and the demographic profile of customers. Using these analytics Jain was able to design better marketing campaigns for specific customer groups. Some purchase trends were based on special occasions such as Diwali Eid Guru Purab Christmas and New Year. These periods often created a surge in demand from certain specific geographic locations. For example increased demand was seen during the Navaratri season from the Gujarat and West Bengal regions as Jain explained:Our system helps us track sales and collect data which we analyze to understand trends. For instance we know that in Gujarat men normally shop either in morning around 9 a.m. or in late evenings whereas women normally shop between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Depending on the areas we are also able to determine the size colour and designs that could be sold.Homesake defined and targeted its typical customer demographic as technology or media professionals earning _100000 to _150000 per month married with both spouses working and aged 28�38. Typical Homesake customers had an active and gregarious lifestyle enjoyed parties with friends and family and decorated their homes bases on their specific tastes. Jain spoke about targeting this demographic of customer:Homesake products have to be made affordable for the customer segment that we are targeting. I want them to buy my products and discard them after six months and try a different product. Actually our products are so affordable yet stylish that our customers buy them enjoy them for six to eight months throw them out and buy another. They are able to make purchases at least three or four times from Homesake. We want this frequency from a single customer to go up and that�s why we are trying to increase our portfolio of products. We started with 50�60 items and now we have around 2800 SKUs [stock keeping units].Homesake also targeted corporate clients who bought the products for gifts. Demand was seasonal for this target concentrated mainly during Diwali and New Year celebrations. Jain saw this segment as a special challenge that he was eager to reach and expand to include other corporate clients such as hotels bars pubs and restaurants. These consumers frequently bought decorative and tableware items from Homesake�s competitors. Homesake�s current conversion rate for these clients was around 20 per cent. Jain�s strategy was to be in constant communication with this segment providing updated information urging them to consider Homesake for their next purchase. He sent newsletters to all prospective business clients every two weeks and often visited their places of business to better understand their needs.Homesake had recently entered the Middle East and U.S. markets through its online retail portal. Jain estimated that it would take Homesake at least three years to create a substantial presence in these markets. However he was not planning to create a traditional retail presence in these markets. He expected the business model for international markets in general to evolve in the future which would mean high logistics costs. However he was eager to create a presence in the United States which he saw as an advanced market from which he could learn a great deal. Currently Homesake products in the United States were only available through eBay. Financing of the Business ModelHomesake was financed entirely by Jain�s own funds and a loan from his father. In the three years since the company�s inception Homesake had grown using only self-generated funding. Jain was determined to continue this approach to finance the growth of Homesake although he anticipated that he might be forced to borrow to finance future operations. Jain created a guideline for Homesake�s cost structure to help him control costs and create affordable products for his customers. The guideline was based on five components of 20 per cent each (see Exhibit 3). He followed this guideline closely but rising input costs increasing transportation charges and rising labour wages strongly affected the company�s cost structure. Homesake currently employed 12 full-time workers across all departments. The artisans were paid daily wages which were borne by Jain personally and issued by the supervisors in charge of acquiring the labour.Jain had been advised to reconsider his business model to allow for scaling up more effectively:I have often been advised by my friends and well-wishers that I should convert my model to an aggregator platform rather than worrying about everything right from procurement to delivery. They want me to become an aggregator for home d�cor products. In that manner I can get funding from investors and scale it up quickly. After all there are so many artisans who are selling their artwork online. I can collaborate with them and bring them on a portal.Looking AheadHomesake had experienced significant growth in its first three years of operation but expanding the business would be a challenge. The contractual nature of the labour force had created certain inefficiencies in the supply chain. Most workers were illiterate and ranged from semi-skilled to skilled. They were mainly migrants who travelled back to their native places during the sowing and reaping season and for festive occasions which caused disruption in production schedules.Recently Jain had received a large order to supply lighting to a real estate developer for 400 apartments. Sales to hotels bars pubs and restaurants were also expected to rise which required a reliable supply chain to function smoothly. There was also a constant need to design and develop new products especially for corporate clients. Jain closely monitored the revenue from each product to keep improving margins. Current revenue sources seemed to follow an inverse 10-20-70 model where 10 per cent of products contributed 70 per cent of revenues 20 per cent of products contributed 20 per cent of revenues and 70 per cent of products contributed 10 per cent of revenues. Ideally the percentage of products in the first category should rise above the low rate of 10 per cent.Jain was planning to add a Homesake fashion jewellery product line using materials such as leather porcelain glass or other alloys. Although still at a very early stage this product line was in high demand and could be sold through Amazon. Jain understood that jewellery item revenues could be low although volumes could be high. To grow the business Jain had to improve the quality control and logistics of the company. The damage rate was 1.2 per cent and the return rate was 11 per cent both of which Jain hoped to lower (to 0.6 per cent and 8 per cent) by using rigorous quality control measures. Jain felt there was an immediate need to increase warehouse facilities to ensure timely deliveries and meet growing demand. Currently Homesake rented four warehouses located in Noida Gurgaon Faridabad and Mohan Nagar of which three had been added in the previous six months. Jain was exploring options for adding at least one more warehouse in each of the southern eastern central and western regions of India. Having decided to target international markets Jain needed to analyze the trends and behaviours of customers from those regions. He also realized that competition in these regions would differ considerably from India. Jain shared his plans for the future of Homesake:I do want it to grow to a big company but I am not willing to dilute my equity or have a huge debt. Growth has been good so there is potential in market. But I aim to innovate as well. At Homesake we believe in designing new products and bringing them to the market quickly. We want to keep surprising our customers and keep costs under control.Exhibit 1: Homesake Organizational ChartNote: Numbers in brackets represent employees in that designation; CEO = chief executive officer.Source: Created by the case writers with company information.Exhibit 2: Homesake WebsiteSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Cost Structure Guideline for Homesake business modelSource: Created by the case authors.

The ECS division focused on ocean freight forwarding�helping customers coordinate and ship goods from origin to destination. Most requests involved picking up goods from a customer�s factory or warehouse and managing the transportation of those goods all the way to the recipient�s factory warehouse or stores. Over the past two years the shipping industry had faced significant disruption due to excess shipping capacity and a fall in demand for shipments. In response the ECS division was restructured to provide consistent coverage to clients. However issues emerged as a result of the restructuring leading to employee departures. Turnover in the division had reached 70 per cent in the past year. These trends and the impact from the restructuring led the division to record a net loss on operations in 2014. �We tried to restructure the division and this change caused a lot of confusion� said Lo. �I recognize that we need to right the ship but I want to think about how we go about doing this so that we can avoid further mistakes.�Freight Forwarding IndustryIn the freight forwarding industry customers valued the timely cost-effective transfer of goods maintained in their original condition throughout the process. To accomplish this work well freight forwarders had to work with multiple carriers over various modes of transport � air marine rail and land. Every transfer from one mode of transport to another and every time jurisdictional boundaries were crossed required a set of documentation to be completed. Completing this documentation was not just a simple task of filling up forms but required one to be familiar with tariffs customs regulations and specific requirements of shipping by that mode of transport. While investments in information technology enabled freight forwarders to manage some of these tasks more efficiently it was still a complex process with many uncertainties and irregularities that still required knowledgeable experienced and competent individuals to negotiate alternative arrangements problem-solve on the fly and assuage customers in the event that deliveries did not go as planned. Canaan Group In 1981 Paul Lo founded a freight forwarding company in Vancouver Canada that grew continuously to become one of the largest privately owned Canadian logistics companies�the Canaan Group. Over the years it expanded to include various services: global air and sea freight customs brokerage warehousing and distribution fully integrated courier service cargo insurance trade-aid consulting real estate development and venture capital financing. Lo who was Paul�s son took over as president and CEO in June 2002.Export Cargo Specialist (ECS) DivisionThe ECS division was historically organized by function�sales booking and documentation. These were different roles and tended to attract different personalities. Sales consisted of one person dedicated to meeting prospective clients and selling them on the benefits of working with the ECS division for their logistics needs. Once clients were brought on board it was the booking department�s job to take care of clients� needs. Booking staff worked with the ECS network of logistics service providers to find the best possible routes for shipments and to anticipate and resolve shipping issues. Sending goods from one location to another required extensive paperwork to be filled in. This task was accomplished through documentation. Documentation staff identified the goods to be shipped noted down the correct tariff codes if necessary and generated specific disclosure documents for fragile or sensitive goods (such as machinery parts). Because of the specific logistical needs of different industries ECS staff tended to be industry experts with each client assigned to one ECS staff member. For example a forestry product company wanted to ship lumber from its factories in British Columbia Canada to a customer in Kyoto Japan. The process the ECS team followed to assist the company in shipping its product included information gathering obtaining rates booking the carriers filling in documentation following up with the customer and monitoring the shipment as it was transported from origin to destination (see Exhibit 1). In many cases the services provided by the ECS team went beyond managing routine shipments. Delays in manufacturing or transportation resulted in shipments being held up or held back. For example a delay caused by a railway line performing emergency maintenance could push the pick-up date from the factory by three days. This delay could create a domino effect where the truck carrying the goods to the port would arrive a day late missing the cargo ship�s original departure date. When such delays occurred the booking department worked with its various transportation providers to find alternative shipping options and routes. For example instead of relying on the regular transport service a higher-priced expedited service to cut two days off a trip could be booked. Alternatively the booking agent could arrange for truck transport instead of rail transport if a railway were undergoing maintenance. In most cases the cost of these changes was passed on to customers. An ECS manager stated: We help clients ship goods efficiently and at a cost-effective rate. There was a lot of problem solving and creativity involved in the role because a shipment could involve many combinations of services. For example shipping a few containers from Calgary to China could involve two different shipping lines and different ports depending on availability.If any documentation was incorrectly provided amendments needed to be made as soon as possible. Otherwise if the item codes on a shipping manifest did not match the description of the physical goods being inspected goods could be delayed at customs indefinitely. If transportation options were closed because of deadlines or capacity constraints alternate routes had to be found rates negotiated and passage booked. A key consideration for the ECS division was the value of having a satisfied customer over the long run. While the division might not make its margin on one or two complex shipments satisfied clients often entrusted their business with the division for years. Thus customer service representatives in booking often built strong client relationships with their customers. �There are very few barriers to entry in the freight forwarding industry� said a manager. �If we can�t provide extra service the customer can go elsewhere.� Some of these extra services included covering the cost of unexpected documentation or delays if they were a nominal sum or helping customers manage packaging waste such as surplus boxes or crates at no extra cost.Pressure to RestructureDuring the Great Recession of 2008�2009 demand for raw materials and finished goods fell worldwide. This decrease in demand resulted in a collapse in the average price to ship products overseas as the owners of empty cargo ships competed for business. The major decline in shipping volume�and revenues�was followed by a second decline in demand from October 2011 to January 2012 (see Exhibit�2). To preserve financial strength many carriers cut out non-core operations in their businesses such as documentation service. To retain competitiveness and client relationships freight forwarders had to perform more of this service for their clients. The ECS documentation staff members found themselves overwhelmed by the additional work and it was difficult to hire new staff to take on this additional work. At the salaries offered the ECS division could attract only younger junior staff. However it was difficult to retain them as they were discouraged by the mundane work of managing detailed documentation and the limited career prospects. To accommodate the additional documentation work Lo decided to set up a three-person office in Taiwan in 2013. Lo believed it would be easier to find and retain staff in Taiwan where there was a larger pool of labour that was more accustomed to performing routine data entry work. By shifting more documentation work to Taiwan Lo freed up resources in Vancouver. Changes in the Vancouver office seemed necessary as well. As each industry had its own set of regulations clients were assigned to booking staff by industry. Each staff member covered multiple industries with no overlap in coverage. As a result the department was caught short whenever someone was on vacation or called in sick. Tina the ECS manager had to rely on sporadic emails from the person who was not in the office to piece together the case being managed. Consequently ECS staff worked long hours and were not able to take time off which Lo recognized to be a problem:Due to the high volumes at times I recognized my staff were overwhelmed. They would work overtime and come in on weekends. It was what we needed to do to keep our customers. It was a tough time in the industry and one wouldn�t want to lose a customer because a few emails weren�t being responded to. Yet this reliance on staff working extra hard could not go on forever. Eventually I was worried the quality of our service would suffer.Creating a Cross-Trained WorkforceIn an attempt to address the problems Lo sought to restructure roles and work assignments among the ECS group. He planned to introduce a model that would allow the group to offer cross-coverage meaning that multiple individuals within the group could handle any single client�s business. Thus rather than being assigned to a single function each staff member was assigned to cover all the needs of a client. This change meant that each client would have a pair of dedicated representatives capable of performing a range of functions for them. No longer were individuals assigned to solely doing bookings or completing documentation but they were to be cross-trained in performing these functions for the clients they were assigned to.Lo was concerned about the ability and interest of individuals to learn a different function (booking to documentation and vice versa) the intricacies of each industry and indeed the preferences of each client. He noted that ECS business fell into two categories: 1) high-value and high-margin very important (VIP) clients and 2) medium- to high-volume but lower margin regular clients. The former accounted for about 70 per cent of ECS business. VIP clients required more customized solutions and more attention to their transport needs. ECS staff had to be available to respond to these clients as needed. For example a request could come in at 7:00 p.m. that required six hours to two days� worth of analysis. A VIP client could ask ECS staff to arrange shipments of five or more full container loads of mixed product (household goods gardening supplies clothing) coming from five different factories and going to 10 different destinations. VIP clients could generate $200000 in commissions per year. In contrast regular clients might require one or two shipments of goods a month�mining equipment and supplies for example�one wooden pallet at a time. These regular clients might generate $8000 in commissions per year. Regular clients needed a response that took perhaps 20 minutes to prepare. Lo noted:Our clients are not uniform in the way they send work to us. There are clients whose entire volume occurs during a very narrow one- or two-month window; there are other clients who provide consistent stable volumes. And our high-volume VIP clients can sometimes offer us a significant amount of work on short notice. Nevertheless the experiment went ahead. The restructuring was implemented by way of a buddy system so that there were at least two people covering a client. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014 individuals in booking and documentation were matched up with the intent that each learned the other�s role. It was expected that booking personnel would coach documentation personnel on how to develop business and in exchange the former would learn how to complete documentation. By providing cross-coverage of clients it was hoped that the buddy system would alleviate everyone�s workload and allow the ECS group to continue providing a high level of service without overwhelming the staff. Consistently in each of the three teams there was one individual placed as the mentor and the other as the trainee. Pairings were put in place at the start of January 2014 (see Exhibit 3). Issues with the RestructuringIt became evident within a week that there were issues with the new arrangement. The individuals in booking were generally gregarious and customer-centric�willing to take on extra work and manage unexpected issues that clients brought up. They were flexible and could think out-of-the-box when it came to finding solutions to shipping issues. The individuals in documentation were detail-oriented and leaned toward strictly following the terms of any agreement. As they were more likely to be introverts they did not seem comfortable dealing with clients in general. Within the first month Bruce and Simon gradually took on fewer booking inquiries and projects reverting to managing documentation for their paired groups. This seemed to come as a relief to Sharon and Paula who preferred to deal with clients rather than learn about and fill in the documentation necessary for shipments. In the Brenda and Lorna pairing it seemed as if Brenda was not willing to share booking responsibilities with Lorna. This resulted in some degree of resentment on Lorna�s side; while she was eager and capable of doing more she was frustrated at being treated like a personal assistant. Brenda commented on how she viewed the restructuring:I came to Canaan after working at various shipping lines. I remember that when I moved to Canaan I had one of the biggest profiles at ECS. My budget numbers were in the millions while others were in the hundreds of thousands. I didn�t want to do documentation because it didn�t utilize my experience. I can use my resources for other things. Problem solving with clients� issues take time. If I spend this time doing documentation�which is data entry really�it�s not a good use of my time. There are issues in booking that we must deal with and we must be flexible to be able to drop our other non-value added work to focus on client issues. If we can�t provide clients this extra service if we can�t resolve it speedily clients will go elsewhere. Brenda�s insights on the need to revert to the old roles�especially when the team was under pressure� rang true for the other pairings. While the intent was to have cross-trained individuals booking agents did not want inexperienced team members providing incorrect information to clients or booking inefficient modes of transportation. Brenda added: �Lorna with whom I was paired was not equipped to deal with shipping problems. I recognized that and I did not have the bandwidth to do anything else other than resolve the issues in front of me. That meant that Lorna had to do her part which was to focus on documentation.�If there were any mistakes booking staff knew that clients would be upset and that additional work would have to be done to placate them. Also booking staff had spent months or years building up their book of business with clients. They had strong working relationships with clients and were often reluctant to share these clients with their documentation colleagues.Another issue that created resentment was the pay disparity between booking and documentation staff. Previously booking staff tended to be more experienced producers generating revenues and profit for the firm while documentation staff were less experienced and seen as part of the back office operations. Thus before the restructuring booking staff earned an average of 20 per cent more than documentation staff. When it was made public that the pairings would be sharing booking and documentation duties Lo addressed this discrepancy by increasing the pay of staff previously in documentation. However this increase was met with resentment by others. One manager stated:We�re essentially supposed to do the same things now�booking and documentation. Why are our colleagues in documentation getting a salary raise? Our team in booking has worked hard to bring the business back on track after the recession. Do we not deserve a raise as well for taking on documentation work which is different from what we�ve been trained to do?Next there was the issue of client mix. �Accounts were initially assigned based on working language� said Lo. �We�d evenly distribute the volume so that there was the same volume of documentation and booking for each person and similar numbers of high-volume VIP clients per team.� In theory the client allocation per pairing was supposed to be equal. In practice the volume of work coming from clients could not be predicted and certain pairings received significantly more work than others. Lo had to manage significant differences in workload: one pairing could be sitting idle while another would be overwhelmed with work. Even when shipment requests seemed evenly distributed the complexity of tasks posed another issue. Complex shipments could require 15 different transportation modes in a single order and the booking agent would often have to adjust a few connections along the way to account for delays. In contrast routine shipments could require confirming a regular weekly shipment of low-value goods from factory to warehouse. Given the differences between complex and routine shipments the attempt to balance the workload by distributing shipments evenly across all pairings left everyone frustrated. Less experienced staff could not adequately anticipate and solve problems on complex shipments. Often experienced booking staff had to step in on an emergency basis to protect arrival dates that had been promised. Invariably it was more work to �save� a shipment than it was to anticipate the issues in advance. The documentation required for more complex shipments required experienced individuals as well. There were times when staff formerly in documentation had to step in to correct mistakes made by their less experienced colleagues. The unintended fallout was that some customers were dissatisfied with what they perceived to be a drop in the quality of customer service in both booking and documentation.There was the additional challenge that complex shipping requests typically generated higher margins�and thus higher bonuses�for individuals working on them. Senior staff were unhappy that some of these higher margin opportunities were taken away from them replaced by more routine�and lower value�work. Lo was aware of complaints from senior staff about reduced bonuses. Redistributing accounts also meant that some clients with a long-term relationship with a booking agent had to now deal with a new person. This upset the booking staff who had spent years cultivating a relationship with the client. In addition clients were reluctant to work with a new staff member and threatened to take their business elsewhere if they could not work with their former booking agent. Six months into the experiment it was evident that Lo�s attempts at restructuring the ECS division had not gone as anticipated. Little cross-training had occurred between the pairs and most booking and documentation work was still performed by the staff member whose original role it was. Despite Lo�s best intentions the division had reverted to its previous structure. To make matters worse his attempt at restructuring had created greater animosity within the group and dissatisfaction among clients. By September 2014 there was turnover in the division with Tina leaving for a Canaan Group project in Alberta and three employees�Simon Gail and Sharon�leaving the company. Four new hires were brought in as replacements but two left within weeks. Two more hires were made to replace these team members. In October 2014 the team was comprised of Brenda (manager) Bruce Nora Julia Raye and Paula.Nora was hired to replace Simon in documentation. Julia and Raye had experience at other companies in the logistics industry but did not have direct experience in the work performed by the ECS team. �We wanted the new hires to complement the team� said Lo. �We wanted the team to be easily moldable if we decided to change the structure of the team again.�Next StepsAfter managing the busy last three months of 2014 Lo took stock of what he had seen in the ECS division. The experiment�moving to a buddy system�could not yet be considered a success. It was not clear whether the changes should be reversed or if they were merely in the first year of what should be a two- to three-year transition. �What if we quit too early and don�t give this plan enough time to succeed?� he pondered.One option open to Lo was to bring in one of his experienced project managers�Lucas�currently working in the Project Cargo division (which handled freight that did not fit within the standard industry containers) to head up the ECS division. �Should I bring fresh perspective into this department?� Lo wondered.Another option was to promote one of the bookers or documenters into the manager role and allow that person to come up with a potential solution. �They�ve dealt with the issue for the past year� said Lo. �Surely they�ll have some idea of what needs to be fixed and how.�There were many opportunities in the freight forwarding industry. Lo could envision the Canaan Group�specifically the ECS division�capitalizing on the changes. Before he could build a stronger foundation for the future though the turnover in the division had to be stabilized. Lo surveyed his ECS team�s organizational chart and wondered what changes he should make.Exhibit 1: Export Shipment ProcessThe export shipment process began when a customer such as a forestry product company contacted an ECS salesperson and outlined a request. The request included specifications on the goods being shipped a preferred arrival time window and any constraints specific to the shipment�such as whether the goods were fragile or required refrigeration. The ECS booking team would explore various shipping options including rail truck and ocean freight. The first task was to find a convenient cost-effective and reliable way to transport the goods to the nearest port typically by road or rail. Then the booking team needed to find available shipping slots on the various ships that were leaving around the same time.To prepare the goods for receipt at its destination port the ECS booking team worked with local brokers to help the merchandise clear customs. Finally a suitable way of transporting the goods from the port to their final destination had to be arranged. The booking team negotiated prices on behalf of the client. Then the ECS documentation team filled in the various forms that were required at each step of the process including the bill of lading�a detailed list of a shipment of goods in the form of a receipt given by the carrier to the person consigning the goods�and any import or export forms.Overview of the Export Shipment ProcessSales & Rate Inquiry Process                     Booking                                    DocumentationSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: Baltic Dry Index 2002�2015The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange that measures changes in the cost to transport various raw materials.

Of these about 3.6 million people used a wheelchair while an additional 11.6 million used walking aids such as a cane crutches or a walker. MobilityWorks provided mobility solutions for this population of individuals with limited mobility. The company had several hundred million dollars in revenue which had grown by over 100 per cent between 2011 and 2014. In December 2015 MobilityWorks was one of the largest adaptive van providers in the United States. When Bill Koeblitz the chief executive officer of MobilityWorks envisioned the future of the company he saw several opportunities to grow at a still faster pace. Some of Koeblitz�s colleagues were concerned that MobilityWorks� close-knit family-type work environment a key contributor to its success to that point might not be able to withstand a rapid expansion. However what worried Koeblitz was that even with all the growth opportunities neither MobilityWorks nor the industry as a whole would be able to reach even half of the 30 million people who desperately needed MobilityWorks� products. Impressive as MobilityWorks� revenue growth had been the entire adaptive van industry sold less than 20000 units in 2013 and less than 150000 of the 3.6 million people in wheelchairs owned a wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV). Koeblitz wondered how could MobilityWorks continue to grow rapidly and profitably reach out to the millions who could benefit from its products and still retain the company�s unique work culture?MOBILITYWORKS� CUSTOMERS: AN AGING POPULATION AND MOBILITY NEEDSJim Kuzak loved meeting people and being on the move as a police officer. That was until he was shot five times while on duty. One of the bullets did major damage to his spine leaving him in a wheelchair. After trying several different vehicles with MobilityWorks Kuzak settled on a converted truck�a wheelchair accessible Ford F-150. The driver�s seat could be lowered from the truck to meet Kuzak at road level. Once he shifted from his wheelchair to the seat the crane in the back of the truck could automatically load or retrieve his wheelchair. Kuzak was thrilled that he could once again get into a vehicle and drive away without having to rely on anyone else. Kuzak was among the fortunate few who knew about MobilityWorks; he had received his truck as a gift. Many individuals with limited mobility were not aware that products like that existed and the vast majority of those individuals even if they knew of the products simply could not afford one�fewer than three out of 10 working-age individuals with limited mobility were employed. The proportion of the population using mobility devices increased dramatically with age. Nearly two-thirds of all mobility devices were used by persons aged 65 or over. While 1.5 per cent of the working-age population (between the ages of 18 and 64 years) used some form of mobility device over 10 per cent of individuals over the age of 65 used a mobility device. Nearly 40 per cent of persons aged 85 or over used mobility devices. By 2015 10000 Americans were turning 65 every day�3.6 million people per year. That represented an additional 360000 mobility device users a year for another 15 years. MOBILITYWORKS� HISTORYIn 1997 Koeblitz sold a health care enterprise he owned to a public company and went looking for a new business opportunity one that offered social value to people. Word reached Koeblitz that a Ford dealer in Akron Ohio wanted to get out of his business after having taken over a company that built vans for people in wheelchairs. Koeblitz looked at the company and found that even though they were trying hard to do a good job they were producing vehicles that were not safe. There were no quality standards no crash testing and no assurance of safety. A wheelchair-bound customer would give up a new van for three months and get back a vehicle that may not have been safe or able to accommodate the customer�s wheelchair. It became obvious to Koeblitz that the whole process could be done in a better way. And thus MobilityWorks was born in 1997.  Two years later MobilityWorks had a team of eight and was selling 50 wheelchair vans a year. Sixteen years later in 2013 the company had grown to an employee head count of 456 and sold 4000 vehicles across 35 locations in the United States. Most of the growth in MobilityWorks� early years came from its commercial segment which sold �upfitted� commercial vehicles and WAVs for commercial use. MobilityWorks grew steadily over the years by opening new stores and consolidating small mobility dealers in key geographic areas. The company had more retail locations in more states than any of its competitors (see Exhibit 1). MobilityWorks hit a bump albeit temporarily in its steady growth due to the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. auto industry was hit pretty hard by the crisis with a 30 per cent decline in revenues. Although MobilityWorks was hit less severely registering an 8 per cent decline in revenues the financial crisis did make it more difficult for MobilityWorks� customers to get their custom-fitted vehicles financed through banks putting additional pressure on the company�s revenues. However it did not take long before MobilityWorks was back on the fast track. By 2015 MobilityWorks commanded a 16 per cent market share and was the nation�s largest mobility dealership and upfitter of WAVs.MOBILITYWORKS IN 2015A privately-owned WAV was pretty much a luxury item accessible to the few who could afford it. Unlike most luxury items however a WAV could truly transform the life of an individual with limited mobility. Also by boosting income generated through employment and simultaneously reducing withdrawals from social security and health insurance for millions of people improved access to WAVs had the potential to bring about a net gain in national productivity and income. After a steady growth over the previous two decades MobilityWorks was on the threshold of its biggest challenge yet: taking WAVs mainstream and making them accessible for the millions of underserved mobility-limited individuals in the United States. Koeblitz and his executive team saw three major hurdles in getting there: product and company awareness supply of eligible and motivated employees and access to capital for further expansion. Typically people who could benefit the most from MobilityWorks products had never heard of them before. Eric Mansfield MobilityWorks� executive vice-president summed up the central challenge of MobilityWorks� business succinctly: �How do you market to people who are looking for something that they have never used before?�MobilityWorks dealt with the challenge by trying to find the right solution for each individual client. By 2015 MobilityWorks was able to find a solution for 44 per cent of the people who walked into its stores a significant increase from 30 per cent just three years before. The increase was largely a result of the company�s focus on creatively exploring all possible avenues to make a MobilityWorks solution affordable for a customer. The engagement of every new MobilityWorks customer started with a needs analysis by a certified mobility consultant. Using casual conversation and direct questioning the consultant would learn about the nature of the person�s disability and any extenuating circumstances. This information was used to formulate the best options for the customer�s situation and transportation and family needs. Often all that was needed was an additional piece of equipment added to the current vehicle such as a stowage lift or hand controls; for some only a full conversion into a wheelchair accessible van would do. MobilityWorks derived its revenues from vehicle sales service and maintenance activities van rentals financing activities extended service contracts and miscellaneous packages�pretty much along the same lines as a traditional auto dealership. MOBILITYWORKS� SECRET SAUCE: THE TEAMThe ability to hire and retain good people had been at the centre of MobilityWorks� sustained growth over the years. In 2014 MobilityWorks employees scored 79 per cent in engagement on Modern Survey�s employee engagement survey. The survey measured employee engagement by assessing an individual�s psychological investment in the company and motivation to contribute to its success. The corresponding figure for the average U.S. workforce was 58 per cent. Over the years MobilityWorks had succeeded in establishing an exceptional work culture of caring for its employees. The employees in turn were heavily invested in the company and its mission. �It is hard not to like what we do. If you care about people it is hard to say I am not engaged� said Mansfield. This had translated into a thriving and profitable business with a significant positive social impact. �People is what makes us successful� said Charla Givens MobilityWorks� human resources director. She joined the company in 2007 when it had 13 stores and a three-person human resources team. In 2010 MobilityWorks developed its set of core values LOVE IT: Listen Ownership Value Excitement Integrity and Team. Givens said that establishing and adopting the core values had been the biggest cultural change in MobilityWorks over the last few years. Employees embraced the catchy motto and the MobilityWorks team started to live and breathe the core values. Finding the right people to hire was a critical part of Givens� role a task that was also the most challenging. People with prior experience in the automotive industry minus the �car dealership attitude� were hard to find added Mansfield. Not everyone was willing to leave the monetary benefits that came with the car dealership environment for MobilityWorks� better work/life balance and purpose-driven work even though MobilityWorks offered reasonably good pay and benefits. Givens felt that increasingly it was an employees� market. As MobilityWorks continued to grow it realized that Millennials were truly the future but not enough millennials seemed to be entering the automotive industry. Givens was concerned that millennials may not want to work for a company like MobilityWorks. Marketing not only to potential customers but also to future employees and leadership could be a critical challenge even for a successful and high impact business like MobilityWorks.AFFORDABILITYIn the United States in 2012 the median annual income of an employed working-age individual with limited mobility was US$20808. The average price of a WAV was roughly $45000. It could cost as much as an additional $26000 to convert a $26000 Toyota Sienna minivan into a WAV. By contrast the median annual income of an employed working-age adult with no disability was $32688 and the average price of a car was $24296. Affordability was clearly the predominant obstacle separating a mobility-limited individual from a WAV. MobilityWorks did what they could to make WAVs accessible. Costs could be lowered by executing a conversion on a used vehicle in good condition. MobilityWorks� inventory of 550 accessible vehicles included both new and used vehicles with a used WAV available for as little as $10500. In 2011 the company established the MobilityWorks Foundation a non-profit organization that provided financial assistance or equipment or both to individuals requiring help with mobility needs. The scope of health insurance had widened over the years but neither regular health insurance Medicare nor Medicaid would help pay for a wheelchair access modification to a vehicle. They would cover the needs of a mobility-limited individual in the home and would subsidize a wheelchair and even a mobility scooter but would not cover costs incurred to enable travel beyond the home. If health insurance plans were to include WAVs in the future millions of people who could benefit from a WAV would finally be able to afford one. One might assume that a number of non-profits and government programs would support the growing population with limited mobility and provide funding for WAVs; after all $519.2 billion was spent on disability programs in the United States in 2006. This constituted 11 per cent of total federal state and local spending in the United States that year. As many as six grants and assistance programs were available in the state of Ohio alone. On the ground however it seemed that third-party funding was limited. The Veterans Administration was an exception. It would fully fund a vehicle including the conversion for all veterans injured on duty. Fifteen per cent of all MobilityWorks� sales were generated through veterans funded by the Veterans Administration. Affordability was a relatively lesser concern for another customer segment: institutions such as hospitals old-age homes universities and schools. They were grouped under the commercial segment and represented another 14 per cent of MobilityWorks� 2014 revenues. A typical van conversion cost $22000�$26000. A scooter lift cost $3400 and a hand control installation $1000. A typical service bill ranged between $200�$300 and it cost $129 to rent a MobilityWorks WAV for a day. The rental fee was only a fraction of the revenue generated from a single van sale but $129 could be a significant amount for an unemployed mobility-limited individual to spend on convenience or pleasure for one day. From the company�s perspective though van rentals and other revenue streams were relatively insignificant in driving future business growth. Front-end sales of WAVs and new add-on equipment provided about 95 per cent of a typical MobilityWorks store�s revenues. OTHER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIESWhile a WAV remained unaffordable for most individuals with limited mobility purchasing one as a group spread the cost over several people making a WAV affordable and accessible to all within the group. A public cab in a city could be seen as a common resource shared among the residents of the city. WAV cabs could therefore be a viable solution for the vast majority of mobility-limited individuals who were not covered within the veteran or institutional segments. Koeblitz did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. If three out of four of the 30 million individuals with limited mobility ordered one WAV cab ride every month an additional 60000 WAV cabs would be needed to fill the gap�more than thrice the number the industry sold in 2013. That could translate into $2.4 billion in fresh sale revenues and $120 million in net income. If each ride were to cost an average of $20 that could mean $5.4 billion in cab ride revenues and $270 million in net income every year.These were fairly significant numbers that represented an opportunity not only for the WAV manufacturers and service providers but also for the WAV cab industry. The structure would simultaneously enable WAV access to all who needed it without having to invest in the purchase of a vehicle. What then was preventing the WAV cab industry from reaching these numbers?The Americans with Disabilities Act stipulated that the cost to a passenger for specialized curb-to-curb WAV cab service could not be higher than the cost for regular sedan taxicab service. However a WAV cab cost more than an ordinary cab to begin with and it yielded a lower mileage per gallon of fuel partly due to the added weight of the wheelchair. With many more cost-increasing factors at play operating a WAV cab could cost up to $10000 more per year as compared to an ordinary cab. Running a WAV cab had therefore ended up becoming a relatively unprofitable enterprise which in turn had led to a shortage in supply of WAV cabs. In this particular instance the Act may have ended up hurting the interests of the very people it intended to protect. There was an opportunity to expand sales by reducing production costs. In order to convert a vehicle into a WAV an upfitter would often start by taking apart a brand new vehicle and reducing it to little more than a shell. A large-scale assembly line production improved standardization and better integration between original equipment manufacturers and adaptive van upfitters could lead to a reduction in production costs. Passing on some of this benefit to the customers as lowered prices could improve the affordability of WAVs and increase sales. However given the high level of customization this was not easy to accomplish. The market penetration varied widely among MobilityWorks� 35 stores spread across the United States. While one store could be selling one van per year for every 14000 people in its region another could be selling as little as one for every 70000. Mansfield estimated that if MobilityWorks� market penetration in each of its markets was as good as its best market that change alone would drive a 100 per cent growth in revenues without opening a single new store. However the market penetration depended not only on the effectiveness of the store staff but also on several other factors including the attributes of the population the store catered to. Having said that opening or acquiring new stores was the most apparent path to revenue growth. MobilityWorks� 35 stores were all located within 13 states in the United States. The remaining 37 states represented a sure-shot opportunity for expansion and revenue growth as did other countries across the globe. MobilityWorks was also considering additional investment in increasing brand recognition and consumer awareness of its products. Since its products and services catered to a select audience there was a good opportunity to leverage targeted advertising to enhance the effectiveness of marketing efforts while simultaneously reducing marketing costs. Improving financing options for customers was yet one more option. Unlike financing an automobile purchase from a major brand organizing financing for the same vehicle for conversion into a WAV could be a challenge limiting the options for customers. MobilityWorks continued to work with banks and leasing companies to further improve consumer financing for its vehicles.GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES: NECESSARY TRADE-OFF WITH THE COMPANY�S WORK CULTURE? Koeblitz saw several big challenges ahead of him. He wondered which would be the most profitable and feasible growth opportunities for MobilityWorks over the short term and which would be the most promising over the long term. Would there be a necessary financial trade-off between the short and long term? And which growth opportunities would best serve the interests of the underserved mobility-limited population? The biggest question Koeblitz struggled with was whether faster growth across multiple market segments necessarily came at the expense of MobilityWorks� winning work culture. Could a mid-size company like MobilityWorks seize multiple growth opportunities to satisfy the large and rising market demand for its products and still retain its close-knit purpose-driven work culture? Relatedly what could MobilityWorks do to become more attractive as an employer to the millennials looking for socially meaningful careers? As he thought about the millennials Koeblitz chuckled. It would not be long before MobilityWorks would have to think about not just the Millennials but Generation Z as well.Exhibit 1: Competitive Landscape by GeographySource: Company documents.

The tasks of an operations manager at an LSP were to plan and review the daily distribution fulfilment. Kiessling operated a terminal that offered various logistics services such as hazardous�materials warehousing contract logistics procurement logistics just-in-time services and in-night express services. The in-night operations permitted the company to exploit the synergistic effects of using the terminal both in the day and at night. There were separate tours for two large automotive original equipment manufacturers that used the in-night service to supply their repair shops and showrooms with spare parts. However the major share of distribution was bundled consignments from various consigners in the automotive agriculture and construction industries. The majority of consignments were business-to-business (B2B). Furthermore sensitive deliveries such as pharmaceuticals horse-breeding sperm records and laboratory samples were carried in the in-night network.In April 2017 Brandl had just returned from a three-week leisure trip. As he arrived at his office one Monday morning he was approached by one of his staff. Since the previous Thursday a large consigner Blum NFZ Teile (Blum) had stopped feeding consignments to the in-night service network from its largest sales area in Regensburg (Ratisbon). Blum being an important consigner at the time was the target of a corporate acquisition from one of its competitors. After the acquisition was finalized in December 2015 Blum had planned to continue with the service provided by Kiessling�s in-night network although in the long run in 2018 it planned to insource in-night distribution. However since the previous Thursday some delivery tours had run idle early on due to missing volume from Blum. The use of these tours had decreased significantly. As a result revenues were estimated to drop �750 per night while operational costs remained at a constant high level.As a first reaction Brandl checked the tour delivery times and volumes in the Transportation Management System (TMS). The TMS held all the timestamps and geographic coordinates from delivery and visualized the tour after the fact on an online map. What he saw was indeed alarming. Blum had been a major consigner up to this point. There was a service level agreement in place which included a two-month period of notice for cancelling the agreement. Blum operated five sales areas in Kiessling�s service area. Four out of five sales areas fed in-night consignments into the in-night network. The Regensburg sales area was the largest one feeding about one third of Blum�s consignments. From the past year�s TMS data a first estimate of the devastating consequences was made: The total number of consignments was estimated to drop by 40 per cent per night and the total number of delivery stops was estimated to drop by 26 per cent. Different tours and zip codes were affected differently.Due to the tight time schedule operating in-night distribution was always challenging. Even small interruptions could cause the system to lose its balance and produce unfavourable results such as delayed delivery or unsecure deposited consignments. Over the years there were smaller challenges which were fixed locally. Whenever there was an issue with unbalanced tours tours running idle over a longer period or tours being delayed for many days in a row Brandl and his staff found some small adaptations to rebalance things in a smooth and smart way. However this time the challenge was no local issue. The cancellation of service by Blum shook the whole distribution and revenue of the in-night express operations. As a result Blum had to come up with a plan to adapt the distribution system by the end of June 2017. How could Brandl adapt the Kiessling in-night operations to overcome this massive turmoil and adapt to the new situation?Background: In-Night LogisticsIn-night logistics was a transportation service characterized by delivery at night. It was different from overnight logistics which was characterized by parcel delivery the next morning. Overnight service providers performed the line-haul from the origin terminal to the receiving terminal at night. However transhipment of parcels at the receiving terminal and distribution to recipients were performed the next morning. This procedure had the advantage of face time with the recipients and secure confirmed receipt. In contrast in-night service providers (INSPs) performed the line-haul in the evening transhipment roughly around midnight and parcel distribution and delivery at night. Customers benefited from in-night services by having the delivered parcels already available at the start of business. This was a competitive advantage whenever parts were necessary at the start of production or spare parts and tool were required for a handyman�s daily tour. Lack of these parts could result in delayed production harvest or departure and hence disrupt a production schedule and cause tardiness and idle times. In-night express was a special case of courier express and parcel (CEP) service. It could be considered a premium logistics service due to its high-service level speed and guaranteed delivery.Another unique characteristic of in-night logistics was receiptless delivery. Usually no one was available to accept a delivery and sign for the delivery so a receipt was not issued. Instead the driver scanned the parcel. By doing so both a timestamp and the geographical coordinates of delivery were saved. There were a variety of delivery options offered to customers including security boxes provided by the in-night service provider and customer facilities such as garages repair shops and private locker boxes. Even a car trunk could serve as a depot. If the depot was not a provided security box the driver took a photograph of the delivered parcel at the destination for the sake of liability. As a result of this variety the driver needed access to the chosen delivery option: keys transponders chip cards access keys for combination locks and so on. Every driver carried about 200�300 keys every night. This practice posed a tremendous liability for drivers in terms of customer deposit places. Receiptless delivery and the keys to customers� deposits and sites were of utmost importance in performing in-night express services.The standard process of in-night express was straightforward. Consignments were collected in the afternoon. One consignment (shipment) could comprise one or many parcels addressed to the same recipient. Usually the consigner paid postage per consignment subject to the total weight of all parcels and distance. INSPs used a deadline of 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m. depending on their proximity to the central hub. Thereafter the consignments were bundled at the regional origin terminals and line-hauled to the national central hub. At the hub the consignments were sorted by their receiving destination and transhipped to the receiving terminal. Line-haul vehicles arrived in the receiving regional terminals and were unloaded to utility vans for distribution. Finally consignments were delivered to recipients until the early morning. This network configuration was called a hub-and-spoke network (see Exhibit 1). Hubs were used in transportation to consolidate and split truckloads. This practice was meant to save direct lines running between every terminal in the network. Similar to conventional cargo carriers INSPs needed to operate networks covering the distribution area without blank spots on the map. Every consignment was handled four times: (1) regional collection; (2) line-haul from the origin terminals to the hub; (3) line-haul from the hub to the receiving terminals; and (4) regional delivery. An exception was consignments that were sent within service areas. These orders remained in the origin terminal awaiting delivery at night. The whole national territory was divided into a series of service areas. Every district was assigned to one partner in the in-night network who performed the collection and delivery. Franchisees were regional logistic service providers running a regional terminal in the assigned service area. The assigned service area was further partitioned into fixed tour areas. There were many approaches to partitioning a tour area into several smaller districts. A widely used practice was called �districting.� When consistency was an important consideration the practices of districting partitioning or fixed tour problems could be used. In 2017 in-night express was already highly consolidated in Germany with few national in-night networks. In Germany only nox NachtExpress (nox) Night Star Express (NSE) European Service Logistics Association (ESLA) and transmed Transport had dedicated in-night networks (see Exhibit 2). In terms of the number of consignments the market leader was nox followed by NSE. The other in-night services were mostly premium options offered to private customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Due to this small number of equivalent logistic services and the premium service level customers were willing to pay a good margin higher than for other CEP services. This was also the case for corporate customers in the B2B segment which was mostly served by those INSPs running dedicated networks. Since 2010 several mergers and acquisitions had taken place fostering the market�s consolidation.In 2011 the German company LPR GmbH Logistik the Austrian company Lagermax AED and other European express service providers started to connect their existing in-night express networks. The co-operation was named the European Service Logistics Association (ESLA). In 2017 the ESLA network operated in 24 European countries by undertaking 832 tours per night and 430 tours per day on average. In 2016 the investment fund Special Situations Venture Partners (SSVP III) acquired 100 per cent of TNT Innight a subsidiary of the Dutch TNT Express. Later TNT Innight became nox. In February 2017 nox acquired CAT Deutschland the German subsidiary of the French CAT Group. In April 2016 Trans-o-flex started in-night express delivery operating its own hub-and-spoke network with its own vans. This Austrian INSP concentrated on temperature-sensitive parcels and offered industry solutions for pharmaceuticals. In 2017 Trans-o-flex was acquired by the Amberger family and Schoeller Holding (see Exhibit 2).Most INSPs used utility vans with only one person�the driver�for distribution. Since there were no vehicle-specific speed limits for this vehicle class they operated at the same speed as passenger cars. This was a competitive advantage over using trucks. Also because each INSPs used only one person the size and weight of consignments were usually limited accordingly. However the limiting resource in distribution was time. There were penalties charged within the in-night network if partners repeatedly failed to deliver a given high quota of on-time consignments. The on-time quota was planned and decided centrally. Since INSPs considered themselves to be premium service providers the on-time quota was usually between 99 and 100 per cent. The operating costs of a utility van were mostly fixed since there was a contracted charge per night with the subcontractors. The operating cost per night and vehicle were estimated to be roughly �272 (see Exhibit 3). In local distribution using small vans with a total weight less than or equal to 3.5 tonnes the personnel cost accounted for 60 to 70 per cent of the total distribution cost. Thus variable costs were relatively small compared to fixed costs.It was common practice to engage subcontractors for the distribution. Subcontractors brought their own vehicles and employed drivers. They had one tour area assigned per vehicle and received a daily contracted compensation for their territories. Every fixed tour area was assigned to one subcontractor�s van. The total working time per driver and night was around 9 hours�from 11:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. During working hours the subcontracted drivers waited for the inbound line-haul assumed consignments addressed to their district loaded their vehicle and delivered all consignments. Usually one tour had about 35 to 50 consignments and between 25 and 35 stops. The planning activities of an INSP were manifold: Strategically the INSP needed to locate its terminal and arrange its service area within the hub-and-spoke network. Subcontractors needed to be selected and employed. Further the service provider needed to make a decision about its degree of operational flexibility. This meant somehow defining which processes were going to be flexible and which processes would better remain consistent over time. On a mid-term tactical level an INSP designed its fixed tour areas which remained fixed for some time. Smaller local changes could take place in order to adapt to new circumstances keeping the majority of the plan robust. The subcontractors and their drivers were then assigned to the tour areas. In order to achieve high familiarity and local knowledge the assignment remained consistent for as long as possible. On a day-by-day planning level the tours in every tour area were routed. Routing meant computing a desirable order of stops that minimized the total duration of delivery. In case of any disruption the operator needed to �fight the fire.� Depending on the level of flexibility there could be some switching plans ready for execution. For example a driver could take over a designated part of another driver�s tour in a flexible way in order to achieve overall punctuality.Background: in-night distribution in Regenstauf GermanyKiessling was a member of a multinational in-night express network. There were several other partners and franchisees across Germany. In practice being part of this network meant feeding consignments into the system and receiving consignments from other partners and franchisees.Brandl was the operations manager at Kiessling responsible for the in-night business. Therefore he was concerned with customer acquisition and transport operations in the Kiessling terminal in Regenstauf. Regenstauf was located north of Regensburg in Eastern Bavaria in the south of Germany. It was close to the borders of the Czech Republic and Austria and within one kilometre (km) of the A93 motorway (German Autobahn). The Kiessling terminal operated a service area that included more than 440 zip (postal) codes comprising the municipalities of Regensburg Passau Landshut Straubing and Weiden (see Exhibit 4). The largest city in the area was Regensburg with about 146000 people. The in-night distribution was organized into geographical districts (i.e. territories or fixed tour areas). There were 29 vehicles and tours each having an assigned tour area. Every tour area was a cluster of several zip codes. In Germany five-digit zip codes had been in use since 1993. For historic reasons every tour area had a three-digit identifier which had no semantic value anymore. However the TMS required a three-digit identifier; hence the information technology (IT) department kept the numbers anyway. Most drivers had been subcontractors for Kiessling for years and were familiar with their tours customers and duties. They knew all the shortcuts dangers difficulties hidden customer depots and localities of frequent addressees by heart. Subcontractors received a fixed contracted charge per tour and night independent of the daily volume weight or delivery time. The average charge was negotiated in long-term contracts and depended on average stop number and density as well as the general ease or intricacy of a delivery area. For example a delivery area having curvy narrow roads bad winter road maintenance or that was simply far off any primary highways was considered intricate. The subcontracted drivers arrived between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. at the Regenstauf terminal with their utility vans to await the inbound lines. When an inbound line arrived it was unloaded and the parcels were transhipped by the drivers themselves.Consignments had a destination address including a zip code. Since shippers fed their consignments into the system using electronic data interchange there were many different names spellings and errors in data fields such as �addressee� �street� and �place� which were string type fields. Nevertheless the 5-digit zip codes were usually correct and therefore of great organizational value. Data integrity and validity was always an issue one that was common to the whole CEP industry. For example identifying addresses was difficult due to different spellings and names of the same address such as �KfZ Dillinger� �Dillinger KfZ Werkstatt� �Autowerkstatt Dillinger� and �Automobile Dillinger.� These four names could all semantically mean an auto repair shop having the family name Dillinger. For this reason distinctive data attributes such as the geographical coordinates and zip code were the primary information used for planning and routing.The consignments arrived in the Regenstauf terminal using any of four different inbound routes. The first inbound route was a line-haul from the central hub which was located close to Frankfurt am Main. This line-haul arrived around 1:00 a.m. but could be delayed until 3:00 a.m. The one-way travel distance from the terminal to the hub was roughly 300 km. Usually there were two vehicles on the line. These two were the same drivers and vans that brought the outbound consignments from collection to the central hub. In the case of too little capacity there was a third stand-in vehicle located close to the hub subcontracted by Brandl. In rare cases there were further stand-ins subcontracted by the hub operator. The second inbound route option was a direct line that arrived from a handful of other terminals such as Augsburg Berlin and Stuttgart. The third inbound route option was a line-haul from the regional hub (rather than the central hub) which was reserved for southern Germany and was located close to N�rnberg (Nuremberg). There was only one line-haul on this link. The fourth inbound route was a direct line-haul from Blum.On arrival the drivers jointly unloaded the arriving vans and sorted the consignments into their vans. Depending on when the last inbound van arrived distribution started around 2:30 to 3:15 a.m. The expected time of departure was 2:45 a.m. Drivers had a recommended optimized route that had been calculated by an in-house-developed routing tool. The computed schedule was displayed interactively on a smartphone and both the optimized tour and the actual driven tour were documented. The tour areas varied in size (see Exhibit 5). The average size was 675 square km. Differences in size were due to different approaching times to get there in the first place different density of stops and different productivity of drivers.A usual stop was processed as follows: stop at address find parcel in van find secure depot at customer site open depot with physical or digital key insert parcel in depot scan parcel and depot barcode. If drivers considered the depot unsecure or were not sure about the right place they took a photograph. The stop was finalized by locking the depot and restarting the van�s engine.The final stop had to be completed by 8:00 a.m. However there were also a few premium 7:00 a.m. deliveries which were usually addressed to general repairs workers who ordered the spare parts they needed to take with them on their own day tour. Nevertheless from time to time tours could not be completed on time for various reasons: bad weather and road conditions causing delay; too many stops adding up so that tours were infeasible; difficulties and therefore wasted time finding a customer depot; and inexperienced stand-ins being less familiar with the district customers and process. Brandl had to explain any delays on behalf of Kiessling because the company had to reach a high quota of on-time delivery. There was a severe penalty for every delayed parcel beyond a given threshold. On average all tours finished on time around 7:30 a.m. However there were some returning problems in the distribution. Most problems occurred in the summer due to peaks in volume and in the winter due to bad weather and poor road conditions. Problem: Losing a major consignerUntil April 2017 Blum had operated its own delivery tours in the daytime to supply repair shops and showrooms with auto parts. For in-night delivery Blum outsourced the in-night express service with Kiessling. Consignments were ordered by the Blum sales areas in Regensburg Amberg Passau and Weiden. The fifth sales area Straubing did not feed consignments into the system. All the consignments were directly shipped from the Pilsen Czech Republic logistics centre to Regenstauf using a designated vehicle. In December 2015 Blum was acquired by a major competitor. This acquisition was a horizontal fusion. Both companies were wholesalers of automotive spare parts for the utility sector operating in Germany and other European countries. In December 2016 Brandl was informed that the acquirer would continue to work with Kiessling until December 2017 and in-night distribution would be moved in-house starting from January 2018. The newly-merged company planned to exploit existing synergies. Blum had already performed daytime distribution and was able to serve most repair shops or showrooms more than once a day. However in April 2017 the Regensburg sales area suddenly cancelled the service agreement and the other sales areas were to follow. After some negotiations Brandl got notice of the cancellation at the end of April 2017. As a result he had to come up with a plan to adapt the distribution system by the end of June 2017. First Brandl decided to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Blum share of total volume and stops in order to find out how much room for re-optimization there would be after June (see Exhibit 6). Roughly 40 per cent of total volume and 26 per cent of total stops were expected to be lost. This share varied across the fixed tour areas due to different customer structures urban and rural infrastructures and the Blum sales areas. The Blum share was analyzed. The consignments were aggregated to stops and stops were categorized into three types: (1) Blum (2) mixed and (3) other stops. �Blum stops� were stops where only consignments from Blum were delivered. At �mixed stops� both Blum and other consignments were delivered. All stops receiving one or many consignments from anywhere but Blum were labelled as �other stops� (see Exhibit�6).Brandl knew he had to come up with a set of changes to implement by the end of June�in two months� time. Otherwise his in-night express division would lose its margin and its strong position in the area. However making changes in the distribution system was difficult. How many stops would remain in existing tours after the Blum volume was lost? Would the drop factor decrease increase or remain unchanged? The art of computing good tour areas was difficult due to the uncertainty in the daily volume and the location of recipients. How many of the 29 tours should remain? If Brandl significantly increased the tour area of remaining tours would the subcontractors be able to operate their tours economically or would they re-negotiate the rate per tour? Would larger tours having a lower density of stops be feasible at all?Alternative courses of actionAfter two days of collecting data talking on the phone with Blum and conducting plausibility checks Brandl knew there would be no way back. Blum was going to cancel and all other things staying the same approximately 26 per cent of the revenue from in-night services was going to leave with this consigner. Brandl called for a small team to plan the change including Brandl himself IT customer service and external consultants. In their first meeting the decision alternatives were laid out.Greenfield Planning (Option 1)The team would use historical data and exclude all consignments from Blum from that data. In this first approach they would need to plan the distribution from scratch: fixed tour areas possible changes in disposition selection assignment and re-negotiation with the subcontractors. Districting as a bridge between strategic and operational planning would stay the paradigm of distribution planning.Re-Optimization of Existing Fixed Tour Areas (Option 2)Some tour areas worked well because the drivers were familiar with them; others did not work well for different reasons. The team would need to look into all tours assess their use and come up with smaller local changes that would improve them. For example tours could be merged or split up between other tours. The borders between neighbouring fixed tours could be shifted to improve productivity and use. The overall goal was to decrease the total number of vehicles in order to save some money. Therefore the team needed to identify tours that could be dropped and fill the blank spots on the map by dividing it among the neighbouring tour areas.Introduce Variable Routing and Drop the Districting Paradigm (Option 3)Using software variable routes with no fixed tour area was optimized flexibly on a daily basis. There would not be any tactical districting anymore. As soon as the daily volume and destinations were known the daily routes were computed. Drivers would not have assigned fixed tour areas any more but would receive an optimized route on their smartphones every day. This optimization problem was commonly called the vehicle routing problem. An advantage of daily routing was that it could be determined based on the exact known volume and destinations.Change the Terminal Structure (Option 4)Until now all consignments had been shipped to the Regenstauf terminal first. This was a problem as consignments to the western areas passed by their destination and were carried back. Other consignments took a detour to Regenstauf which was not the direct way from the hub to the destination. The terminal structure could be made the subject of a greenfield network optimization. The variables to be optimized would be the number and location of additional terminals or cross docks. The team could think about using more than one terminal or at least two or three transhipment points (cross docks) somewhere in the west and south. This alternative would decrease detour mileage and increase the time available for distribution.decision timeBrandl argued in favour of re-optimized fixed tour areas (option 2) which was supported by customer service. Fixed tours had many advantages in terms of consistency while the daily routes within the tour remained flexible. Also from Brandl�s point of view the fixed areas were mandatory due to the fixed assignment of customer keys. For reasons of liability swapping keys was a difficult and time-consuming issue. The in-house IT administration while not countering Brandl�s argument argued that the in-house solution had already been capable of online routing. Therefore option 3 was not too big a technical issue for them. The TMS routing engine could exploit the higher degree of freedom to compute better daily routes. Hence full flexibility in daily routing would lead to lower costs because the vans would be better used and travel times would be minimized. It was pointed out that the main issue was the late time of departure. Since all drivers needed to wait for the last inbound van all tours could be late on high-volume days. One of the consultants argued that this issue could be tackled by pre-sorting the consignments onto the line-haul vans in the central hub and routing them to three cross docks across the service area. As a result the expected time of departure could be scheduled earlier and the distance from the terminal to the tour area could be shortened. Customer service was concerned about the willingness of drivers and the flexibility of other personnel to accept major changes. It was assumed that drivers would favour a re-optimized solution over a greenfield solution. Despite this argument Brandl remembered that local re-optimization in the past had led to a suboptimal division of tour areas. Therefore this turmoil could be the chance to get rid of all the old structures and start fresh. He expected to see better results from this option in terms of minimizing cost. Nevertheless everyone agreed that some changes were necessary and that they would need to find a good configuration that worked consistently from July onward. This solution should somehow balance the optimality of costs (minimize the number of tours per night and the travel time per route) and consistency over time (reinforce the familiarity of drivers and limit the systematic changes to a sufficient level).The team members first needed to decide which alternative to choose and then develop a plan for executing the chosen course of action. Due to the tight time schedule they needed to plan and implement a solution fast.Exhibit 1: In-Night Hub-and-Spoke Network Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Overview of In-night service providers operating in GermanyNote: � = EUR = euro; �1 = US$1.07 on April 21 2017.

No other cost item has greater influence on their profitability and on freight rates as these costs will be passed on to the customers eventually. How will the costs develop in the coming years? To answer this question an understanding of the subcontractors� costs is necessary. These include the typical fixed costs for the provision of the various truck types (realistic depreciation rates and residual value rates moderate rate of return on the capital employed motor vehicle taxes and insurance costs).

Ltd. (Apigee) office to discuss the road ahead for the company. Apigee was doing well and had established itself in the technology space as a well-known application programming interface (API) provider. The enthusiasm among the senior management was infectious and everyone wanted to be a part of the Apigee growth story. Much had happened since Grandhi had joined as vice-president and managing director of Apigee�s Bangalore office in 2011. The company had been growing very fast and its revenues had increased significantly. When Grandhi joined Apigee approximately 250 staff worked at the Bangalore office which by 2015 had increased to more than 400 employees. To compete in high-technology markets Apigee needed to build a culture of innovation and learning. At the Bangalore office Grandhi had taken forward the vision of the chief executive officer (CEO) Chet Kapoor by building a culture of collaboration openness to experimentation and an emphasis on learning. As the company was poised for major growth there were doubts whether Apigee would be able to sustain and nurture its existing culture. A few members of the senior team wondered whether Apigee would need to modify its crucial human resources (HR) practices in light of its anticipated growth. Would it be possible to connect the growing number of employees with the organizational values of sustaining passion and excellence without creating organizational conflict?  Although the fervour of the staff was evident Grandhi knew that he needed to discuss with the HR team and the senior management the integration of Apigee�s unique culture with its growth plans.The API IndustryAPI had disrupted the manner in which businesses operated because of its immense emphasis on the digitization of businesses. APIs acted as interfaces between hardware devices and the applications on which they were used representing both a business development tool and a new go-to-market channel that could generate substantial revenues. A study by McKinsey in 2013 found that adapting digital innovations in terms of their apps marketing and business processes could yield average cost savings of 9 per cent and that companies that pulled all the transformation levers could boost their bottom line by more than 50 per cent over the next five years. As stated by Kristin R. Moyer VP and distinguished analyst at Gartner: The API economy is an enabler for turning a business or organization into a platform. Platforms multiply value creation because they enable business ecosystems inside and outside of the enterprise to consummate matches among users and facilitate the creation and/or exchange of goods services and social currency so that all participants are able to capture value.Given the strategic significance and revenue potential of APIs many businesses were moving away from the brick and mortar business model to application-based models that could be operated through smartphones and other similar devices. This trend had resulted in huge investments in APIs. According to a 2015 Forrester report �US companies alone would spend nearly $3 billion on API management over the next five years. Annual spending would quadruple from $140 million in 2014 to $660 million in 2020. International sales would take the global market over the billion dollar mark.�The API Capability Index which was created using feedback from information technology (IT) respondents who were part of a global study commissioned by CA Technologies had identified India as one of the world�s API leaders. Globally the API management space had been growing rapidly leading to several prominent players in this space: Mashery (Tibco Software Inc.) Layer 7 Technologies Apigee Apiphany 3scale and Mashape (see Exhibit 1).APIGEEApigee was founded in 2004 and had its headquarters in San Jose California and regional offices in Bangalore and London England. The CEO Chet Kapoor joined Apigee in 2007. A proven leader and innovator in the high-tech industry Kapoor had spent more than 20 years in leadership positions at innovative software and hardware companies.Apigee delivered an intelligent API platform that enabled companies to securely share their enterprise data and services in an attempt to provide connected digital experiences. Apigee�s platform helped businesses use APIs to accelerate the pace at which they innovate share their data and services and adapt to rapidly changing customer and market needs. Apigee�s mission was �To deliver products that help make every business a digital business.� Many of the world�s largest�organizations selected Apigee to enable their digital business. These organizations included more than 25 per cent of Fortune 100 companies 5 of the top 6 Forbes Global 2000 companies and 5 of the top 10 global telecommunications companies. Apigee customers included global enterprises such as The Walgreens Company AT&T Inc. The British Broadcasting Corporation AOL Inc. MapQuest (Oath Inc.) Honeywell Limited Burberry Group Inc. Royal Dutch Shell plc Live Nation and First Data Corporation.Apigee�s total revenue grew from $27.6 million in fiscal year (FY) 2012 to $52.7 million in FY 2014 representing a 91 per cent increase. However as often happens with fast-growing companies its losses had also been soaring from $8.3 million in FY 2012 to $60.8 million in FY 2014. Losses in FY 2015 however had slowed compared with the previous year. In April 2015 the company sold 5115000 shares in its initial public offering raising $87 million. Apigee�s was thus the first public offering from a software company that worked on APIs. As stated by Kapoor:We believe that taking the company public gives the organization�greater credibility�with customers and partners. From a practical standpoint it provides a pile�of cash that could be used�for acquisitions. We intend to expand sales and marketing and pour more investment into research and development. We have a large company in the making.By 2015 Apigee proved to be a leading player in enabling digital transformation across industries and a thought leader in the management of APIs. Apigee diversified into three main areas of operations: products consulting and implementation. In offering digital strategy consulting services to its clients Apigee conducted a string of strategy workshops and created a warehouse of knowledge through white papers and cutting-edge research on APIs. These efforts enabled Apigee to offer its clients credible and trustworthy advisory services related to digital innovation. Most of Apigee�s target clientele comprised organizations that wanted to innovate while reaching out to customers in the digital space. In the highly dynamic and rapidly growing API space Apigee constantly worked on innovation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. Innovation had been the key differentiator between vying competitors who weren�t sparing any efforts to incorporate emerging technologies such as cognitive computing. To combat the intense competition Apigee created opportunities for collaboration within and outside the organization. Apigee had strategic alliances with Accenture SAP and GSMA. Apigee�s mission was to provide product enhancement and delivery with the aim of helping every business to become a digital business. Its competitive differentiators included a single and secure platform for APIs predictive analysis and close interaction with clients in an attempt to build and deliver solutions to meet the requirements of mission-critical digital businesses. Apigee�s approach to client engagement was quite unique. The company�s sales personnel worked closely with business executives and hands-on technologists in client organizations. Typically they started the engagement by identifying business success criteria for specific digital value chain projects. Given its customer-centric approach backed by technically sound personnel Apigee became a category creator and a market leader. Apigee�s strategy thus centred on the rapid resolution of client needs; this included a lower response time for clients. To achieve these goals the company focused on creating a work culture of autonomy openness spontaneity and courage to empower employees to take new challenges without the fear of failure and to be able to deliver innovative and speedy responses to clients. the APIGEE WAY: THE UNIQUE DNA OF APIGEESince Apigee�s inception Kapoor and Grandhi were clear that the organization would be designed and driven by a heavy focus on people and would work toward establishing management practices that empowered employees. Kapoor stated �We at Apigee deeply believe in the �magic of people.� Apigee nurtures the right environment for people to realize their potential and lets the magic unfold. We constantly look at fine-tuning our ways of working and our hiring approaches to allow this magic to happen.�Apigee�s prioritization of people over processes was based on the strong belief that focusing on people would enable effective processes i.e. when people were taken care of processes would automatically follow suit. This people-focused style of work necessitated an understanding of the culture and the values that prevailed at Apigee. Referring to Apigee�s unique culture and its effectiveness Michael Fleshman senior VP for customer digital technology at BBC Worldwide remarked �What defines success for us is the design of the APIs themselves. The level of expertise that Apigee brought to the table in terms of individuals who can help with the design of the APIs was an important aspect.�Culture building at ApigeeThe unique culture at Apigee i.e. �the Apigee way� was the outcome of culture-building exercises that were initiated to identify the company�s core values. Apigee�s way of building culture was markedly different from traditional top-down culture-building approaches; Apigee�s leadership team devised a bottom-up approach that was accomplished in-house. Dave Hinman a member of the senior management team was chosen to drive Apigee�s culture-building exercise which primarily involved capturing Apigee�s beliefs sentiments and values via interviews and conversations with employees. Hinman adeptly drove the identification of Apigee�s values and was well served by his strong technical qualifications and his close working relationship with Kapoor. The Apigee culture-building exercise provided an opportunity for employees to express what they liked about Apigee their reasons for working for Apigee and their perception of its culture. From the interviews and conversations with employees and the leadership team it became evident that at Apigee three critical values were internalized and exhibited in behaviour: passion a bias for action and respect. PassionA major part of the culture-building exercise involved the leadership team�s decoding of Apigee�s DNA which centered on answering two questions: Who are we? How do we do things? These questions underscored the value of �passion.� One employee highlighted the passion in Apigee�s culture by saying �The people at Apigee are incredibly passionate about their work and supportive of each other.� The passion at Apigee was evident from three unmistakable characteristics that the employees exhibited: an unwavering belief in the future of the API industry a passion for technology and employees� skills as high performers in their own domain. Unlike traditional large process-driven firms in which extra-role behaviour was often constrained Apigee as one employee pointed out �fosters a light-hearted and friendly environment; engineers are focused on success and frequently go beyond the call of regular duty.� Employees were encouraged to hold informal cross-functional meetings to enhance their learning beyond their individual roles. In one instance a group of employees who were not a part of the organization�s hiring process held an informal discussion over coffee on the use of social media in hiring. This informal discussion culminated in the same group of employees launching a social media initiative despite their not formally being a part of Apigee�s hiring process. In another instance a group of employees got together based on their common interest in the retail industry. They conducted research on the use of APIs in the retail industry. Data were collected to analyze the APIs used by large retailers; the resultant white paper culminated in a digital strategy workshop for the retail industry that provided a new approach for retail sales. A Bias for actionAnother important value that guided Apigee�s manner of operating was its �bias for action.� The secret of Apigee winning deals and appreciation from clients stemmed primarily from Apigee�s culture of taking quick decisions and responding promptly to clients. An employee explained Apigee�s bias for action as follows: �The teams at Apigee are very smart hyper-focused and really believe in delivering value and best practice to clients.� The concept of customer-centricity (i.e. paying the utmost attention to clients by providing immediate responses and solutions to client requests) became the cornerstone of decision making in the organization. For instance one Apigee client who had a cloud-based application required extra bandwidth in anticipation of increased web traffic for a few days. The Apigee employee who was dealing with the client could have responded in one of three ways: by renegotiating with the client for additional licences; by negotiating internally and acquiring approvals from within the organization to enhance the client�s account; or by responding immediately to the client�s needs by providing the client with the required extra bandwidth and later ratifying this action with the Apigee team leader. The employee chose the third option. RespectRespect both for each other and for autonomy was a deeply valued and cherished philosophy at Apigee. This respect was reflected in Apigee�s flat organizational structure (see Exhibit 2). Highlighting Apigee�s culture of respect an employee remarked �At Apigee there is hardly any hierarchy. All employees can walk up to the CEO anytime to talk about new ideas or about something the employee is not happy with.�Another employee stated �Employees are trusted and empowered to make decisions. We have freedom in doing what we need to do to get the job done. There is no bureaucracy or politics�just a good environment of cross-functional teamwork.� Barriers restrictions and employee checks of any sort were absent at Apigee as were the smart filters used by most IT organizations to block employee access to social networking websites. The lack of restrictions was based on Apigee�s trust that its employees would not compromise either their own work or their clients� work. Employees for the most part responded to the trust invested in them by working sincerely and by involving themselves completely in providing the best experience to clients. One of the biggest manifestations of the freedom autonomy and respect enjoyed by Apigee employees was a two-day program organized by Apigee called �Hackathon.� This program involved inviting application developers from across India to participate in research and collaboration on application development. Apigee employees who volunteered to support the Hackathon were given complete operational freedom to make critical decisions and to carry out those decisions. This approach ultimately increased their sense of commitment and unwavering loyalty toward the organization. Human Resource Practices at APIGEEConsidering Apigee�s unique and unconventional culture it was essential to design human resource practices that supported and enhanced the Apigee�s core values of passion a bias for action and respect. HiringIn the light of Apigee�s culture of granting its employees total freedom and autonomy emotional connection with the organization was critical for the success of both Apigee and its employees. Vishwadeep Anshu the lead for people operations at Apigee remarked �At Apigee�s People-Operations our job is to connect employees emotionally with Apigee.� The culture of Apigee necessitated a rigorous selection process to identify candidates who could blend seamlessly with Apigee�s culture by being able to handle freedom and responsibility in the most productive manner. Most importantly it was essential to hire employees who were motivated to work and could work independently with the highest integrity and with a sense of responsibility and commitment. The hiring process thus was one of Apigee�s most critical human resource activities (see Exhibit 3). Apigee�s hiring process became more crucial as the company embarked on a rapid growth path as even a few �bad hires� could render Apigee�s culture vulnerable thereby jeopardizing the company. Performance ManagementThe majority of Apigee�s employees hailed from large IT companies that used a forced ranking or bell curve for performance management. However at Apigee its biannual performance management system was aimed at collaboration and not competition among employees. Every function had a function head who had overall responsibility for that function and a coach or molecule lead who managed the daily routine operations. For example the coach for the human resources function was based in Bangalore while the function head was the vice-president who was based in San Jose. Grandhi the India lead was the second-level coach for most employees in Bangalore. Working in close coordination the function head set the individual goals while the coach monitored performance on a regular basis. Each employee had three to four individual goals that were reviewed in April and October each year. Bonus decisions were determined by a combination of self-ratings coach ratings and reviews by the function head. The India lead reviewed the ratings of each employee and recommended changes in the coach ratings if any errors were noticed in terms of the stacked ranking.As the company evolved the leadership team introduced performance management via a mobile application that had four or five customized themes for each business function. Using the application the employees entered their goals which the coach reviewed at the start of every month. At the end of the month the employee could perform a self-review which would subsequently be approved by the coach. The use of innovative technology increased not only the objectivity of the performance appraisal but also its frequency by replacing the biannual performance appraisal process with a dynamic system that captured performance in real time. The employees were fully aware of their performance through real-time feedback thereby making performance review meetings redundant. At Apigee employee growth and promotion were not characterized by a change in designation but by increased responsibility. As a flat organization Apigee could not frequently change employees� designations. While growth was not directly linked to performance ratings it was evaluated based on the individual�s potential such that greater responsibility was given to those who were found capable of handling it. Thus it was not surprising to see employees who had spent only two years at Apigee becoming molecule leads because of their demonstrated potential. On one occasion a top performer in the technical support team desired to be shifted to the pre-sales team; however as he had no prior experience in sales he was required to report to an employee who would have been junior to him if a formal hierarchy had been in place. Prabahar a coach at Apigee explained this situation saying �The core of Apigee employee engagement is to enable the employee�s success through an environment of empowerment autonomy self-learning and fearless communication built upon the absence of hierarchy.� As the company did not have rigid formal designations when downward shifts occurred that carried no change in salary structure neither the affected employees nor their peers perceived the movement negatively. Work-Life BalanceApigee encouraged its employees to strive for an ideal work-life balance by offering flexible work hours by giving employees the freedom to work from home and by enabling employees to take vacations with their family. When surveyed on their top reasons for working at Apigee 70 per cent of employees mentioned work-life balance. The organization�s culture of freedom trust and empowerment rendered flextime redundant as employees were bound by the organization�s common beliefs and norms. For instance when employees chose to work from home they would email their relevant colleagues; this action was guided by Apigee�s culture of respect in which colleagues were to be informed of such changes. As Apigee�s culture facilitated collaboration and openness within the organization individual employees did not feel the need to hide information or to make excuses for their absence. Employees were also given the liberty to plan their workday. A formal �meetings culture� was absent at Apigee where few formal meetings were held based on the belief that if a group of employees needed to collaborate on a specific task they would allocate resources and find ways of coordinating with one another. A small percentage of employees misused this freedom; however the effects of their actions were minimal compared with the benefits that the majority reaped from Apigee�s spirit of freedom and empowerment. Compensation and BenefitsAs Apigee hired employees who had prior work experience it offered generous stock options and competitive salaries that were on the higher side of the industry norms. Annual incentives were decided on the basis of an individual�s impact on the job core values that the employee demonstrated for his or her team and the employee�s overall contribution to Apigee�s success. The performance review and impact assessment exercises were done together by coaches and all the team members with their names listed on a board. Each employee was asked to rate other employees in terms of the impact they had created. Self-ratings were taken from every employee. Employees used a high degree of scrutiny for the self-evaluation; in most cases employees� self-ratings were lower than the ratings provided by the team. The rating and impact assessment exercise was fairly exhaustive usually requiring an entire day. Based on their ratings employees were later sorted into impact buckets. Newcomers and long-standing employees were commonly sorted into the same impact bucket. Apigee�s system of rating was criticized when a senior architect with moderate impact was given a lower rating than junior employees on the same team. However the large majority of employees believed that the system was successful in fulfilling the objective of identifying and rewarding top performers. Employees were classified into three categories based on their impact and contribution. The first category of employees who were deemed to be performing below the company�s expectations received both detailed feedback and performance-enhancement coaching. The second category of employees constituted those who met expectations and were rewarded in proportion to the impact they created. The third category constituted performers who created significant impact and were considered to be critical assets; they received stock options. Another important focus of Apigee�s employee-retention strategy was to provide challenging assignments and a supportive work environment.Apigee also made several innovations in the reward system by providing employees with greater equity in experiential events rather than rewarding them only with monetary or materialistic benefits. For example the HR team recorded the wish lists of the employees who won awards in the reward and recognition program. The organization then created customized experiences for the employees based on the top-most item on their wish list: an all expense paid vacation to a holiday resort with family dinner with a spouse at a five-star hotel or a sponsored flight ticket to Singapore. Apigee management believed that personalizing the reward experience led to a stronger and sustained impact for a longer period of time. Self-Managed TeamsKeeping with Apigee�s philosophy of driving innovation via a bottom-up approach the organization formed several small teams called molecules and used various IT integration tools to manage team goals and facilitate collaboration among employees without compromising Apigee�s unique culture. Such small agile teams were self-managed and an effort was made to synergize each member�s contribution to attain the overall objective of forming the team. The molecule leads were empowered. Grandhi said �We clearly defined �what� we expect a molecule lead to accomplish leaving the �how� to him or her� (see Exhibit 4). The molecule leads were also encouraged to experiment with people management practices within their respective teams. For instance the molecule leads and their teams had the freedom to decide their arrival time at the office. Any deviations would be dealt with in a manner decided by the team and the molecule leads were also in no way exempt from the norms set for the entire team. All teams at Apigee were encouraged to create their own norms and most team norms centred on �empowerment� and �innovation.� Other HR PracticesApigee�s people management strategy was characterized by several unique practices. The office which was designed in bright colours to enhance the overall energy level had an open-plan layout without any cubicles and with the desks laid out in a large hall. Grandhi had his desk in a corner of the office. This open workspace policy reduced office gossip and politicking and offered easy accessibility to all employees. However this floor plan required hiring employees who had sufficient maturity to respect each other�s work and avoid the temptation of snooping on someone else�s work. Apigee did not have a formal meeting room as the company did not have a culture of meetings. However several groups that worked together on matters of mutual interest were provided spaces for discussions. Also Apigee did not have a formal leave policy. Unlike the conventional leave policy of 30 days annually Apigee employees were free to take leave whenever they felt the need to do so and they kept their colleagues informed of their plans. Even in the absence of any restrictions on leaves the average number of leave days taken by each employee was well below the standard 30 days per year. Likewise the company did not have a travel approval policy. When employees travelled for work they discussed their travel plans with the molecule lead. After the travel was completed all employee travel expense claims were reimbursed without question after the submission of the relevant bills. In eight years of operation only one travel expense claim was rejected as the bill was not produced. The Road aheadApigee�s unique DNA with regard to its HR practices had several positive outcomes such as enhanced productivity lower attrition and better collaboration that resulted in organizational effectiveness. Apigee�s culture of empowerment and freedom enabled it to partner with several large and influential clients including the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Adobe. Apigee had undoubtedly created much goodwill among application developers who constituted another vital stakeholder group and played a major role in contributing to the success of the organization. However as Apigee was poised to take the big leap to become the leading provider of cutting-edge digital transformation technology across the globe Grandhi felt that Apigee�s existing culture was fraught with risk. He anticipated that Apigee�s culture of excessive freedom and empowerment could lead to lower productivity or subpar organizational results. After all a culture that lacked monitoring could make it easier for employees to set lower benchmarks and to indulge in loafing. Grandhi and his senior team had invested much time and effort to build the unique culture at Apigee which assumed that employees had both the maturity and the capability to handle autonomy. Grandhi wondered: Can Apigee�s culture thrive even when the organization grows? Would moving too fast lead to a breakdown of Apigee�s culture? Was it possible to embed Apigee�s culture into people�s consciousness through the use of institutional processes? Or would such an effort betray Apigee�s culture of autonomy and freedom? Would the leadership team be able to install processes without entering into the bureaucracy quagmire? How could Apigee guard against complacency? In light of Apigee�s ambitious growth plan Grandhi realized the importance of seeking answers to such crucial questions.Exhibit 1: apigee�s Competitors in the Application Programming Interface IndustryNote: SLA=service level agreementSource: Compiled by the case authors from the following sources: Alex Williams �Mashery Is Selling to Intel for More Than $180M� Techcrunch April 17 2013 accessed April 1 2016 https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/source-mashery-is-selling-to-intel-for-more-than-180m/; Alex Williams �CA Acquires Layer 7 Technologies to Connect Cloud Mobile and Internet of Things as API Market Starts to Consolidate� Techcrunch April 22 2013 accessed April 1 2016 https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/22/ca-acquires-layer-7-technologies-to-connect-cloud-mobile-and-internet-of-things-as-api-market-starts-to-consolidate/; Alex Williams �Microsoft Acquires Apiphany An API Management Service to Integrate with Windows Azure� Techcrunch October 23 2013 accessed April 1 2016https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/23/microsoft-acquires-apiphany-an-api-management-service-to-integrate-with-windows-azure/; �Mashape� accessed April 1 2016  www.mashape.com.Exhibit 2: Apigee�s Organizational Structure Notes: SR = senior; HR = Human resourcesSource: Company documents.Exhibit 3: Hiring Process at Apigee--Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 4: Questions for consideration by the Molecule leadsSource: Compiled by the case authors.

From 2009 to 2012 the company�s employee head count quickly grew from several thousand to nearly 30000. It was still short of some needed talent but management considered the human resources (HR) department�s role and business impact as insignificant. JD.com�s founder and chief executive officer Qiangdong Liu realized however that he had to strengthen the company�s internal management in order to sustain its rapid growth. In 2011 and 2012 he recruited several chief officers (COs) in the areas of operations technology and marketing (see Exhibit 1). Liu also persuaded Yu Long who had been pursuing a profession as legal counsel in foreign multinational companies (MNCs) to join JD.com as its chief human resources officer (CHO) and general counsel in August 2012. Without prior HR experience Long faced the challenges of bridging the company�s wide talent gap and establishing a sound HR management system. As a new CHO from outside who had to quickly build her credibility Long thought about what her priorities should be as she tackled these challenges. growth and workforceJD.com originated in 1998 in Zhongguancun an area in Beijing that was a hub of computer-related products and services. At the age of 25 Liu opened his first agency outlet which sold CD burners. He then expanded his product portfolio to cover a variety of computer peripherals. With a business principle of selling only genuine brand products and offering after-sales services Liu had grown his retail chain to more than a dozen stores by 2003. However due to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic of 2003 sales at physical stores in Beijing dropped. As such Liu turned to e-commerce and launched JD.com in 2004. JD.com soon gained a reputation as the leading e-commerce site for information technology (IT) and digital products. Around 2008 because the profit margin of IT and digital products had shrunk JD.com began to diversify its products and in 2010 the company became an all-category e-commerce retailer. In early 2012 JD.com purchased an online-payment clearing house chinabank.com to acquire the capacity to settle purchase transactions. From 2004 to 2012 JD.com achieved an annual compound growth rate of over 200 per cent and the number of employees also increased rapidly (see Exhibit 2).During these transformations even though his executives had different opinions Liu made several critical decisions that were based on his beliefs and intuitions. For instance in 2004 when the company was considering alternatives for setting up an online store Liu insisted that JD.com invest in its own infrastructure while most of his executives felt that leveraging eBay which was the leading e-commerce platform hosting e-retailers at the time would be an instinctive choice. Later in the same year when Liu was in a late night meeting with his six executives four of them wanted to keep the 12 physical stores which contributed 90 per cent of the company�s total revenues and 95 per cent of its total profits. However Liu saw the importance of focusing on the e-commerce channel and by 3:00 a.m. he had finally convinced the executives to close all the physical stores. Whether or not the company should build its own logistics centre was another of these decisions. Liu strongly believed that in-house logistics were critical to provide prompt and reliable delivery service and to expedite customer payment and track inventory turnover. He aspired to build the most advanced logistics centre in China. The idea was criticized in the local media as a move akin to �burning cash� but Liu was able to persuade investors to finance the construction of the company�s �Asia No. 1� warehouse. JD.com received four private equity investments in 2007 (US$10 million) 2009 ($21 million) 2010 ($150 million) and 2011 ($1.5 billion). JD.com�s warehouse and delivery staff accounted for the majority of its total head count (see Exhibit 2). Although the company�s warehouse and delivery workforce was smaller than those of many courier companies it was nevertheless competitive among the two types of e-commerce retailers. The first type was made up of traditional physical store chains that also tapped into e-commerce channels such as home appliances market leaders GOME and Suning who had established their own delivery logistics with varying levels of speed and reliability. The other type were �born online� shops that had not built their own full-scale logistics. For instance JD.com�s key rival Yhd.com outsourced some of its deliveries. Liu was highly concerned about customer experience and therefore prioritized functions such as warehouse sorting product packaging and order delivery. He often personally experienced the logistics operations to understand the front-line staff�s working conditions. Even though the skill level of these workers was relatively low JD.com offered above-industry-average compensation and benefits. For instance unlike many courier companies JD.com insisted on signing a formal contract with every delivery worker and bearing their social security costs. While the delivery workers of other companies usually received negative customer feedback and had high turnover rates due to low pay long hours and heavy workloads JD.com�s delivery employees generated customer satisfaction. HR Management Before 2012Until July 2007 the company did not have a human resources department; only two employees used part of their time to handle basic HR tasks. By the end of 2009 JD.com�s HR department grew to eight staff. In 2010 JD.com commissioned an HR consulting firm to look into improving the company�s HR practices. However at the end of the two-year contract JD.com�s head count had almost quadrupled which led Liu to call for reviews of and adjustments to the consultancy�s recommendations. Recruitment JD.com�s HR department shouldered a heavy workload for recruiting two groups of employees� warehouse and delivery staff and e-commerce management talent. Although the emerging e-commerce sector had attracted and developed more and more management talent the sector�s evolution made the talent shortage persist. For instance when online stores added product categories and other services they also demanded versatile talent with leadership potential and specific competencies. Consequently the rapidly growing JD.com found it difficult to recruit the ideal candidates. Training and DevelopmentGeneral Staff There were some training programs for basic skills but not for competencies specific to various job categories.Management TeamThe company�s internal management had not geared up enough to match its rapid growth in both scale and complexity. Under the pressure of achieving high business performance JD.com�s long-serving managers focused on immediate results rather than on the company�s overall long-term outlook. Moreover they had been so occupied with results that they were not able to devote time and energy to sharpening their own leadership skills or acquiring competencies required by the new e-commerce business. Although Liu recognized this problem he too did not have spare energy to think seriously about how to build a systematic talent �pipeline.� Nevertheless in 2007 the company attempted to address this issue by recruiting two management trainees. Liu spent time talking with them and watching their progress and in the following five years JD.com continued to recruit a few management trainees every year. HR Information System In 2010 when the company had about 7000 employees with 700 job positions the HR managers had not yet implemented an HR enterprise resource planning system; instead they were using Microsoft Excel to calculate and record salary payment. The company eventually installed new software for this purpose but the software reached its limit as the number of employees continued to grow. Employee Care Program Although an employee care program existed resources for it were limited and it had not incorporated any company-specific features. The company also maintained a standard benefits package but did not customize it for different job ranks or categories.Compensation Structure Warehouse and Delivery Staff The company allowed managers in different cities to decide the salary for local delivery employees and did not centrally factor cross-city differences in costs of living into its nationwide compensation structure. Management TeamRemuneration of long-serving managers and executives at JD.com was below the average market rate. In the start-up stage the company was unable to offer high salaries but gave out bonuses when performance was exceptional. JD.com was still able to attract management talent who saw the growth potential of the e-commerce sector and the company; some were even willing to lower their salaries to join. More recently as more and more newcomers arrived their salaries usually at market rate sometimes surpassed those of their supervisors. For high-demand talent such as those hunted from the financial industry the problem of �reversed supervisor�subordinate pay level� was even more common and serious. One senior manager commented �These long-serving managers were actually very capable and had grown with the company. Although the company regularly raised their salaries such increases did not catch up with the market rate.� Another senior manager noted �The company has not yet had a job ranking scheme to guide whether a newcomer should join as a manager or director. The decision is often subjective.� Furthermore these newcomers might not be perfect candidates and they often needed time to adapt to the company and figure out how to deal with its increasingly complex business issues. This led to a morale-hurting perception of unfairness among underpaid long-serving supervisors. A senior manager complained �If my subordinates were better paid than me they should be more competent and bring more value to the company than me.�Performance Evaluation and Incentive Schemes To stimulate growth in 2010 the company began to conduct performance reviews every month. Such frequency was much higher than the industry average. At that time some managers did not do an objective performance evaluation�as they mistakenly thought that the purpose of the reviews was to calculate and pay out bonuses to balance salary differences among employees. These reviews were also not linked to benefits training or promotions. High performers therefore complained that the evaluation outcomes were not fair that their contribution was not recognized and that there was favouritism. Corporate Culture and Values The company trained all newcomers to respect its values. Liu also repeatedly stressed at meetings that JD.com would not allow anyone with opposing values to stay even if they delivered outstanding performance. Nevertheless as these newcomers joined they brought in additional values and cultural elements as well as their associated work styles. When the company was smaller the staff behaved according to the existing corporate values (through chanting slogans together initiating communications with employees and so on) because of Liu�s personal influence. But as the company grew it had not considered how to articulate Liu�s values and translate them into employee behaviours. Facing influential new executives JD.com�s founding executives were concerned about the possible dilution of the company�s original values especially if Liu would be less and less in touch with every manager or employee in the future. Top management teamLiu�s Leadership StyleWhen Liu was leading his founding executives to overcome countless hurdles during the start-up stage he always required his team to fully execute his ideas. As the company grew Liu still required his team to quickly fulfill his special requests. Being very diligent Liu presided over nearly every morning meeting with dozens of executives listened to their business reports and made plans accordingly. When his executives did not instantly understand his visionary ideas Liu�being straightforward�sometimes harshly criticized these executives making them feel anxious and embarrassed. Clashes between Long-Serving and Newcomer Executives After hiring from outside Liu had over 20 executives directly reporting to him. In 2011 JD.com added a new layer of COs�highly qualified candidates from renowned local companies and foreign MNCs. These COs reported to Liu while the other executives reported to the COs of their respective functions. These newcomer executives did not necessarily believe in many of the original management practices of the company. Some chose to resign while others were determined to change these practices which created tensions with the long-serving executives. Some of the founding executives also chose to quit because they worried about the increasing pressure from the company�s rapid evolution and the subsequent loss of Liu� confidence in them. Challenges Facing LongLong and Liu were classmates of an executive (UTStarcom) program in business school. Because of their different career backgrounds�one worked for a US-listed MNC and the other founded a local company�they stayed with their respective communities and did not interact much. Liu was determined to hire Long because of her work experience and English proficiency. Although Liu was taciturn at school he had now approached Long four times within seven months. Being impressed by Liu�s sincerity Long decided to join JD.com. UTStarcom�s board chairman tried to make her stay explaining that heading JD.com�s human resources department was not a wise choice: First the drastic change from legal counsel to a CHO would be risky. Second JD.com had become infamous for its high turnover of executives. However Long started to feel that at UTStarcom she was as �little as a screw in a large corporate machine.� She commented �In an MNC you only need to do the job well and follow its rhythm. But in a local private company there are far more development opportunities.� Long was attracted to the immense potential of JD.com thinking that it would give her the stage to realize her career goals. Moreover because she was outgoing and communicative she was eager to experience the people-oriented nature of HR. In fact even though JD.com was losing over �1 billion in 2012 and was rumoured to be running out of capital the company continued to develop its business. Although Long was not sure about the outcome she was thrilled by the huge challenges facing her�something she described as like changing the tires of a racing car on a high-speed track. When Long joined JD.com in August 2012 as its third HR department head the department had never had a strong voice in the company even though it had grown to employ 280 people. Long was clear that the accumulated HR problems were interrelated and that the HR department needed a thoroughly thought-out plan for reform. Not only did she have to shape her working relationship with Liu and her role among the COs but she also needed to gain the employees� acceptance of the planned reforms. More importantly because the foreseeable growth of the company would involve the incubation of new businesses the HR reforms should adapt to the evolution of the company�s organizational structure and capabilities. Without previous experiences in HR management Long was thinking about how to proceed.Exhibit 1_JD.com�s CHIEF EXECUTIVES in 2012 		CFO = chief financial officer; COO = chief operating officer; CTO = chief technology officer; CMO = chief marketing officer; CHO = chief human resources officer.Source: Company information.Exhibit 2_JD.com�s Head CountSource: Company information.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-03-11Ami Shroff (Ami) looked around the exhibition venue in Mumbai with satisfaction; 2020 had begun on a good note for Shrujan Trust (Shrujan) the not-for-profit craft organization that Ami managed. The organization had just concluded its 200th exhibition on January 15th the birthday of Amiâs late mother Chanda Shroff who had started Shrujan 50 years earlier. This exhibition had been one of Shrujanâs most successful: they had sold all of their products and at least 15 customers had paid advances for personalized orders.Exhibitions played an important role in Shrujanâs growth but that could change if Ami were to seriously consider a proposal her niece Alia Shroff (Alia) had made just a few days earlier. In an internal meeting Alia a budding fashion designer had proposed ambitious plans to increase Shrujanâs domestic and global presence. Her proposal would require upfront investments of â¹10 million with a projected revenue of â¹40â50 million over the next two years. Alia wanted to discuss her proposal with Ami and get feedback. Ami had managed to delay the meeting by citing the excuse of preparing for the exhibition. They planned to meet for breakfast on Sunday morning and Ami wanted to be prepared.The global recognition of Indiaâs rich handicraft tradition provided an opportunity for Shrujan to build a bigger market presence for its exclusive and high-quality merchandise. Ami knew this would substantially increase the opportunities for generating revenue for the trust and it would translate into greater earnings for the nearly 3000 craftspeople currently associated with Shrujan. But what would pursuing Aliaâs plan mean for the ethos of Shrujan which prided itself on putting the artisan at the centre of everything? Being a small quality-conscious brand had worked well for Shrujan so far; would growth on the scale proposed by Alia strain the threads that bound Shrujan to its artisan community?Handicraft tradition in IndiaThe Indian handicraft tradition was over 5000 years old dating back to the Indus valley civilization. The handicrafts sector was not just a reflection of the cultural identity of the people who made the crafts but was also an important source of income in the rural and semi-urban areas. The most popular crafts included metal ware earthenware pottery sculpting woodwork hand-printed textiles and scarves embroidered and crocheted goods shawls zari products stone carving and imitation jewellery. The handicrafts sector was one of the largest employment generators with over 6.88 million artisans out of which 3.00 million were male and 3.88 million were female. Most artisans were from economically disadvantaged sections with low levels of education and they tended to be self-employed.The production of Indian handicrafts had been increasing steadily with over 60 per cent of the countryâs production exported (see Exhibit 1). Yet while the handicrafts sector accounted for a significant share in Indiaâs export (see Exhibit 2) the countryâs share in total world handicrafts exports was estimated to be less than 2 per cent. The Indian handicrafts industry was promoted in the global markets by more than 67000 exporters and export houses; the United States Europe the United Arab Emirates Canada and Australia were among the top 10 export destinations (see Exhibit 3).Demand grew both internationally and domestically for handicraft and handloom products and consumer consciousness around organic fair trades practices that created value for marginalized populations increased. However handicraft exports shrank as a share of the countryâs total exports due to the fragmented nature of the value chain and inadequate links to markets and consumers. Further the sectorâs growth was challenged by a scarcity of raw materials poor production facilities limited access to financing and limited marketing capabilities. Despite the governmentâs efforts to address these challenges and efforts by many for-profit and not-for-profit social enterprises that had worked in the sector for many decades the sector continued to be plagued by issues relating to scale and to building sustainable growth models.Indian handicrafts were traditionally sold by retailers (direct sales) or through a network of wholesalers and distributors (see Exhibit 4) which hampered the handicraftsâ market reach. However with the growing popularity and reach of e-commerce through websites like Aporv (no longer active) Craftsvilla Naaptol Fabindia and Mydala the handicrafts industry was looking at e-commerce to increase market access and sales in both domestic and international markets. Adoption of e-retailing was also expected to improve margins for the artisans by eliminating intermediaries and providing both business-to-business and business-to-consumer opportunities.Kachchh (Kutch) Province Gujarat IndiaKachchh (Kutch) district was in the northwest part of the state of Gujarat on Indiaâs western coast. The province was a largely barren and harsh desert landscape spanning more than 45000 square kilometres with a population of over 2 million people. Because it was a border district many nomadic and semi-nomadic communities from various countries had over centuries made Kutch their home. Craft especially embroidery was inextricable from the culture of the communities with each community continuing to keep distinctions in style stitches patterns and colours and the rules for using them. Many of the handicrafts especially embroidered items were made by the artisans for themselves and their families for marriage and other social obligations; they were never meant for sale as commercial products. Some of the most skilled artisans renowned for their embroideries included people from the communities of Jat Aahir Rabari Mutwa Meghwals Sodha and Jadeja.The Kutch region was known for its arid and inhospitable climate: it experienced drought nearly every three to four years. On January 26 2001 the region was rocked by a massive earthquake (6.9 on the Richter scale) which killed over 20000 people left hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed or damaged more than a million buildings. The earthquake came at a time when the region was already experiencing a severe three-year drought thus creating serious water shortage and livelihood problems. However with US$1.8 billion in aid and donations from both domestic and international sources and focused government projects the region bounced back and transformed from an agrarian to a manufacturing- and services-focused economy. Non-government organizations (NGOs) were actively involved in the rehabilitation of the region and helped build an international focus on the local arts and crafts as a means of raising funds.The Gujarat State Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation Ltd. (GSHHDC) an undertaking of the Government of Gujarat handled the development and marketing of handicrafts and handlooms from Gujarat through its chain of Garvi Gurjari emporia. GSHHDC also regularly organized exhibitions for selling and creating awareness of handloom and handicrafts products among prospective buyers. Many NGOs such as Shrujan Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan Kala Raksha and Khamir were also active in this space offering support to the artisans in terms of design product development and marketing (see Exhibit 5). Many of the NGOs had set up their own stores or brand labels to sell the handicrafts in domestic and international markets.ShrujanChanda Shroff (Chandaben) was born in 1933 in the village of Mandal and married into the industrialist Shroff family which hailed from the Kutch district. The Shroff family was known in the business community for its philanthropic and charitable activities. In 1969 Chandaben travelled from Mumbai to Kutch which was then suffering from prolonged drought as part of the Ramakrishna Missionâs relief work. In one village the volunteers found that the women of the village (who belonged to the Ahir and Meghwad Gujjar communities) were not comfortable accepting the relief material considering it to be charity and asked for work instead.Chandaben had noticed the beautiful embroideries on the villagersâ clothes and decided to use that to accede to the villagersâ request for income. Ami Shroff told the story:My mother bought 30 plain saris in Mumbai took them back to the village and commissioned the women to work on them. The women were paid â¹300 per sari on acceptance of the commission. It took the women about five months to complete the embroidery. On completion my mother organized an exhibition of the saris in Mumbai. Each sari was priced at â¹1000 with an average margin of about â¹150 per sari. All the saris sold out within a day raising â¹30000. More hearteningly there were many requests for more such saris. The positive feedback from the exhibition and the demand for similar products lead to the birth of Shrujan (meaning creativity in Sanskrit). All the money raised from the first exhibition was used to buy raw material for a fresh batch and that is how Shrujan started building connection with the artisan community.Initially conceptualized as a one-time drought-relief project the initiative received was overwhelming response. Ami saidMy mother was surprised by the response of the women. As word spread about how we were helping women to make money from the skills that had been passed down for generations we started getting enquiries from different parts of Kutch asking for help. From just 30 women in 1969 today we have over 3000 members across over 100 villages.Shrujan was registered as a not-for-profit charitable trust in 1983 with â¹5000 as initial capital. In 2007 the brand Shrujan was trademarked. The organization employed 65 people: four in Mumbai and 61 in Bhuj the capital of Kutch (see Exhibit 6). The Bhuj office coordinated all the activities of the trust which included production planning (see Exhibit 7) liaising with craftspeople preparing production kits and managing the logistics at the village level (dropping off production kits and picking up the finished products). The Mumbai office handled sales and marketing and liaised with the designers and tailoring units.The key responsibility of the Bhuj office was to ensure that the core group of artisans had regular work while the Mumbai office focused on staying in touch with both retail and corporate customers. Ami shared âOur primary focus is always the artisan. We do not provide work based on the orders received. Instead we focus on selling the work of the artisans. This ensures that we are not driven by commercial pressures.âShrujan prioritized 15 products while preparing the production based on customer feedback and past sales (see Exhibit 8). These products were sold through exhibitions and Shrujanâs own stores in Mumbai and Ahmedabad at the Bhuj airport and at the organizationâs headquarters in Bhuj. In addition Shrujan occasionally partnered with a few exclusive online and offline lifestyle stores for pop-up stores or shop-in-shop stores (see Exhibit 9). Shrujanâs product margins ranged from 15 to 45 per cent across various product categories.The organizationâs artisan base included women who in addition to their regular normal household responsibilities contributed to the household income through various activities such as animal husbandry and goat rearing. Ami explainedWe distribute work to the women depending on how many hours per day and the number of days they can work. We get requests for more work during times of drought as agricultural incomes go down or when there is an occasion like a wedding when the family expenses increase. The women work on the products during their spare time which is usually between four and six hours per day. Some of our artisans work with other organizations too but the artisans tell us that it is easier for them to associate with other organizations or get financial aid from banks or NGOs if the artisans mention that they are Shrujan karigar [workers].Shrujanâs craftspeople worked from home. The production team ensured that the fabrics and threads were delivered to the craftspeople at their doorsteps. The women did not have to pay for the materials and they were paid for their work as soon as they completed the embroidery. Shrujan found that on average its craftspeople worked about 18 to 20 days a month and the most skilled artisans earned â¹220 per day. Payment to artisans was based on skill and mastery over their craft with the most skilled artisans making at least â¹60000 per year. The least skilled artisans earned between â¹15000 and 20000 a year and the moderately skilled artisans could earn between â¹20000 and 50000 a year.Once the embroidered textiles were received back at the Bhuj office they were fashioned by Shrujanâs in-house design team and its tailoring team (a mix of in-house and outsourced local tailors) into apparel accessories and lifestyle products and then sold through Shrujanâs shops and exhibitions. Shrujan used the generated revenue to buy more raw material and to train artisans so that their income could be protected. Working capital requirements and financial deficits were met by a bank overdraft (see Exhibit 10).Proposal for Growth: Aliaâs VisionShrujanâs management team consisted of Ami Saket Bakshi (marketing) Sakshi Mathur (store supervisor) Dinesh Shah (head of production) Sulo Gujjar (artisan coordinator) Dipesh Shroff (Amiâs brother and the organizationâs financial adviser) and Hetal Thakker (design consultant). The team met every quarter to review performance.Alia who was Dipeshâs daughter grew up with Shrujan having spent summers in Bhuj with her family and having travelled with the Shrujan team to the villages. She had graduated in 2016 with a degree in fashion design from the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York City interned for a year with a leading design house in New York and then worked for one year with a well-known Indian designer before joining Shrujan as an employee. Since January 2019 Alia had been working closely with the design and production teams based out of Bhuj.On January 10 2020 Alia made a presentation to the management team in their quarterly meeting. She had been working on a proposal for three months and was excited to share her ideas with the management team. Her proposal was to take the Shrujan brand global and to strengthen the brandâs domestic presence.Take the Shrujan Brand GlobalTwo popular designers from the United Kingdom and Australia had approached Alia for partnership opportunities. These designers had their own stores in London and Manchester and in Sydney and Melbourne and they occasionally opened pop-up stores in leading high-end department stores. They wanted to build an India-centric fashion line to target the affluent Indian community in their cities.Both designers had bought Shrujan pieces from exhibitions and they were keen to engage on a professional basis. They proposed building a long-term relationship with Shrujan starting with home furnishings like cushion covers wall hangings and table linens and after that extending to apparel. However these designers operated on tightly defined production plans and were keen to implement these plans in their collaboration with Shrujan.As well a leading home furnishings chain based in the Netherlands had expressed interest in carrying an India-themed furnishings pop-up and it wanted to collaborate with Shrujan for the chainâs spring/summer line for 2021. The chain had 10 stores across the Netherlands and wanted to know if Shrujan could work on a line of embroidered window decorations (curtains and blinds). The opportunity would allow Shrujan to build expertise in working with fabrics like jacquard and organzaâexpertise Shrujan did not have.Strengthen Domestic PresenceAlia proposed increasing the number of Shrujanâs physical stores having Shrujan-owned and managed stores in 10 Indian cities within two years and having a total of 20 stores by the third year. These stores would carry the complete range of Shrujan products and would be positioned as high-end shopping venues with an exclusive product range. Alia also proposed tying up with two upcoming fashion designers to develop the merchandise for Shrujanâs stores.The organization could also collaborate with leading interior decorators to provide home furnishings for high-end dwellings. The wife of a leading Bollywood actor had used a Shrujan wall panel in her dining room and it had drawn a lot of attention when the house was featured in an international lifestyle magazine. The interior decorator on the project had expressed a desire to have at least 20 distinctive wall pieces from Shrujan over the next two years. Each piece would be priced at a minimum of â¹1 million.Alia had also been contacted by a prominent Indian fashion designer who wanted exclusive embroidery pieces for the designerâs label. The implicit understanding was that fashion accessories would be the next step.Both of Aliaâs proposals would generate more work for the artisans and add at least â¹40 million to Shrujanâs revenues on a conservative basis. However the proposals also required Shrujan to completely change its approach to operations. Investments would have to be made in training artisans recruiting staff managing inventory and expanding tailoring units and warehouses. Alia expected that Shrujan would have to make an initial capital investment of approximately â¹10 million over the next 15 months; incremental recurring expenses would be around â¹22 million. Shrujan would also need to increase its long- and short-term borrowings to fund its growth plans (see Exhibit 11).At the end of Aliaâs presentation. Ami could feel all eyes in the room turn to her to gauge her reaction to the presentation. Ami was gathering her thoughts just as her phone rang with an emergency call from the Bhuj office. She excused herself from the meeting but knew that it was a temporary reprieve. Alia had already scheduled a breakfast meeting with Ami for the coming Sunday to discuss the proposal. Alia want Amiâs thoughts.Ami had always believed that Shrujan was a movement not an enterprise. It had always worked with the aim of helping craftspeople become financially independent by using their traditional crafts. Profits or income had never figured in Shrujanâs planning. However Ami realized that Alia had a valid point in wanting to build a better market presence for Shrujan. Could Shrujan become more commercial without compromising its values? Would Shrujanâs craftspeople support the growth plans? Would the organization still remain a social enterprise if it implemented Aliaâs plans? Ami knew she needed some answers before meeting Alia on Sunday.Exhibit 1: Production and export of handicrafts (in â¹ Billions)Source: Ministry of Textiles Government of India Annual Report 2018â19 204 accessed July 20 2020 http://texmin.nic.in/sites/default/files/Textiles-AnnualReport2018-2019%28English%29.pdf.Exhibit 2: Export of handicrafts (excluding carpets) (in â¹ billions)Source: Adapted from âExports of Handicraftsâ Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts accessed May 2 2020 www.epch.in/policies/exportsofhandicrafts.htm.Exhibit 3: share of Indian handicraft exports by Country FiscaL YEAR 2019â20Note: UAE = United Arab Emirates; UK = United Kingdom; and USA = United States of America.Source: âShare of Exports of Handicrafts in Major Countries/Regionsâ Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts accessed May 2 2020 www.epch.in/policies/exportsofhandicrafts.htm.Exhibit 4a: Value chain of the handicrafts sectorNote: HHEC = Handicrafts and Handloom Exports Corporation of India.Source: Adapted from KPMG Human Resources and Skill Requirements in the Handlooms and Handicrafts Sector (2013â17 2017â22) (Government of India Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship n.d.) 34 accessed May 2 2020 https://nsdcindia.org/sites/default/files/Handlooms-Handicrafts.pdf.Exhibit 4b: Role of stakeholders in the handicrafts value chainSource: Created by case author based on data from Dasra and the Edmond de Rothschild Foundations Crafting a Livelihood: Building Sustainability for Indian Artisans 8â12 2013 www.dasra.org/assets/uploads/resources/Crafting%20a%20Livelihood%20-%20Building%20Sustainability%20for%20Indian%20Artisans.pdf.Exhibit 5: Select prominent social enterprises focused on handicrafts of the KutchQasab Co.

She was now gearing up for what she knew was the hard part�executing the strategy and managing the transition for the employees. This involved coordinating many parts which would soon begin to move simultaneously.The consultancy firm had suggested a three-fold strategy for TVO: to become the provincial government�s digital education partner; to increase citizen engagement; and to empower employees. There was some debate about whether revenue enhancement should be an independent objective in its own right but the common view that it was embedded into each strategic goal prevailed.The second pillar�citizen engagement�also represented a continuing content refocus. The new direction was to make current affairs journalism the priority and drive documentary through that lens.A few weeks earlier de Wilde had been reviewing the organization structure of TVO as part of ensuring that it had a fit with the strategy (see case A Exhibit 4). She had also been testing TVO�s new strategic direction in her conversations with people in the education ecosystem. During one conversation de Wilde had a sudden realization. TVO did not have a professional educator on its executive team a person with deep expertise and experience in pedagogy and curriculum. It became evident that getting a hands-on educator aboard was a definite way for TVO to build credibility with the educator community in the province in its bid to move into the classrooms with a focus on digital content. Days later while listening to a presentation by a former school principal at an event to which she had been invited de Wilde found the ideal person. She met with the speaker who was then working as the coordinating superintendent of strategy and program planning at the Toronto District School Board. Both agreed to meet for lunch the next day when de Wilde appointed the educator on a consulting capacity. Eventually the educator assumed a new role at TVO heading a new division called digital education.TVO had 350 employees of whom 104 were non-unionized. The 206 technicians developers and administrative employees were part of Unifor the largest private sector union in Canada. The remaining 39 producers and content creators were part of the Canadian Media Guild. Internal promotions were a common occurrence at TVO. A recruitment of senior level employees in January 2014 was the cause of some concern among the company�s rank and file but more recruitment was expected. Organizationally TVO was structured as a media company. All broadcast and media functions were grouped under content and programming (e.g. TVOKids current affairs documentaries prime time programming and websites). All educational services were grouped under the Independent Learning Centre (ILC) which also administered Homework Help. Culturally the two areas operated as two very distinct business units. The leader of content and programming was a seasoned producer and the leader of the ILC unit had an operational pedigree. The restructuring brought all of the content activities together under two divisions: digital education (ILC Homework Help and TVOKids); and current affairs and documentaries (current affairs documentaries and prime time programming). Both divisions were now led by new vice-presidents not chosen from within the ranks (see Exhibit 1). The vice-president (VP) of current affairs and documentaries was an experienced journalist from the Toronto Star. The result was that nearly 200 people at TVO from the two operational streams had a new boss as of the day the two VP appointments became effective. Many of the employees had not worked together before�many of them did not even known each other. The reactions varied from surprise (�Are you kidding me?�) to despair (�Why are they doing this to me? They are deprioritizing us.�). The organization was also grappling with the impact of digital technology on people�s job descriptions. This led to grievances that were eventually filed with the Ontario Labour Relations Board. Under the new rules a TVO journalist could post on Twitter and take photographs to upload online. Previously however employees could not take photographs and certainly could not post them on Twitter without TVO�s approval. Clearly de Wilde and her team needed to resolve the organization�s labour strategy while moving forward on TVO�s business strategy. A strong pride in the organization had always been a factor that brought the employees together. The result of these technological advances was a lot of disquiet at TVO. Nevertheless de Wilde continued to move quickly. She recruited additional leaders at the VP director and manager levels. Her executive team had been working on putting in place a product management structure. It was meant to be used as a tool to help make decisions on how resources should be allocated (see Exhibit 2). It would also ensure that the planning forecasting production and marketing of various products and services were managed across all stages of product lifecycle (i.e. pre-development development introduction/launch growth maturity decline and end-of-life). In 2014 TVO also received a major bequest of $2.4 million from the estate of Donald Pounder which helped fund new initiatives.In September 2014 de Wilde approved the development of two new products: mPower and TeachOntario. mPowerThis new product was being conceptualized as a game-based resource engaging math students from kindergarten to grade 6. It would be designed in collaboration with math teachers from different school boards in Ontario software developers and game designers some of the latter drawn from TVOKids. The team would take apart the math curriculum and make math learning fun and innovative for students in a bid to ignite in them a spark of love for math. According to de Wilde math specialists were key to the program:Math specialists from different schools were asked: Take apart the math curriculum. Tell us where the kids are stumbling and struggling. Help us build the outline of what the games should do. Design it in collaboration with teachers to work inside the classroom including a robust student assessment component aligned with the game play.The new math program mPower would be easy to install on a laptop or an iPad. It would have provision for a student community gallery (for exchanging views online) and teacher dashboard (for tracking progress). The program would be free for users and would leverage TVO�s expertise at the intersection of curriculum evidence-based pedagogy and digital media�the three pieces that would form TVO�s secret recipe.The executive team was clear that mPower would be developed without any of the baggage of TVO�s past. The product development team would be fluid have a physical space of its own and make its own rules as it went along. TVO�s mPower would mark the beginning of two transformational trends. First it would break down silos and make the organization more receptive to new ideas and less hierarchical where operating in a collaborative cross-functional way would become the norm. It would make TVO more relevant to current needs and more resilient. Second the designated team would deliver in short sprints. It would not wait until the product was perfect and complete. It would simply put it out there and make mid-course corrections as it went along. The approach was meant to foster a sense among employees that it was okay while working on a product or a problem if the team did not get it right the first time. The message was that falling and failing were acceptable if moving along the right direction. All necessary financial resources for the new program were arranged by de Wilde as she explained:The way we developed mPower has changed the way we behave with those we serve. The old-fashioned broadcasters would say: �We know what is good for you; here take it and run.� We would think: �This is what works. Let us go out and test it. Let us get feedback. Let us see what the kids think and what the teachers say. Then let us come back here and retool the program put it out again and continue to fine-tune it.�  TeachOntario This second new program would be an online platform created by TVO in partnership with the Ontario Teachers� Federation its affiliates and the ministry of education in consultation with teachers from across the province. It was meant to promote sharing co-operation and knowledge exchange among educators in Ontario. The goal was to create an online community where teachers could share best practices. It would be like a Facebook Inc. platform for educators.  TVO�s objective in developing this platform was to reframe the relationship it had as an organization with the educational community. Incorporating the voice of teachers would bring credibility to TVO�s ongoing initiatives to transform itself. The company would soon be hiring teachers to talk to teachers about TVO�s projects. It would also be hiring a community manager to oversee its activities. It would be building TeachOntario from ground up.An important finding of the consultants was that there was a high degree of goodwill among employees for TVO and its mandate. The middle and lower level employees were not only seeking an articulation of a clear growth strategy they were also eager to be involved in its implementation. Some had expressed frustration with their level of involvement with high-level decision making. Some had reservations about the limited encouragement provided to their initiatives. However de Wilde encouraged risk-taking as a strategy for success as she explained:When a company does lots of things simultaneously something�s bound to go sideways. I need to convey a message: If things are not going sideways we are not trying hard enough; we are being too cautious. No heads will roll if something does not work as planned. Let us find out why. Let us try something new and different. Falling and failing are perfectly in order if we are all moving along the right direction. Risk taking is good behaviour. You can�t get everything right and perfect the first time. Just keep moving. When conveyed with clarity and sincerity it works like magic.Exhibit 1: TVO Chief Executive Officer�S DIRECT REPORTS SEPTEMBER 2013Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: PRODUCT PORTFOLIO PRIORITIZATIONSource: Company documents.

Multistrada Agro International (Multistrada Agro) an Indonesian industrial forestry firm sat in her Jakarta office listening reluctantly to her estate manager who had called her from East Kalimantan province. In a panic he reported that �rude people� had entered the company premises accompanied by armed security guards and were looking for her. He sounded scared and asked for instructions. The underlying problem was a local land conflict pitting powerful local interests against each other. Antono knew that unless she managed to work with local stakeholders she would never be able to successfully operate large-scale rubber plantations. How should she handle this latest personal threat? What tactics could she use to deal with a variety of stakeholders with divergent interests?backgroundPT. Multistrada Arah Sarana Tbk (MASA) established in 1988 was Indonesia�s second-largest tire manufacturer (see Exhibit 1). The company was listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2005 and experienced rapid growth thereafter. It manufactured car and motorcycle tires for both domestic and export markets. MASA was among the top tire manufacturing companies in Indonesia. One of the main operational risks identified by MASA�s directors was the availability of raw material so in 2011 PT. Multistrada Agro International was established as a subsidiary to develop rubber plantations. Kartika Antono a seasoned executive with experience in both plantations and automotive businesses was recruited to manage the new business (see Exhibit 2). Under her guidance the company acquired licences to plant 128000 hectares with rubber and was aiming for a total of 500000 hectares under the industrial forestry scheme mostly in remote Indonesian provinces.Rubber was traditionally an important crop in much of Southeast Asia including in Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia. About 70 per cent of the world�s natural rubber production was used for tires. Experts estimated that 85 per cent of rubber production in Indonesia once came from independent smallholders. The volatile price of rubber drove many farmers away from growing the crop disrupting the supply for tire companies; this prompted some tire manufacturers to invest in large-scale rubber plantations with employees rather than relying on independent farmers.All large-scale plantations in Indonesia faced common problems: discrepancies between regulations of the central and local governments; lack of enforcement and limited protection of property rights; and a host of formal and informal powerful groups with divergent interests at both the local and provincial levels not all of which used legal or professional means to meet their interests. The arrival of a plantation company often induced or aggravated local conflicts that pitted the different rival sources of power against each other. Consequently most Indonesian plantations were protected by armed guards often the military. However as Antono remarked �The best guards are the villagers if we can educate them well and ensure [their] welfare. The villagers are the fence.�The largest Indonesian plantations were involved in palm oil and pulp and paper. Both sectors came under pressure from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve practices in terms of environmental sustainability and management of local stakeholders. The rubber industry did not witness such development as most rubber (was thus far) produced by smallholders. Multistrada Agro�s rubber plantation in East KalimantanMultistrada Agro acquired permits for industrial forestry from the central government Ministry of Forestry. These permits allowed industrial forestry activities in designated degraded forest areas owned by the government for a period of 60 years with an option to renew for another 30 years. Due to capital restrictions this large area would be planted in stages. The pilot project was a 47000-hectare plot in East Kalimantan. The initial phases�including preparation land clearing and planting�were the most capital intensive and the most prone to conflicts. It took five years for rubber trees to mature and produce the first yield.Antono positioned herself nationally as a pioneer in the forestry area and kept in close contact with the ministry. She became the chief editor of Indonesia�s leading forestry business magazine which carried articles on various types of agroforestry. Furthermore she sat on a council that advised the government on new laws which allowed her to communicate with forestry officials from the ministry on a regular basis. To facilitate this work she had a small showroom and office within the ministry.Although there were officially no inhabitants on the land for which Multistrada Agro had obtained permits in practice about 100 people lived within the boundaries of the area: 3000 lived in surrounding villages on the southern side and another 4000�5000 lived to the north. Most villagers were small-scale farmers who owned poultry or other animals or were (illegal) loggers selling wood from the forest. They were typically poor and had limited education. Access to the land was often achieved by boat because infrastructure was poor.Some villagers (both locals and people from outside the area) claimed to be the rightful owners of the land and invoked �adat law� (customary law) to claim that the forest belonged to their ancestors although they did not have legally valid proof of such claims. Antono stated that many villagers simply did not understand the concept of land ownership adding that �the law is clear but enforcement is another issue.� Those who claimed ancestral land rights sometimes demanded compensation from the company (e.g. in the form of cows motorcycles or money) and these claims were often accompanied by death threats. Antono described the situation as �messy.� One day she was dropped in the forest by a boat skipper who simply disappeared; he had been threatened and fled. Antono eventually managed to secure the help of villagers to get back. With little protection and law enforcement in the area the company needed to find other ways to deal with threats. Surrounding the pilot plot were other plantations mostly palm oil plantations. These were considered �agribusiness� rather than industrial forest and came under a different licensing regime. However Antono had discovered a 3750-hectare Malaysian-owned palm oil plantation inside the 47000 hectares of land for which she had acquired licences. The plantation was operating under a local government licence. In addition the owner had invested in a small airport on the plot that the company occupied.Although Multistrada Agro held licences from the central government the Malaysian palm oil company and its local partner had a licence from the local authorities and the regent (bupati) of the area refused to cancel the palm oil company�s licence. This was a problem because the bupati carried weight in the area and had administrative powers. The palm oil plantation employed some 200 people in the area mostly from one village in which the local authorities were close to the palm oil company and against Multistrada Agro.Regulations required the companies to place signs indicating the boundaries of their land�some 140 kilometres of boundary in Multistrada Agro�s case. Officials from the Ministry of Forestry had come to the area with maps but the local authorities had refused to sign off on parts of the boundary making it impossible for the company to begin planting in the northern part of the plot. Accordingly planting commenced only in the southern part.Plantations required many workers who could be drawn from either the local population or other parts of the country. If the latter option was chosen it was likely to create conflict at the local level. Yet working with the local people was not always easy. Antono trained the villagers extensively in tasks such as filling polybags with rubber seedlings. She commented that productivity was about six times lower than on Indonesia�s main island Java and that the attitude of the people was not always disciplined. Of the 600 local people trained fewer than 400 worked for the company. After scaling up the plantation Antono needed 10000 workers. This made her the largest employer in the area and she needed to recruit labour from outside. As such the company became a major player in the delicate local balance of power.Handling stakeholders at the local levelAntono carefully mapped out the groups at the local level identifying approximately 19 different powerful groups and categorizing them as formal or informal. The formal groups comprised government administration at the provincial and local levels including a regional head (bupati) area head (camat) village heads (kepala desa) and other local power holders (see Exhibit 3); most Indonesian villages had this administrative structure. In addition to government entities the groups included local religious leaders ( who carried substantial weight at the local level) the local police NGOs political parties and vigilante groups. One vigilante group was the notorious Pemuda Pancasila which was feared for its thuggish practices and often hired by other groups to spread threats. Antono had already met with this group in her plantation area. She told the following story. One day I was doing socialization in one village in the north of our land in East Kalimantan. We were on a stage with the army head the police head the head of the village and the village secretary as well as a female consultant. We opened the discussion and suddenly about 20 people came in and they were very rude. I saw they had Pemuda Pancasila attributes. So I took the microphone and said �Thank you for coming Pemuda Pancasila members.� They were confused because they were probably ordered by someone to make the meeting messy and I had changed the scenario. I told them �You are my guest because you defend the Pancasila.� I gave them a challenge to recite the Pancasila and promised a free airplane ticket to Jakarta for the person who could do this but nobody could manage it so I lectured them on our state ideology.The NGOs operating in the area represented another relevant group of players. Antono commented that the indigenous Indonesian people were generally courteous but once outsiders came in such as NGOs with different visions things became messy at the local level. She felt that NGOs in general were a good thing but that many NGOs did not have a clear vision or a good understanding of the regulatory environment as she explained:Some NGOs position themselves as environmentalists but they do not understand key concepts such as the difference between virgin forest and degraded forest. They think no cutting of any tree is allowed anywhere. We follow all regulations we do environmental impact analysis and so on but they still oppose us. I spent a lot of time explaining this to one NGO [representative] until someone said to me �Don�t waste your time he could not even pass high school.� Other NGOs understand but have a different agenda.Antono operated an extensive corporate social responsibility program in the villages around the area to foster understanding and prevent conflicts. She described using a personal approach to appease the villagers: If the father is very rude and says �I threaten your manager burn your boat� I visit them and start talking to their wives [and] children. I find a way to help the family. Someone called me and said �I want to learn English�can you give me a book?� I myself buy the book I write in the book� you have to be able to speak in two years; I use their name. [This challenge] makes me more creative. I have to solve the problem.Antono�s approach was to be humble and ready to talk to all people. This was different from the management of some of the foreign-owned plantations which had trouble proceeding with land clearance because the general managers would not come to the area. Antono in contrast expected all of the top management (herself included) to spend time in the field to explain Multistrada Agro�s vision. She felt that good communication was the most helpful tool to achieve her objectives. Her strategy was very personalized. She mapped all the structures of all the families in the villages including all the family heads. She went to their houses knew how many children they had what their hobbies were their aims in life and their difficulties. According to Antono when she had difficulties with the palm oil plantation on her land her personalized approach made several people stand behind her. However she also remarked that she had to be careful not to owe the villagers anything.The land conflictThe conflict with the Malaysian-owned palm oil company worried Antono. Even though the palm oil plantation was only a small part of the total area for which Multistrada Agro had licences the local bupati appeared to be backing the palm oil plantation. Antono depended on the bupati for various local licences; it became clear that opposition from the bupati hampered her ability to plant and also led to problems with community relations. Although it was not clear where the threats came from Antono felt that the conflict over the land played a role.The Malaysian-owned company naturally took the position that it had received the licence in 2006 and invested heavily in the palm oil plantation and hence should be allowed to operate it. Antono took the case to the Indonesian courts and won at each level up to the Supreme Court. However winning a court case proved to be quite different from actually enforcing the court decision at the local level.As the Malaysian firm lost its case in the courts the owners were aware of the risks and came to Antono with a proposal that involved cash compensation to continue their activities and replacement land or a minority stake in the palm oil plantation. Antono declined their proposals and refused to negotiate. She understood there had been changes in ownership in the palm oil plantation during the conflict. She knew that because of the conflict four of the directors had been placed under a �red� notice from the Indonesian government for breaking the law by planting in the area.Sometime before the incident in which armed �security� threatened the company management and came looking for her Antono decided to pay a visit to the plantation to see the situation for herself. She set off with a group of six motorcyclists and announced herself at the palm oil plantation management office by giving her name card to the security guards. Her team was asked to wait in the bright sun for almost one hour before being allowed entry after which the management changed its mind and her team was told to leave.Despite being treated rudely Antono maintained a friendly posture and conveyed an invitation to the management to meet her. On the way back on the narrow roads the last motorcycle went missing. Antono had to go back to search for the two missing men belonging to her party. The men had been apprehended by security guards who threatened to report her to the police and again she was confronted with aggression. She told the guards they could take her to the local police if they let go of her men but that she would sue them. She eventually was allowed to go but the episode clearly demonstrated how contentious the situation was.Possible strategiesAntono thought about how to handle this situation which had brought so much trouble resulted in death threats and upset the delicate balance in the area by pitting villages against each other. Her careful efforts toward the villagers and other stakeholders had been undermined. She had to give her estate manager an answer but also think about the underlying long-term issues. The following few options were open to her.Option 1: Go to Court Antono felt quite confident from a legal standpoint and she had already won up to the Supreme Court level. What was lacking was a final step that would force the local authorities to comply and give her the land. However taking this last step would cause the bupati to lose face and would place her firmly in the opposing camp. As Antono said �We live in the area (kabupaten); the bupati can make our life difficult.� Every year the bupati had to approve Multistrada Agro�s business plan and as Antono said �Every year the bupati may try to block me.� The bupati had already blocked the signing of the boundary so that Antono could not start planting. The court case might have been won but not without confrontation and conflict on the ground and enforcement was uncertain.Option 2: Wait Until the Bupati Leaves Office The term of the current bupati would expire within one year and the planting would be done in stages. Antono could start with other parts of the land. She suspected that the current bupati had her own reasons to stand behind the Malaysian company and that a new person might not have the same loyalties. However Antono was a seasoned executive and knew that waiting would allow the Malaysian company to come up with a counter-strategy. During the conflict the bupati had already tried to change the status of her land. Moreover the identity of the next bupati was uncertain; the current bupati (or one of her family members) might be re-elected.Option 3: Make a Deal with the Malaysian CompanyThe Malaysian company had already taken steps to negotiate offering US$1.5 million in compensation with the bupati offering replacement land. Another option was to jointly manage the plantation but Antono wanted a controlling stake which the opponent was not willing to give. Even if such a deal materialized another problem remained: palm oil was not permitted under Antono�s licensing scheme and applying for an additional permit to finish one cycle of palm oil would involve substantial lobbying. The cash settlement or a share in the revenues from the palm oil plantation which was already producing palm oil would mean extra income that could be used for the expensive land preparation and planting phase; it would allow Antono to scale up faster.Option 4: Use Lobbying to Neutralize the BupatiAntono considered a variety of options to neutralize the bupati. She could try to lobby at the national level to limit the bupati�s authority to renew the palm oil plantation licence annually but this would not be easy. The bupati herself was involved in a number of other conflicts in the area. Furthermore Antono wondered whether the bupati was involved in corruption. The bupati�s father a previous bupati had spent time in jail for a corruption case. Could this bupati be loyal to the Malaysian company for personal reasons? Antono could lobby for an investigation or report the bupati to the national corruption committee. She could also get involved in politics locally and try to support certain other candidates for the bupati election.Option 5: Use Preman-Style TacticsDue to Antono�s community-building efforts a number of villagers were on her side in the land conflict. They told her they would stand behind her and fight with her. Just as Antono received threats she could also mobilize existing groups to put pressure on the other party. Some villagers suggested she use the so-called �preman� way�using thugs or force to make life difficult for the Malaysian company. There were a variety of options of this nature. The villagers suggested burning the plantation or introducing a crop disease. Sabotage of this nature was quite common in Indonesian land conflicts. Antono knew that foreign investors in Indonesia were usually reluctant to fight with local companies. She suspected that turning up the pressure could make the Malaysian company give up the land which was after all a rather small plot that was hardly worth its trouble.Option 6: Give UpThe last option was to �live and let live��in other words plant around the palm oil plantation and leave the situation unchanged. This would allow Antono to build ties with all parties and allow everyone to coexist peacefully at the local level. However she would have to give up a fertile chunk of land and run a legal risk because palm oil plantations were not permitted under Antono�s licensing conditions.Dealing with the threatAfter listening to her estate manager Antono instructed him to invite the intruders to eat a meal in the village paid for by the company. This gesture was a proper way to treat guests but also bought her some time. She told her manager she would call him back shortly. Antono then called her lawyer in East Kalimantan and asked him to go down to the local police station the next day with copies of all the permits obtained protected by some security people. She called her manager back and asked him to convey the message that she would report to the local police station the next day. Her manager pleaded with her not to go as the rumour in the village was that she would be tortured while in police custody. Should she make the trip? What other actions should she take?EXHIBIT 1: FINANCIAL SUMMARY�Source: Company materials.EXHIBIT 2: PROFILE OF KARTIKA ANTONODr. Kartika Dianningsih Antono is the managing director of PT.

The report indicated that although the company had grown it had grown slowly. However Infosys had set an ambitious goal for the coming years which it referred to as “Vision 2020”—achieve US$20 billion in revenue at a 30 per cent net margin and revenue of $80000 per employee. If Infosys were to realize this goal by 2020 (which had been depicted in the media as a “far-fetched” goal) its 8–9 per cent annual growth had to be improved. To scale up quickly Infosys would need to leverage inorganic growth opportunities such as acquisitions. Infosys had already made nine acquisitions between 2000 and 2016 (see Exhibit 1) but of these two had led to controversy. Lodestone Management Consultants had been bought for $345 million then acknowledged a few years later to have been a bad acquisition. Panaya acquired for a value of $200 million raised questions about the price paid for the acquisition: the month before acquisition Israel Growth Partners valued Panaya at 20 per cent less ($162 million) when they invested $20 million for a 12.31 per cent stake in Panaya. Infosys’ growth plans were also challenged by labour and revenue uncertainty due to changes in the United States’ foreign workers visa policy. The policy had allowed U.S. companies to employ skilled foreign workers to fill certain occupations but the Trump administration had recently changed the system to protect the jobs of U.S. workers by limiting the number of foreign workers with visas. The change was a blow to the U.S. information technology (IT) sector which was particularly dependent on workers from overseas. A drop in output from the American IT sector would affect Infosys because it relied on North America for 65 per cent of its segmental revenues. Infosys had improved its client base and technical knowledge and had expanded geographically with its acquisitions but if Infosys was going to use buyouts and acquisitions as inorganic paths of growth it needed to reconsider its strategy. Which business and geographical segments should the firm invest in and what should be the key determining factors that drive the acquisitions: increased clientele enhanced technology or extended geographical reach? Information TECHNOLOGY and IT-enabled SERVICES IN INDIAIndia was the prime outsourcing country for the IT industry accounting for a market of $154 billion in revenue. Growth in the Indian IT sector was evolving driven more by services than software and that involved human capital and automation. As of 2016 the Indian IT industry employed about 10 million people.Business process outsourcing IT consulting and cloud-based services were becoming more important with every passing day. In a recent press release Gartner Consulting estimated that the cloud services market in India would grow at 35.9 percent and reach a value of approximately $1.3 billion. The improved diffusion of Internet and mobile connections in India’s urban and rural areas coupled with the swift rise of electronic and mobile commerce were driving continued demand for hosting and IT-enabled services in India. The telecom regulatory authority was also planning a rapid expansion based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G (fifth generation mobile services infrastructure) bringing standards on par with those in the developed world. The Indian healthcare IT market was also growing at an unprecedented rate; it was estimated that by 2020 the market would be 1.5 times the size of its then valuation of $1 billion. The IT-enabled finance and payments sector was also undergoing great growth especially after the Indian government demonetized specific currency denominations and invested in resources to upgrade unified payment interfaces. This augmented demand in the IT-enabled finance and health sectors meant increased demand for services and platforms. International players in platform-based businesses and innovative IT tools were entering India and the competition from these international companies (both start-ups and larger firms) was becoming a threat to the domestic Indian IT sector. These international companies included some of the pioneers of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Head Hunters India founder and managing director Kris Lakshmikanth observed this trend and commented:Amidst fears that Indian tech companies haven’t kept pace to make the shift from traditional to cutting-edge technologies to meet customer demands I firmly believe that our top companies including TCS and Infosys just as they made India the outsourcing global giant will lead India in the digital business too.The reach of venture capital private equity angel investments and foreign direct investment had increased significantly in India with a focus on IT-enabled sectors. Foreign investors were motivated to invest in India’s growing digital economy by increased transparency and clear taxation policies. For example a goods and services tax (GST) was introduced as an indirect tax levied throughout India to replace the complex structure of taxes imposed separately by the central and state governments. International technology firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Robert Bosch GmbH were establishing corporate start-up accelerators in India to tap Indian IT talent and the market. Indian IT firms like Tech Mahindra Limited Wipro Limited Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Limited were expanding their offerings beyond their existing capabilities in on-shore and off-shore services. They were using innovation hubs and research and development centres to showcase their leading ideas in natural language processing blockchain technology social media cloud computing analytics and AI for clients. However the international players were moving at a much faster pace in these sectors than their Indian counterparts.INFOSYS LimitedInfosys was a global consulting and IT services company headquartered in Bengaluru India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The company was founded in 1981 by N. R. Narayana Murthy Nandan Nilekani N. S. Raghavan Kris Gopalakrishnan S. D. Shibulal and Ashok Arora with an initial investment of just $250. The chief executive officer in 2017 was Dr. Vishal Sikka. He held a bachelor of science degree in computer science from Syracuse University and a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University. Prior to joining Infosys he had been employed at SAP SE.As of May 2017 Infosys had a market capitalization of $36.2 billion; yearly revenues for fiscal year 2016–17 totalled $10.2 billion (see Exhibit 2). According to the company’s annual report for 2016–17 Infosys had 17 direct subsidiaries 26 step-down subsidiaries and one associate. Its workforce stood at 200364 as of March 31 2017. The company added 6320 employees during 2016–17 and had an attrition rate of 15 per cent. Infosys along with its subsidiaries provided business outsourcing consulting and information technology services to its clients across the globe. Its primary market business segments included financial services; manufacturing; retail consumer packaged goods and logistics; energy utilities and communications and services; hi-tech; and life sciences health care and insurance (see Exhibit 3). Geographical segments of Infosys including on- and off-site locations spanned North America Europe—including Ireland and the United Kingdom—India and the rest of the world.Infosys ACQUITIONS (2000–2016)Infosys was a cash-rich company able to buy out a number of companies (see Exhibits 2–3). Expert Information Services a Melbourne Australia-based company was Infosys’ first acquisition acquired in 2003. The company earned revenues of $34.6 million and made a net profit of $5.2 million during its fiscal year ending June 30 2003. The company specialized in designing building and integrating business solutions and products for medium and large clients across vertical sectors such as telecom financial services retail and government. Infosys paid $22.9 million to acquire 100 per cent of the Expert Information Services’ equity (a buyout deal). The transaction value included an up-front payment of $14.1 million and an earn-out and transition bonus of $8.9 million payable over three years for achieving key financial targets and retaining key employees over a period of two years. The company was renamed Infosys Technologies (Australia) Pty Limited. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Philips)’s three shared services centres were Infosys’ second acquisition completed at a cost of $28 million in 2007. At that time Infosys had $1.4 billion in cash reserves and the company estimated that the deal would augment revenue by $32 million. This estimated revenue was calculated at $15 per worker hour. The deal included a business contract for Infosys worth $250 million to provide Philips with finance and accounting services and process its purchase orders. McCamish Systems was founded in 1985 and based its 260-employee delivery centre in Atlanta Georgia. It posted earned revenues of $38.2 million for the year ending 2008. Infosys bought it in 2009 for $58 million. According to the terms of acquisition the up-front consideration for the deal was $38 million. Infosys agreed to pay an additional $20 million to McCamish Systems if it achieved set financial targets in the coming years. At the time of the deal McCamish Systems had 39 clients and counted major insurance and financial companies among them including Nolan Financial Group Phoenix Companies Inc. and Heritage Credit Union. The deal helped Infosys’ business process outsourcing subsidiary Infosys BPO develop an evolved pricing-based business model.Portland Group was an Australian sourcing and category management services company founded in 1999. It had offices in Melbourne Brisbane Perth New Zealand and Shanghai. Its revenue was $29.3 million at the end of June 2011 with a workforce of 113. Portland Group was originally a procurement technology company that later expanded into cost reduction consultancy. The company had 42 clients including two of the four major Australian banks. Its other major clients were ASX PepsiCo Inc. Commonwealth Bank of Australia Westpac Banking Corporation and QGC Pty Limited—the Australian coal steam and gas company. Infosys acquired Portland Group in 2012 for $32.05 million in an all-cash deal. Before acquiring Portland Group Infosys had only one client in the natural resources sector: Rio Tinto. The deal helped Infosys establish its presence in several niche segments of the Australian market.Lodestone Management Consultants headquartered in Zurich was bought for $345 million in 2012. Lodestone advised international companies on strategy and process optimizations and provided business transformation solutions enabled by SAP software. Lodestone’s operations were focused primarily in Europe particularly in the United Kingdom Germany France Switzerland the Netherlands and Belgium. Its major clients were BMW Group Deutsche Telekom AG British American Tobacco plc and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Lodestone’s consultants billed clients at a rate of $175 per hour one of the highest rates in the industry at the time of the deal. Lodestone employed more than 850 consultants working in 17 countries but none were working in India. The company also had expertise and experience in the verticals of life sciences automotive and manufacturing.Panaya an Israeli software as a service (SaaS) company headquartered in Ra’anana Israel was founded in 2006 with investment support from Benchmark Capital Hasso Plattner Ventures and Battery Ventures. Infosys bought the company in 2015 for $200 million and incorporated the technology from Panaya’s CloudQuality Suite to bring automation to some of Infosys’ software. Using the agile SaaS model in its software Infosys was able to mitigate risk reduce costs and shorten time to market for its clients. The CloudQuality Suite helped businesses to test changes to Oracle E-Business Suite and SAP and Salesforce software by identifying functions that might break and providing potential solutions including code corrections. At the time of the acquisition Panaya had more than 400 active customer accounts including global marquee names such as General Electric Mercedes-Benz (Daimler AG) Bosch Whirlpool Corporation GlaxoSmithKline plc Siemens AG Apple Inc. the Coca-Cola Company and Johnson & Johnson. Forty per cent of Panaya’s revenue came from the United States and another 40 per cent from Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Panaya earned the remainder of its revenue from other systems integrators such as IBM Computer Sciences Corporation Logica and the Hewlett-Packard Company.Kallidus Inc. operating under the brand name Skava was based in San Francisco and provided digital and mobile commerce solutions. Skava was a cloud-hosted platform for mobile websites and applications (apps) and other digital shopping experiences delivered across mobile tablet desktop in-store and emerging channels to large retail clients worldwide. In 2013 Kallidus had revenues of $22.9 million and logged a three-year revenue growth of 608 per cent. Infosys acquired Kallidus and its affiliate in 2015 in an all-cash deal of $120 million which included retention bonuses and a deferred component.Noah Consulting LLC was a leading provider of advanced information management consulting services for the oil and gas industry established in 2008. It had 122 employees and was headquartered in Houston Texas with an additional office in Calgary Canada. Its solutions consisted of information management strategic services industry solutions analytics and acquisitions. Noah’s deep domain expertise in upstream oil and gas coupled with its tools solution accelerators and proprietary methodologies made it a leader in driving strategic data management engagements. The value of Infosys’ buyout of Noah was $70 million. The acquisition came at a time when global oil prices had fallen steeply resulting in a need for oil and gas companies to improve operational efficiency by using data analytics and smarter information technology solutions. The acquisition helped Infosys gain expertise in providing end-to-end data management services to oil and gas industry clients.In addition to eight other deals Infosys invested $2 million in Airviz Inc. an air quality monitoring start-up that originated at Carnegie Mellon University. The investment was made from an innovation fund Infosys had earmarked for investments in disruptive new technologies. The innovation fund was launched in 2013 with $100 million to further Infosys’ strategic and functional interests. In 2015 the fund was expanded to $500 million. As of January 22 2017 Infosys had invested a little more than $62 million of the fund in various start-ups covering areas such as IoT automation and drones. Sikka was optimistic about the role that the companies Infosys acquired with the fund would play in achieving the firm’s Vision 2020 goals. He noted “The start-up world is incredibly exciting. We have been investing in companies there. We have been bringing these companies to our clients and that rate at which we bring these companies to clients is just exploding. So that’s very exciting.” THE WAY FORWARDThe coming months would be crucial for Infosys and Sikka. The clock was ticking for achieving Vision 2020; shareholder expectations were rising; international competition in the domestic and overseas markets was increasing; and the geo-political dynamics and U.S. visa policies were changing. Infosys had myriad uncertainties to deal with and several critical decisions had to be made. Organic sources of growth were not going to be enough to reach the company’s target of $20 billion by 2020. Infosys had to devise an appropriate buyout strategy if it hoped to scale up rapidly.In the past buyouts had enhanced Infosys’ client base increased its product and service portfolio and enabled its geographical expansion. The buyouts had also enabled Infosys to become agile and better prepared for uncertainties. At the same time some acquisitions such as those of Panaya and Lodestone had also created turmoil and company-wide disagreements for Infosys. With all that in mind it was important for Sikka to strike a balance between risks and rewards in his approach to buying out companies. Since becoming chief executive officer in August 2014 Sikka had brought several changes to the company such as overhauling its organizational structure increasing the focus on design thinking and focusing efforts on AI. But AI was just one facet of the industry’s emerging technologies. Infosys had its business spread across a variety of segments and diverse geographies. To continue its swift growth and leverage the way for acquisitions and buyouts which of these business and geographical segments should Infosys invest in? Which key determining factors should drive the acquisitions: increased clientele enhanced technology or increased geographical reach and what investments were priorities? Sikka knew that the journey ahead would be challenging and that tough choices would have to be embraced.Exhibit 1: Infosys Limited BuyoutsNote: BPO = business process outsourcing.Source: Created by the case authors based on “Acquiring Organization: Infosys” Crunchbase accessed November 24 2017 www.crunchbase.com/organization/infosys/acquisitions; “About Us” Infosys (website) accessed November 24 2017 www.infosys.com/about/Pages/history.aspx.Exhibit 2: Infosys Limited Balance Sheet(in US$ ’000)Source: Created by the case authors based on Infosys Limited Annual Report 2010–11: Powered by Intellect: Driven by Values; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2011–12: Infosys 3.0—Accelerating Growth; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2012–13: Relevance through Innovation; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2013–14: Evolving with Changing Times; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2014–15: Powered by Intellect Driven by Values; Infosys Limited Annual Report 2015–16: Being Infosys.

It was a job Chan still insisted on doing even though he was 89 years old. As usual Ming Li the factory director and several department managers reported on what was going on in the factory. At the meeting Li mentioned that “it was very difficult to recruit employees although they had been actively working on recruiting after the Spring Festival. Apparently it was insufficient to recruit a skilled worker with a ¥4000–¥5000 [US$640–$800] monthly salary.”China’s economy had been flourishing since the 1990s but labour costs had also increased. Due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and the appreciation of the Chinese currency the yuan renminbi the quantity of orders was dropping. Since 2013 a nationwide shortage of workers had caused shoe factories toy factories and garment factories to gradually shrink. Because of improvements in hometown environments and higher living costs in large cities more and more migrant workers were unwilling to leave their hometowns for work in the cities. Fewer workers and greater management challenges resulted in the closure of many factories in mainland China and made it difficult to maintain and operate the businesses that surrounded and supported them. In the context of this restructuring of labour-intensive economic activities in mainland China Chan took time to consider how YGM could respond. The recent emergence of fast-fashion brands had made it necessary to consider how YGM Trading Limited could better implement its original brand manufacturer strategy by acquiring well-known brands and developing independent brands.YGM which Chan founded in 1949 with a mere 20 sewing machines had grown into a prestigious original equipment manufacturer/original design manufacturer (OEM/ODM) garment manufacturer and global organization (see Exhibit 1). Production headquarters were in Hong Kong and the business extended into mainland China and other countries in Asia. Its sales network extended globally. Chan had realized decades ago that it was unwise for the company to rely solely on factory production and he had therefore founded YGM which manufactured and marketed shirts with well-known brands (both licensed and self-owned) for Asian European and U.S. markets. YGM Trading Limited was spun off from YGM in 1987 and it became a separately listed public company based in Hong Kong. The company’s core businesses were garment wholesaling and retailing; its other businesses included garment manufacturing property investment and printing. While it had developed its apparel retail and wholesale businesses YGM Trading Limited also actively grew a franchise business. At this point YGM had a rich experience in brand management and had been very successful. However Chan was facing both challenges and opportunities and was considering how to keep YGM and YGM Trading successful in the future. The chinese Textile industryThe textile industry in China was labour-intensive and highly dependent on international sales. China was the largest producer and exporter of textiles and garments around the world. Compared with Europe the United States and other developed countries its labour costs were low. In addition the large scale of the textile industry helped companies take full advantage of economies of scale. The government of China had enacted special policies that encouraged garment companies to develop their own brands and it had also encouraged upgrading rural market consumption and utilized policies to safeguard corporations’ lawful rights and interests. The government provided preferential tax policies and in recent years a public research and development design platform was utilized to provide talent issue new financing and encourage companies to use brands for mortgages or issuing bonds. The government also encouraged spinning industries from eastern China to develop in western China. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China the total market volume for clothing increased from ¥102 billion in 2004 to ¥702.2 billion in 2012 representing a 26.58 per cent average growth rate over this period which was about 16 per cent higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. China’s garment industry went through a relatively long-term development process (see Exhibit 2). The third transformation of the global textile service industry in the 1980s resulted in China becoming a manufacturing centre and the OEM model became the major business model for Chinese textile and garment companies. After the 1990s with the maturation of the manufacturing technology used in the textile and garment industry the business model had changed from OEM to a more advanced processing model: ODM. However the industry was facing increasing costs. As a high-polluting industry the textile industry in China was under increasing social pressure concerning pollution control and abatement. The public was beginning to demand that companies protect the environment and the government intended to impose environmental pollution taxes. Hong Kong was also facing new operating challenges due to environmental concerns: developed countries were implementing environmental protection measures that formed a “green” barrier—a protective network for the global market. Green symbols provided permission for textile products to enter global markets and textile printing and dyeing companies invested more in environmental protection. The development of China’s economy and increasing household incomes also resulted in increasing labour costs. Migrant workers became more reluctant to leave their homes to work in big cities. At the same time the implementation of labour laws in mainland China led to higher production costs in the textile industry.As the textile industry was a traditional industry in Hong Kong most companies paid little attention to research and development which resulted in large gaps in relation to the global textile market in areas such as new fabric innovations. While the textile and garment industry was a relatively low-cost industry policy incentives such as the government’s encouraging eastern spinning industries to develop in western China led to the establishment of many emerging garment companies attracted by high gross profits. Garment companies were suffering from potential threats as the garment industry was a chaotic intellectual property-based industry with too many imitation and counterfeit products. In addition Britain’s intention to exit from the European Union (i.e. Brexit) and international turmoil were highly likely to affect companies’ profits.Recent Industry Statistics In terms of market size China was the world’s largest producer exporter and consumer of textiles and garments. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China with the increase in income levels and an increase in the proportion of the Chinese population living in urban areas China’s consumer market for apparel was expected to grow sustainably in the future. In 2014 China’s large garment companies had produced clothing worth US$29.921 billion with a year-on-year growth of 10 per cent. Over the same period China exported clothing and accessories worth about US$186.31 billion representing an annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent (i.e. a 6 per cent decline from the previous year’s annual growth rate) and an average price of US$2.7 per piece (i.e. a 0.7 per cent annual price increase). In terms of consumption garment retail sales of the above-normal wholesale and retail trade totalled ¥8935.8 billion with a year-on-year growth of 9.24 per cent. In terms of development prospects the annual growth rates for per capita expenditures on clothing by urban and rural residents in China were 4.73 per cent and 12.47 per cent respectively. However China’s per capita consumption on clothing was still at a low level much lower than that of some developed countries (see Exhibit 3).Middle- and High-end Consumption Trends In 2014 domestic middle- and high-end consumption suffered from a recession in the industry and the macro economy. A decrease in shoppers in malls and increased costs contributed to a temperate decline of middle- and high-end consumption. At the same time with the popularization of the Internet and WeChat the traditional business model was replaced gradually by the online to offline business model. Garment Industry TrendsThe garment industry was trending toward two ends. The first trend was toward international fast-fashion brands (e.g. the big four fast-fashion brands—Zara Uniqlo GAP and H&M). Compared with fashion leisure brands such as Baleno which were in decline the big four and other international fast-fashion brands were experiencing frenzied expansion in mainland China. Data showed that the top six fast-fashion brands (i.e. Zara Uniqlo GAP H&M C&A and MUJI) opened one new retail store every two and a half days. In 2014 fast-fashion brands opened 274 new stores in total including 13 Uniqlo stores and nine H&M stores in Guangzhou. The other trend emphasized luxury goods. In recent years the popular term “entry lux” was created to describe brands that had become the choice of white-collar consumers. These brands were affordable and fashionable. Moreover with improved purchasing power the top luxury brands had gradually become the main choice of a new wealthy class.China’s textile industry was currently entering a decelerated growth stage. On March 4 2015 the China National Textile and Apparel Council pointed to three main development characteristics that were present in the textile industry: decelerated growth more pressure for development and an urgent need for transformation. First the growth rate of China’s textile industry had slowed down. Second China’s textile industry was under pressure and differentiation was accelerating. The traditional production model was difficult to sustain while the new production model was still in the process of formation. Therefore for textile companies facing new challenges a competitive scenario emphasizing survival of the fittest would intensify. Innovation would become the key to transforming production power. Under the terms of this new normal the key to China’s textile industry was to promote transformation and upgrades. To promote the development of the whole industry instead of investment-driven and materials-driven development it was now more important to innovate and to develop new technologies and brands as well as more efficient management regulation governance and business models. Industry experts pointed out that as garments were necessities there was at least a fixed demand for textiles in the Chinese market. In 2015 it was predicted that the growth of Chinese textile sales would be at the level of the previous year (see Exhibit 4). Yangtzekiang Garment LimitedYGM was the largest multinational textile and garment corporation in Hong Kong. It operated under the names Yangtzekiang Garment Limited and Hong Kong Knitters and was listed on Hong Kong’s public stock exchange in 1970. YGM Group’s business covered a wide array of activities from spinning weaving dyeing and finishing to garment manufacturing and sales. While YGM also had an investment in electrolytic aluminum ingots the principal activities of the group were manufacturing and sales of garments and textiles provision of processing services and rental of properties. YGM’s textiles business included a wide line of products including yarn woven and knitted fabrics and woven and knitted garments (e.g. men’s and women’s shirts trousers shorts polo shirts T-shirts jackets and knitted outerwear). YGM handled both ODM and OEM garment businesses as well as garment procurement wholesaling and retailing (see Exhibit 5).YGM’s operations covered Southeast Asia the United States Italy France and the United Kingdom. With Hong Kong as its base YGM branched out to China and other parts of the world. YGM set up sales offices and representatives in the United States the United Kingdom France Singapore Bangladesh and China. Branch offices in China were set up in Guangzhou Shanghai and Beijing. The export business mainly targeted European Japanese and Southeast Asian markets. Production plants were in China and Southeast Asia. YGM grew into a global organization and had over 20000 employees (see Exhibit 6) and more than 1200 retail stores worldwide. Besides Hong Kong and places where YGM had factories YGM also had offices in Panyu (Guangzhou) and Shanghai China which took care of manufacturing needs and oversaw domestic sales in those regions. The company had factories in Hong Kong mainland China (in Wuxi Panyu and Guigang) Bangladesh Cambodia Malaysia Macao and other regions. Its headquarters in Hong Kong oversaw sales and the overall management of the group including its manufacturing facilities in China Bangladesh India Cambodia Myanmar and Vietnam. It also monitored and supported YGM’s subcontractors in China and abroad. YGM had wholly owned production plants in Panyu (Guangzhou) China. These production plants included Exquisite Knitters (Guangzhou) Ltd. (EQK); Whampoa Garment Mfg. (Guangzhou) Co. Ltd. (WGM); and Guangzhou Top Yield Garment Ltd. EQK and WGM were compliance plants that focused on the production of high-end clothing. YGM also had a 49 per cent share in Wuxi Talak Investment Co. Ltd. (Wuxi Talak Group) a jointly controlled entity that owned several textile-related companies in Wuxi China including Wuxi Changxin Textile Co. Ltd. Wuxi YGM Textile Co. Ltd. and Wuxi Yangtzekiang Textile Co. Ltd. (collectively the Wuxi Talak Group). The core business of the Wuxi Talak Group was the production of medium- to high-end yarns. Current PerformanceAccording to Tonghuashun Finance YGM Group’s revenue and pre-tax profits dropped considerably from 2012 to 2016 (see Exhibit 7). YGM Group’s five-year gross profit rate remained relatively steady but the net profit rates fell between 2012 and 2016 (see Exhibit 8). Data for the textile and garment industry overall in China in the first half of 2016 (see Exhibit 9) indicated that sales incomes had been continuously reduced over the past five years (from 2012–2016). Even though YGM Group’s gross profit for fiscal year (FY) 2015–16 had increased it was far less than that of the domestic garment industry (i.e. 28.55 per cent less) which implied that YGM Group’s costs were far higher than average costs in the industry. YGM Group’s net profit rate had continued to decline over the past five years especially in FY 2014–15 which had a negative profit. Although the company was profitable in FY 2015–16 its net profit rate was only 0.5 per cent compared with an industry net profit rate of 9.72 per cent—a huge gap.In terms of costs YGM Group’s sales costs rate was lower than the overall industry rate of 10.29 per cent in FY 2015–16 (see Exhibit 10) which indicated that as a well-established garment manufacturing company YGM Group had competitive advantages in its sales channels. However compared with previous years its overhead costs rate (see Exhibit 11) was higher than both its rate for previous years and the overall industry rate of 6.20 per cent. Domestic EnvironmentYGM’s aggressive innovation always caught the industry’s attention. Chan noted that he was the first to produce ready-to-wear suits that met international standards: According to the traditional concept of suits production each suit is customized by the tailor and then [sewn] as the whole suit. While I separated parts of suit to produce Hong Kong men could follow the pattern of Europe and the United States buying right away after trying [it on for the] first time. My masterpiece is the three-piece suit which was most popular in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s suits and Italian suits were well-known as the international style and the most exquisite clothing in the world because there were several exquisite Shanghai tailor masters in workmanship and several excellent Guangdong masters with consummate tailoring skills who [were] updating [their] styles constantly. What’s more with the decades of accumulated experience the art of Hong Kong suits were [at] the world-class level.In the 21st century facing opportunities and challenges from the rapid development of science and technology and intensifying competition from economic globalization Hong Kong had evolved into a high-value-added economy and the Hong Kong textile industry could no longer be rigid. The company evolved from a family-owned textile business by establishing YGM’s own Doctor brand exporting its products to the Middle East the Caribbean and other developing regions and setting up factories in Macao to take advantage of the Portuguese colony’s duty-free market. After 1959 American markets began to purchase Asian goods and YGM captured the European and U.S. markets in 1969. The improvement of the economic environment in mainland China in recent years resulted in increased labour and insurance costs. In addition the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi led to a decline in the number of orders. As a consequence Chan considered expanding into new businesses. At that time a friend who had won an agricultural award indicated that he could supply large quantities of duck down to YGM Group each year. Chan thus decided to open a new duck down business—a field that had recently seen high market demands. His old friend Li Feng helped in sales channels. Chan said “The business of producing a duck down jacket is equivalent to producing three pants and the quality is an important factor. I have confidence to produce duck down jackets and expand business for the new products.”YGM had a long history of delivering excellent product quality; its traditional approach Cantonese-style products and its value connotations matched current Chinese consumers’ new consumption concepts. In mainland China the medium- and high-end clothing markets were mostly captured by Uniqlo Zara H&M and other fast-fashion brands and domestic brands were in a weak position. This situation provided good opportunities for the emergence of high-end domestic clothing brands. International Environment Globalization helped multinational companies to manufacture and sell globally reduce costs and increase sales. However economic globalization also had disadvantages that led to new issues including fluctuating currency exchange rates and unfair competition caused by international tax treaties. The impacts of diverse economic and political backgrounds in various countries also led to losses for some companies. Regarding currency fluctuations since YGM Group’s main business operated in Europe and the United States and accounts were settled mainly in Hong Kong dollars U.S. dollars euros pounds sterling and Chinese yuan renminbi the devaluation of the euro and the pound had a serious impact on YGM’s export business. In 2016 the exchange rates for euros and pounds fell sharply because of Britain’s plan to exit from the European Union. In addition the fluctuation of exchange rates may have put YGM Group under greater economic risk business risk and accounting risk. Due to international tax treaties and taxation exemptions regarding China’s imports of yarn from Southeast Asia and South Asia during 2014–15 YGM Group’s yarn manufacturing business had to pay taxes when importing cotton which weakened the competitiveness of YGM’s manufacturing group. It was inevitable that YGM would be placed in a poor financial situation. In terms of economic and political impacts if other countries had high inflation YGM’s net income would decline; and if industries were nationalized in other countries this nationalization might pose a risk to YGM. After the financial crisis from 2009 a labour shortage emerged in the developed areas on the coast of China. In recent years this issue had been highly damaging to labour-intensive industries that manufactured toys footwear and textiles including YGM Group. The company’s factory in Bangladesh was in good condition and the benefit of the demographic dividend had not been demonstrated in its factory in Myanmar which was in the early stages of construction. However the main production plants were located in Panyu and Guigang in the Pearl River Delta which suffered from the labour shortage. The Panyu factory was most affected. Because it was too difficult to recruit skilled workers the Panyu factory had to reluctantly decline some orders and could rely only on high-end urgent and small orders. Therefore YGM Group’s garment business was in insufficient production. Manufacturing in China had always taken advantage of lower prices as a competitive advantage; however with the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi foreign currencies were in a weak position. Compared with the national corporations in Southeast Asian and South Asian countries Chinese textile enterprises including YGM Group had lost the advantage of low prices for their OEM and ODM businesses. Due to the financial crisis in 2008 European and U.S. markets had weakened and market demand had declined. (The demand for high-end garments had decreased significantly.) Garment orders from abroad had been reduced sharply and the profit margin of companies had been further squeezed. Furthermore major developed countries had again recognized the strategic significance of the manufacturing industry and had implemented re-industrialization strategies: The United States had proposed a U.S. manufacturing industry action plan and Europe had launched a “Factories of the Future” plan. These countries were looking for new technology and innovation strategies to support the development of their manufacturing industries which also forced China’s textile industry to transform and upgrade. Moreover higher production costs had resulted from rapid economic development in China; the appreciation of the Chinese yuan renminbi; and increasing costs for labour raw materials energy and other production inputs. According to Made in China 2025 because China had lost its advantage of lower labour costs global manufacturing industries were moving to Southeast Asia South Asia and Africa where production costs were lower. Since the improvement of labour productivity and the energy advantages in the United States and other developed countries the manufacturing business of multinational companies presented a trend of accelerated back-flow toward developed countries. YGM Trading LimitedYGM originally manufactured shirts for local markets and exported products to Europe and the United States. At the beginning of the 1960s it expanded to also produce trousers and suits. In 1970 YGM was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (now Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited). In the 1970s it established retail outlets in Hong Kong Macau Taiwan Singapore and Malaysia. In 1987 YGM Trading Limited was established as a separately listed public company based in Hong Kong. YGM Trading developed an apparel retail and wholesale business and distributed a wide range of men’s and women’s wear for many world-renowned brands. It also licensed and acquired internationally recognized brands. The Chan family held controlling shares in YGM Trading Ltd. which had a close relationship with YGM Group.Business DevelopmentYGM Trading had a network of more than 800 retail outlets throughout Hong Kong Macau China Taiwan Southeast Asia and Europe. YGM had been actively developing the Greater China market for the past 10 years and had established retail outlets in major cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Guangzhou and expanding this network to many smaller cities. YGM now had more than 200 outlets operating in China and the company expected to grow further in core and developing cities.YGM Trading also actively developed a franchise business and distributed many world-renowned brands (e.g. Michel René Ltd. Aquascutum Limited of London Guy Laroche and Charles Jourdan of Paris Ashworth and Hang Ten of the United States J. Lindeberg from Stockholm and Harmont & Blaine from Italy). YGM Trading opened more than 200 stores in Hong Kong Macau Taiwan and mainland China for the Michel René brand. During 1950–1952 Chan developed the Doctor brand which became fashionable in South Asia. In the 1970s he introduced the American jeans brand Wrangler to China. Meanwhile Michel René was developed as a store brand and was positioned in the market as a “fast suit” brand. Recently YGM had launched a casual-wear series to offer tasteful high-end workwear separates for urban office workers professionals and executives. Clients were attracted by the brand’s exquisite tailoring and careful choice in materials. The company also invited well-known personalities to endorse its brands to increase awareness of the brands.In 2008 the first time that Beijing hosted the Olympic Games the Michel René Aquascutum and Ashworth brands launched limited-edition premium lines for three sporting events aimed at celebrating the Olympic Games with gorgeous practical and cheerful characteristics. YGM Trading focused on middle- and high-end brands (see Exhibit 12). YGM Group had three acquired brands: Aquascutum Michel René and Guy Laroche while Ashworth was an agent brand and J. Lindeberg was a dealer brand. Based on the sales from March 31 2015 to March 31 2016 Aquascutum and Ashworth were the main beneficiaries of the company and both brands’ sales together accounted for 95 per cent of the total sales.Dr. Sui-Kau ChanPersonal InfluencesChan served as a member of the eighth and ninth terms of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference until he reached retirement age. Chan was an honorary citizen of Dongguan Foshan Guangzhou and Wuxi (Jiangsu). He was also the former chairman of the Clothing Industry Training Authority (1986–1997) the founding chairman (1988–1994) and then honorary chairman of the Textile Council of Hong Kong the former president (1977–1988) and then life honorary president of the Federation of Hong Kong Garment Manufacturers the honorary president of the Hong Kong Woollen & Synthetic Knitting Manufacturers’ Association (since 1980) and a former member of the Textile Advisory Board of Hong Kong (1971–1987) and the Hong Kong Labour Advisory Board (1985–1995). In 2013 Chan was awarded Industrialist of the Year from the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. Charity Involvement Chan was renowned for his charity at home and abroad. He was committed to participating in charity work and strongly supported and promoted education in Hong Kong and mainland China. Chan and the Chan family set up several charitable funds including the Chan Yuqing Family Charity Fund and the Chan Yin Chuen Charitable Donation Funds.

It was April 2017 and the hotel perched on Lion�s Head mountain in Cape Town South Africa was perfectly positioned to catch the last westerly rays of sunlight. Ellerman House was a common stopping-off point for travellers returning from safaris throughout southern Africa and in this respect Gordon�s trip was no different. She had just returned from a whirlwind tour through the best new safari camps in southern Africa. However Gordon�s trip was not for rest and relaxation; she was there to gather up-to-the-minute intelligence on the safari industry.As the chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of Extraordinary Journeys (EJ) a provider of custom luxury African safaris she was �on inspection��that is visiting safari camps to test them for future clients. This also involved meeting the camps� owners and managers and networking with other safari professionals. This was the part of the job that she truly loved and no matter how busy she was at home Gordon carved out time to come to Africa at least twice a year. Notwithstanding the 21-hour flight she had a knack for shrugging off fatigue and jet lag to embrace 5:30 a.m. starts and 16-hour days while she was there.Founded in 2009 EJ was a leader among a new breed of fully customized safari tour operators that sought to upend the more common group-tour model. As demand for custom safaris grew EJ�s revenues had grown rapidly increasing at a 60-per-cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2016. However by mid-2017 Gordon was beginning to think that this rapid growth would be difficult to maintain in the face of mounting competitive pressures. Every few months she was seeing advertisements from a new competitor in her industry. While some of these were entrants with scant resources others were backed by private-equity funds and million-dollar branding campaigns. These competitors were advertising to her potential clients and in some cases overtly attempting to drive down prices and profit margins. This suggested a troubling increase in competition that would threaten incumbents. At worst these changes could threaten the growth and market position she had enjoyed for the past eight years.Gordon sipped her drink and looked across the Cape Town cityscape. She knew her South African competitors had offices downtown and she wondered if they were still at work pondering the future of the safari industry.SAFARIS: A BROADER VIEWIntroduction to SafarisThe word safari came from the Swahili word for an overland journey. While the term had used to predominantly refer to a big-game safari it had evolved to refer to �travelling usually in vehicles into unspoiled or wild areas for . . . game viewing.� One estimate suggested that at least 4.5 million international tourists visited Africa in 2015 to go on safari. Primary destinations for safari goers were often well known. For example tourists flocked to see the great migration in Tanzania�s Serengeti National Park. There approximately 1.5 million wildebeest migrated clockwise throughout the region in search of grasses that grew after the seasonal rains. Other top safari destinations included Kruger National Park in South Africa the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya the Okavango Delta in Botswana and Victoria Falls on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe (see Exhibit 1).Safari ActivitiesMost visitors went on safari for anywhere from four to 14 nights. When not on safari travellers to Africa also went to major cities such as Cape Town in South Africa or beaches such as in Zanzibar in Tanzania. The most popular safari destinations tended to offer big-five game viewing: lions buffalo giraffes leopards and rhinoceros. Most safari goers planned to stay at either a camp or a lodge. At a lodge travellers found a permanent building that typically had amenities such as full-time electricity hot water and perhaps air conditioning or a swimming pool if the location had a warm climate. On the other hand travellers at a camp found more rustic amenities such as fabric-walled tents. However ultra-luxury camps like Chinzombo in Zambia with amenities such as indoor bathtubs private plunge pools and hand-carved sinks blurred the lines between upscale camp and lodge.The most popular even emblematic safari activity was to participate in game drives which involved driving in a modified Land Rover or Toyota Land Cruiser to see wild animals.�Another common activity was a walking safari where guests hiked in search of game with well-qualified scouts and guides. Alternative activities were typically offered based on the price range of the lodge or the type of travel the lodge was oriented towards. For example more luxury-oriented lodges tended to offer horseback riding or mountain biking while specialty lodges might have offered support for birdwatching or canoeing. American Safari TravellersIn 2017 the upscale safari market was composed of both luxury and adventure travellers who stayed in higher-end camps and lodges. Within this space the average spend for EJ clients was approximately US$8000 per person excluding international airfare. Almost all EJ clients were American and industry estimates suggested that approximately 110000 Americans travelled on a luxury safari each year.For these American travellers an African safari tended to fall into the �bucket list� trip category. In other words most travellers did not plan to return to Africa; rather they hoped to accomplish their safari aspirations so that they could check the trip off their list of lifetime travel goals. As such potential travellers chose whether to go on safari relative to a number of factors and alternative destinations. For example the outbreak of Ebola in 2014 caused many travellers to divert the trips they had planned for 2015 to other worldwide destinations such as India Peru and Patagonia. Despite occasional short-term changes in supply and demand the luxury safari industry had grown quickly since the end of the financial crisis. Safari demand depended heavily on both the current condition of the economy and the current state of the US stock markets. In good economic times safari bookings and prices tended to increase dramatically. For example in the luxury segment between 2010 and 2017 growth averaged an estimated year-over-year CAGR of 10 per cent. However if the stock market performance were to slow or reverse the rapid growth could give way to a stagnating or even contracting industry.Safari industry STRUCTUREThe safari industry in particular and the luxury travel industry in general tended to function in three distinct layers of operation: (1) tour operators (2) destination management companies (DMCs) and (3) safari camp managers (see Exhibit 2). Because the safari industry had historically been fragmented throughout the value chain few if any companies dominated the industry. In 2017 the largest firm Wilderness Safaris made up no more than 9 per cent of the DMC and camp management industries. No other tour operator was thought to serve more than a small fraction in the luxury market.Layer One: Tour OperatorsPotential US-based travellers hoping to plan a customized safari had a range of choices when selecting a tour operator. There were at least a dozen highly visible firms with more established brand names as well as dozens of other smaller companies (see Exhibit 3). Travellers were able to consult with different firms and request quotes from a number of tour operators to find the best deal or the best match for their particular interests. However most clients did not shop as extensively as might have been expected because of the high time commitment of working with a safari specialist to generate a custom itinerary. Custom safari tour operators could be thought of as travel agents with extremely specialized knowledge of African countries types of safaris guides lodging options and a range of other topics. Tour operators earned their gross profits in the form of sales commissions from safari camps and lodges. These commissions typically ranged from 12 per cent to 25 per cent of the gross trip price excluding airfare. These relatively high commissions for African safaris attracted a consistent stream of new entrants because commissions for tour operators in other comparable markets such as Patagonia India and New Zealand averaged less than 15 per cent.Safari commissions worked in much the same way as a wholesale price markup. For example if a camp had a listed price of $1000 per person per night then tour operators typically charged clients $1000 and then paid the $800 wholesale price to the hotel. They then kept the remaining $200 as gross profit. Wholesale rates were not available directly to consumers so individual travellers paid approximately the same amount whether they booked with a tour operator or directly with the safari lodge.Tour Operator SuccessTo be successful tour operators needed at least three key resources. The first related to industry knowledge such as knowing the best safari properties knowing how to work with suppliers and knowing what customers wanted. CEOs were expected to have gained this knowledge through experience as a tour-operator sales agent or a safari camp marketing representative or at a DMC. While people with the required industry knowledge could have been hired from rival safari companies owners and managers needed sufficient experience to manage this process. The second resource was an appropriate amount of capital. To make a successful entry and remain competitive a new firm needed an estimated $1 million�$2 million to create an office hire an experienced team and build a marketing and a branding campaign. The third resource was the skill to manage the marketing and branding campaign which was critical to developing awareness and trust in potential clients. Successful �safari-preneurs� needed to manage online direct-to-consumer marketing engage in direct mailing and get mentions in top press outlets like Travel + Leisure and Cond� Nast Traveler.Layer Two: Destination Management CompaniesThe second layer of the safari industry was DMCs. Tour operators worked directly with DMCs to put together the difficult operational logistics of a custom safari within a specific region�for example the Serengeti and nearby areas in Tanzania and Kenya. DMCs were based in the geographic region they served and hence acted as the on-the-ground service for safari clients. They helped tour operators book the difficult and/or time-consuming elements of the trip such as arranging local car transportation or chartering planes. For example travelling to a safari camp might require a charter flight that would be difficult to book directly such as an eight-seat Cessna aircraft that needed an experienced bush pilot for a dirt landing strip. Camps were often far from each other on dirt tracks or bush roads. This made arranging and coordinating between the camps for each custom trip difficult and dependent on specialized knowledge. DMCs filled a gap in skills and capabilities between tour operators and safari camps and lodges. DMC activities were typically white-labelled so the client saw DMC services such as ground transportation luggage transfer and local troubleshooting as natural extensions of their tour operator and not branded as the DMC itself. DMCs typically had little pricing power in their operating region. As direct suppliers to the tour operators they competed by offering a mix of good service and a reasonable price. In competitive markets like Kenya the Serengeti and South Africa DMCs that unilaterally raised prices or stopped providing service for certain properties would find that tour operators had moderate switching costs and were able to find another DMC. The DMC industry was highly fragmented although in some specific geographic regions such as Botswana one firm such as Wilderness Safaris� DMC could have a relatively large market share and exercise some degree of market power.While most DMCs were independent some DMCs were part of vertically integrated companies. For example andBeyond a large vertically integrated safari DMC and camp manager also had a competitive tour operator subsidiary in the United States.Layer Three: Safari Camps and LodgesIn 2017 there were over 300 luxury or high-end camps and lodges throughout Africa. Prices for luxury safaris ranged from moderate to sky-high. Typically daily fees for a safari were all-inclusive and included room meals and safari activities. The fees per person per night for a mid-range safari started at approximately $350 and continued to in excess of $3000 per person per night for ultra-luxury experiences (see Exhibit 4). The business of managing safari properties was highly specialized and capital intensive. Traditionally the industry was highly fragmented and firms that owned lodges and camps were small. From 2000 to 2017 the industry slowly began to consolidate. Some firms especially those that catered to high-end luxury clients began building international brand reputations that allowed them to grow in new directions. For example Singita which managed six safari lodges as well as private guest houses was highly regarded in the industry. Its brand was built on a reputation for uncompromising quality and attention to detail. This overall level of quality had led to nearly 200 awards for its properties service level and wildlife conservation efforts including Cond� Nast Traveler�s 2015 award for the number-one hotel in the world. On the back of this reputation Singita had pushed partially into the tour operator space by allowing consumers to book their safaris directly. This allowed Singita to charge full retail price and therefore retain the portion of gross profits that would normally have gone to tour operator partners. Its booking office handled the difficult details of getting travellers to their camps. However Singita generally provided booking services only for its own properties and travellers generally preferred to visit a number of different safari camps on their journey.EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEYSElizabeth Gordon 35 was born in Nairobi Kenya to an American family that had been involved in the safari industry since her father founded Park East Tours in 1965. For 35 years until her family sold the business in 2000 Park East Tours was a leader in the planned-departure group safari business in Kenya and Tanzania. Its primary customer base was college alumni groups. As a lifelong safari industry insider Gordon had visited every major safari country and stayed in over 100 safari camps and lodges. After college she worked as a manager at a number of safari camps in Namibia which helped her gain a new ground-level perspective on the safari industry. She later worked as a consultant in New York City and as a property investor focused on short-term vacation rentals in Buenos Aires Argentina.In the late 2000s however Gordon began looking for a new entrepreneurial opportunity in the travel industry. After looking at safari industry trends she recognized that the older planned departure approach to group safaris had lost its appeal to a new generation of travellers. Prior to the mid-2000s African safaris whether upscale or more down-to-earth were usually conducted as part of a group. Group sizes ranged from a dozen travellers to 50 or more and the pre-planned format allowed for lower prices and easier transportation options. However as travellers became more adventurous and the number of flight options increased clients increasingly sought more customized experiences. In an effort to modernize the safari experience Gordon founded EJ in 2009 to cater to the fast-growing segment of American travellers that wanted customized safaris with elements of both luxury and adventure. Customization allowed her to better match customer interests to the actual trip itinerary. Due to EJ�s extensive on-the-ground research at safari camps throughout Africa it excelled at the process of matching customer interests to safari camps that complemented clients� personalities. One of Gordon�s key guidelines was to send clients only to destinations where either she or one of the 20 EJ employees had stayed. As the demand for custom safaris grew EJ�s revenues had increased dramatically. EJ had grown at a blistering pace averaging a CAGR of over 60 per cent. From 2009 with revenues of $200000 and no full-time employees EJ had grown to projected 2017 revenues of over $12 million with 21 employees.Extraordinary Journey�s Strategy�The Extraordinary Journeys method of trip planning starts the minute we pick up the phone to answer a client inquiry� Gordon said. �The process that we use to create safaris for clients�from the first call until our clients return home�is focused on 360 degrees of trip planning and execution. We want both creativity in trip planning as well as a Ritz-Carlton-level attention to detail at every step of the process whether it is a $7000 safari or a $70000 safari.�A core principle of Gordon�s trip planning philosophy was that matching client interests to both safari lodges and the overall travel itinerary was the most important part of her safari specialists� (i.e. her sales team�s) job. In other words the sales team never directed clients towards high-priced accommodations simply to get a higher commission; the goal was to always match client interests budget and tastes to the best trip that matched these criteria. �The sales team is as empowered as possible to use their deep industry knowledge� Gordon said. �I don�t require them to follow any set itineraries or choose properties with which we have higher gross margins. We do a lot of training to ensure the sales team is up to date but I hire my team because they are smart and I make sure they think for themselves.� She cited two examples of her philosophy: a Hollywood star travelling with family was best served by a low-key family-owned property whereas two honeymooners on a modest budget stayed at economical bush camps before they splurged on two nights at the luxurious Singita Pamushana Lodge in Zimbabwe.Thus far Gordon had guided EJ�s rapid growth based on three primary strategies: (1) a public relations (PR) campaign targeting high-end travel publications (2) referrals from past clients to their friends and (3) repeat bookings from past clients. Each of these strategies had led to a growing brand reputation. EJ had become known for its high-quality customer service and creative safari planning. Thanks to the PR campaign and the support of its most loyal customers EJ had received coverage from the Wall Street Journal Travel + Leisure Departures and National Geographic Traveler. Gordon was awarded Travel + Leisure�s A-List travel agent status four times and in 2016 EJ won Travel + Leisure�s Best Safari Outfitter in the World award coming in second for the magazine�s annual World�s Best competition.LOOKING FORWARDAs the last blushes of sunset faded from the clouds over the Atlantic Ocean Gordon realized that she had one of the greatest luxuries of all�a few free minutes to think about the strategy of her company. Between the long days on safari and a few hectic months back at her office in New York this was her first chance in a long while to sit and think about the future of EJ. She recognized that to maintain her market position she needed to invest capital and even more effort into her company (see Exhibit 5). She was considering at least three options to leverage EJ�s existing resources: a direct marketing approach a PR approach and an optimization and efficiency approach. Unfortunately her available time to devote to a new project was limited and she was only able to engage in�at most�one new project for the foreseeable future. Marketing StrategyThe first option she was considering was to conduct a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign. Considering its rapid growth it was surprising that EJ had never undertaken a marketing campaign. Recently however Gordon had reached out to a number of advertising agencies and specialized marketing companies. There were a few possible marketing channels to explore and she knew that she would need to operate in a number of these channels to be successful. These opportunities included using direct online marketing through Facebook and Google direct mail campaigns search engine optimization and advertising in high-quality magazines that catered to a wealthy audience. While the advertising agencies promised big results Gordon was uncertain about these as advertising for safaris was very competitive and relatively expensive. For example dozens of firms advertised safaris on Google and Facebook which drove up the cost for all competitors. Likewise direct mail campaigns were expensive to mount due to high fixed costs for graphic designers and content development as well as high costs to print and mail. However the benefit of an advertising-based approach was that the average cost to acquire a new customer could be determined over time. After Gordon determined this information the advertising campaigns could be increased or decreased over time to fit the available resources in her sales team.Altogether Gordon estimated that to test the profitability of an advertising strategy she would need to spend at least $100000 and likely closer to $150000. Due to high fixed costs for graphic design coding and agency fees a lower spend would simply waste resources and limit the ability to draw conclusive results. From her research she estimated that it would cost at least $800 to acquire each new customer. Relative to the other two proposed strategies Gordon thought this marketing-based strategy would almost certainly provide a quicker payback period.Public Relations StrategyThe second strategic option Gordon had outlined was to dramatically increase her commitment to PR and brand building. In 2009 she had signed a contract with a New York City-based PR firm and she had renewed this annual contract each year since. At the beginning she had seen a great deal of success from the relationship. For example she had been covered by the Wall Street Journal in 2010 and Departures the travel magazine only available to holders of the American Express Platinum charge card in 2012. These articles boosted both EJ�s reputation and revenues. Gordon estimated that they had paid back her investment many times over. However recently she had begun to see weaker results from the PR firm. She suspected that it was due to the fact that the firm had picked up more lucrative clients and that more tour operators were competing for the limited attention of journalists editors and bloggers who covered the safari industry. To continue competing for press attention Gordon knew that she would have to dramatically increase the size of her contract to at least $100000 a year and possibly higher. The added costs would help pay for the types of perks that drew media attention such as exclusive events in Manhattan airfare for journalists to Africa and the sponsorship of luxury events that would attract travel journalists and potential safari clients.The main difference between the type of earned media coverage gained through PR exposure and the paid exposure gained through advertisements was that PR gains were riskier with a possibly higher payout and a longer-lasting boost to reputation. For example spending $100000 in an advertising campaign could lead to results that were largely consistent throughout the months or years of the campaign. In other words each quarter would probably have relatively consistent profits. However investing $100000 in PR could lead to either an all-but-wasted effort or a mention as a top safari provider in Cond� Nast Traveler which could quickly generate millions in revenue and have the long-tail reputation effects of being linked with a pre-eminent luxury travel brand. These long-tail effects included less obvious outcomes such as higher search engine prominence (due to the way Google assigned rankings based on firm prominence). This approach had the longest payback period and the highest risk. However the leads it generated were likely to be higher-quality leads that were not a burden on the sales team�s time and effort. It could also raise EJ�s visibility within the tour operator industry.Optimization StrategyThe third strategic option was to engage in an optimization program for her firm�s operations. While this program would not be oriented towards increasing revenues it would hopefully contribute to increasing profits through cost reductions and increased employee efficiency. As EJ grew at a 60-per-cent annual rate from 2009 to 2017 the systems put in place to manage both the sales process and sales support were often designed as temporary rather than long-term solutions. For example there was little formalized knowledge management and much of the firm�s critical knowledge of safari properties DMC owners and safari camp managers resided informally with individual employees. Knowledge was transferred ad hoc by requesting information in meetings or via group-chat threads. Gordon hoped to formalize this proprietary knowledge through an internal database that would make the information more easily accessible. Another ongoing issue was improving communication between sales agents and sales support staff who were internally called ops managers. Gordon�s vision of having the best customer service necessitated hiring more ops managers than was standard for the industry. They handled trip and booking details client communications and client administrative work. EJ used one ops manager for every two sales agents which was higher than the industry average. But even with a seemingly robust system in place EJ employees were busier than Gordon would have liked. She firmly believed in keeping her employees to a 40-hour workweek but had had a difficult time achieving that target with the sustained growth over the past few years.To improve efficiency Gordon envisioned custom-built customer relationship management (CRM) software that would automatically create customer travel documents and engage in automated client communications. This would save ops managers and sales staff from having to create a number of semi-customized client documents potentially saving hours of labour from every client inquiry and booking. She knew a capable software engineer who had estimated a cost of $100000 to build the content management system (CMS). This approach came with a number of risks such as the software not performing as expected or employees not finding value in the software. On the other hand Gordon believed that she could expect at least a 5-per-cent boost to employee productivity as well as other benefits such as improved client experience; increased employee retention; and lower stress for her as the executive who typically had to step in to solve problems.The DecisionThe safari tour operator industry had become more competitive in previous years. The increased pressure had not yet begun to affect EJ�s meteoric growth but Gordon believed that all signs pointed to difficulties ahead. She wondered how the safari market would play out over the next few years. Should she spend her hard-earned capital by investing in a new strategic project for EJ? If so in which possible project should she invest? As she thought about these critical issues Gordon looked over the lights of the Cape Town cityscape and briefly enjoyed one of the greatest job perks in the world�travelling for business to some of the most beautiful and unique places on the planet.Exhibit 1: Map of Common Safari DestinationsNote: Rep. = Republic; Dem. = Democratic; countries and national parks mentioned in the case are noted in larger font sizes.Source: Created by the author using a map from The World Factbook s.v. �Political Africa� accessed August 1 2018 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/political/pdf/africa.pdf.

He wanted Maheshwari to use the management science tools he had learned in his engineering course to determine the bus frequencies and number of buses required to meet passenger demand between various stops. Maheshwari needed to consider reliability cost and safety and how these aspects might be improved. Shrouti suggested that Maheshwari begin by studying the operational planning used by the Indore Bus Rapid Transit System (Indore BRTS).URBAN TRANSIT IN INDIAIndia was one of the fastest growing economies of the world with a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.024 per cent per year. The majority of India’s population lived in rural areas (68.8 per cent) although the share of the urban population was expected to increase substantially rising to 58 per cent of the population (875 million people) by 2050 according to 2011 estimates.With urbanization increasing improving public transport was a priority especially because ownership of private vehicles was also increasing in India leading to city congestion and pollution. In urban areas buses were the most efficient and easiest mode of transport. India was reported to have over 1.75 million registered buses in 2016. Of those the public sector operated 170000 which transported approximately 70 million people per day.In an annual survey of household spending on utility and sustainable products in India both rural and urban buses were reported as the most used form of transport with 62 per cent of urban households and 66 per cent of rural spending on this form of transit. Auto rickshaw was noted as the second most common means of transportation in both urban (47 per cent) and rural households (38 per cent).Public bus transport was not responding quickly to the rising travel demand. India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs provided financial assistance to 11 cities for the construction of 504 kilometres of bus rapid transit (BRT) of which about 245 kilometres were operational and the remaining still under construction.Bus Rapid TransitBRT was the most common mode of public transportation in mid-size cities around the world. The system relied on a segregated infrastructure with dedicated lanes busways and stations efficient fare collection rapid and frequent bus operations and easy boarding and alighting facilities for the passengers. BRT vehicles travelled in exclusive lanes—a corridor “where busses run on a dedicated right-of-way such as a bus lane reserved for busses on an arterial road or a freeway.” The exclusive travel lanes and fewer stations than used in standard networks helped the buses to escape congestion on mixed roads considerably reducing their travel times variability in scheduling and rate of accidents. The bus service blended the efficiency of rail with the versatility of buses making the system fast and safe yet cost effective. BRT was also a flexible system which could be enhanced incrementally.The BRT could be an effective transport service particularly for cities in developing countries with large transit-dependent populations and minimal financial capital. Many urban centres around the world—for example Bogotá Colombia; Guangzhou China; Jakarta Indonesia; and Delhi Pune and Ahmedabad India—had developed BRT networks. The system also helped to address environmental concerns. One-fourth of greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the transport industry. To reduce the associated environmental and health challenges and to decrease energy consumption in travel public transport services needed to be provided as an alternative to private cars providing a service that was safer more accessible convenient and economically attractive. Another advantage to public transit systems was that they allowed economically vulnerable sections of society who could not afford their own vehicles to travel safely and comfortably at affordable rates.To make public transit attractive government agencies needed to plan and manage the infrastructure so the service could cope with increasing demand. However according to studies an ability to accommodate passenger capacity at peak hours was the most significant issue in developing countries. The dilemma could be resolved by increasing fleet size and service frequency at peak hours but the solution required a trade-off between public service and increased expenses for the operator. Sustainability of the service required that both be taken care of. When planning operations for BRT networks many of the options concerned how the public bus service was developed: (1) sufficient capacity to handle expected passenger demand (2) speed of service to minimize travel times and (3) frequency of service to limit waiting time.Meticulous scheduling was needed to maintain the high quality of a BRT service. BRT operations managers usually scheduled the frequency of service for each of the bus routes. To achieve a certain frequency the headway—the time between two consecutive buses leaving the initial station—was calculated at periodic intervals for specified periods of time and operators decided on and maintained this headway on each bus route. The important performance characteristics for a BRT were reliability frequency capacity safety and costs. Reliability was measured as a percentage of bus arrivals within a stipulated delay time and was dependent on traffic conditions on the route. Frequency was the main factor in maintaining reliability and was managed by keeping an appropriate headway. Capacity utilization was the third performance characteristic; optimal capacity utilization could reduce operating costs. The fourth performance characteristic was the total cost of operations which comprised both the investment and operating costs. Operating costs included transportation (the direct costs of operating the buses vehicle maintenance and garages) general and administration costs marketing and advertising taxes and licences and insurance. Last but not least safety was a high priority performance characteristic.Indore BRTS: BACKGROUNDThe Indore BRTS branded as iBUS was started in 2007 under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a city modernization scheme launched by the Government of India. The city of Indore the commercial and educational hub of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was plagued with poor traffic conditions including modest road infrastructure erratic traffic and insufficient public transportation. Increasing commercial and trade-related activities had resulted in a remarkable growth in population and a consequent demand for efficient and reliable public transportation (see Exhibit 1). The BRTS was thus launched to enhance the city’s roads improve traffic conditions encourage the public to use public transportation and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.AICTSL initiated the development of Indore BRTS on a public–private partnership model through the legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle. AICTSL submitted the proposal for approval to India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. In August 2007 the Indore Development Authority issued a construction work order for the selected bidder after funding of ₹984.5 million was approved. A single BRT corridor was constructed on the Agra–Bombay (AB) Road in Indore—a project that experienced several delays. Reasons for the delay included acquiring the land for the corridor’s development completing the parallel underground drinking water trunk line and sewage trunk line and dealing with encroachments and the need to remove illegal constructions on the proposed corridor. After the deadline was extended eight times the corridor was completed in May 2013.Indore BRTS started from Niranjanpur a locality on the northern edge of Indore and ran to Rajiv Gandhi Square in south central Indore. The route ran along the AB Road which connected vital business and residential locations. Hence the route was strategically critical and carried the most city traffic (see Exhibit 2). The corridor was 11.57 kilometres long with 21 bus stops (see Exhibits 3–4). The BRT buses travelled one route in two directions: from Niranjanpur to Rajiv Gandhi and in the opposite direction from Rajiv Gandhi to Niranjanpur (see Exhibit 3). BUS SCHEDULING AT INDORE BRTSMaheshwari met with Shrouti to learn about the operation of Indore BRTS. Maheshwari learned that Indore BRTS had a dedicated team that managed the schedules for buses that ran from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Operations started with dispatching five buses from each end of the route at 6:00 a.m. Initially within the first one to two hours they tried to dispatch enough buses running both directions on the BRT corridor to achieve the desired frequency. At any given time 25–35 buses were in active operation; the remaining buses were used to keep operations running smoothly. Some of the buffer buses were kept at intermediate stops so that if a running bus went out of service on the corridor a buffer bus could replace the out of service bus as soon as possible.The schedulers determined peak and non-peak hours of demand based on data from the previous few days (see Exhibits 5–6). The hourly demand for transit followed a normal distribution with a standard deviation close to 20 per cent of the mean. Ridership on weekdays was greater than it was on weekends.All buses had a global positioning system (GPS) for navigation with radio-frequency identification (RFID). Information from the RFID tags and from live cameras at each bus stop allowed the schedulers to continuously track all buses from the control station. A headway of approximately 3–5 minutes was maintained during peak hours and 7–10 minutes during non-peak hours. Based on the live information the scheduling team could coordinate bus dispatch from their respective depots and guide the drivers in maintaining appropriate headway. The bus drivers were also trained to adjust their speeds to align with the bus ahead to maintain the required headway.Indore BRTS had two groups of bus drivers: one group worked in 12-hour shifts and the other worked 8-hour shift. Drivers on the 12-hour shifts normally began their day at 8:00 a.m. specifically to work peak hours. Drivers who worked 8-hour shifts began at 6:00 a.m. on most days. Drivers worked approximately six days a week getting four days of leave each month.At the end of each day the buses were docked at the Niranjanpur depot where crews washed and sanitized the buses then did a general technical and safety checkup. If an issue arose with a bus while in operation a team of mechanics was available at each end of the BRT corridor to respond to the problem and carry out small repairs. According to the company’s contract with the bus leasing agency each bus could be operated up to 1200 kilometres per week.Maheshwari was satisfied with the information he gathered. He was excited to develop workable solutions for Indore BRTS’s operational problems although the complexity of the problem did worry him. His priority was to develop a solution based on management science using the sample demand data he was given to estimate headway and bus deployment for both directions of the route.EXHIBIT 1: INDORE Bus Rapid Transit System DETAILSNote: mm = millimetres; BHP = brake horsepower; BS = Bharat StageSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: INDORE Bus Rapid Transit System MAPNote: The yellow-coloured stretch of the Bus Rapid Transit corridor indicates slow moving traffic.Source: Open Street Map contributors Open Street Map under Creative Commons licence CC BY-SA 2.0 accessed March 22 2021 https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions? engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=22.6828%2C75. 8574%3B22. 7708%2C75. 9015#map=13/22.7282/75.8848.EXHIBIT 3: Indore Bus Rapid Transit System BUS STOPSNote: km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service Limited; Sq. = SquareSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: Indore Bus Rapid Transit System Bus STOP FeaturesSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: Origin–Destination DEMAND MATRIX For PEAK HOURS (7:30 A.M. to 11:30 A.M.) in number of passengersNote: *distance is measured from the origin (Rajiv Gandhi) to the specified stop; the number of passengers is the total number of passengers travelling between an origin (row) and destination (column) over the measured period; km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service LimitedSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 6: Origin–Destination DEMAND MATRIX For NON-PEAK HOURS (11:30 a.M. to 14:30 p.m.) in number of passengersNote: *distance is measured from the origin (Rajiv Gandhi) to the specified stop; the number of passengers is the total number of passengers travelling between an origin (row) and destination (column) over the measured period; km = kilometres; AICTSL = Atal Indore City Transport Service LimitedSource: Company files.

They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!This sounded like a threat which it was presumably intended to be. However only weeks before the picture had looked rosier for Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and its chief executive officer (CEO) Ian Read. In the fiscal year 2017 Pfizer had successfully maintained its position as the leading global pharmaceutical corporation in terms of its revenue from pharmaceutical products of US$52.8 billion (see Exhibit 1). Nevertheless in the last few years Pfizer had had many setbacks other than those generated by the president’s threat. For example a comprehensively planned merger with Allergan Plc (Allergan) had to be stopped and competitors were closing in on Pfizer’s leading position (see Exhibit 2). In addition drug patents were about to expire and the company’s entrance into new emerging markets was creating many problems. However the entire pharmaceutical industry not just Pfizer was being challenged by various issues. While corporations were recording decreasing global average returns on investment (10.1 per cent in 2010 and 3.2 per cent in 2018) they were also experiencing increased research and development (R&D) costs ($1.2 billion in 2010 and $2.0 billion in 2017). Furthermore companies from other industries—such as the electronic device producer Philips—were entering the market and some emerging-market companies were becoming unexpectedly strong. Given these challenges Read needed answers to some key questions: Do these changes mark a turning point for the whole industry? Does Pfizer need to act and if so how? The pharmaceutical INDUSTRYThe pharmaceutical industry was complex with some important trends. Globally in 2018 pharmaceuticals represented more than 16 per cent of health expenditures. In 2017 global sales were recorded at $1.2 trillion (see Exhibits 3 and 4) and the demand for pharmaceuticals was rising. Historically the United States has been the country with the highest spending on pharmaceuticals with an average per-person spend of $1162 in 2017. Viewed with respect to global pharmaceutical sales in 2018 the United States was the biggest market with a share of 48 per cent. Europe (including Russia and Turkey) accounted for 22 per cent; Japan accounted for 8 per cent; Latin America accounted for 5 per cent; and the regions of Africa Asia (excluding Japan) and Australia accounted for 17 per cent (see Exhibit 5). Health-care spending was known to be increasing for a variety of reasons and this increase suggested that demand for pharmaceuticals was likely also to be rising.First an ageing population led to increased demand (see Exhibit 6). Second the supply of biologics had increased substantially amounting to 25 per cent of the total pharmaceutical market in 2017 (see Exhibit 7). Biologics were highly effective drugs for certain classes of disease such as cancers rheumatism infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis diabetes and neurological disorders. They represented a very expensive form of treatment usually lasting around a year and with costs averaging $25000 per patient. Biologic drugs were produced using animal cells or microorganisms and the molecule sizes were many times those of conventionally synthesized drugs. A study by the consultancy company McKinsey concluded that the development and production costs for biologics as well as the complexity of a biologic drug equated with those of building a business jet. Due to their efficacy biologics were in high demand. Third globally increasing awareness of the importance of early health checks the use of prophylactic drugs (e.g. vaccinations) and better information availability had all further increased demand.Finally favourable growth rates in pharmaceutical product purchases had been predicted several years ago for developing markets (see Exhibit 8). However the road to success in developing countries had in fact been bumpy for Western pharmaceutical companies. Local producers (mainly generics producers) often retained a higher market share and more power in these developing markets than Western pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore relatively weak patent law slowing economic growth intense local competition and government efforts to reduce health-care costs (or at least to prevent their growth) had reduced company expectations of rapid success. CompetitionIn general the pharmaceuticals market could be divided into two main categories: prescription drugs which could only be prescribed by doctors; and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs which could be purchased without prescription because they were considered comparatively safe in terms of self-diagnosis and self-medication. The latter included products such as painkillers nasal sprays food supplements and vitamins. Under some jurisdictions these could also be sold in supermarkets and drugstores. In the United States OTCs made up 16 per cent of the total market in 2013 similar to the percentage in other major markets (see Exhibit 9).Within the prescription drug market a further distinction was usually made between “innovative” drugs (also called “branded” drugs) and “generics.” Innovative drugs underwent extensive R&D processes and clinical trials using humans and animals. In the United States once they were approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) innovative drugs were patent protected giving the developer firm the exclusive right to market the product for several years (20 years in the United States). In rare cases extensions were requested; for instance if a molecule had been substantially modified. Patents protected the particular chemical structure only. Other innovative pharmaceutical companies that had developed a different drug treating the same disease could thus apply for a distinct patent and this resulted in “between-patent competition.” As soon as a firm lost patent protection for a drug (i.e. for the active ingredient) other firms could market a product based on the same active ingredient as long as FDA approval and bioequivalence standards were met. Such drugs were called generics and they resulted in “within-patent competition.” Generics were marketed under different names from those of the original branded products. Generic copies of biologics were called biosimilars; due to the specifics of biologic manufacture it was not possible to copy them precisely (as could be done relatively easily in the case of conventional or synthetic drugs). Copying biologics could only result in similar but not identical drugs.The roles of doctors and patientsBecause self-medication with prescription drugs was illegal patients needed to go to doctors or hospitals to obtain them. In most health-care systems doctors were relatively free to decide on treatment and medication. They normally had the choice between different substances and would suggest a particular drug depending on availability. To save on costs many countries encouraged the prescription of generics. In 2017 these made up only 10 per cent of total prescription sales (in $) but generics had been outgrowing branded drugs for many years (see Exhibit 10). In general doctors tended to choose products that they feel provided the best treatment for a given patient. The market power of expensive innovative drugs was sustained by the fact that in most countries there were no regulations concerning cost cutting or a preference for generics. Moreover depending on country and disease patients were frequently not required to pay for drugs because the state or private insurance schemes covered this expense. As doctors had a large influence on which brand was purchased pharmaceutical firms’ marketing activities tended to be targeted at doctors. Moreover depending on the law the extent to which direct customer marketing of prescription drugs was permitted varied. Sales representatives had always been the main communication channel between pharmaceutical firms and doctors and firms invested in sales to such a considerable extent that doctors from time to time complained about over-marketing. Many firms however were not prepared to reduce the size of their sales forces unless the competition did the same: they were trapped in a “marketing-and-sales arms race.” As a result pharmaceutical firms had in recent years spent significantly more on prescription sales activities (including expenditure on sales marketing and administrative costs) than on R&D. For instance in 2017 Pfizer spent $7.6 billion on R&D but an enormous $45.4 billion on prescription sales (see Exhibit 11).In 2010 the US Congress demanded greater transparency in marketing activities in order to reduce the number of corruption allegations. In response to the demands of Congress Pfizer cut down on payments to US health-care professionals—by 11 per cent in 2012—and reduced spending on company-sponsored dinners by more than half. Since 2014 firms in the United States had been required to enter payments to doctors into a public database. In addition to these tighter regulations doctors had become less welcoming towards sales representatives; they said they did not feel well informed by them and so the doctors instead tended to favour online information. A recent study revealed that 65 per cent of physicians were interested in getting clinical information online. Doctors also generally lacked the time to meet with sales representatives because they were under pressure to see increasing numbers of patients.In Europe such marketing activities were also limited by governments. For example in Switzerland each pharmaceutical company could only target a given doctor once a year. In Slovakia the government introduced a law that stated that doctors were required to pay a 19 per cent tax on both financial and in-kind benefits (e.g. meals events hotels) received from pharmaceutical companies.Yet the need for marketing activities became more important in particular as the trend of self-medication was increasing. This was also related to the growing amount of information available online—a source frequently used by patients in addition to or even in preference to their doctors’ advice. This was a delicate issue for pharmaceutical firms because in Europe direct marketing could not be targeted at patients. Pharmaceutical companies could circumvent such regulations by using new digital tools such as patient and physician portals and by promoting social-media posts. Extensive information about specific drugs was offered online and pharmaceutical companies also provided information during discussions on various online health platforms. Nevertheless when compared to some other industries by 2018 pharmaceutical companies had not yet taken full advantage of social and other online media. The development of drugs and the patenting processIn 2018 most pharmaceutical companies were highly vertically integrated compared to other industries and so were carrying out R&D drug production and marketing and sales activities themselves. In terms of its R&D the innovative sector of the pharmaceutical industry was like the oil industry a “self-liquidating” industry: both had to continually develop new products and both experienced long product lead times. In 2015 the pharmaceutical industry dedicated 15 per cent of its net sales to R&D (see Exhibit 12). In the United States alone more than $48 billion was spent in 2015 on pharmaceutical R&D (see Exhibit 13) a long and resource-intensive process involving several phases. In 2016 the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) estimated that it took on average 12 years for a product to reach the market (see Exhibit 15).In general the process started with the identification of a target (e.g. a protein) in the human body upon which the drug would be required to act and the development of an initial formulation (preparation). These preparations were then repeatedly tested and modified (up to 10000 times) in order to achieve the desired effect and minimize side effects. If preliminary results were promising a patent was registered in order to obviate potential competition. These new chemical entities (NCEs) were subject to pre-clinical testing often on animals. The objective was to investigate the drug’s effectiveness and any possible side effects. This process of laboratory testing would take about three and a half years. The pre-clinical test results would subsequently be evaluated by the relevant health authority and if appropriate permission would be given for further (clinical) tests. In the United States the regulatory agency was the FDA comparable to the European Drug Agency (EDA). On average only five out of every 10000 NCEs would make it to the clinical testing stage from which point on they would be designated “investigational new drugs.” In 2016 the average cost of finding and developing a new drug amounted to approximately $1.9 billion. If Phases I to III of clinical testing (duration about 6 years) showed positive results in terms of effectiveness and side effects a new drug would be approved for marketing; this last stage could take up to two and a half further years. However reaching this stage did not necessarily mean that the drug would stay on the market in its current form. It continued to be subject to further tests the results of which might require the drug to be modified or in some cases taken off the market completely. The new-product success rate was one or two per 10000. The lengthy launch period for new drugs was the subject of an ongoing debate and in 2017 the US president announced the government’s intention to speed up the FDA approval process.In the past patent law had made it possible for many pharmaceutical firms to earn high revenues from just a few popular products. The development of these so-called “blockbuster” drugs (drugs with more than $1 billion in yearly revenues) had long been considered essential for the success of global pharmaceutical firms (see Exhibits 16 and 17). Firms would naturally try to make maximum use of patent protection and new globally standardized products tended to be patented and brought to market simultaneously worldwide. In exceptional situations governments would use a patent without the consent of the patent holder in order to produce a drug and make it available to patients (a process known as “compulsory licensing”).An innovative branded drug in a new therapeutic area was known as a “breakthrough” or “first-in-class” drug. New drugs in existing therapeutic areas were known as “follow-ons” or “me-too” drugs. Pfizer’s Viagra for example was a breakthrough drug when it was launched in 1998 and the company profited substantially from it until 2003 when Bayer introduced a similar product Levitra (an example of between-patent competition).When patent protection ended other firms were free to start selling generic copies of the same chemical. Usually patent expiry led to a dramatic drop in revenue referred to as the “patent cliff.” Within-patent competition was initiated when generics producers started selling the generic copy at much lower prices. Patent expiry could have devastating effects. Between 2003 and 2011 Pfizer’s blockbuster Lipitor yielded annual revenues of $10–12 billion but when Pfizer lost Lipitor’s patent protection in 2010 sales dropped to $4 billion in 2012 and reached a low of $1.7 billion in 2016. In 2017 alone Pfizer lost patents for several key products including Lyrica and Viagra. Global-pharmaceuticals forecasts anticipated that in 2023 across all companies $67 billion of sales would be at risk due to patent expiries. In 2017 the figure was $32 billion. The biggest generics producer was Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva) and other big players were Mylan NV (Mylan) Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Sun) and Sandoz International GmbH (Sandoz). Often generics manufacturers tried to make use of any scientific progress that had taken place since the development of the original patented drug. Consequently generics could sometimes be substantially superior to the originally branded products in terms of effectiveness and side effects. In contrast to branded products generics were profitable despite lower price levels because their manufacture sidestepped a large proportion of the expensive development and test phases. Due to their lower prices many governments had taken steps to improve the market position of generics resulting in a rising proportion of generics in the global drugs market. Recent patent disputes in emerging markets such as Brazil and India were considered a threat to the traditional patent system. In 2018 India was the biggest global generics market in terms of the export of and demand for generics. Although India adopted new patent law after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 the way in which the new ruling was interpreted made it unfavourable to innovative (international) pharmaceutical companies. In 2012 for example the Indian national court upheld the position of the Indian government and refused requests from Novartis International AG (Novartis) and Bayer AG (Bayer) for patent exclusivity for two drugs stating that these could not be classified as “new inventions” under Indian patent law. Under compulsory licensing Indian generics producers were then allowed to produce generics for these products by paying a license fee of about 6–8 per cent of the annual revenue to the innovator firm. In 2013 the Indian Patent Office granted the generics drugs producer Cipla the right to produce Pfizer’s patent-expiring cancer drug Sutent. These cases were decisive to the future of Indian patent law and pharmaceutical firms feared spillover effects into other markets. Because many important patents had expired sales of Indian generics surged. But problems such as poor hygiene and defective processes in many Indian plants hampered the country’s generics exports.The supply chainFrom manufacturing through to use by the patient drugs in development went through a number of steps.ProductionThe production base for most drugs consisted of fine chemicals. For branded products fine chemicals accounted for 10–15 per cent of the final price; for generics it accounted for up to 30 per cent. On average half of all pharmaceutical products globally were manufactured by the pharmaceutical firms themselves; the other half were produced by firms in the fine-chemicals industry. The chemicals consisted of standardized or customized molecules plus active agents that were processed into the final drug in tablet or fluid form. Fine chemicals were essentially raw materials or mass-produced products generally made to a high standard by a variety of firms. As such there were many potential suppliers. No single chemical firm had achieved a dominant market position. The pharmaceuticals industry was by far the largest buyer of fine chemicals and frequently a substantial percentage of a chemical company’s revenue depended on just a few pharmaceutical customers. Drugs manufacturers for their part had to be able to guarantee high product quality. A given drug required every factory to have precisely defined processes and permissions that were checked regularly. If a given health authority judged that there were variations in quality safety or effectiveness product authorization was immediately withdrawn.Distribution and PricingWholesalers and pharmacies ensured that products reached patients. However there were considerable differences between the United States’ and European markets. In most European markets the health authorities set maximum mark-ups for pharmacies and wholesalers whereas in the United States there was more flexibility. On average the drug manufacturer received around 66 per cent of the sale price the wholesaler around 5 per cent the pharmacy about 20 per cent and the state around 9 per cent (in value-added tax and other taxes). The wholesalers would buy directly from the drug manufacturers and distribute the products to hospitals and pharmacies. To carry out this function the wholesalers needed a license and had to conform to certain criteria—such as keeping a safety stock so that they would be able to deliver within a short time frame. Wholesalers who organized the logistics of delivering drugs to pharmacies hospitals and health centres delivered the majority of drugs. Europe was dominated by a multichannel system in which multiple wholesalers would sell a given product. Large pharmacy chains specialized pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies were also able to some extent to buy drugs directly from the manufacturer. The growing importance of chains and mail-order houses in Europe however was leading to an increasing trend towards bypassing the distributor. Wholesalers had been experiencing increased price pressure resulting in tighter competition. In Europe in 2014 the average wholesale margin was around 5–10 per cent but this varied greatly between countries (e.g. in Sweden it was 3 per cent and in the Netherlands it was 23 per cent). This pressure was to some extent due to rising packaging delivery and transportation costs. Increased competition had also resulted from the tendency for drug manufacturers to establish just-in-time production systems which had caused the industry both in the United States and Europe to undergo substantial consolidation over the last few decades. Pricing was more critical for generics manufacturers than for innovative pharmaceutical companies. The competitive generics environment played a major role in pricing. An example was the effect exerted by wholesalers and parallel imports: the wholesaler could promote the distribution of higher volumes of drugs. Some wholesalers added service activities such as market data gathering processing and packaging to their core business; some even integrated vertically both downstream and upstream and had taken over production and pharmacy functions. This strategy however was disliked by national health authorities and was therefore highly restricted in some countries. The preclusion of parallel imports also had an impact on prices and revenue. The fragmentation of the European Union (EU) pharmaceutical market (and with this its pricing levels) led to parallel trading where firms could buy drugs in a country with lower price levels and resell them in countries with higher price levels. Parallel trading was estimated to amount to $4.5 billion in 2016. The sale of parallel imports in the pharmacy market amounted to 1.6 per cent in Belgium 25.5 percent in Denmark 8.5 per cent in Germany and 1.9 per cent in Poland. The role of the pharmacy varied from country to country. Prescription drugs were generally available only through pharmacies but the degree of influence of the pharmacist on the choice of drug or brand depended on the particular legal environment. Generally only doctors could decide on the drug prescribed but in many countries the pharmacist was allowed to replace a branded product with an unbranded one containing the same active ingredients. Regional DifferencesIn 2013 state-supported compulsory health insurance existed in the majority of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. On average 58 per cent of medication expenses in OECD countries were financed publicly (e.g. in Germany 77 per cent; in the United States 48 per cent). Patients and/or private health insurance (see Exhibit 18) funded the other 42 per cent. Health systems in Europe and the United States were different. In the United States the great majority of the population was privately insured as there was no or little public health insurance. Moreover until 2017 the US government had rarely commented on drug price regulation. In 2018 however the US president announced when meeting with US-based CEOs of pharmaceutical giants “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.”Traditionally the US market had always been the most important market for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide yielding high prices and margins. In Europe state health systems were the principal purchasers of drugs but this was becoming less of a positive for the pharmaceutical industry than it used to be. Due to increasing public health-care spending and tight national budgets European governments had in recent years become active in the areas of price regulation and negotiation. For the pharmaceutical industry these measures had taken on vast proportions. Tom McKillop the CEO of AstraZeneca Plc (Astra Zeneca) from 1999 to 2006 spoke of an “extortion-like” situation. Felix Raeber at the time head of European media relations for Novartis described the situation as one where the pharmaceutical companies were “without control” over pricing. One regulation method involved the state and manufacturer agreeing to set fixed prices. This meant lengthy price and reimbursement negotiations which could delay product launch significantly. The German government in 2005 for example became involved in price regulation and demanded sweeping price reductions. For example Lipitor patients would in future receive reimbursement up to a certain amount only. The government also asserted however that if the price of Lipitor were to be reduced by a further 38 per cent patients would receive full reimbursement. Pfizer implemented the price reduction which had a drastic effect on its profits. It did mean though that the product could be kept on the market.  Governments in Europe set prices by what was known as “referencing.” Products with similar therapeutic effects were grouped together and a lower all-in price separately determined for each group. The reimbursement system was then aligned such that the patients paid for the drugs if the price was higher than the reference price. Another measure taken by governments was known as an “all-in price markdown” that limited a product’s profit margins—one such was the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme system developed in the United Kingdom.In 2012 an average price range of 30 per cent over or under the EU average price existed. Each country set different prices; hence price control within the EU resulted in parallel imports and lost profits for pharmaceuticals corporations. Governments via their respective health-care reimbursement systems influenced not only prices but also product demand. Usually patients would get drugs expenses paid for only if the drug was classified as reimbursable by their national health-care system. Many countries established so-called “positive lists” where all products on the list were normally reimbursed and/or “negative lists” where all products on the list would not be reimbursed. When a prescription drug was not reimbursed the demand for this drug was thereby automatically limited—as patients would shy away from drugs they had to finance out of their own pockets.Exhibit 1: Revenues of the Pharmaceutial SEgment of the top 10 Pharmaceutical Companies 2007 2012 and 2017 [in US$ millions]Notes: *Including generic drugs.

We wait in lines at the campus cafeteria to board an airplane in the emergency room and when we call a company for customer service. We even wait for applications to be initiated and processed by our smartphone processors and our online orders wait to be fulfilled at companies� warehouses before being shipped to us. How long we wait in line depends on several factors and parameters. The wait may be a result of the number of servers working to serve us and the amount of time it takes to serve each individual customer (i.e. the system�s capacity). It also depends on how many customers arrive at any given time (i.e. the system�s demand or flow rate) but most importantly queues form due to random variations in arrival patterns and service times. For example if a small call centre receives one call exactly every 10 minutes and its customer service representative takes exactly eight minutes to resolve that call it seems intuitive that the next customer to call would not wait. After all the customer service representative would have finished the previous call two minutes before the next customer calls. On the other hand if the same call centre receives one call every 10 minutes on average and processes that call in eight minutes on average a customer may call while the representative is still dealing with the previous customer. We have formulas to calculate the probability of that happening the average wait time and the size of this system�s queue. (The average wait may be around 32 minutes and an average of 3.2 customers may be waiting at any given time.) What a difference randomness brings to a system!Often a system that has a low level of service (e.g. slow service or too few staff) may be very inexpensive to run (as the small call centre presented previously) but it may incur a high level of customer dissatisfaction leading to lost future business and rising costs for processing complaints. Adding extra staff (thereby improving the service level) or improving service time (e.g. via automation) can be costly; however either change will tend to reduce the wait lines and attract more consumers. Because of this trade-off a common managerial decision is to determine a service level that optimally balances the cost of service and the cost of waiting.BASIC QUEUING THEORY AND FORMULASAny queuing system (see Exhibit 1) is composed of the following key elements: a source population that generates arrivals into the system (e.g. customers goods calls or patients); a queue (e.g. a wait line inventory or a waiting area); servers (e.g. clerks machines operators or physicians); and an exit (e.g. leaving the system or returning to the source). A common notation used to classify queuing systems is called �Kendall notation� (see Exhibit 2). A queuing system can be easily understood by using its A/P/s/K/n/D format. Where �A� stands for the arrival process �P� for the service or process distribution �s� for the number or servers or workstations �K� for the number of places in the queue �n� for the size of the population and �D� for the arrival discipline. The arrival processes and the service time distributions are most commonly of the types described in Exhibit 3.ELEMENTS OF WAITING LINES (QUEUING SYSTEMS)PopulationThe sourcing population can be either finite or infinite. In a finite scenario the arrival of an entity into a system can affect the rate of arrival for the remaining entities in a population. On the other hand an infinite population is considered large enough that the arrival of an entity will not affect the rate of arrivals for the remaining population. ArrivalsArrivals are an external source of variability in the system. The mean arrival rate  (lambda) refers to how many arrivals enter the system in a given unit of time (e.g. customers/hour stock-keeping units [SKUs]/minute calls/minute or patients/day). Arrival rates are often described as being Poisson-distributed. The inverse of the arrival rate is the inter-arrival time () which represents the time between consecutive arrivals. The inter-arrival time assuming a Poisson arrival rate is exponentially distributed leading to random independently distributed arrivals. QueueThe maximum available size of the queue can be finite and infinite. It is more common to assume an infinite maximum queue size. Queue DisciplineServers may collect entities from their queues according to different rules with �first in first out� (FIFO) being the most common. However priority rules may be in place depending on many factors such as preferential status expiry dates severity of disease and others. Customer BehaviourIn addition to waiting in line units entering the system may also choose to balk renege or jockey. Balking takes place when a unit does not join the system. For example a student observes the cafeteria�s current wait line and decides not to join it. Reneging happens when a unit enters the system but after waiting for a period of time decides to leave the system without being serviced. For example you call your mobile phone carrier�s customer service wait for your turn to talk to a representative but hang up after 10 minutes of waiting. Jockeying happens when units that entered the system change waiting lines due to differences in perceived size hoping to reduce time waiting to be served. Waits at highway toll stations tend to lead to this behaviour in impatient drivers.ServiceServers are another internal source of variability in a queuing system. Similar to the arrivals we have the mean service rate  (mu) which refers to the service capacity or the number of entities the server can process in a given unit of time (e.g. customers/hour SKUs/minute calls/minute or patients/day). Also note its inverse the service time  which represents the time the server takes to process one entity. A measurement of the variation of the service time is often described in percentage terms as a coefficient of variation  being the ratio of the standard deviation  to the mean service time . When the standard deviation is zero (_ = 0) the coefficient of variation is also zero (i.e. ) the service time has no variation and the service rate is therefore constant. When the standard deviation is equal to the mean service time ( then  and the service time is exponentially distributed. If the coefficient or variation differs from one we may not assume exponential service times and may instead make use of general distributions. Moreover a queuing system can also have a single server (e.g. s = 1) or multiple servers (e.g. s = 6).Performance MeasuresThe focus of this note is an infinite population and FIFO discipline infinitely sized queues so we will omit that part of the notation. Also we assume that customers are patient i.e. they do not balk renege or jockey.When analyzing queues we are most often interested in determining the performance indicators related to four categories: (1) the probability of having a certain number of units in a queue or in a system (2) the number of units in the system (e.g. how many patients are waiting in the waiting room) (3) utilization rates and (4) wait times. We will introduce some formulas for such indicators using the following notations: : Arrival rate (mean number of units/time-unit): Service rate of one server (mean number of units/time-unit): Utilization rate (system congestion rate): Average length of the queue (number of units in the queue): Average length of the system (number of units in the system): Average time spent in a queue per customer (in time units): Average time spent in system per customer (in time units): Probability of having n units in the systemCoefficient of variation: At all times we will assume that the utilization rate is below 100 per cent or . This condition is necessary to achieve what we call a �steady state� meaning the system is stable and the parameters do not change over the foreseeable future. If the utilization rate is above 100 per cent the arrivals (demand) are higher than capacity. In such a scenario the intuitive conclusion is that the queue would grow indefinitely over time.calculating SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURESNow let�s analyze some basic queuing systems by means of the formulas available in the literature. Primarily this analysis can be done using the intuitive and elegant Little�s Law () which states that in a steady state (i.e. fixed parameters over time) the average number of units in a system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time the units spend in a system. This formula can be adapted to any queuing system or any general process where a process inventory (L) flow rates () and cycle times () can be calculated from any combination of two of these measurements. SINGLE-SERVER WAITING LINE MODEL (M/M/1)This system assumes exponential inter-arrival and service times with a single server no restrictions on queue size and a FIFO discipline. Average System Utilization Rate: The ratio between the arrival rate and the service rate:  < 1 for stabilityProbability of having 0 units in the system: 	(100% capacity subtracted by the average utilization rate)Probability of having  units in the system: 	(Probability of having empty system multiplied by the utilization rate of as many independent arrivals you expect)Average time spent in system:  	or The total time in the system (also known as the process cycle time) is related to the difference in service rate (capacity) and arrival rate (demand). Better yet the wait time has an exponential distribution with parameter  which means the wait time is related to the service time (capacity) and the probability of an empty system (i.e. idle time).Average time spent in queue:  or  The total time in the system minus the service time yields the time waiting for service. Operationally the time waiting (non-value-added time) is the difference between the process cycle time and its run time.Average length of the system:  or Using Little�s Law the average number of units in the system is calculated by multiplying the arrival rate by the average time spent in the system. In other words the total inventory of an operation is calculated by multiplying its flow rate (demand) by the process�s cycle time.Average length of the queue:  or  or Using Little�s Law the average number of units in the queue is calculated by multiplying the arrival rate by the average time spent in the queue. This formula also expresses the idea of work-in-process inventory in an operation being the result of the flow rate (demand) times the non-value-added time.As an example students arrive at the parking lot entrance where they must proceed through a pay station to enter the parking lot and park their car. The students patiently form a single line of cars in front of the pay station to wait their turn. Students are served based on a first-come first-served priority rule (the order in which the cars arrive). On average 12 students per hour arrive at the paying station. Student arrivals are best described using a Poisson distribution. The pay station can collect payments from an average of 15 students per hour with the service rate being described by an exponential distribution. The characteristics of the parking lot system are calculated as in Exhibit 4 and the probabilities of n students in the system are shown in Exhibit 5.MULTIPLE-SERVER MARKOVIAN WAITING LINE MODEL (M/M/s) where s = Number of ServersThis system assumes exponential inter-arrival and service times with multiple servers �s� no restrictions on queue size and a FIFO discipline. A performance calculation example can be found in Exhibit 6.Average system utilization rate: We need to multiply the service rate by the number of available servers to determine the system capacity. This calculation accounts for system utilization depending on the number of parallel servers. Before using the formulas ensure that the total service rate is greater than the arrival rate that is s i.e. the system is in a steady state. As seen before if s �  (capacity is smaller than the demand) the waiting line would eventually grow infinitely large. Probability of having 0 units (patients) in the system: Average length of the queue: Average length of the system: Average queue wait time: Average system total time: M/G/1 Queuing ModelsThis queuing system assumes exponential inter-arrival times but does not require the service time distribution to be exponential. In fact no assumptions are needed regarding the service time distributions. The relaxation of the assumption of the exponential service time can be very useful for systems in which the standard deviation ( differs from the mean service time (a characteristic of the exponential distribution). As such one needs only to estimate either the standard deviation ( or the coefficient of variation ( and the mean service time  . The service time is therefore considered �general independent� with a single server no restrictions on queue size and a FIFO discipline. Pollaczek-Khintchine�s famous P-K formula  finds the length of the queue and demonstrates the negative effect of variation in all performance measures. Note that if variance is equal to the service time this formula reduces to the M/M/1 formula for . An example of system performance measures can be found in Exhibit 7.Probability of having 0 units at the queue: Length of the queue: (Pollaczek-Khintchine formula) or Intuition: the larger the variation in the service time the larger the queue.Queue wait time: 		or Length of the system: 			or System total time:  		or M/D/1 Queuing ModelsThis is a special case of the M/G/1 model where there is no variation in service time ( making it a constant or deterministic service. An example of system performance measures can be found in Exhibit 8.Probability of having 0 units in the queue: Length of the queue: 			or Intuition: without variation the length of the queue in the deterministic case is smaller than in the M/M/1 and M/G/1 models. For example compare the M/D/1 model�s  to the P-K formula.Queue wait time: 		or Length of the system: 			or System total time:  		or G/G/1 Queuing ModelsWith greater variation now introduced into the previous M/G/1 system we may now have two sources of variation the inter-arrival time and the service time distribution. As such the G/G/1 model tends to perform worse than the M/G/1 model when both arrival and service times have great variation. This system makes no assumption in terms of arrival and service distributions; thus we have general independent inter-arrival and service times with single server no restrictions on queue size and a FIFO discipline. There are approximations for some performance indicators as below now requiring the coefficient of variation of both inter-arrival time and service time .Probability of having 0 units at the queue: Length of the queue	 (Marchal�s equation) Intuition: compare it to the P-K formula and you will see how the extra variation influences the length of the queue.Queue wait time: 		 (Kingman�s equation) Or Intuition: In congested systems the queue wait time in the G/G/1 queue is approximately the wait time of the M/M1 queue multiplied by the average variation in the system.Length of the system:  System total time:  	G/G/s Queuing ModelsThe G/G/S queuing models represent by far the most general case where we may add another parameter to the Kingman equation the number of servers as done by Hopp and Spearman�s cycle time approximation formula. This approximation formula provides fast and reliable queue wait-time approximations particularly in congested systems. The other performance metrics rely on Little�s Law. Hopp and Spearman�s formula is a �quick and dirty� approximation often used to provide estimated performance metrics and due to Little�s Law it is often use in operations management for cycle time and work-in-process inventory calculations.Queue wait time: 		Intuition: The wait time in the queue is composed of three factors. The first  is the utilization factor. The busier the system (as measured by  the longer the wait time. The second factor is a capacity factor The more resources (as measured by s number of servers) the shorter the wait. The final factor  is the variation factor. The higher the variation of arrivals and/or service times the longer the wait. Operationally this formula is useful to calculate the non-value-added time of work-in-process inventory. Observe that Hopp and Spearman�s formula converges to the M/M/1 formula for  when the number of servers is one and the coefficient of variation for both arrival () and service () is also one.Length of the queue:	(Little�s Law) Intuition: Work-in-process inventory is approximately the multiplication of the non-value-added time of a process by its flow rate (or demand).System wait time: 		Intuition: Total system wait time is the sum of the wait in queue and the service time. Operationally the cycle time is equal to the non-value-added time plus the run time.Length of the system:	(Little�s Law) Intuition: Similar to the other models the total inventory in a process is the result of cycle time multiplied by the flow rate (demand) in that process. exhibit 1: Queuing system elementsNote:  = arrival rate; service rate.Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit 2: Kendall notation used to classify queuing systemsSource: Created by the case authors.exhibit 3: SYMBOLS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF Queuing system arrival processes and service time distributionsNote: � = infinite; FIFO = first in first out.Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit 4: Spreadsheet for single-server operating characteristicsNote: FIFO = first in first out.Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit5: Probability of having �n� students in the systemSource: Created by the case authors.exhibit 6: Spreadsheet for multiple-server operating characteristics	Note: FIFO = first in first out.Source: Created by the case authors.exhibit 7: Spreadsheet for M/G/1 characteristicsNote: FIFO = first in first out; Std.

He had left his house on the outskirts of BogotÃ¡ Colombia in the city of CajicÃ¡ shortly after 7 a.m. heading to northeast BogotÃ¡. He had arranged a meeting with Stefano Pacini the Plastilene Groupâs chief executive officer (CEO); Fernando Venegas a member of the Plastilene Groupâs shareholdersâ board; and Gabriel Jaramillo vice-president of operations. The goal of the meeting was to define how to address the sustainability challenge that Pacini had entrusted to Estrada. During his journey Estrada thought about how to face the situation in Colombia and the region. The media had demonized plastic due to the impact of its waste on marine ecosystems while members of Colombiaâs Congress had proposed tightening and increasing prohibitions against plastic items. Meanwhile the financial sector questioned companiesâ survival in the sector and there was no clarity about appropriate technologies for plastic waste management. The Plastilene Groupâs large multinational petrochemical suppliers were stunned by the size of the threat against the industry. How could Estrada enhance sustainable innovation strategy within the Plastilene Groupâs structure? How could Pacini enhance corporate entrepreneurship and innovation at the Plastilene Group?A Volatile Uncertain Complex and Ambiguous context At the beginning of 2016 it was estimated that the equivalent of the contents of a plastic garbage truck were dumped into the worldâs rivers and ecosystems every minute eventually ending up in the oceans. In the same year during the World Economic Forum the Ellen MacArthur Foundation declared that by 2050 the oceans would have more plastic than fish. Environmental organizations such as Greenpeace had long been promoting a battle against plastic items. In 2017 a significant proliferation of regulations occurred worldwide with the main objective to reduce the consumption of plastic bags plates glasses cutlery straws and other single-use plastic items. Large mass-consumption multinationals such as Unilever PepsiCo Coca-Cola Company and others ratified their commitments to reduce plastic consumption and use more environmentally friendly packaging: wrappings and containers that were recyclable compostable reusable or manufactured from recycled materials. Such events threatened the stability of global plastic item companies and their supply chains; the countries in which the Plastilene Group operated were not exempt from this reality.Estrada began working at the Plastilene Group at the beginning of 2010. Before his arrival he had managed consulting projects with an international company within the Colombian Ministry of National Education. Estrada had also worked as a business consultant an independent entrepreneur and an executive in private companies. He had served in various management positions as a collaborator of recognized trade services food footwear textiles and clothing companies. By mid-2017 Estrada had been part of the Plastilene Group for seven and a half years initially as a project consultant in the planning and production areas then as an employee. He assumed the role of logistics manager in which he had the opportunity to participate in the implementation of SAP enterprise resource planning software and lead the implementation of logistics co-operation agreements with strategic customers. Estrada had recently led the implementation of the Corporate Management of Purchasing and Materials Planning as a transversal area for all the Plastilene Group companies. The new corporate model made important impacts on cost reduction and the diversification of supply risks. It strengthened strategic relationships with global and local suppliers and directly increased the companyâs profits by reducing the percentage cost of raw materials and more effectively negotiating trade agreements with strategic suppliers. In July 2017 Estrada spoke with the Plastilene Groupâs previous CEO and raised the possibility of working on sustainability in an orderly manner to respond to the general threat facing the plastics industry. However with the appointment of Pacini as CEO the Plastilene Group officially decided to face the growing threat against plastic materials through a sustainability strategy. Estrada was delegated to lead this task.The Plastilene Group: 62 Years of Innovation and LeadershipThe Plastilene Group was part of the Pacini familyâs business group which operated businesses in many sectors including plastic cardboard boxes packaging flower crops granites and marbles. As an organization the Plastilene Group had 62 years of history. It operated production plants in Colombia Ecuador and Guatemala and a US plant was in the preoperational stage. In 2017 its main products included flexible polyethylene packaging polypropylene-laminated films and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets for food beverage and other industrial uses; and flexible films for floriculture. The Plastilene Group also produced post-industrial recycled composites and materials. The organization had served its markets for a long time and they represented its primary income and sources of profit. The following companies comprised the Plastilene Group: Plastilene Laminates Khroma Novalene Altalene Reciclene and Interplast in Colombia; AgroplÃ¡sticos in Ecuador; Technofilms in Guatemala; and Plastilene NA in the United States (see Exhibit 1).The Plastilene Group had been vertically integrated since 2015 when it decided to organize itself in a matrix manner. It had corporate management positions to oversee the functional management in operations logistics and systems finance human resources purchasing and sustainability. Additional company managers were primarily in charge of regional strategy product commercialization and fulfilling legal requirements in each company and region.Forty-two years earlier the entrepreneurial innovative and continuous improvement awareness of its founder had led the Plastilene Group to manage plastic waste that resulted from its plant operations. The organizationâs interest had always been to optimize resources be efficient in processes and ensure that industrial waste could have a new life. This interest had led to Reciclene a company that by 2018 had transformed 3000 tons of post-industrial plastic waste per year and converted it into new raw materials resins straps and tubes. Reciclene marked a line of responsibility in the Plastilene Group. It paved the way so that 100 per cent of plastic waste from factories could be recovered. In the late 1990s the Plastilene Group ventured into the manufacturing of PET sheets a business that allowed it to establish a supply chain of 3000 tons per year from beverage bottlesâ recycled material for the manufacture of agricultural industrial and food packaging.A New Leader a Single CultureIn November 2017 Pacini became CEO of the Plastilene Group. He was the son of the family business groupâs founder and had inherited his fatherâs passions for sailing and operating industrial businesses. While the two interests may have seemed unrelated Paciniâs passion for navigation had led to his awareness of how waste negatively affected the oceans. On several occasions while sailing the Atlantic he had found fishing nets bottles bags and other plastic items. Pacini had been involved with the Plastilene Group for many years having served as a leader in relevant events and in negotiations with both clients and suppliers in significant multinational organizations. He had led the Plastilene Groupâs foray into the Central American market with the opening of Technofilms in 2000. In 2001 Pacini led a vital agreement with the multinational company DuPont de Nemours Inc. for the manufacture of flexible milk packaging for the Latin American region. Pacini led the Plastilene Groupâs technological transformation for which among other actions he developed agreements with the German firm W&H Group one of the worldâs most recognized manufacturers of specialized machinery for the plastic film industry. Pacini had promoted the implementation of SAP enterprise resource planning software which laid the foundations for a future digital transformation within the Plastilene Group. Pacini was a member of the Plastilene Groupâs board of directors and was involved in other businesses where the Pacini family was present. Paciniâs vision closely aligned with his fatherâs which was always directed toward values innovation entrepreneurship and recognition of the human factor as pillars of the organizationâs growth. He held the conviction that the only way to do things was the right way. He conveyed this leadership style once he assumed the position of CEO. At the end of 2017 shortly after taking over as CEO Pacini defined some strategic objectives and new projects for the Plastilene Groupâs management team including implementing a sustainable strategy improving staff training and well-being and increasing local and international sales. Another goal was to open two new production operations by 2023 which would work toward the objective of establishing a significant presence in North America. Additionally the Plastilene Groupâs management team worked toward strengthening innovative products sale with high added value becoming a carbon-neutral group to reduce the environmental impact of the Plastilene Groupâs operations and establishing an operational efficiency model based on technological development and process control.At the meeting on Saturday August 1 Pacini Venegas Jaramillo and Estrada discussed the complex context they were facing. They reviewed and analyzed the Stanford University webinar âHow to Build a Sustainable Organizationâ delivered by Professor Julia Novy-Hildesley and discussed ways to maintain the values of entrepreneurship and innovation within the company while working toward a sustainable strategy. The dayâs discussions led to the defining of the Plastilene Groupâs Sustainable Innovation Strategy.Fundamentals of the Plastilene Group's Sustainable Innovation StrategyThe Plastilene Groupâs sustainable innovation strategy began with the acknowledgment that plastic was threatened by a lack of education by culture and by excessive use in some applications and that its customers were sensitive to the sustainable management of their productsâ packaging. The Plastilene Group wanted to be an innovative leader with social and environmental awareness and to work within the increasing regulatory frameworks for the sustainable management of plastic use. At the end of the meeting Pacini established the CEOâs sustainability guideline: We are an organization committed to the environment; we have innovative processes and products that contribute to improving the well-being of our society and our customers. We contribute to the conservation of the future quality of life and the well-being of our planet.Structural Organization Toward Sustainable InnovationThe purpose behind the sustainable innovation strategy was to address the organizationâs daily operational activities starting with Pacini and followed by Estrada the corporate managers the company managers and then their work teams. The sustainability strategy needed to permeate all areas of the organization while using the same human resources required to maintain performance on a day-to-day basis. Situations inevitably arose in which the work teamâs time and concentration were not enough to promote sustainability with the necessary force. Because of the need to share resources it was not easy to assign priorities and identify who was responsible for making decisions. As a result differences and territorialities emerged that were typical of a shared structure and were resolved through persistence and teamwork aligned to the superior common goal which Pacini constantly reiterated. Pacini formed an executive strategy implementation committee that met every two months. The committee led by Estrada included participants from the Plastilene Groupâs corporate managers and some company managers as well as leaders of management lines. The committee became the stage where corporate progress was regularly reviewed on environmental social and economic issues related to the sustainable innovation strategy.The management lines of the sustainability strategy were established and interdisciplinary workgroups were created. Each management group had a directive leader and a management leader who reported to the managerial sustainability committee (see Exhibit 2). Short- and medium-term objectives were established and were used to frame the sustainability management lines of the various Plastilene Group companies.THe Plastilene Groupâs Sustainability StrategyâManagement LinesThe Plastilene Groupâs sustainability strategy included several guidelines for management lines which were expected to raise public awareness and communication for the positioning of both the Plastilene Group and the plastics industry (see Exhibit 3). The strategy stipulated that projects with customers and suppliers must align with the Plastilene Groupâs sustainability programs and goals. It required social responsibility initiatives with employees and vulnerable communities and called for active participation in associations for the development of joint initiatives and constant monitoring of regulations that might affect the plastics industry. Management lines were expected to both strengthen the Plastilene Groupâs sustainable product portfolio through innovation and maintain financial management when investing in sustainability projects. The strategy also required internal environmental management to measure and control greenhouse gases in production plants and end-of-cycle projects in which a circular economy would be implemented in a practical way with the leadership and commitment of the Plastilene Group.Estrada hired a consulting company that specialized in environmental issues to accompany the implementation of the strategy on particular issues such as carbon footprint measurement life cycle analysis and the methodological framework for the sustainability report. He also carried out a careful selection process to hire Luisa Ribero a social communicator with a masterâs degree in Sustainability and Social Responsibility who assumed the position of corporate head of Sustainability. Upon her arrival Ribero monitored interdisciplinary teamsâ activities and was in charge of articulating monitoring and communicating the Plastilene Groupâs sustainable actions.In the process of adapting the sustainable innovation strategy to the particular problem of the plastic industry the strategyâs references expanded to include the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals circular economy theory and concepts of the new plastic economy exhibited by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.The Plastilene Group referred to the Global Reporting Standards methodology to report the strategyâs progress by consolidating information in a way that allowed for establishing a path of progress and creating new commitments based on indicators. The methodology proposed by this institution allowed the Plastilene Group to define and manage material issues for its stakeholders as well as to identify where the Plastilene Groupâs principal investments in sustainability should be made.Material Topics for the Plastilene Groupâs StakeholdersThe material topics for the Plastilene Groupâs stakeholders included greenhouse gas management waste reduction from the start of operation and the management of plastic waste through education on proper separation at the source in alliance with different actors in the chain (see Exhibit 4). Other topics included thinking from the beginning of the circular economy about sustainable management of packaging involving analysis from design production disposal and recycling. Finally the Plastilene Group focused on strengthening scientific and technological capacity to move toward more sustainable consumption and production modalities with efficiency in processes materials and energy use.Building Strategic AlliancesWhile Jorge Moreno directive leader of Regulators and Associations Management line coordinated the work of objectively contextualizing political leaders the need to join forces led Estrada to strengthen the organizationâs strategic alliances. The Plastilene Group joined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) in the United States and continued the path of learning and co-operation for developing sustainable products. Estrada joined the SPCâs Next Markets committee which focused on a permanent search for new applications that would increase the use of recycled materials. With the support of Venegas Estrada led the Groupâs participation in organizations such as the National Association of Companies of Colombia (AsociaciÃ³n Nacional de Empresarios de Colombia or ANDI) the ANDI pilot for compliance with the Law of Extended Producer Responsibility Vision 30/30 Colombian Association Plastics (ACOPLÃSTICOS) the organization Compromiso Empresarial por el Reciclaje (Business Commitment to Recycling or CEMPRE) in Colombia and the Guatemalan Plastic Association (Cogualplast). Estrada and his team were involved in working sessions with the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and other public and private entities to back the development of public policy around plastics and packaging supported by scientific data such as life cycle analysis. The development of strategic alliances to achieve goals led Estrada and his working group in purchasing and sustainability to establish collaborative partnerships with suppliers. The partners searched for sustainable raw materials special materials to facilitate recycling recycled raw materials for contact with food and biodegradable resins while developing supplier evaluation models that included sustainability criteria. To strengthen the recycling chain and develop the line of social responsibility the Plastilene Group formed close relationships with different associations of recyclers. The Plastilene Group provided financial support and accompanied the recyclers in their operational and commercial development through training and purchase guarantees of their products at fair prices.The customer management line focused on communicating sustainability strategy to this stakeholder. The Plastilene Group became a permanent customer advisor on sustainability issues fulfilling its extended producer responsibility and the joint development of sustainable packaging.Collaborative projects were generated with important beverage and cleaning products companies around strengthening the collection chain the transformation of recycled materials and the circular economy as a way to comply with REP (Responsibilidad Extendida del Productor or extended producer liability) legislation. New business models were developed in which the alliance with third parties to make up for a lack of proprietary technology became the first step in generating solutions to impact the circular economy.The Challenge of Taking on the Circular Economy In 2018 the necessary studies were executed to carry out the compensation of greenhouse gases in the primary plants of the Plastilene Group and a process for the compensation of carbon footprint was developed for the Plastilene and Novalene companies. These studies resulted in the foundations looking forward to being carbon-neutral in 2020.Sustainability became a fundamental part of developing the Plastilene Groupâs product portfolio. Eco-design became a protagonist for developing new products with reduced plastic consumption and new recyclable materials. The Plastilene Group incorporated products with a high content of raw materials that had been recycled by mechanical and chemical processes and it was working on developing compostable products and bio-based products among others.In April 2019 the Plastilene Group was a finalist in the SPC Sustainable Packaging Awards in the Sustainable Products and Processes category. The Plastilene Group presented an innovative lightweight technology that reduced up to 20 per cent of plastic consumption by decreasing film density.The Plastilene Group set out to find the best way to increase its direct offering to the circular economy by avoiding the use of plastic in packaging so that plastic packaging would stop ending up in rivers seas and terrestrial ecosystems. Pacini Jaramillo Estrada and the technical team of the Cycle Closure Management Line led by Luis OrtegÃ³n and FabiÃ¡n Forero travelled to international fairs and visited research and development plants and laboratories in Europe China and the United States where new recycling technologies were being consolidated. In October 2019 while they were at the K-Show the plastic industryâs most important technological event they decided to invest in a mechanical recycling plant for plastic waste and agreed to build a production that would be operational in Colombia by the end of 2020. This technology would allow the recovery of approximately 10000 tons of post-consumer plastic waste per year thus allowing the Plastilene Group to take the next step toward a circular economy.In November 2019 in a simple event in the city of BogotÃ¡ and before a large audience Pacini submitted the Plastilene Groupâs first sustainability report to the stakeholders. He communicated the Plastilene Groupâs three sustainable commitments: facilitating its Colombian customers compliance with the regulations of REP: 1407/2018 offering a competitive portfolio of sustainable products under the principles of circular economy and eco-design and becoming carbon neutral by 2020.The financial sector was pleasantly surprised by how the Plastilene Group was mitigating the companyâs risks. Other stakeholders such as customers suppliers and collaborators expressed their satisfaction with the way the Plastilene Group was implementing its sustainable innovation strategy.The preparation and delivery of the report consolidated the foundations of the sustainability communication strategy. With participation from Estrada Ribero and a communications specialist company the Plastilene Group developed a communication strategy in social networks to tell its stakeholders about its vision and actions regarding sustainability and the role that each of societyâs actors must play to contribute to the circular economy and correct disposal of waste.All these actions allowed the Plastilene Group to fulfill its internal goal of sustainability which was to generate competitive advantages and promote growth in the Plastilene Groupâs sales through the sustainable products and actions of its companies. At the end of 2019 sustainability had become a benchmark for actions carried out by the Plastilene Group with its stakeholders. The sustainability strategyâs achievements played an essential role in fulfilling the strategic objectives Pacini had set when he assumed the position as the Plastilene Groupâs CEO. Thus within the line of environmental management the leading companies of the Plastilene Group achieved carbon footprint compensation during 2019 and were on their way to obtaining carbon neutrality in 2020. At the beginning of 2020 a new plant was installed when the American market opening took place. The new plant played an important role in supporting sustainability and the sale of sustainable products. The Plastilene Groupâs sustainability strategy contributed to anticipating the start-up of two new production operations before 2023. The first would take place in the United States for product manufacturing with an emphasis on sustainability. The second would be built in TocancipÃ¡ Colombia with the capacity to process 10000 tons of post-consumer plastics recycling per year thereby contributing to the circular economy. Sustainable product sales multiplied and contributed to the consolidation of customersâ preferences while obtaining new sponsorships from suppliers and other financial partners to strengthen the circular economy and sustainability strategy.The Plastilene Group considered 2019 to have been its best historical year in terms of tons of product sold economic income EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) and other financial indicators. As of December 2019 the sustainable innovation strategyâs exact financial results could not be quantified. Nonetheless it was clear that the strategy offered support for the Plastilene Groupâs present and future and thatâtogether with the motivation and leadership transmitted by Pacini the operational excellence of company managers and their work teams and the contributions of technological innovationâthis strategy contributed significantly to obtaining the desired results.In August 2020 Estrada continued to lead and advance the development of the Plastilene Groupâs sustainable innovation strategy with the mission of incorporating sustainability into day-to-day operations. Despite the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic fundamental advances were expected for the yearâs end including the development of a carbon-credit emission system as a result of the processing of recycled materials and the replacement of virgin raw materials. Additionally the companyâs management anticipated that the consolidation of products offered with recycled material content and the consolidation of a communications strategy to disseminate topics of sustainability would solidify the Plastilene Groupâs positioning as a sustainable company.The Challenge of Integrating and Coordinating Innovation at the CompanyThroughout its history the Plastilene Groupâs innovation policy had focused on product development. The innovation structure that managed the operationâs vice-presidency was made up of different cells within each company. Since Paciniâs arrival the innovation concept had taken on a new dimension and transcended the product and manufacturing processes. It contemplated sustainability innovation in technology administrative procedures and the generation of new business models. Innovation at the Plastilene Group was headed by Pacini who integrated different lines of innovation inside and outside the company. Pacini continued to reflect on the Plastilene Groupâs accomplishments and identify new ways to move forward in a conscious and orderly manner. However Pacini was faced with several key questions to consider. How could the company keep innovation active and permanently in operation within the Plastilene Group? Specifically how could Estrada enhance the sustainable innovation strategy within the Plastilene Groupâs structure while Pacini worked to enhance corporate entrepreneurship and innovation?Exhibit 1: THE Plastilene Group Structure in 2017Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 2: composition of the Plastilene Groupâs Managerial Sustainability CommitteeNote: COB = chair of the board.Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 3: the Plastilene Group's Sustainable Innovation Strategy Management LinesNote: CSR = corporate social responsibility.Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.Exhibit 4: the Plastilene Groupâs Materiality Matrix Source: Plastilene Group Sustainability Report 2018 accessed January 18 2021 https://en.grupoplastilene.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/08/Sustainability-Report-2018.pdf.

Ltd. (SNB) was co-operating with her lawyer Rajashri Menon taking measures to be implemented at SNB to mitigate losses from an incident that had occurred in her company ranks. Sunithaâs most trusted employee and studio manager at SNB Raghuveer Urs (Raghu) had quit SNB without notice. Further it appeared that Raghu had stolen money from SNB taken away one of SNBâs important clients and started a business that competed directly with SNB. Sunitha and Rajashri considered what measures needed to be implemented at SNB to contain any further damage and to preserve Sunithaâs relationships with her clients and vendors. They needed to review Raghuâs employment contract and determine what if anything Sunitha might do to prevent Raghu from using SNBâs resourcesâknowledge processes designs clients and employeesâin his new business.EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT WITH RAGHURajashri directed Sunitha to retrieve Raghuâs employment contract. Sunitha provided Rajashri with what she had but cautioned Rajashri:Currently Raghu was working as the studio manager in charge of all of SNBâs offices. At the time of promoting him to studio manager a couple of months back we did not sign a new employment contract. It was just an oral understanding based purely on the need for managing the SSP movie project. But we had signed an employment contract when he was appointed as the assistant fashion designer. Rajashri was surprised that her friendâa very careful and clever designerâhad overlooked a business responsibility but Sunitha explained:We did not have time to document all the responsibilities of the new role. We were planning to get it done once the movie project was complete. Before we got there he put me through this. Rajashri read what Sunitha did have: a two-page document that provided the job description for Raghuâs position as assistant fashion designer (see Exhibit 1) and an older single-page document that Raghu had signed when he was appointed trainee fashion designer (see Exhibit 2). Neither document included the legal aspects Rajashri was looking for in an appointment letter. Sunitha explained that the documents were drafted by the office manager who had some legal training. She had requested something simple to document the roles and responsibilities with a mention of the compensation package. She also wanted some flexibility so she could modify Raghuâs roles and responsibilities as needs evolved. Hence Sunitha asked the office manager to keep the agreement âopenâ and expected Raghu to execute what was delegated to him as SNB became busier and busier. When asked Sunitha confirmed that most of SNBâs employees had signed similar employment contracts. Rajashri explained to Sunitha:An agreement or contract between two parties (in your case between SNB and your employees) is a document that would be signed by both parties and would be referred to and reviewed only in extraordinary circumstances such as during a performance review salary revision or dispute between parties. An agreement should be as comprehensive as possible documenting all possible scenarios that the employer and employee could reasonably encounter. The document should also prescribe the remedies available in case of a breach of contract. In a good employment contract drafted effectively all of your requirements could have been taken care of while still providing the flexibility necessary to have Raghu execute the work you assigned him. To safeguard the interests of the employer the employment contract should also contain provisions preventing employees from joining competitors or starting a competing business when they leave your employment. Such provisions are called non-compete clauses. Your employment contract does not have any such provision.An employment contract should also contain a confidentiality clause which is also known as a non-disclosure agreement. Such a clause would prevent an employee from sharing any confidential information the employee encounters during employment. This helps to keep sensitive business information confidential within the organization. Your employment contract does not contain this provision either.Sunitha was surprised to hear that she might need to protect confidential information:But we donât have any confidential information at SNB. Everything that we do is available for public scrutiny. We are leading fashion designers in the industry and all the information about what we do how we do it who we do it with and so on is transparent. So what is there to hide?Rajashri explained that while much of SNBâs information might be available for public scrutiny Sunitha would be maintaining some information as confidential even from her employees. Rajashri directed Sunitha to think about the information that she would not want her competitors to know. That could be the information that would provide SNB with competitive advantage in the market. Such information should be maintained as confidential within SNB. Rajashri advised Sunitha that any information that met two key requirements could be considered confidential information: (1) the information was not openly available easily accessible openly discussed and shared or easily ascertainable; and (2) the information provided a competitive advantage to SNB. Sunitha acknowledged that she did maintain some information as confidential and did not share it with everyone in the firm. But Raghu in his position as studio manager had Sunithaâs complete trust. He had access to all such data at SNB so he could manage SNBâs offices in Sunithaâs absence.Rajashri stated that non-compete and non-disclosure clauses might have helped Sunitha in this situation:For a design firm like yours apart from creativity which is individual in nature information is a very crucial component. The information provides its holder with needed agility and uniqueness. These are the qualities that provide you with recognition and competitive advantage in the industry. You needed to give Raghu access to the information so he could do his job but you needed to restrict Raghuâs use of the information to SNBâs business. Now he has started operating in the same space as you have been operating and he has also taken business away from you by underbidding in a project that you were executing. Also he has started a business that is directly competing with SNB all of which is possible because the employment contract you have with him did not have non-compete and non-disclosure clauses. Sunitha nodded in agreement. âI now realize my mistake in executing a very simple employment contractâ she acknowledged. Rajashri interjected âThatâs not quite all. The employment agreement doesnât have a non-solicitation clause either.â She elaborated:A non-solicitation clause is also called a no-raider clause. Let me explain. You know that Raghu has already started a business which competes directly with your activities. He needs some employees who are good at their job and who also have relevant experience in the field. Letâs assume he finds that some of his ex-colleagues here at SNB could be persuaded to join him. Because he is aware of the details of the compensation paid at SNB he would top that salary and poach your employees crippling your business. Not only that he could also take away your customers and your vendors. He would be soliciting your employees vendors and customers to join his business by terminating their relationships with you. If there were a non-solicitation clause in his employment contract then he would not be in a position to do such a thing.Rajashri added that legally Sunitha could not take action against Raghu based on the employment contract he had signed with SNB. Based on their current contracts Sunitha could not prevent employees from joining Raghuâs business. However there were other ways they could prevent Raghu from poaching SNBâs clients customers and vendors. One approach would be to update the employment agreements Sunitha had with her remaining employees. Rajashri explained that non-disclosure non-compete and non-solicitation clauses collectively called restrictive covenants in an employment contract tried to achieve different objectives; hence they could not be captured with a single clause in an employment contract. Sunitha would need multiple clauses for her employment agreements. Rajashri offered to have her staff prepare a format for the clauses.Rajashri also cautioned Sunitha not to expect permanent prohibition from such restrictive covenants. She continued stating that if the courts found that the restrictive covenants prevented an employee from using his or her knowledge skill and experience to secure profitable employment (primarily the fundamental right to carry on business trade and profession which was guaranteed by the Constitution of India) then the courts could set aside such restrictive covenants. Rajashri gave an example of a recent case decided by the Delhi High Court. Before departing Rajashri reminded Sunitha to take care of the mitigating measures they had previously discussed. Rajashri was keen to have Sunitha quickly address some of the important needs:Raghu had access to everything in the office including the keys the passwords and so on. Now that we have evidence that he has stolen money belonging to SNB for his office interior work we donât know what else he would do. So as a precautionary measure I suggest that you change the passwords and access codes to the computers in the office. Also get his email address deactivated immediately so that he doesnât misuse it. Similarly get the office locks changed as he might have had copies of the keys made before leaving. Get these [things] done as soon as possible.Rajashri set an appointment with Sunitha for later the same day at 5 p.m. She asked Sunitha to gather as much information as she could about the interior design work Raghu had commissioned so they could consider that matter when they met later. She also reminded Sunitha to speak to her clients and vendors to ensure their accounts were in order and to determine whether Rajashri had contacted them. Sunitha thanked Rajashri for her assistance and promised to be at her office later in the day with her research.EPILOGUEAfter Rajashri left Sunitha reflected on the events that had transpired during the day. She had lost her most trusted employee when he quit SNB without informing her. The employee had started his own firm competing directly with SNB and had taken one of SNBâs key clients with him. He had also been interacting with SNBâs vendors and customers encouraging them to join his competing business. And before leaving the employee had arranged for his office interior to be completed and the work paid through SNBâs accountsâa theft of â¹400000 (about US$6000). The silver lining to this incident was that she had also learned how not to structure an employment contract and the importance of including non-disclosure non-compete and non-solicitation clauses in employment contracts.Sunitha recalled what Rajashri identified as the two key requirements of confidential information: (1) the information is not openly available easily accessible openly discussed and shared or easily ascertainable; and (2) the information provides a competitive advantage to SNB. Sunitha wondered what kinds of information available in a fashion-designing firm like SNB would meet the requirements of confidentiality. She was also wondering what she needed to do to protect such information.Given that she did not have a strong employment contract with Raghu and the contract she did have did not contain a non-solicitation clause Sunitha wondered what preventive measures she should adopt to prevent her existing employees from leaving her. Specifically she was wanted to prevent Raghu from poaching her existing employees. Rajashri had also reminded Sunitha that some restrictive covenants in employment agreements would not be enforced by the courts if they infringed on the constitutional right of freedom of an employee to carry on business trade and profession. Sunitha made a mental note to ask Rajashri how to include restrictive covenants that the courts would uphold thereby effectively preventing similar incidents from happening again at SNB. Sunitha had much to review and clarify with Rajashri during their meeting in the evening.

Beauchamp was smiling to himself at the sounds of the hippopotamus grunting in the river. As he approached the deck he could see a broken floor tile that a rather bold giraffe affectionately nicknamed Gerry had made shortly before his arrival. The South African government was starting to ease the national lockdown restrictions that had been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic so Beauchamp had met with the other Abelana shareholders earlier in the day to discuss the tourist booking pipeline and expansion plans. Additional topics had included maintenance requirements and the various skills that would be needed for the work. The Abelana shareholders had partnered with the local community to create jobs and provide support to local businesses during the lodge renovations and after its reopening. Beauchamp wondered what other shared value ideas might create more opportunities for employment and growth within the community. Were there other ways to engage with the community and listen effectively to better understand their needs? How else could Abelana support the community?LAND DISTRIBUTION AND THE MASHIShIMALE COMMUNITYDuring the colonial and apartheid periods many black South Africans were forcibly removed from their land by the institutionalized racial system. In 1994 land reform legislation was passed as part of the national Reconstruction and Development Program to create equality and to address some of the injustices of the past. This legislation had three pillars one of which was land restitution: a policy and framework to return land to black South Africans who had been forcibly removed. In 1922 the Mashishimale community had been forcibly removed from its land in an area that later became known as Limpopo province. The community received no compensation for the removal only allocation of a small portion of nearby land for residential purposes. In 1999 the Mashishimale community lodged a claim with the Limpopo Regional Land Claims Commission in compliance with the newly enacted Land Rights Act. The claimant community comprised approximately �1885 households who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants.� The property was approximately 15000 hectares (36000 acres) in size located near the Selati Game Reserve (Selati). The property was �valued at a total of R148920000.� In 2012 the previous owners were compensated by the government and the land rights were transferred to the claimants administered by a community property association (CPA) led by a chief named Audrey Shai. Royal families in South Africa played an important role in the community through the regulation of social behaviour. Chiefs were considered heads of the royal family whose responsibilities often included providing safety and security allocating and distributing land settling land disputes and administering justice.According to the White Paper on South African Land Policy CPAs were a �legal body through which members of disadvantaged and poor communities may collectively acquire hold and manage property in terms of a written constitution.� The role of the CPA would be to work in conjunction with the Tribal Authority (TA) which was a representative body of local chiefs and headmen and with the chief to provide good governance and to manage land and resources. The CPA�s structure comprised up to 10 people including two ex-officio members and the chief. Other responsibilities included organizing and arranging community meetings managing projects on behalf of the community and creating jobs. Over the previous 25 years some parts of the property had been gazetted as a game reserve whereas other sections had been used for different purposes. The property had been used to graze cattle and grow citrus and after stocking the reserve with game it was also used as a hunting destination. When the Mashishimale community first received the property income had been historically generated through two primary�although differing�sources: the first was a citrus farm; the second was safari trips to observe or hunt wild animals which included guest accommodation at the reserve�s 14-bed lodge called Makubu.Challenges soon surfaced however. CPA members had received no training on farm management and some community claimants wanted to use some of the land for cattle grazing. The citrus farm was subsequently deemed unsustainable and was closed down. A new agreement was then signed with a different partner to operate a hunting concession but that relationship soon grew sour. The community was not convinced that the partner was being transparent about profit sharing. Specifically the revenue amounts generated and the number of jobs created did not meet the expectations of the community. As a result the Mashishimale community lost all trust in new partnerships.A NEW PARTNERSHIP FOCUSING ON SHARED VALUE Beauchamp had over 30 years� experience working in the �bush� (e.g. game parks or game reserves). He had trained as a field guide and worked for MalaMala one of the oldest and largest private game reserves in South Africa. Eventually Beauchamp became the head field guide. After a brief management trainee course with the French global oil company Total SE he was recruited back to MalaMala as head of international marketing. For eight months each year he travelled abroad to promote the destination to tour operators around the world. After having spent 15 years with the company Beauchamp moved on to the role of CEO of the Thornybush Collection a network of 12 four-star and five-star lodges located in the Thornybush Nature Reserve and in the Sabi Sand Wildtuin. Both areas were private game reserves adjacent to Kruger National Park.By 2017 Beauchamp had left Thornybush and pursued an unsuccessful attempt to build a high-end vacation property business based on the time share model of multiple owners with specific time allotments. Beauchamp then learned about an opportunity to bid for the land lease from the Mashishimale community. As he explained he was very interested in the prospect of trying to build a new offering for tourists on the property: �The community had been in partnership with the hunting concession but were not seeing many benefits from that arrangement so were looking at new possibilities.� In April 2017 on his first visit to the reserve Beauchamp tried not to show his excitement at the magnificent landscape and natural resources. He recalled �I tried to have a poker face during the whole drive through the reserve; I could see the potential for ecotourism and building a world class tourism experience here.� The reserve had a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Topography varied ranging from a 10-kilometre stretch of riverine bush in the north along the Selati River to massive granite koppies in the south formed by erosion that had weathered the land into boulders and dramatic rock formations. Animal life included a wide variety of insects and birds antelopes giraffe and the �big five�buffalo elephant leopard lion and rhinoceros.Over several months Beauchamp spent time travelling to the area aiming to connect with the CPA and the chief. He had a potential investor behind him and in September 2017 Beauchamp and two other competitor bidders were given the opportunity to present formally to the CPA and the TA. �It was one of the worst presentations in my life� Beauchamp reflected. �It was 40 degrees Celsius and I had put the presentation on flip chart paper which my daughter had helped write because my handwriting is terrible and the fan was blowing the pieces of paper everywhere.� He tried to incorporate the themes he had heard from the community during previous visits into his presentation. Four pillars were highlighted including plans for the land community business and investors. Each page in the flip chart had a tag line indicating �added value to your land.� Beauchamp emphasized what he could do for the community as community members were the ultimate beneficiaries. This vision included a new focus on ecotourism through different activities for visitors the upgrading of the existing lodge and the building of proposed additional lodges and the jobs and skills upliftment that could be created through the building phase and subsequently the servicing of guests. Lastly he highlighted the financial benefit of revenue coming through an annual lease payment as well as the adjacent community businesses that could be used to help service the tourism needs. The presentation went better than Beauchamp had thoughthe was selected as the preferred bidder. He heard later that the CPA enjoyed the focus on what he could do for them compared with the other presenters who had emphasized their impressive business track records. Beauchamp also sensed that his promise that �you would have me for 20 years and I hope the next CEO would be someone from the community� resonated with the CPA. However funding became a concern for Beauchamp when it seemed his investor partner had different long-term values.In January 2019 Beauchamp approached Richard Napier whom he had known as a shareholder at Thornybush as a potential investor. Beauchamp and Napier shared a deep love for nature and the African bush. Being conservation-minded both men felt a moral responsibility for preserving this natural resource. Beauchamp also approached Dene Murphy the founder of the property development company Mirage Leisure and Development as another possible investor. The three parties reached an agreement with the Murphy family holding a 67.5 per cent stake and Napier and Beauchamp together holding the remaining 32.5 share. The partnership traded under the name MTH Holdings which Beauchamp explained stood playfully for �making things happen.� Beauchamp held a salaried CEO position Napier was chairman and Lindsay Clur was the financial director representing the Murphy family�s interests.After consulting a leading branding professional MTH Holdings proposed a new name for the reserve. Abelana (meaning �to share among each other� in the local Northern Sotho language) reflected the shared approach that the partners and the community represented. Final negotiations were conducted primarily by Beauchamp and Napier with the current lease holder at the time. Beauchamp individually facilitated all contact with the CPA and the chief. The remaining hunting lease was settled and a new 25-year lease was signed with a 25-year extension registered against the title deeds. Components of the deal included an annual lease agreement with yearly increases linked to the consumer price index for up to six years when MTH Holdings expected to break even. Thereafter increases would be linked to increases in turnover or the consumer price index whichever was greater. As Beauchamp explained �we wanted the community to benefit from us doing well and having an incentive for that.� The agreement included 60 commercial beds to be developed by year six and a levy of R100 per night per guest to be paid directly to the CPA as Napier outlined:This daily community levy is unusual amongst most game lodges. We wanted the amount to be significant to the community but not to deter local and international guests. Most other lodges charge a conservation levy which they use to offset their habitat management costs�be it road land or species management. We wanted a different model and hoped the community would see the value that visitors bring on a daily basis knowing that this levy would go directly to them.In addition 70 per cent of all jobs would be sourced from local community members who had the requisite skills.BUILDING WORK TO SUPPORT THE ECOTOURISM MODELThe next step for MTH Holdings was to agree on the overall vision for ecotourism and on the infrastructure that was needed to support that vision. Building on previous experience the management team decided to create an ecotourism service that offered three primary offerings: game drives (which took place in open four-by-four vehicles with a certified field guide to search for wild animals) walking safaris and an equestrian experience in the bush riding alongside the big five. These offerings were expected to be extended in the future to include more activities and guest experiences. The overall target market was expected to be primarily international visitors (estimated at 70 per cent of all guests) with the rest coming from local areas. Given the initial limited density of game and the need to develop an established road network the pricing per night at the five-star Abelana River Lodge was set at R7500 per person per night deliberately positioned well below competitors in the lowveld whose rates were usually two to five times more expensive. �We can�t compete immediately with the game density of some of our competitors� Beauchamp said �but we can offer an experience of exclusivity where you can drive all day and not see another vehicle.�The management team decided to renovate the current lodge and expand the footprint to provide 40 beds and offer a five-star experience. The team also identified a new three-star to four-star safari tented camp destination south of the reserve. This camp would be smaller with 10 beds in total and offer different activities than in the north. The activities ranged from walking and mountain biking on trails accompanied by a tracker and armed field guide to horseback excursions. Marketing was done through a dedicated specialist in Johannesburg in collaboration with a booking agent. Beauchamp and other staff planned to use their contacts with travel agents and tour operators as well as social media marketing campaigns to spread awareness of and interest in the reserve. The horseback safaris were run by Tamlyn Whitebread a qualified field guide with years of equestrian experience. Whitebread studied nature conservation and had trained horseback guides in southern Africa. Horseback safaris provided a unique perspective for game viewing but they were logistically complicated. They comprised dedicated pieces of land and infrastructure for the horses additional running costs to support the feed and horse maintenance and qualified staff to look after the animals. However management believed there was an international market of horse riders who would be interested in this experience. These individuals often booked multi-day horse riding adventures in notable locations around the world. They often secured trips one year in advance and typically stayed for longer periods than other tourists. Whitebread was excited about the opportunity of creating a business from scratch and of being only the second operator in the country to offer riding with the big five.Building work started in March 2019 initially in the south with the development of the new tented Safari Camp. The renovation and expansion of Abelana River Lodge in the north was started in July 2019 and included work on the staff accommodation. Specialists linked to the Murphy family�s company at Mirage Leisure and Development assisted with the planning�from architectural interior and landscaping design to specialist implementation involving decking and fireplace installation. Staff accommodation was the responsibility of a local community contractor. Where possible other local businesses were engaged for additional work as Beauchamp explained:We tried to pair local contractors with some of the specialists from outside the community. For example the stone mural behind the bar was created by a Johannesburg artist�there wasn�t that skill set locally. But we paired the artist with someone from the community who was interested in that type of work and hope that there has been a transfer of skills as a result. The structural work took longer than expected. The lodge was expected to open in December 2019 but delays had resulted from some of the specialist installations and from the site closing for a week due to the CPA insisting that the contractor had not hired enough local community members for construction and building work. In addition the total overall cost for the renovations was higher than expected particularly at the upmarket Abelana River Lodge. This cost included building work installation and soft furnishings plus a sophisticated water filtration system. But Beauchamp and his team believed that the investment would be worthwhile in the long term knowing that shortcuts could compromise the overall guest experience.HIRING AND TRAINING COMMUNITY MEMBERSTo provide a five-star experience for guests Beauchamp placed great importance on the quality selection and training of staff members. Working with the TA Beauchamp reviewed hundreds of resumes and conducted 260 interviews to create a short list of qualified individuals for a variety of roles. Trackers who were skilled at interpreting bush signs were needed to provide support to field guides. Maintenance and lodge workers were required for a wide range of roles assisting with the lodge�s infrastructure grounds pool bar and kitchen. But the main industry in the area was mining and mining services which meant that many community members had never before worked in the hospitality industry or had moved away. Beauchamp was unable to fill five tracker positions from the local community although he did hire 52 people from the community to work on the reserve. Transport to the game reserve was provided for community hires based on the industry standard two-week-on two-week-off rotation. Game reserve workers were provided with meals and accommodation.Thabiso Luthuli was hired as sous chef. Luthuli came from a different part of the country and spoke an African language different from the Mashishimale people which made it a challenge to earn the trust of all community members employed in the lodge. His responsibility included training the six staff members who worked with him in the kitchen. Luthuli encountered a steep learning curve in his position for various reasons. Most staff members had limited kitchen experience so he had to help them develop basic skills such as learning the difference between red and white onions preparing vegetables and cutting meat. Luthuli also felt that several community members had low self-esteem and were afraid to ask questions or admit mistakes. Patience was something that he focused on through the training�both to remain calm and to repeat instructions multiple times. �It has been wonderful to see how their confidence has grown� Luthuli said �and the quality of meals they are able to now produce.�Several of the waiters echoed Luthuli�s pride in the success and growth of all staff including their own derived from training and experience working with guests after the lodge�s opening. As staff member Meisie Malesa reflected �I used to shake when I took food orders but now it is fine. I enjoy speaking with the guests. It is a great opportunity. You never know what will happen tomorrow.� Training waiters included teaching them to set a table serve meals pour wine and understand both red and white wines. Training videos and YouTube resources were put to use during training as Natalie Roberts the acting lodge manager explained: �It�s quite a challenge training a staff member to work in a five-star lodge when that individual might not have been to a high end restaurant or lodge before.� As part of the training staff were offered a glimpse of a guest�s typical experience by having dinner in the dining room and sleeping at the lodge for example or taking part in a game drive.The process was intended to provide an understanding of industry standards. Regular feedback was part of the process of development. However when the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the lodge to close in March 2020 shortly after its formal opening all progress temporarily ceased. Guest visits did resume in August 2020 after the government relaxed lockdown restrictions in the hospitality industry for local guests. FOCUSING ON AND SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESSESIn addition to hiring local community members Beauchamp also realized that there was an opportunity to support local businesses. This was a specific focus for him as he sought partnerships for the entire value chain of servicing guests. Bread was bought from the local bakery and vegetables and eggs from the local vegetable shop. �But that shop does not have enough cucumbers and lettuce for us when we have more visitors to the lodge� Beauchamp realized so he helped local farmers extend their growing season and thus available produce by sourcing wind tunnels (i.e. unheated greenhouses) for farming. Laundry services was another requirement from local businesses to supplement the lodge�s laundry facilities. When a local entrepreneur approached Beauchamp in the TA office about his interest in starting a waste recycling business Beauchamp could not contribute funding but he did provide advice on setting up a business and promised a contract for waste management services. Before long Beauchamp realized the entrepreneur would one day become the community�s next chief.While exploring new partnerships Beauchamp decided that Abelana should source its alcohol locally even though bulk pricing from a major city inland would likely be lower. A local supplier would have the added benefit of assurance during peak periods when someone would be there to help �make a plan given the relationship that they would have.� Therefore Beauchamp partnered with two women in the town of Haenertsburg a one-hour drive from Abelana who owned a new gin bottling business called Rhino Beetle Gin. One afternoon Beauchamp organized a gin tasting outing for a select group of guests under one of the reserve�s large Sycamore fig trees. That event led to conversations with the gin producers about developing a proprietary line of gin with a hint of fig in it which would be marketed and associated with Abelana. However many products could not be sourced locally. Whitebread tried but was unsuccessful in sourcing locally the specific type of feed she needed for her 15 Boerperd horses which were known for their hardiness and suitability for riding in the bushveld. Most furnishings for the two lodges had to come from high-end retailers in Johannesburg. The lodge�s small souvenir or curio shop also sold items from suppliers located across the country.CHANGING MINDSETS TO VALUE ECOTOURISMCommunity members were appreciative of the employment opportunities provided by the game reserve. However one challenge of ecotourism was getting locals to recognize the value that wildlife provided. Subsistence poaching which referred to the illegal seizing of animals for food had been a problem in the reserve in the past. Members of the maintenance team who patrolled the fence line daily often found snares near broken parts of the fence. These activities were likely carried out by members of the local community. �The problem with that� Beauchamp reflected �was not what was caught but the snares that were left behind and the impact they could have for other animals.� For example a giraffe was found with a snare on its foot and getting a veterinary team to come out to the reserve to assist with the snare removal was very difficult and expensive. Therefore the situation was constantly monitored by field guides.Beauchamp was campaigning with the community policing forum which included elders and some community farmers to communicate the value of the game in the reserve. His goal was to inform the broader community about its value. He also established an anti-poaching team of 14 individuals who were rewarded R5 for finding snares which was very successful and R500 for information leading to the apprehension of poachers which did not result in many poachers being caught. The anti-poaching team purposefully comprised Venda-speaking people to avoid any collusion with the community.There was also a need to change the mindset of some staff. For example Martin Niemandt the reserve manager who had worked on the reserve for 11 years �needed to make a shift from managing a game farm to managing a game reserve� as Beauchamp explained. Water sources had to be positioned differently not just to provide for the animals but also to be aesthetically pleasing to guests. New roads also needed to be built to create more opportunities to search for animals and to redirect existing routes from driving in front of infrastructure. Beauchamp was pleased to report that �the game vehicle now pays for Martin [Niemandt]�s salary. It is a transition to think about what visitors with an ecotourism mindset would like to see and what sort of an experience we want to create.�Part of the game reserve�s long-term plan included establishing an educational centre where students from the community could learn about the history of the land flora and fauna which Napier was particularly excited about. Many staff members had never seen a wild animal until they came to work on the property. Napier and others were thrilled by the staff�s new appreciation and awareness. �Imagine the opportunity with children. If you catch a child early enough you have the chance to create a conservation-minded person who will think differently about this piece of land that they will inherit� stated Napier. He explained:It is important that the children get to learn about the history of the farm. Also children are an important source of anti-poaching information; they see and hear things and if they have a positive mindset about conservation they will not tolerate poaching from their community.Napier also hoped that the educational centre would represent a future for the children on the land in terms of opportunities for employment and aspirations for skills development. This was something that Napier hoped to develop in conjunction with the chief whom he had met for the first time earlier in the year. The land at Abelana also had historical significance for the community; there were areas where healers and diviners (known as sangomas) traditionally came to pray for rain and for areas considered sacred.COLLABORATION AND HOPE Philemon Shai the spokesperson for the chief and a member of the royal family acted as a liaison officer between the staff at Abelana and the chief. Shai spoke about changes seen in the community as a result of the new partnership. Although the community held a 50 per cent share in the hunting concession fewer than 10 jobs were created with limited value in terms of skills transfer or revenue to the community. �You could see money coming into the reserve for the hunting but nothing going back to our people� explained Shai. Shai reported that the chief was pleased with the quality of Abelana River Lodge. He also was pleased to find that community members who were employed there seemed to be developing contacts and friendships that translated into greater harmony among the community.One concern among the community was the bulk of jobs in the area being primarily associated with mining from Chinese investments. Shai explained that many employees came from China where food and supplies also originated with little associated benefit for the Mashishimale community. He said that Abelana on the other hand �represented hope for the future.� Shai believed that funding from the lease and levies would be put back into school development to pay for sports facilities equipment school uniforms and many other needs. Other initiatives such as MTH Holdings donating clinical face masks to protect against the spread of the COVID-19 virus were appreciated by the community. �The chief is happy� stated Shai proudly �and so am I.�BROADER ECOSYSTEM FOCUS FOR THE FUTURENapier had a broad vision for the future of Abelana which included conversations with the shareholders of Selati a neighbouring 27000 hectare private reserve located in Limpopo. According to Napier Selati had managed to commercialize game breeding and hunting in the past and had thus been able to operate for 10 years without levying fees from shareholders or paying dividends to members. But all that had changed. Napier explained that breeding no longer provided the same level of income. For example his own informal research found that a sable antelope that might have garnered up to R50000 in the past would generate no more than R10000 in the current market. According to Napier Abelana�s neighbour had thus shifted its focus more toward ecotourism which was closer to Abelana�s focus. �So we have had discussions about dropping the fence line between Abelana and Selati to achieve a larger conservancy in total� Napier said. The bigger the area the fewer the fences and the more marketable the whole area would be for both Abelana and Selati. From the context of an ecological habitat a greater free-roaming area for animals allowed for greater carrying capacity which in turn allowed for more game. For example if too many animals resided on one side dropping the fence would provide a wider area for them to roam. The idea of dropping the fence which was raised in a memorandum of understanding between the two reserves was an indication of a shift from hunting to ecotourism as Napier explained: �The world has changed and continues to change.� Napier believed that there was an increasing global consciousness toward protecting land and wildlife. This was an opportunity for tourism to embrace the rich resources of the land in South Africa. His vision was currently under discussion with the CPA who still had unresolved land claims on certain properties nearby Selati. Although the CPA was considering the idea of dropping fences nothing was confirmed yet.A broader vision included collaboration with the World Wildlife Foundation which ran the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project (BRREP). The black rhino was a rare and endangered species that had plummeted in number in South Africa from 100000 in the 1960s to approximately 2000. Abelana currently had only a few dehorned white rhino on its property but no black rhino. The expansion program was intended to facilitate partnerships with landowners whose habitat was suitable for black rhino with the aim of creating new breeding populations. The team running the program visited Abelana and Selati to conduct an assessment. The study indicated that a specific number of black rhino could be relocated to the area if fences were removed between the two properties. This would give the rhinos sufficient area to roam and breed. Napier explained that the Mashishimale community would benefit directly from this arrangement because any progeny would be owned jointly by the community and the BRREP if the animals were to be sold or relocated. According to Napier a black rhino could be sold for R700000 a few years earlier which �could be a significant amount for the community in a few years� time.� But Napier�s vision did not just include dropping fences between Abelana and Selati. He believed that an opportunity for expansion existed that would benefit the general wildlife. If the two game reserves were able to become part of the Greater Kruger National Park by closing and rediverting part of the road network that currently existed and by collaborating with other properties in the area an additional 150000 hectares of land could be incorporated as Napier explained:That would be meaningful for conservation. But that is a 20-year vision. There would have to be a mindset change for people in South Africa. We have this weird idea that wildlife has to be fenced in

Ltd. (Nissan) and Mitsubishi Motors (Mitsubishi) was arrested and detained by Tokyo district public prosecutors—this time on the grounds of breach of trust. Instead of greeting 2019 in one of his luxurious homes in Beirut Brazil or France Ghosn found himself in a five-square-metre detention cell in Tokyo Japan. It was a fate that 64-year-old Ghosn had not expected. In 2017 the three companies had produced 10 million cars making the alliance one of the largest automakers in the world. Ghosn was responsible for the turnaround of Nissan in the late 1990s and he was also featured in comic books due to his popularity. He had been preparing an implementation plan that would cement in 2019 the alliance among the three automotive firms into a holding company structure that would make him the overall chair.The 2019 arrest and subsequent indictment of Ghosn a Brazilian-born French citizen with Lebanese blood triggered a great uneasiness among all of the companies’ shareholders and was reflected in erratic trading. It threatened a formula that would have allowed each of the three companies to gain ground in the automotive industry even though Mitsubishi was a late entrant to the alliance and implementation plans were still afoot. The indictment raised many questions about corporate governance reforms in Japan that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had been instituting since 2010. It challenged the relationships not only between Japan and France which had a vested interest in Renault but also between the nations in which Ghosn had grown up: Brazil and Lebanon. Ghosn was not only the celebrated gaijin or foreigner who defied Japan’s long-term employment and keiretsu (informal company group) system but he was also an international figure who rubbed elbows with government leaders especially where automotive companies were located.Relationships were uncertain. What could Nissan do in its corporate governance structure to restore investor trust and prevent the recurrence of another Ghosn scandal? What would happen to the alliance between Nissan Renault and Mitsubishi?The Birth of the Alliance and the Role of Carlos GhosnCentury-old Nissan was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles by 2018. However the stellar performance of the company would not have been possible had it not been able to overcome the financial hurdles of the 1990s. Nissan sought out partners that included Daimler Chrysler and Renault but it was the latter that Nissan partnered with. In 1999 Renault purchased a 36.8 per cent stake in the company. Renault then assigned Ghosn to help revive the firm. Yoshikazu Hanawa the president of Nissan at that time agreed on the condition that Ghosn would come in as a Nissan and not as a Renault executive. Ghosn recalled At the time Nissan was in a desperate situation. The company’s share of the Japanese market had been steadily falling for 26 years. Financially it had been in the red for seven of the eight years through 1999. Interest-bearing debt was more than 2 trillion yen (US$17 billion at current rates). Because of this the release of new models had slowed almost to a stop.Despite the predictions of doomsayers profit margins improved within three years and obligations to creditors were halved under the leadership of Ghosn. From chief operations officer (COO) Ghosn assumed the presidency in 2000 and the chief executive officer (CEO) position in 2001. The year after Renault’s stake at Nissan increased to 44.4 per cent while the latter gained a non-voting 15 per cent equity share of Renault. At this point Renault-Nissan BV was formed to manage this alliance. In 2010 the stake of Renault in Nissan was lowered by 1 per cent.  The cross holding between Nissan and Renault allowed the two auto-manufacturing firms to operate separately with different sets of boards yet gain from manufacturing and distribution synergies. Further the two firms shared in common their research into building electric hybrid and self-autonomous vehicles. That strong alliance brought forth even more conquests for the two companies both together and alone. There was a venture with Germany-based Daimler AG makers of the Mercedes Benz Dongfeng Motor Group in China and Russian automaker AvtoVAZ. A proposed tie-up with General Motors in 2006 did not materialize.Meanwhile in 2015 the French government enacted the Florange Act which effectively granted equity owners of two years or more double voting rights. The Renault board succeeded in limiting the rights of the French government which owned 15 per cent of the company. Under a Restated Alliance Master Agreement Nissan would be allowed to increase its holdings in Renault if the French government interfered in Nissan’s business decisions. The move served to protect the interests of Renault and Nissan and had the effect of further strengthening trust between the two companies.  In 2016 Nissan purchased a 34 per cent interest in financially troubled and scandal-riddled Mitsubishi and Nissan-Mitsubishi BV was formed the year after. Almost immediately Mitsubishi improved financially turning losses into profits benefitting from the management expertise of Nissan-assigned executives and shared operations under the leadership of Ghosn who was named chair of the Mitsubishi board in that year. The tripartite alliance produced and sold 10 million cars annually (see Exhibit 1 for the state of the relationship as of January 2019).Carlos Ghosn the Celebrated Hero at Nissan Ghosn’s entry into the automotive industry was fortuitous. Encouraged by his sister Ghosn joined French tire maker Michelin soon after graduating from the École Polytechnique. He started from the factory floor rose to become a plant manager and then was assigned by the co-owner of the family business to manage the company’s Brazilian plant. His successful turnaround of operations led to his assignment as CEO of the North American division. Again Ghosn was able to revive the business by acquiring Uniroyal Goodrich in the 1990s.In 1996 Ghosn was recruited by Renault. Realizing he would never assume the top position at Michelin—it being a family business—he moved to financially troubled Renault in 1996. He was appointed executive vice-president and in that capacity began to restructure the operations of the French carmaker which had been suffering from the merger with Volvo. In the process of restructuring Renault Ghosn gained the moniker of “Le Cost Killer” for his strategy of cutting costs. When Renault purchased a substantial stake in Nissan in 1999 Ghosn was assigned to revitalize the firm.The rehabilitation of Nissan came in phases. The first phase was dubbed Nissan’s Revival Plan. At this time the 43-year-old Ghosn was bold and determined. “I asked for trust and backed it up by saying that if we did not return to profit after a year I would resign as would my executive committee” he had declared in front of Nissan employees. He formed cross-functional teams to identify solutions and then introduced changes that were considered un-Japanese. Instead of favouring seniority and lifelong employment the new president of Nissan closed unprofitable plants and terminated the employment of 21000 personnel. He then shifted to a merit-based system that disregarded age gender and nationality and brought in foreign managers—initially about 30 executives from Renault most of whom he handpicked. Ghosn also challenged the keiretsu and awarded contracts based on terms favourable to the company.Nissan began to see some changes in profitability in the immediate years that followed and Ghosn did not have to resign as he had promised to do if things did not work out. In 2001 Ghosn was named Nissan’s CEO. He then entered the second phase of the rehabilitation referred to as the Nissan 180 plan. The Nissan 180 goals were to increase sales by one million units increase operating margins by at least 8 per cent and reduce interest-bearing debt to zero by 2015. The company achieved its one million sales goal (see Exhibit 2).In 2005 Ghosn was appointed president and CEO of Renault making him the first CEO to lead two Fortune 500 companies. As Renault CEO he also became the default head of Renault-Nissan BV. The appointment required him to shuttle back and forth between France and Japan and resulted in him wearing different hats; however Ghosn believed that it allowed him to strengthen the ties between the two firms. Meanwhile at Nissan the company proceeded to enter its medium-term plan called Nissan Value-Up. The two-year plan aimed at sustaining performance by further enhancing the company’s product line. This was followed by GT 2012 a five-year plan that focused on long-term performance through growth and trust. However the plans were suspended due to the economic turmoil brought about by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.In response Ghosn who had become president CEO and chairperson of Nissan declared the company in crisis and moved to a recovery plan. Belt-tightening moves were undertaken to conserve cash including a reduction in managers’ salaries and the suspension of dividends (see Exhibit 3). However one investment that Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered vehicles. As a result LEAF the first mass produced electric car was launched in 2010. By then he was president CEO and chairperson of Renault as well.The recovery of Nissan was interrupted by the March 2011 earthquake which affected Nissan’s facilities among others. Immediately after this event Ghosn launched Nissan Power 88 the goal of which was to reach a sustained 8 per cent operating margin and attain an 8 per cent share in the global market. Nissan missed the mark on both targets with only a 6.1 per cent global market share and a 6.9 per cent operating margin. It was reasoned that Nissan had been affected by unfavourable foreign exchange rates. This period saw mass replacements of key executives including Toshiyuki Shiga who was terminated as COO in 2013 when he was unable to shore up the sales of LEAF. Shiga who had joined the company in 1976 was subsequently appointed to the board and served as vice-chair to Ghosn.Despite missing these Power 88 goals Nissan forged ahead and announced its M.O.V.E. 2022 midterm plan. The 2022 goal was to increase global revenues to ¥16.5 trillion generate cumulative free cash flow of ¥2.5 trillion and revive its original goal of 8 per cent sustained operating margin. The company intended to sell one million electric vehicles annually and to continue to introduce new technologies and products through its Nissan Intelligent Mobility strategy (see Exhibit 4).The Allegations and Charges Against Ghosn“If you have not been a villain at a certain point in time you will never be a hero. And the day you are a hero you may become a villain the next day.” Ghosn made this ominous comment when he discussed the Japanese comic book about him.Ghosn’s success at Nissan made him a global celebrity. In 2003 Fortune magazine named him one of the most power people in business. He moved in political and social circles hobnobbed with influential individuals in various governments was interviewed and studied in business schools as an exemplar of good leadership. At the height of his fame he averaged l1 speeches a month spoke on global issues in symposiums such as the World Economic Forum and even carried the Olympic torch during the last leg during the opening of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. A citizen of three countries—Lebanon Brazil and France—Ghosn was a jetsetter. He kept residences in each of these countries and others. There appeared to be no end to what this man who had attained a semi-godlike image could do.From the rise came the fall. As Ghosn prepared to strengthen the current alliance of Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi a report submitted by a whistle-blower—the result of months of covert internal investigation—gave rise to a number of problems. What began as a case of misrepresentation became elevated to a breach of trust. To progress prosecutors needed to prove that “Ghosn violated his official duties that he committed the transgression to enrich himself or a third party and that the conduct financially harmed the company.” A lawyer opined that prosecutors aimed to prove that Ghosn had treated Nissan as his own.The initial allegations stemmed from the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act that Japan’s Financial Services Agency had enacted in 2010 which compelled publicly listed firms to declare the compensation of executives who received at least ¥100 million. In the period April 2010 to March 2015 reports filed with the agency showed that Ghosn had received total compensation of roughly ¥5 billion. When Ghosn then Nissan chairperson was first arrested in November 19 2018 it was alleged that he had underreported his annual income—already high by Japanese standards—by half. If convicted Ghosn could have been sentenced up to 10 years in prison fined ¥10 million or both.Ghosn was said to have been particular about his compensation. He had wanted to receive his compensation in US dollars but Japanese law prohibited disbursement in foreign currency. Further an executive compensation advisor stated that Ghosn did not believe he was adequately paid based on international standards. A global consultancy Willis Towers Watson reported that Japanese executives earned only a tenth of those in the United States or 20–30 per cent of levels in some European countries. The detained ex-chair claimed he had been offered CEO positions by four companies and knew his true market value. Despite the claimed underpayment Ghosn was one of Japan’s top 10 highest-paid executives not just for one year but also for seven consecutive years.  The matter of compensation was a sensitive issue not only at Nissan but also at France-based Renault. It was reported that in 2017 alone Ghosn received ¥735 million from Nissan ¥227 million from Mitsubishi and ¥128 million from Renault. The year before his contract with Renault was at risk due to compensation negotiations. With the backing of the French government he had received a renewed contract up to 2022 after he agreed to cut his remuneration by 30 per cent. His goal was to cement the alliance but to do so he claimed he needed to chair all three companies.In a potential case of embezzlement under criminal law or breach of contract under corporate law Japan’s prosecutors also alleged that Ghosn used company resources to fund family vacations and to finance the purchase renovation and maintenance of homes in Beirut and Rio de Janeiro which he personally used. After a concern raised by company auditors Ghosn considered re-purchasing the homes with personal funds but nothing materialized. Regardless prosecutors claimed that Ghosn as a resident of Japan should have reported the use of corporate property as part of his compensation.Moving from the whistle blower’s report into their own investigation prosecutors asserted that Ghosn transferred to Nissan personal losses he had incurred during the 2008 financial crisis. It appeared that Ghosn’s asset management company had insufficient collateral to cover the ¥1.85 billion paper loss when the yen appreciated during the crisis. It was then that Ghosn transferred the potential liability to Nissan. However due to some resistance and following notification by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission the contracts were returned to the asset management company. Finally it was alleged that the company had paid out consulting fees supposedly for the management of charitable activities amounting to tens of millions of yen to Ghosn’s elder sister. Records did not appear to show the sister’s contribution to Nissan. This same sister was also said to be living in Nissan’s Brazilian property. In this regard Nissan intended to file a case in Brazil against Ghosn and his sister for a supposedly fraudulent contract.Ghosn’s DefenseOn that fateful day in November 2018 Ghosn was escorted by Japanese authorities from his private plane which had just landed in Haneda Airport to a Tokyo detention cell. It was eight weeks before Ghosn was allowed to publicly defend himself. Confined in a sparsely furnished cell he was allowed to speak only to his attorney and embassy officials. Even before his public appearance Ghosn had already asserted that the allegations against him were false.  On January 8 2019 Ghosn was given the opportunity to speak publicly before being brought back to his detention cell to await trial. The procedure required him to address only the court without speaking to his lawyer or family. Due to the language barrier the entire procedure took two hours—four times longer than usual. Nonetheless Ghosn remained composed and addressed the various allegations.First he explained that there was no malice in the transfer of his contracts from his asset management corporation to Nissan. He indicated that this had been a temporary solution while he sought to find collateral needed to buffer the devaluation of the yen against the dollar. Further he claimed Nissan did not incur financial losses since the contract was returned to the asset management corporation. The foreign exchange contracts arose from his compensation in yen even though most of his expenses were in dollars.Ghosn averred that all his compensation from Nissan was disclosed and that any item not disclosed referred to hopeful and not agreed upon future payments. He had entrusted Greg Kelly with the legal management of his compensation and though Ghosn maintained he was abreast of his market rate as a CEO (since he received offers from four major companies) his lawyer Motonari Otsuru former head of special investigations at the Tokyo Prosecutors’ Office stated that the amount of compensation was undetermined. This was because it referred to retirement benefits and Ghosn had sought the counsel of internal and external lawyers regarding his remuneration.  Throughout his speech Ghosn reiterated his love for Nissan and Japan and enumerated all his positive contributions to both. He shared how Nissan’s performance had improved considerably under his leadership and how Nissan’s success also benefited Japan.Hiroto Saikawa Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NissanWhen the alliance purchased a 34 per cent share in Mitsubishi with Ghosn as chairperson Ghosn relinquished the Nissan CEO position to Hiroto Saikawa a Japanese executive who had risen from within the ranks. He was seen as a “loyal right-hand man to Ghosn” credited with negotiating a revised agreement with Nissan following the Florange Act. Saikawa served as co-CEO until he officially assumed the position in April 2017.However Ghosn was said to have been displeased with continued poor performance of the firm. In addition during the leadership of Saikawa Nissan had to recall 12 million vehicles due to improper inspection. It was believed that Ghosn distanced himself from the problem; instead of returning from a family vacation when informed of the scandal he opted to stay in Western Japan with his family. Saikawa was left to take full responsibility.  Saikawa on the other hand was careful not to criticize Ghosn but did express surprise that the lapse in protocol was not discovered sooner despite transparent operations instituted by Ghosn. Saikawa then agreed to return part of his salary as did other senior executives as atonement for the inspection scandal. This scandal haunted Nissan as another round of recalls also for improper inspection hit the company in December 2018.In November 2018 it was Saikawa’s turn to distance himself from Ghosn when the latter was arrested initially on the grounds of misrepresentation. In an official statement by Nissan Saikawa relayed that he had immediately called for an internal investigation of Ghosn’s misconduct and on this basis called for the ouster of the chairperson and his trusted associate Kelly from the Nissan board. “Beyond being sorry I feel great disappointment frustration despair indignation and resentment” Saikawa was quoted as saying. Informed of the covert investigation on Ghosn about a month before the arrest Saikawa claimed that Nissan’s United States operations were a negative legacy of Ghosn due to declining profitability. In January 2019 Nissan announced the retrenchment of 700 workers in that United States following the removal of 1000 workers in Mexico.Saikawa also made constant reference to the “dark side” of the Ghosn era and was unsure whether Ghosn was “a charismatic figure or a tyrant.” He emphasized that the recovery of Nissan was attributable to many hardworking individuals rather than just one.  Notwithstanding these comments Saikawa recommended that investigation should continue to include all other geographic areas of Nissan’s operations. He further contended that the three-way alliance undervalued Nissan shares but the companies needed to collaborate to weather the Ghosn scandal. Nonetheless he was adamantly opposed to permanently cementing the relationship between the three automakers and was vocal about reducing the control of Renault over Nissan. Ghosn who was subsequently allowed to talk to the press after his prolonged detainment believed the precise timing of his ouster had to do with his plans to further strengthen and cement the current alliance. However Saikawa had earlier told media in a news conference that followed Ghosn’s arrest “Do not take this as a coup d’état.” As the current CEO of Nissan Saikawa seemed the most natural replacement for Ghosn as chairperson of the company. His failure to act as an independent leader did not work in his favour however and his signature did appear in documents with prosecutors on retirement compensation and non-compete agreements. However to the surprise of many Saikawa indicated in January 2019 that he would step down as CEO after instituting corporate governance reforms. The two-year term of all board directors ended in June 2019.Replacing GhosnOf the three companies involved in the alliance Mitsubishi was the first to make an announcement about Ghosn’s replacement. Days after Ghosn was arrested the board of Mitsubishi unanimously removed Ghosn as chairperson and appointed its current CEO Osamu Masuko as acting chairperson. Renault was more circumspect preferring not to fire Ghosn pending results of an investigation. Chief Operating Officer (COO) Thierry Bollore who was being groomed to take over the CEO post in 2022 was appointed acting head on November 21 2018 and was confirmed as CEO only on January 24 2019 a day after Ghosn resigned from his post. Appointed on the same day as chair of the board was Jean-Dominique Senard the largest shareholder of Renault who was the first non-family CEO of Michelin.Nissan’s board was in fact the first to fire Ghosn as chairperson but the board had been unable to appoint his replacement during the November 22 2018 board meeting. On December 17 2018 the board again met but failed to name a successor. It would appear that the committee of three outside directors formed during the November board meeting was unable to arrive at an acceptable replacement. They also could not agree to recommend Saikawa as provisional chairperson.Replacing Ghosn on the Nissan board appeared critical. Before the ouster of Ghosn and Kelly Nissan’s nine-member board had been composed of four foreigners and five Japanese citizens (see Exhibit 5). It was a good balance considering the 43.4 per cent ownership of Renault in Nissan. Consequently the preferred replacements of Renault were individuals from the French side. On the other hand Nissan preferred a Japanese chairperson coming from among of its current directors. The candidates identified were Saikawa Executive Vice-President Hideyuki Sakamoto and Director Toshiyuki Shiga.Under the restated agreement between Renault and Nissan the former was given the right to select Nissan’s top executives and therefore the replacement for Ghosn. Since the business decision would affect Nissan the French government which owned 15 per cent of Renault was precluded from casting its vote. Should the French government interfere Nissan had a unilateral right under Japanese law to increase its holdings in Renault to 25 per cent and cancel Renault’s voting rights altogether. This would render Renault’s investment unprotected. After the December board meeting Renault twice asked Nissan to hold a special shareholders’ meeting. The request was granted only after Renault announced permanent replacements for Ghosn as CEO and chairperson—both of whom committed to restoring “trust” within the alliance. Had Nissan not responded within eight weeks Renault had the right under Japanese law to petition the courts to force a meeting. The special shareholders’ meeting to decide on the replacement for Ghosn or abolish the board chair post was scheduled for April 2019.The Future of the Nissan–Renault–Mitsubishi AllianceThe almost 20-year-old alliance between Renault and Nissan was regarded as a great symbol of French and Japanese cooperation. Ghosn was expected to make an announcement in March 2019 regarding a more permanent alliance and this would have been a grand celebration. At less than 8 per cent of the market the current business relationship between the three companies was already considered a leader in the automotive industry. Therefore it would be difficult for both parties if each were to compete separately since they would each be competing from weaker positions. For instance the combined budget of about ¥800 billion for research and development would be greatly affected considering Japanese rival Toyota worked with a ¥ trillion budget.Both countries needed to ensure that the right replacement for Ghosn was selected to maintain the stability of the current relationship that had already included Mitsubishi. However any action had to be taken immediately as competitors wanted to get a lead in newer technology vehicles which would upset Nissan’s long-term strategies captured in M.O.V.E. 2022. Google was already leading the field of autonomous driving.Without Ghosn considered the orchestrator of the current alliance at the helm distrust appeared to prevail. The French government had continually pressed Nissan to share information about the investigation but the latter seemed hesitant even if there was a commitment to do so in line with the alliance’s charter of transparency trust and mutual respect. Nissan had been giving summaries but Renault was interested in a full report. Renault like Nissan and Mitsubishi had also been conducting its own investigations on compensation. Nissan and Mitsubishi aimed to recover compensation paid to Ghosn that was unauthorized by Nissan-Mitsubishi BV.On January 25 2019 Renault’s chair had his first official conversation with Saikawa and together they agreed to rebuild a climate of trust and cooperation. Investors were pleased with this discussion and stock prices went up 2.5 per cent at the Tokyo Stock Exchange and 4.9 per cent at the Paris Stock Exchange at the close of business hours.EXHIBIT 1: RENAULT–NISSAN–MITSUBISHI ALLIANCE as of January 2019Source: Developed by author with data from Renault Nissan Alliance Facts & Figures 2017 accessed January 27 2019 https://global.nissannews.com/ja-JP/releases/infographic-renault-nissan-alliance-facts-and-figures-2017?source=nng; Nissan Motor Co.

The upcoming Medibank initial public offering (IPO) was set to be one of Australia’s largest and was expected to generate more than $4 billion from shareholders who were keen to snap up a piece of the country’s largest private health insurer. Because Gardner was new to the deal her supervisor gave her access to his notes and directed her to her business school’s Bloomberg terminals. As she read through this material Gardner wondered about some important questions: What was Medibank worth? Which valuation methods should she use? Introduction to the DealIn November 2014 the Australian government was in the process of selling Medibank Private Limited through an initial public offering of all common shares. Medibank was Australia’s largest private health insurer with a 29 per cent share of the $19 billion market. Investors were eager to get a piece of what was predicted to be one of the biggest IPOs in Australia since Telstra and Queensland Rail National. Highly anticipated pricing of Medibank was underway and consumers were awaiting the final results before the arrival of the release date. With demand set to be strong the retail offer opened with projections of more than 750000 pre-registrations by members of the Australian public bringing increased competition to the private health insurance (PHI) industry. For the past few weeks Gardner had been collecting her data and key valuation assumptions based on how the company had been performing under the government’s watch. Medibank was a leader in a market that was just starting to tap into its scale advantage. For the success of the selling strategy and for the future success of the company in the current market it was important to present potential investors of the IPO with a fair value for Medibank and Gardner was eager to provide a reasonable price. Company overviewMedibank was Australia’s largest private health insurer providing services to a total of 3.9 million people. The company was established in 1976 and was operated through the government-run health insurance commission. The Fraser government had initially established Medibank for a combination of reasons including bringing greater competition to the PHI sector. When the Australian government initially announced its intention to sell Medibank questions arose concerning legal issues related to the fund but an Australian parliamentary report determined that while the government “clearly ‘owns’ Medibank the fund itself is best characterized as a government-controlled not-for-profit entity (not strictly owned by either the Commonwealth or the fund members).” Medibank’s aim was to provide competitive health insurance coverage and create a reliable brand that consumers could trust among the various options in the private health industry. Dominating the oligopoly market in 2014 Medibank had a 29.5 per cent share in the national PHI market. The company had a strong capital position and a well-rounded reputable brand supported by the government after acquiring AHM Health Insurance (AHM) in January 2009. Medibank had a strong focus on customer acquisition and retention competitive pricing customer service product innovation and sustaining its competitive advantage in the market. Employing more than 3400 people the company operated throughout Australia with a limited presence in New Zealand and Singapore. Medibank was owned and operated by the Australian government’s Health Insurance Commission until 1998 when it was transferred to Medibank Private Limited which had the government as its sole shareholder. Operating in a heavily regulated industry Australian health insurers typically produced stable and defensive earnings and Medibank looked to be heading in the right direction to produce solid long-term earnings and growth potential. Beginning in 2009 Medibank made a number of acquisitions both to provide an alternative to its premium-brand Medibank offering and to aid its expansion into adjacent health services. First in January 2009 Medibank acquired AHM an affordable PHI offering that catered to a different demographic than did Medibank’s premium product offering. In 2013 Medibank repositioned AHM to utilize fast-growing comparison website distribution channels that would deliver Medibank a younger demographic. In July 2012 Medibank and AHM merged into a single unit. Second in April 2009 Medibank merged with Health Services Australia which was also government-owned thereby bringing Medibank into the health management sector. The main component was the immigration contract which provided pre-migration visa health screening. However in February 2014 Medibank lost this contract to a competitor and the division had to be handed over to a new supplier. Finally in July 2010 Medibank acquired McKesson and Carepoint which developed and evolved into the company’s main complementary services division. McKesson and Carepoint was one of Australia’s largest tele-health and rehabilitative health services. Medibank business modelMedibank’s core business involved the underwriting and distribution of PHI policies through its two brands Medibank and AHM. This dual brand strategy was meant to help insulate market share by appealing to different market segments. Medibank was forecasted to generate 90 per cent of its pro forma fiscal year (FY) 2015 revenue from its health insurance business (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3) which offered hospital coverage and extra coverage to customers in Australia as well as health insurance to overseas visitors and students. Policyholders paid premiums for insurance coverage for which Medibank would provide reimbursements for qualifying healthcare costs under the holder’s policy. Aside from its insurance operations Medibank further served the healthcare industry by providing a limited range of complementary services that accounted for approximately 10 per cent of its FY 2014 revenue. These offerings encompassed a range of ancillary services that were seen as beneficial to Medibank’s health insurance business such as online and telephone-based health services and alternative insurance products including pet coverage travel coverage and life insurance coverage. Like most insurance companies Medibank was also able to generate significant income from its portfolio of investment assets. In becoming a publicly listed company Medibank’s objectives would inevitably involve the maxim of shareholder value creation. In light of this goal the company revised its strategy to emphasize five key focus areas: expanding revenue growth improving underwriting margins enhancing operations building and utilizing core competencies and investing in its people (see Exhibit 4). Medibank’s revised strategy which centred around cost and claim efficiencies was starting to deliver claims initiatives thus enabling Medibank to buck the industry trend of declining gross margins and to increase its health insurance net margin to 4.4 per cent. MEdibank Private: Private Health InsuranceIn Australia public healthcare was free to all eligible Australian patients; however those who held PHI could choose between being treated in a private hospital and being treated as a private patient in a public hospital. PHI also gave these patients their choice of practitioner and the chance to avoid or reduce any waiting periods. Further policyholders were entitled to ambulance services which were not provided free of charge to public policy holders as well as dental examinations and other therapies. The PHI industry faced strict regulation under the National Health Act 1953 with the Private Health Insurance Administration Council supervising 38 market providers. While it was a market leader in the PHI market Medibank’s administrative expenses remained above the industry average from 2012 to 2014 with a management expense ratio of 8.7 per cent in FY 2014 (see Exhibit 5). With strong industry growth in the PHI sector projections of five-year growth of 8 per cent were expected to reach $147 billion in healthcare costs as healthcare costs outpaced tax revenue. Policyholder growth for the PHI sector continued to increase steadily at 8.4 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2003–2014 exceeding the 7.9 per cent CAGR rise in healthcare expenditures over the same period (see Exhibit 6). However claims on PHI policies kept pace and grew at 8.3 per cent largely eroding the gains produced by an expansion in policyholders. Medibank itself exhibited a claims expense representing 87.4 per cent of FY 2014 revenue.Australian healthcare IndustryThe Australian healthcare industry was an integral part of the Australian economy representing approximately 9.5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011–2012. The Australian healthcare industry consisted of public and private organizations that provided healthcare services to consumers. Historically the Australian private health insurance industry had been subject to a high degree of subsidization at a national level notably through a national private health insurance rebate. Because they were heavily subsidized by the Commonwealth government insurance premiums for consumers could be kept low and coverage could be expanded to larger populations. As of September 30 2014 the PHI industry comprised 34 private health insurers which were generally categorized by membership criteria and profit status. Such services included medical treatment hospital services medications and other related services. The key drivers of PHI premium revenue included policy volumes premium rate increases and coverage downgrades. Rising policyholder volumes had increased alongside a significant rise in average premiums with approximately 55.2 per cent of all Australians possessing some form of PHI in June 2014. Medibank Private accounted for roughly one-third of this number. The PHI industry generated approximately $19.3 billion in PHI premium revenue in 2014 and had grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.4 per cent since 2004. Australia’s high PHI participation rate stemmed from the government’s use of financial incentives that were administered through the tax system such as the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) and the Lifetime Health Cover (LHC). Australia’s population had been one of the fastest growing among the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This population was also aging with a high proportion of people aged 65 and older representing approximately 14.7 per cent of the population in June 2014. This structural shift in the population was supported by increasing wealth per capita; Australia had a relatively high GDP per capita and its median wealth rate was one of the highest in the world.The PHI industry was relatively concentrated and competitive with the top three private health insurers accounting for 67 per cent of principal policyholders nationally (see Exhibit 7). The structure of the industry had changed over the decade ending in 2014 when the industry had experienced consolidations demutualization and conversion of not-for-profit to for-profit private health insurers. The industry faced some other key concerns including government objectives health policies technology advancements and consumer needs and trends.The government put these incentives in place to lessen the healthcare costs that it had to fund directly. In 2013 total healthcare expenditure stood at approximately $147 billion of which around 68 per cent was funded by the government (federal and state) with the balance accounted for by individuals and organizations (24 per cent) and the PHI industry (8 per cent). Looking ahead it seemed reasonable to expect that funding pressures would continue to rise as the population aged and people lived longer.With around 90 per cent of Medibank’s pro forma FY 2015 revenue expected to come directly from the PHI market this longer-term thematic was very much applicable to the company and provided the basis for future growth. To that end the extent to which the company sustained or increased its market leadership position would ultimately depend on its ability to acquire and retain policyholders at a rate in excess of the underlying market.In this regard the company’s PHI growth strategy involved the operation of two distinct brands: the premium brand (Medibank Private) and the budget brand (AHM). While the premium brand was distributed through the company’s retail locations call centres website and third-party brokers the budget brand was distributed through comparison websites Medibank’s own website and a call centre. The company generated its PHI revenue from insurance premiums paid by policyholders for hospital coverage and from extras coverage. The balance (around 10 per cent) of Medibank’s revenue was derived from the provision of services that were complementary to the core business. These offerings included contracted health management services for government and corporate clients online and telephone-based health services and the distribution of travel life and pet insurance products provided by third parties. Economic and MArket conditionsThe Australian market had experienced its ups and downs in the three years preceding 2014. Over the same period despite higher volumes of listings several IPOs had failed spectacularly—for example education provider Vocation Limited “VET” on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). However the health industry had strong potential for future success and long-term growth given the prevailing market environment. The nation’s aging population promised to generate sustained demand for secure health services. With respect to demographics over the two-decade period ending June 2014 the median population age had increased by four years to reach 37.3 years. This changing population structure could foreseeably bring with it higher demand for health services from individuals in higher age brackets from which Medibank benefited both as an insurer and to a lesser extent as a provider. In periods of low interest rates as an alternative to fixed-income instruments investors could turn towards investments that provided steady yields through dividend payments; Medibank itself proposed to offer a dividend between 4.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent. In 2014 the market saw a brief resurgence in Australian government bond yields from 2013 levels; however a declining trend emerged that could increase the appeal of dividend-paying stocks if it persisted. Economic conditions in Australia could have encouraged an increase in competition either from domestic or overseas competitors. These factors in turn could affect Medibank Private’s financial performance and growth prospects due to the increased ability the company might have to access capital markets. Pre-SaleIn going public Medibank’s goal was to become a publicly traded company on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX: MPL) and provide an opportunity for the Commonwealth (the government) to sell down its entire shareholding in MPL. In turn Medibank would be afforded commercial independence through privatization and would gain access to capital markets for future capital raisings through the stock exchange. At the same time the Commonwealth would retain its role as a regulator of the PHI industry but relinquish its ownership role. The proceeds from the offer would be reinvested back into the company for productivity enhancement. The pre-sale included offers for both retail and institutional investors worth nearly US$660 million. Offering a pre-registration made Medibank appear more attractive to prospective investors an aspect that represented a concern for Gardner who wondered whether all the hype from the media would result in an oversubscription in the stock. The pre-sale presented many unknown factors to investors who had no idea how many shares were going to be offered at what price or what the likely return would be on those shares. That level of uncertainty would be cause for concern for prospective investors.Medibank Price TalkMedibank decided that 2754 million shares would form the offer through the ASX a total of 100 per cent of total shares on issue. The federal government placed an indicative price range on the offer of $1.55 to $2 per share. On the forecasts for Medibank’s FY 2015 earnings an earnings multiple of 16.5 to 21.3 times and a dividend yield of 4.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent were implied by the price range. This price band was fairly wide (i.e. 30 per cent) and brought with it some noteworthy implications given the uncertainty over the price that investors would end up paying.The offering price was to be determined following a book-building process by agreement among the underwriters the vendor and Medibank on the price discrimination date which was expected to be November 25 2014. Medibank had forecasted fully franked dividends of 4.9 cents per share to be paid starting September 2015 with an implied FY 2015 dividend yield of 4.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Based on the indicative price range provided the Commonwealth could expect to raise between $4269 million and $5508 million for 100 per cent of Medibank’s equity. Additionally going public provided a way for Medibank to position the company within the current market and get its name out to potential investors. It was also a strategic way for the company to increase customer loyalty and its overall public image through brand recognition. Going public gave Medibank an opportunity to attract other companies to evaluate it for potential mergers and acquisitions as a way to achieve synergies and increase overall shareholder value. ValuationTo determine the worth of the business in relation to the price range specified Gardner had to perform a valuation. The equity valuation encompassed both a fundamental valuation using a discounted cash flow model and a relative valuation using multiples from listed Australian health insurers (see Exhibit 8). Gardner also made some further assumptions concerning weighted average cost of capital inputs (see Exhibit 9).Making a DecisionOnce Gardner had collected all the necessary information and data she had some difficult choices to make. Although the company’s future appeared promising it was unclear how the company would be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the current market while at the same time managing to please shareholders and customers. Could the necessary changes be made to the company simply because of its listing on the ASX? The government faced a difficult position by having to price the securities in a manner that balanced investor demand against the need to generate satisfactory returns for the state. The government obviously wanted the float to be successful and in order for that to happen a reasonable valuation price would be required. As well Medibank was looking at expanding into travel pet and life insurance to provide its clients with a variety of options and also to serve as a potential growth strategy. Although Medibank currently dominated the market share Gardner had her doubts about the investment largely because of investors’ high expectations of future performance and the company’s aggressive growth strategy. Gardner was skeptical about the hype surrounding the IPO but she felt that the state of the current market and Medibank’s market position might provide a basis for the success of the company after its listing. However she questioned the firm’s ability to maintain a sustainable position in the long term in the face of increased demands and scrutiny from shareholders. For these reasons Gardner wondered whether Medibank constituted a worthwhile investment.Exhibit 1: MEDIBANK BALANCE SHEET AS AT JUNE 30 2014 (amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand; APIC = additional paid-in capital.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 2: Medibank’s HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENTS FOR YEARS ENDED JUNE 30(amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand; * “Other operating expenses” includes depreciation and amortization figures as per cash flow statement.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 3: medibank’s HISTORICal CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2014(amounts in millions of AUstralian Dollars except per share)Note: Figures rounded to nearest hundred thousand.Source: Bloomberg data.Exhibit 4: MEDIBANK PRIVATE STRATEGIC FOCUS AREASSource: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 5: Medibank’s MANAGEMENT EXPENSE RATIOS PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRYSource: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 6: TOTAL AUSTRALIA HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE FY03–FY13Note: All dollar amounts are in Australian dollars; US$1 = AU$1.1796 on November 30 2014.Source: Modified from Medibank Private Share in the Future of Medibank Private (October 2014) accessed March 23 2017 www.medibank.com.au/content/dam/medibank/About-Us/pdfs/privatisation/Medibank-Private-Prospectus.pdf.Exhibit 7: TOP 10 Private Health Insurance INDUSTRY MARKET SHARE IN AUSTRALIA

The building was close to a bustling centre of malls business offices and hotels in Kathmandu Nepalâs capital city. With the cityâs fast-growing economy and appetite for coffee Shrestha saw an opportunity to make this location the first of a large chain of cafÃ©s that he would call Kaffeine. He and his partners each had their own successful businesses. From money management to consumer packaged goods distribution to construction the founders brought a great deal of knowledge and valuable relationships that would help them operate in the Nepalese business environment. They had many things to consider such as location competition target market and how to measure the feasibility of this new venture. The KAFFEINE TeamShrestha Pradhan and Gurung were each successful entrepreneurs in their own right. Shrestha and Pradhan met while studying business at Kathmandu University one of the most prestigious institutes in the country. After graduation Shrestha founded an investment company called iCAPITAL that researched and invested in private and publicly-traded Nepalese businesses. Pradhan took a different route after business school choosing to become the exclusive distributor of Optimum Nutrition consumer healthcare products in Kathmandu. Gurung whom Shrestha met at a social event in Kathmandu owned and operated his own construction firm in Hong Kong. Overall Shrestha was quite confident about pursuing a venture given his groupâs accomplishments.ENTREPRENEURIAL CHALLENGES IN NEPALNepal was a landlocked Asian country surrounded by China and India. Located in the Himalayas the country was extremely mountainous and was the home of Mount Everest the tallest mountain in the world. Being located between two of the biggest economies in the world was a great opportunity for aspiring Nepalese entrepreneurs but also a big source of political tension. For example in 1989 the Indian government imposed an economic blockade on Nepal because of its growing relationship with China and disputes over transit treaties. There were few places Nepal could turn for trade due to the Himalayan mountain range along its northern border and India in the south. The lack of oil and gasoline flowing to the country was one of the biggest challenges for the everyday population as well as entrepreneurs. Costs that were normally stable skyrocketed as people turned to the black market to fulfill their needs which drastically raised the cost of doing business in Nepal. The results of the blockade were disastrous for Nepalâs economy with gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropping from 17.92 per cent from 1987â1988 to just 1.09 per cent in 1988â1989. The threat of another blockade was very real if Nepal and Indiaâs relations worsened again.Beyond these political challenges Nepal faced many developmental challenges that affected its population. Nepal was considered a least developed country by the United Nations with low economic growth and subsistence farming. This designation was conferred through the consideration of per capita income human assets and development and economic vulnerability. The Nepalese government set forward plans to become eligible to graduate from a least developed country to a developing country by 2022. As of 2012 only 67 per cent of the population had access to electricity 62 per cent had access to sanitation and the adult literacy rate stood at 57 per cent. Some progress had been made though with the percentage of those living below the poverty line dropping from 42 per cent in 1995 to 24 per cent in 2013 and GDP growth at 4.9 per cent in 2012. The developmental challenges facing Nepal directly affected entrepreneurs attempting to start businesses in the country.Major hurdles for entrepreneurs in Nepal included lack of funding and electricity deficiencies. It was nearly impossible to receive funding for a business without putting up significant collateral in the form of land or buildings. The concept of credit scores did not exist in Nepal so there were few ways for young entrepreneurs to build up a reputation of paying back loans and becoming creditworthy. Most funding came from existing family business houses causing large family conglomerates with holdings across diverse industries. Also Nepal faced large energy deficiencies which it managed through planned load shedding also known as rolling blackouts. As a result businesses had to cope without electricity for hours every day. To ensure smooth business operations many businesses ran expensive generators to keep the lights on which cut into operational margins. Overall these challenges discouraged many keen young entrepreneurs from entering the uncertain business market.Coffee in Nepal Britainâs heavy influence on Nepal contributed to the Asian countryâs large tea-drinking culture. The Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923 was the first to declare Nepal a sovereign international state. It was not until 1938 that coffee was introduced in Nepal and it remained a niche product that was primarily consumed by expatriates throughout the 20th century. Nepalâs mountainous terrain provided the potential for its coffee farmers to produce a top-quality product; however farmers often had trouble maintaining consistency in harvests each year. Up until the 21st century the limited amount of coffee that was grown in Nepal was mostly exported. However in the 2000s farmers had noticed an increase in both international and domestic demand for Nepalese coffee. Although exports had declined since a peak in 2008 export demand for coffee was supplanted by growing local interest (see Exhibit 1). This movement toward consumption of coffee was largely driven by Gagan Pradhan founder of Nepalâs largest coffee chain Himalayan Java Coffee (Himalayan Java). Prior to the founding of Himalayan Java Nepalese primarily purchased instant coffee a form of coffee that was inexpensive and consumed at home. Gagan Pradhan was able to achieve success in changing Nepalâs coffee culture by placing great emphasis on the location of his cafÃ©s. His first cafÃ© was opened in an upscale region of Kathmandu called Thamel after which he was able to expand his chain to other booming regions in the fast-growing city.Potential CustomersThe prospective Kaffeine building was located one block away from Durbar Marg one of Kathmanduâs busiest streets. Durbar Marg contained offices for many large companies large malls upscale hotels restaurants and bars thus attracting a wide variety of people. Shrestha divided his potential customer base into three distinct groups.The first group Shrestha considered targeting was the business people working at large companies such as the Nepal Investment Bank and Nabil Bank. Many of these businesses had coffee canteens for their employees and Shrestha wondered whether the appeal of his cafÃ© would be enough to attract these wealthy customers. Not only did they come to the area for work but they would also shopped in the upscale stores and restaurants around Durbar Marg.Another group Shrestha considered targeting was tourists. Durbar Marg contained many shops and restaurants that were popular tourist spots. The cafÃ©âs location was about a 25-minute walk from Thamel the largest tourist hub in Kathmandu. This district was highly popular with tourists a segment that had grown from 736215 in 2011 to 803092 in 2012. It was also a five-minute walk from Hotel Yak & Yeti a five-star deluxe hotel for affluent travellers. One concern that Shrestha had with targeting this group was that the vast majority of tourists were interested in trekking in nearby mountains as opposed to shopping in Kathmandu. Without being centrally located it would take a lot of marketing and online presence to attract tourists.A third group Shrestha considered targeting was domestic students. Durbar Marg contained many of Kathmanduâs most popular malls restaurants and bars which would attract students to the area. The cafÃ© location was a 10 to 15 minute motorcycle ride from many of Kathmanduâs large universities such as Kingâs College. Students frequented cafÃ©s and enjoyed using them as quiet study spots with a steady stream of coffee to keep them awake through long study sessions. Although they had relatively low disposable income compared to the other groups students were more often willing to try new products and brands. Shrestha considered these three types of people the most easily distinguishable groups in the area. Although there were people who frequented the area but did not fall into these groups Shrestha found it difficult to categorize them into an addressable market.SUPPLY CHAINIn starting Kaffeine the founders needed to decide where to source their coffee from weighing considerations such as price quality consistency and branding.Nepalese BeansNepalâs unique high-altitude Himalayan environment made it ideal for growing specialty coffee. Coffee grown in Nepal included the Bourbon and Typica varieties of the C. arabica species. The Nepalese coffee production market was highly fragmented with most coffee grown on small plots by independent farmers. This made the Nepalese coffee market a somewhat niche market with mass production to the scale needed by international brands not possible. Segmentation was also a problem for quality control. Because batches of beans came from many different plots and growers quality across shipments could vary greatly. Despite the quality issues there was a pride in showcasing locally grown products. Of all the options locally-sourced coffee was the most affordable costing between Rs1300 and Rs1600 per kilogram.Imported BeansThe second option was to import beans from popular growing regions around the world such as Ethiopia Colombia and India. Importing beans without branding would allow Kaffeine to brand and label them however it wanted while gaining the consistency of larger farm operations. However the company would lose the âlocally grownâ appeal and marketing power of a larger brand. Imported beans would provide quality consistency but would cost Kaffeine Rs2500 per kilogram.Branded ImportsFinally Kaffeine could purchase imported branded coffee from international brands. Two popular options worldwide were Illy and LavazzaâItalian brands with operations spanning the globe. The benefit of going with a branded option was that Kaffeine would be able to advertise with the supplierâs logo on shop and advertising materials leveraging the international brand. Additionally these brands underwent extensive quality control on their coffee beans. At Illy a coffee batch could be quality tested as many as eight times before being incorporated in the Illy blend. However using a branded option might take away from the core Kaffeine brand and came at a premium; importing Illy cost Rs3950 per kilogram and Lavazzaâs international beans cost as much as Rs4500 per kilogram.COMPETITIONSince 2003 there was a large increase in the number of coffee shops in Kathmandu. Within a three-minute walk of the location there were four established coffee locations that Kaffeine would be competing with the largest of the four being Himalayan Java Coffee. Himalayan Java CoffeeHimalayan Java Coffee was founded in 1999 and proudly advertised its sourcing of Nepalese coffee. It targeted tourists heavily and the upper middle-class in the Thamel area and priced its coffee between Rs200 and Rs300. The company used Facebook and TripAdvisor to advertise to tourists and spread its growing brand. Due to its backstory and heavy social media presence Himalayan Java Coffee would be Kaffeineâs toughest competition in the Nepalese market.The Coffee ShopThe Coffee Shop was a high-end restaurant in Hotel Annapurna a 50-year-old 5-star hotel in Kathmandu. The shop was very formal rather than relaxed like a cafÃ© with coffee being offered at prices between Rs200 and Rs400. The Coffee Shopâs customers mainly consisted of wealthy tourists staying at the Hotel Annapurna and well-off local businessmen who used it as a venue to meet clients.Magic BeansMagic Beans was a mid-range coffee shop located in Sherpa Mall on Durbar Marg. It mostly targeted local shoppers with prices between Rs150 and Rs250. It had some social media presence but did not have the same brand strength as Himalayan Java coffee. While Himalayan Java coffee had the potential to be a national brand Magic Beans was more of a local one-off shop.Coffee ExpressCoffee Express was a coffee kiosk located on Durbar Marg catering to on-the-go customers with lower prices. Coffee started at Rs100. Coffee Express did not have much of a retail presence and lacked the feel of a modern coffee shop. It was not a place that people would convene to socialize or have meetings.FINANCIALSMarket SizeShrestha estimated that 250000 to 350000 cups of coffee were sold in cafÃ©s around Kathmandu annually. This figure was growing quickly at approximately 5 per cent year-over-year. It was driven by new customers becoming avid coffee drinkers and by increasing economic prosperity which made cafÃ©-sold coffee more accessible. Given Shresthaâs relatively large marketing budget he believed he could capture 2 to 4 per cent of the Nepalese coffee market in his first year. Shrestha believed that the market share captured would depend on his price point which ultimately depended on the quality of beans his cafÃ© would use. As a relatively discretionary good a more expensive coffee would likely lead to lower market penetration. As his business grew and he opened up more locations Shrestha projected that his market share would increase to 10 per cent in five years.Costs and InvestmentsShrestha recognized that his direct costs would vary depending on how he sourced his coffee beans. Direct costs would make up 35 per cent 40 per cent or 45 per cent of revenues if he used local beans branded beans or imported beans respectively. Shrestha also predicted all of the indirect operating costs of operating his first store (see Exhibit 2). Finally Shrestha expected that the initial investment in his cafÃ© would be Rs4800000 which would be enough to cover a rent deposit renovations and fixtures. He believed it was reasonable to assume that renovations and fixtures would last 10 years before having to be replaced.The DecisionShrestha and his team planned to meet the next day to discuss the many decisions and questions facing them. Was the location they were considering the right place to establish operations? Which target market would Kaffeine cater to and how would it price and source its coffee to differentiate itself from the competition? Would the Rs4800000 required to occupy and modify the space pay off as an investment? Finally what quantitative metrics should the partners use to measure the feasibility of this venture?Exhibit 1: Nepal Coffee Export and Production since 2008Source: Created by case authors using data from âSummary Table of Area and Production of Coffee (FY2012/13)â National Tea and Coffee Development Board of Nepal accessed June 23 2016 www.teacoffee.gov.np/images/gallery/Coffee%20data%20english.pdf.Exhibit 2: List of Operating Expenses (IN Rs)Source: Company files.

I have no choice but to accept it. It�s a regrettable outcome. I feel that it�s a real shame.Tetsuro Higashi CEO of Tokyo Electron LimitedTokyo Electron Limited (Tokyo Electron) announced a merger of equals with Applied Materials Inc. (Applied Materials) on September 24 2013. The deal would allow the combined entity to compete effectively in the highly competitive and consolidated global semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) industry. However one and a half years later after multiple delays in the approval from concerned governments in several countries the deal was rejected due to antitrust issues and both companies agreed to cancel the deal. Tokyo Electron probably suffered more from this failure as Applied Materials had already sought new acquisitions or partnerships. Shortly after the cancellation in October 2015 Lam Research Corporation (Lam Research) announced a merger with KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLA-Tencor). If this merger was approved the SME market would be led only by Applied Materials ASML Holding (ASML) and Lam Research/KLA-Tencor while Tokyo Electron would be marginalized. Given the tremendous cost pressures from such consolidated competitors and powerful customers should the company initiate another merger attempt? What kind of merger should be made? Were there other competitive options? Was its traditional Japanese style of business management an impediment to responding effectively to such a demanding and dynamic industry environment?OVERVIEW OF the Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment IndustryThe SME industry referred to all the equipment and machinery used to produce semiconductor devices including microprocessors and memory devices. Semiconductor equipment was classified into two main categories: front-end equipment and back-end equipment. The former included silicon wafers and wafer-processing equipment while the latter included equipment for testing assembling and packaging. SME companies built machinery and equipment that the semiconductor industry would use to produce semiconductor devices. The SME industry itself did not directly produce semiconductor devices. The entire process for chip manufacturing took between six and eight weeks and was carried out in highly specialized locations called fabs. These fabs were owned by semiconductor companies like Intel Corporation (Intel) an American multinational company which had more than 12 fabs worldwide. There were four main stages of manufacturing including wafer manufacturing front-end production wafer testing and back-end production. Each stage involved process control and a yield management process.Not only was this manufacturing process complex it was also costly. The process costs varied from US$200000 to $50 million depending on the equipment. In the end because of the numerous expensive devices that were required for it to function a fab would usually cost around $3 billion to $5 billion. Samsung Electronics (Samsung) announced in May 2015 that it would build a new $14 billion fab in South Korea for 2017 the world�s most expensive fab at the time of the announcement. The costs of SME were expected to rise by 7 per cent to 10 per cent in the coming years which would in turn increase the costs of building a new fab to $10 billion. Therefore few companies would be able to build a new fab in the coming years which also meant that semiconductor equipment companies would rarely be able to afford one.The SME industry had always been characterized by its volatility because of technological change and intense competition. For example in 2000 industry sales reached a new record of $47.7 billion but then plummeted to $28 billion the following year. The gap between the most profitable year (2000) and the least profitable year (2005) was greater than $35 billion (see Exhibit 1). Such high uncertainty was caused by the volatility of the consumer electronics market which in turn had a large impact on the semiconductor industry. Therefore the demand for SME was driven by the demand from the semiconductor industry which itself depended on the consumer demand for electronic products (e.g. computers tablets and smartphones) that used semiconductors. Given that the life cycle for these products was rather short (e.g. 4.7 years for smartphones and 5.1 for tablets in 2014) it was necessary for SME players to constantly innovate to remain competitive in the market.Customers and CompetitorsThe SME market was dominated by buyers from the United States South Korea and Japan. Intel led the market with revenue of $51 billion in 2014 (a 6 per cent increase compared to 2013) followed by Samsung (South Korea) with revenue of $37 billion (an 8 per cent increase) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) with revenue of $25 billion (a 28 per cent increase). The combined revenue of these three industry leaders was higher than that of their next ten competitors. The top 10 leading companies held 59 per cent of the market but this number would tend to increase as the industry became more consolidated with 23 mergers and acquisitions deals completed in 2015. These buyers looked for equipment that would combine technical performance value and durability. Given their net increase in revenue of over three times the revenue of SME firms these buyers could put significant pressure on SME firms (see Exhibit 2).The SME market was highly concentrated with 85 per cent of its worldwide sales held by manufacturers in Taiwan South Korea China Japan and North America (see Exhibit 3). Europe and the Middle East represented only 6 per cent of total sales. In 2013 $23 billion or 70 per cent out of a total of $33 billion of industry sales was made by 10 companies and the remaining 30 per cent was made by the top two Applied Materials and ASML. Due to the length and complexity of the manufacturing process and the cost of developing new equipment SME companies tended to specialize in one portion of the manufacturing process. For example ASML specialized in the lithography system and thus occupied 82 per cent of the upper-end lithography market share. KEY players in the industryApplied MaterialsApplied Materials was an American company headquartered in the Silicon Valley United States. In 2015 the company was the industry leader with $9.7 billion in revenue $1.5 billion in investment in research and development (R&D) more than 10200 patents and 14000 employees in 18 countries. It operated in four segments including silicon systems applied global services display and energy and environmental solutions. In 2014 the company derived 66 per cent of its revenues from silicon systems. Its major customers were Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) Samsung and Intel. In 2015 Asia-Pacific the United States and Europe represented 71 per cent 22 per cent and 7 per cent of revenues respectively. ASMLASML was a Dutch company headquartered in Veldhoven the Netherlands. In 2015 it was ranked number two in the industry with $6.3 billion in revenue $1.1 billion in investment in R&D more than 10000 patents and 11000 employees in 16 countries. ASML was the world leader in lithography equipment. Its major customers too were TSMC Samsung and Intel. It sold products in Asia the United States and Europe representing 84 per cent 14 per cent and 2 per cent of sales revenues respectively.Lam ResearchLam Research was an American company headquartered in California. In 2015 the company was ranked number four in the industry with $5.9 billion in revenue around 10000 patents and more than 6300 employees in 16 countries. Lam Research�s revenues were derived largely from etching (conductor dielectric and silicon) and electrochemical deposition. Its main customers were located in Asia-Pacific and the United States and the largest customers were Samsung and TSMC. The company sold its products in Asia the United States and Europe representing 76 per cent 18 per cent and 6 per cent of sales revenues respectively. In October 2015 Lam Research announced that it had bought KLA-Tencor a U.S. semiconductor equipment company for $10.6 billion. The deal was supposed to be completed in the summer of 2016. This merger would have a significant impact on the competition in the industry as KLA-Tencor specialized in process control and yield management which was a major part of semiconductor manufacturing. KLA-TencorKLA-Tencor was an American company also headquartered in California. In 2015 the company was the fifth-largest player in the industry with $2.8 billion in revenue $500 million in investment in R&D and 5800 employees. KLA-Tencor�s revenue was largely based on process control and yield management with three customers�Intel Samsung and TSMC�accounting for more than 10 per cent of total revenues. The company sold its products in Asia the United States and Europe representing 60 per cent 27 per cent and 13 per cent of its sales revenues respectively. These four companies were considered to be the major players in this industry because they each had a market share of greater than 5 per cent (see Exhibit 4).INDUSTRY TrendsSeveral important industry trends appeared to have a major impact on the industry; the first was an expected increase of 1.4 per cent in global sales for Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) a global trade association. SEMI also expected wafer fabrication equipment shipments to rise by 2.5 per cent in 2016. The most important factor that explained the SEMI forecast was the fact that demand for consumer electronics which required semiconductors was on an upswing. In the domain of the Internet of Things the expected compound annual growth rate between 2014 and 2019 was 23 per cent while it was 9 per cent for industrial applications and 10 per cent for the automotive industry. In 2020 there would be more than 50 billion of these devices on the market accounting for more than six devices per person (see Exhibit 5).However an American research and advisory company Gartner Inc. (Gartner) expected that wafer fabrication equipment shipments would drop by 2.5 per cent in 2016 before following a growth trajectory in 2017. The discrepancy in the forecasts between the two was that SEMI expected that SME sales in Europe would increase by 63.1 per cent and increase in China by 9.1 per cent as both regions were seeing an increase in investments from semiconductor companies. However both SEMI and Gartner expected a decrease in equipment sales in Taiwan and South Korea which were two key semiconductor manufacturing countries accounting for 60 per cent of global SME sales in 2015. To summarize if the Chinese market failed to perform and growth slackened in Taiwan and South Korea then Gartner�s forecasts would most likely be right.Finally the consolidation of SME customers in 2015 and the coming years would likely lead to stronger buyer power as these consumers would consolidate their revenues and margins. Obviously this consolidation would lead to fierce competition. Because the forecasts were uncertain and the consumers were consolidating the SME companies were advised to look toward mergers and acquisitions to consolidate and strengthen their competitive positions. Moreover because of the industry�s high volatility semiconductor companies were expected to compete in an increasingly complicated and difficult market.Tokyo electron overviewHistoryTokyo Electron was a Japanese company headquartered in Tokyo Japan. The company was created in 1963 under the name Tokyo Electron Laboratories with a capitalization of �5 million. The company originally only imported and sold diffusion furnaces from Thermo Products Corp a U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer but in 1968 both companies made a joint venture under the name TEL-Thermo and started to produce those same furnaces in Japan. Thus from a trading company it became a manufacturing company. In the 1980s the company was renamed Tokyo Electron Limited and started to expand its manufacturing with the production of in-circuit board testers etch systems and coater/developers. In 1990 it made a full-scale entry into the liquid-crystal display production equipment market.Tokyo Electron made several acquisitions in the semiconductor equipment industry. The first acquisition was Timbre Technologies in 2001 an American company that specialized in the development of advanced software solutions for the semiconductor industry. Thanks to the acquired technologies and skills the company could integrate the most advanced process controls and yield management technologies which enabled it to develop next-generation wafer-processing equipment. The second acquisition was NEXX Systems in 2012 which specialized in the development of electrochemical deposition and physical vapour deposition systems. Both technologies were a key differentiating technology for wafer-level packaging which was vital for the semiconductor industry as it allowed for the final chip to become significantly smaller. This technology was imperative for the continuously thinner and lighter smartphones that were predominant in the market. In 2012 Tokyo Electron spent $280 million to acquire Oerlikon Solar a Swiss company that specialized in thin-film silicon photovoltaic panel technologies. These technologies provided superior energy conversion efficiency and manufacturing cost advantages. By combining such technologies with TEL�s advanced technologies in the SEM business TEL would be able to develop world-leading more competitive devices. The company also wanted to establish the photovoltaic panel production equipment business as its new core business. Oerlikon Solar became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokyo Electron under the name TEL Solar AG. However this business was less thriving than expected with TEL Solar AG achieving revenue of only $810412 in 2013 and Tokyo Electron decided to divest it in January 2014. Competitive PositionTokyo Electron was one of the leaders in the industry with $5.1 billion in sales in 2015 and $593 million in investments in R&D (see Exhibit 6). The company had 10844 employees worldwide of which 66 per cent were located in Japan. More than 94 per cent of its sales came from semiconductor production equipment. Coater/developers plasma etch systems thermal processing systems single wafer deposition systems cleaning systems and wafer probers were among the major products and services in this segment. In essence Tokyo Electron dealt almost exclusively in front-end manufacturing equipment. The company�s most profitable market was coater/developers which occupied over 89 per cent of the market share and had little competition.In 2015 Japan the United States Europe and Asia contributed 15.5 per cent 22 per cent 10.2 per cent and 52 per cent of the total sales respectively (see Exhibit 7). Tokyo Electron�s main customers TSMC Samsung and Intel were the same as those of its major rivals. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary in 2013 Tokyo Electron defined a new corporate philosophy that articulated the purpose of its existence and mission in society: �We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society through our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support.� ANNOUNCEMENT OF MERGER BETWEEN Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials On September 24 2013 Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron announced a merger of equals between the two companies with a combined market capitalization of $29 billion. This announcement was one of the most important strategic moves in the industry. �It�s like a merger of Google and Microsoft� said Dan Hutcheson a semiconductor market analyst at VLSI Research. The new entity would hold 25 per cent of the industry�s market share. This move came as a surprise in the industry as Tokyo Electron had a strong financial position in 2013. While some employees could exhibit resistance toward this deal especially considering the cultural differences the merger was completely approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Indeed while the situations of both companies were positive in 2013 their core customers which were the same had been increasingly pressuring them to reduce costs and also to invest more in R&D so as to develop more complex and modern equipment. Moreover while both companies seemed to sell similar types of products they actually specialized in different stages in the semiconductor manufacturing process. In particular Tokyo Electron specialized in thermal oxidation lithography (photoresist) etching (oxide) and wafer testing. Applied Materials however specialized in depositions (physical vapour deposition and chemical vapour deposition) chemical mechanical planarization and etching (metals) (see Exhibit 8).This new merger would allow both companies to gain synergies from their operational activities and products while leaving extra capital available for R&D investments. Facing cost pressures from customers mergers were one of the growth strategies for a large electronic company like Applied Materials to increase its revenues more quickly while preserving its profit margins. Developing new products was expensive in this industry (e.g. over $100 million for developing the product alone without selling it). So it was simpler for a company to buy another one and integrate its existing technological know-how and products. After the merger Tetsuro Higashi chief executive officer (CEO) of Tokyo Electron and Gary Dickerson CEO of Applied Materials would become the chairman and the CEO respectively of the new entity. The new entity would be called Eteris and would be based in the Netherlands. The Netherlands was selected due to tax advantages (e.g. the tax rate during 2013 was 17 per cent versus 22 per cent in the United States) and also because it represented a middle ground for both companies. The CEOs of both companies expected that the deal would achieve $250 million in cost savings by the first fiscal year and a total of $500 million by the third fiscal year. Once the merger deal was announced the shares of Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials rose by 14 per cent and 9.1 per cent respectively.While both companies acknowledged that the deal was a merger of equals shareholders of Applied Materials would own 68 per cent of the total shares of the new company. Rather than a merger of equals this deal could be seen as an acquisition of Tokyo Electron by Applied Materials. Hence it was possible that some employees at Tokyo Electron were afraid of losing their autonomy and culture.Antitrust IssuesGiven that the merger deal would result in the new entity controlling 25 per cent of the global market share of the industry there was a possibility that both merging parties could be exposed to antitrust issues. Jim Cramer a financial analyst from the U.S. business and financial TV channel CNBC stated: �It�s all about antitrust. This deal will not go through. It will absolutely not go through.� However Ben Pang an investment bank analyst at Northland Capital thought that �In each of the segments that they compete in there is absolutely another competitor right now� and thus there would be no reason for the antitrust regulations to forbid the deal. Therefore at the time of the announcement whether this deal would be rejected due to the antitrust was still inconclusive.The antitrust concerns for this merger deal were valid for several reasons. First some products of the two companies were indeed overlapping. The etching process would be the most problematic as both companies had products made through this process but for different types of materials (e.g. oxide for Tokyo Electron and metals for Applied Materials). However such an overlap would not create a monopoly in the etching process as Lam Research would still be the number-one player even after the merger between Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials. Second the U.S. antitrust regulator had a history of not approving large mergers. For example in 2015 the U.S. Department of Justice refused the mergers between Comcast and Time Warner Cable and between Sysco and US Foods. In all these cases the U.S. Department of Justice invoked the protection of U.S. customers against the monopoly of companies in the merger deal. From the regulator�s perspective there was also the risk that once the merger was done the new company would decrease its innovation efforts thereby developing fewer new products as it would not have much pressure from the competition. In the end both semiconductors companies and end customers would suffer from the lack of innovation. However both Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron had rejected the likelihood of this innovation risk.For the deal to be complete both companies would have to gain regulatory approval from eight countries: the United States Japan China South Korea Germany Taiwan Singapore and Israel. In December 2014 Tokyo Electron announced that the date for completion of the merger had to be postponed from December 30 2014 to March 24 2015. The date had already been delayed once from September 24 2014 to December 30 2014. As of the time of the announcement of March 24 2015 only Israel and Singapore had approved the merger of the two companies. The antitrust regulations of several countries such as China Japan and the United States had been taking a longer time to review than expected.At the time both Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials had acknowledged that the main opposition came from the Japanese and U.S. antitrust regulators. They concurred that Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials had to divest a number of overlapping product lines. But the most critical point in the regulators� opinion was whether the divestitures that both companies were ready to pursue would be sufficient to tilt the balance in their favour. As of 2013 both companies had only been required to divest assets worth $600 million to secure antitrust approval. Mark Ostrau Fenwick & West LLP co-chairman explained:In such multiproduct situations there�s often general consensus on the problem products and the safe products but then there�s a gray area of products in the middle that the companies either have to convince the agencies are not a source of concern or have to dig deeper into the deal value and provide a fix to address [those] as well. While both companies had not thought the antitrust issue would present a real threat the international regulators might not think in the same way.On April 27 2015 over 18 months after the merger was first announced Applied Materials eventually admitted that the deal had not gone through because of regulatory concerns. In particular the U.S. Department of Justice had declared that the companies� proposals and divestiture attempts were not sufficient to supersede the antitrust concerns. However the merger between the two companies might be executed but the new entity of Eteris would not be able to sell its products on U.S. territory. This restriction was unimaginable given that one of the firms� biggest customers Intel was located in the United States. The merger deal was hence cancelled. In fact the deal was cancelled likely not only due to the antitrust concerns per se but also because semiconductor companies like Intel and Samsung opposed the deal and proposed reasons for the rejection to the U.S. Department of Justice.For Tokyo Electron this failed merger was a tough blow as the company had invested more than �10 billion in this strategic move with a lot of hope. As CEO Higashi said �I�m not convinced but the conclusion has been made. I have no choice but to accept it. It�s a regrettable outcome. I feel that it�s a real shame.�AftermathMany analysts believed that between the two companies Tokyo Electron probably suffered more from the cancellation of the deal as Applied Materials had already looked ahead and sought new acquisitions or partnerships. �Now Tokyo Electron has to find a way to go it alone. If it doesn�t we can expect the shares to fall� said Mitsushige Akino executive officer of Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. Ltd. To add to such a difficult situation Tokyo Electron was facing increasingly high costs because of customer demand for next-generation equipment.In October 2015 Lam Research announced a merger with KLA-Tencor. If the merger was to go through then the semiconductor equipment market would be led by three major companies: Applied Materials ASML and Lam Research/KLA-Tencor with each company holding around a 15 per cent market share. Tokyo Electron would fall behind with only a 9 per cent market share (see Exhibit 4). The company was likely to be left behind in the semiconductor industry where consolidation was a key driver of competitiveness.Importantly the threat from customers was still strong as Intel Samsung and TSMC bought 60 per cent of chip-making equipment and thus had a lot of bargaining power over their suppliers. Such a threat was imminent as Intel announced in July 2015 that it intended to spend only $7.7 billion on equipment for the year 2015 11.5 per cent less than $8.7 billion which was announced in April 2015 and 23 per cent less than $10 billion which was projected in January 2015. These numbers were unlikely to change in a positive direction due to the expected slowdown in personal computer sales in the coming years.�We would like to make a fresh departure as a new Tokyo Electron� said the Tokyo Electron CEO in June 2015. Indeed the future was not all bad for the company as its financial position was still strong in 2015. Sales had reached �613 billion in 2015 (a 23 per cent increase compared to 2013) and even the operating profit had increased by 173 per cent from 2014 so as to reach �88 billion. While sales had indeed decreased in Japan in 2015 (a downward trend since 2011) they were compensated for by an increase in both Europe and the United States (see Exhibit 6).Tokyo Electron had some of the most reliable and efficient products available on the market. However some of its customers had complained that the company was not sufficiently proactive toward them contrary to Applied Materials which was praised for its good customer service. Because of a traditional silo organization with a bureaucratic and long decision-making process�characteristics of most Japanese organizations�it was possible the company could lose its customers to more aggressive competitors. Losing one major customer might mean losing around 10 per cent of the total sales and meanwhile the cost of production was expected to rise in the near future. In this volatile industry to be sustainable the company needed to maintain a profit margin at over 15 per cent. For Tokyo Electron the most important thing seemed to be how the company could become a customer-oriented rather than a product-oriented company.It was indeed a challenging situation for Tokyo Electron in the global semiconductor industry. Externally there were not many strategies for surviving and growing besides consolidating with its competitors and competing fiercely based on costs and probably innovations. The company could try to initiate another merger deal but again it might not succeed due to the same antitrust reasons as in its first attempt. Tokyo Electron possibly had to look for a different strategy to successfully compete in this highly consolidated industry. Internally the CEO would need to consider reorganizing the company in order to make it more customer-centric and more responsive to such a demanding and dynamic industry environment.Exhibit 1: Semiconductor equipment billings (2000�2015)Source: Created by the case authors based on �Semiconductor Equipment Back on Track� SC-IQ: Semiconductor Intelligence December 19 2013 accessed December 3 2016 www.semiconductorintelligence.com/semiconductor-equipment-back-on-track.Exhibit 2: Revenue comparison between Semiconductor Companies and Equipment and Material companiesSource: Created by the case authors based on Lara Chamness �2011: A Look Back at the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Market and Outlook� Semiconductor Manufacturing & Design accessed December 3 2016 http://semimd.com/semi/2012/04/08/2011-a-look-back-at-the-semiconductor-equipment-and-materials-market-and-outlook.Exhibit 3: Semiconductor equipment sales forecast by region (Us$ billions)Source: Created by the case authors based on �Semiconductor Equipment Sales Forecast: $37 Billion in 2015 and $38 Billion in 2016� SEMI December 15 2015 accessed December 3 2016 www.semi.org/en/node/60181.Exhibit 4: Revenue of major SME players (US$ Millions)Source: Created by the case authors based on Gina Roos �Semiconductor Spending Fell 12%� EPS News April 8 2014 accessed December 3 2016 https://epsnews.com/2014/04/08/semiconductor-equipment-spending-fell-12.

Eandis operated one of the leading low- and medium-voltage electricity networks in Europe. The company’s financial plan was more complex than it had been in previous years because the company needed to decide whether to roll out smart meters to their Belgian customers—a decision that could be seen as an opportunity for growth. At the same time Van den Bossche was aware of the regulatory risk that came with such large investments in his field. Thus far the company had been operating in a regulated monopoly governed by a cost-plus (cost+) pricing regime. In that regime the company recovered all of its costs from the fees grid users paid to access the electricity distribution network. The charges were expressed in volumetric tariffs of euros per energy unit. The cost+ regime had motivated Eandis to invest in the grid infrastructure; however that regime was about to be replaced by an incentive regulation scheme—a pricing regime that would involve either a price cap an upper limit on the unit prices charged to network users or a revenue cap (an upper limit on the total revenue the DSO could earn). With the anticipated change in revenue structure the company needed a new financial analysis for the company’s planning processes; the new analysis would need to anticipate the potential changes in regulatory structure and how the changes would affect a decision to invest in smart metering. The CEO summarized “With the funding needs ahead for the DSO industry it is important to prove to potential institutional investors and other stakeholders that we have looked at all reasonable scenarios to assess the impact on profitability equity debt turn over . . . you name it.” The Power Grid Industry in EuropeThe power grid industry was rapidly changing and low- to medium-voltage grid operators which were asset-intensive owners of vast infrastructures merited attention. Electricity DSOs played an important role in Europe’s energy system: they linked the transmission system with 260 million connected customers delivering approximately 2700 terawatt hours (TWh) of electrical energy per year. Europe’s DSOs collectively employed approximately 240000 people. Distribution grids had been previously regarded as merely the last mile in the delivery of low- and medium-voltage electricity; however with more technology penetrating the grids the future role of DSOs was increasingly a topic of discussion. Europe’s DSOs approximately 2400 in number were likely to become the central hub and backbone of future intelligent power systems. Several forces were challenging the status quo of electrical distribution. An increasing number of generators creating electricity from renewable resources (renewable generators) were being connected to the networks at the distribution level and the grids were increasingly driven by information technology (IT)—a process known as “becoming smart.” Large centralized power generators such as those involving hydro nuclear energy coal and gas were giving way to a range of dispersed units such as co-generation plants photovoltaic panels (solar panels) and wind turbines. Millions of these small-scale units were already generating electricity all over Europe. Further as smart meter systems were added to the system electricity consumers could use the information and communication technologies to participate in the distribution system. These clients which were unlikely to change in number represented 99 per cent of all final customers. The evolving context was not only changing the business model of power generation but also affecting the grid operations and investments of network companies which included DSOs. Regulation was advancing and it triggered the need for adequate financial planning models to complement existing tools of analysis. In addition to being used in project analysis where for example the net present value of projects or investments was calculated for a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and to assess profitability financial modelling tools were needed to calculate the impact of a project or investment on the rate of tariffs.EANDIS: THE BELGIAN POWER GRID OPERATOREandis was the regional electricity DSO in Flanders the northern Flemish region of Belgium servicing a market that covered 78 per cent of the Flemish municipalities. With a network of 94000 kilometres (km) (61000 km in low voltage and 33000 in medium voltage) Eandis supplied 2.5 million clients engaged 4750 employees and generated €3 billion in operating revenue from a base of €3 billion in total assets.Basic Financial Statement for EandisIn 2014 Eandis serviced a consumption of 30 TWh at a regulated price of €39.17 per megawatt hour (MWh). The company’s return on equity was 7 per cent with equity costs of €140 million for a total equity of €2000 million (€2 billion) (see Exhibit 1). A depreciation cost of €220 million for the regulated asset base (RAB) of €5000 million (€5 billion) indicated that under a simplified linear depreciation model the existing assets were assumed to have an average lifetime of about 23 to 26 years. This was realistic for power grid companies which typically had a mixed composition of heavy infrastructure assets with a lifetime of up to 40 years (e.g. cables and overhead lines) and lighter assets with shorter lifetimes (e.g. IT equipment).Main Assumptions for Cost+ PricingIn the cost+ scenario the regulatory regime was assumed to remain as it was (see Exhibit 2). The annual increase of operating expenses other costs and consumption for the projected years 2015–2024 was assumed under business as usual. In this scenario the change in the RAB was the net effect of the ongoing asset depreciation of €230 million per year corrected for the investments that were planned to replace depreciated assets of €400 million per year. For the new investments a depreciation rate of 2.5 per cent per year was assumed implying an asset lifetime of about 40 years. It was also assumed that positive changes to the financing needs (an increase in the RAB) or negative changes to the financing needs (a decrease in the RAB) were shared between debt (60 per cent) and equity (40 per cent). Moreover equity was equal to the shared capital in 2014 implying the absence of any reserves. As of 2015 the company would have accumulated reserves because a portion of the profit was paid out as dividends while another portion was kept in the company.Financial Planning for Regulatory ChangesIf the regulatory structure changed revenues would vary. The cost+ regime covered all cost positions and the revenues had to provide the profits which equalled the allowed return on equity. This was assumed to be 7 per cent of equity as in 2014. Under this regime the revenues no longer guaranteed a fixed return on equity. Instead the revenues included the costs that the regulator accepted to be recovered from consumers the allowed change in operating expenses and the allowed capital expenditure. The difference between the allowed costs and actual costs determined the net profit and thus the company’s performance. Under the cost+ regime the company had an implicit weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5.5 per cent but in 2014 the regulator had limited the WACC to 5 per cent. The regulator had set the starting value for operating expenses based on the DSO’s expected cost but the allowed operating expense was capped at a 2 per cent increase per year even if the DSO argued that the operating expenses would grow at 2.4 per cent per year and that investing in smart meters would further increase the operating expenses.If the regulatory regime changed to price cap regulation revenues would depend on the price cap set by the regulator and the volume customers consumed (see Exhibit 3). In this scenario the volume risk would be assumed by the company.This possible change to price cap regulation posed the threat that the regulator might not allow grid tariffs to increase more than 2 per cent per year. This threat was taken seriously because the investments had a lifetime of more than a decade while the regulatory period in which the regulated parameters were fixed was typically for four to five years.Investment programEandis was considering a slow but almost complete rollout of smart meters (see Exhibit 4). The costs would be high in the first two years because the company would need to assume costs to prepare the company systems for rollout. Moreover these investments had a depreciation rate of 10 per cent which was set by the regulator based on the expected lifetime of a meter.The ChallengeUsing the financial information and assumptions van den Bossche needed to develop a financial planning model that would help him evaluate the smart meter investment program under the different regulatory regimes and assumptions. Use the accompanying Student Spreadsheet (Ivey product no 7B19N003) to determine whether Eandis should undertake the investment in smart meters under the different regulatory regimes and if so under what conditions the investment might be attractive to Eandis’s equity investors. The financial planning model should include a detailed income statement a cash flow statement and balance sheets for Eandis.Exhibit 1: Company Results 2014 (in € millions except where indicated)Note: € = euros; MWh = megawatt hours.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 2: Business as Usual 2015–2024 (in percentages except where indicated)Note: RAB = regulatory asset base.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: Parameter Settings for Regulatory RegimesNote: WACC = weighted average cost of capital.Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 4: Expenditures for the Smart Meter Investment ProgramSource: Created by the case authors.

Vu who was TEKCOM’s chief executive officer had good reasons to be proud of his company’s achievements. Established in 2005 TEKCOM had moved from being an import company distributing construction materials for the domestic market to becoming a leading manufacturer of film-faced plywood (FFP) in Vietnam. TEKCOM was one of the largest Vietnamese manufacturers of FFP with an export market share of 55 per cent. For over two hours the TEKCOM board of directors had deliberated intensely on the future of TEKCOM with no clear consensus. The business environment in Vietnam had changed and new opportunities were beckoning. As a high performance company TEKCOM was determined to grow. From 2013 to 2016 TEKCOM had seen annual average growth in both revenue and gross profit at 50 per cent and 73 per cent respectively. Expansion opportunities for FFP still existed in Vietnam but its growth was expected to plateau over the next three to five years. Entering new markets with new products would enable TEKCOM to grow but the payoff was uncertain. TEKCOM’s challenge in securing raw materials for FFP production was becoming critical. Obtaining raw materials was a major factor in determining growth in this industry. As Vu walked back to the meeting table he wondered whether TEKCOM should focus on improving its current core FFP offerings or seize the opportunity to enter new markets with new products. The risks and trade-offs involved in pursuing either option could be drastic and complex. He would need the advice of his senior colleagues to reach the right decision.Background of TEKCOMIn 2005 Vu and two partners founded Ky Thuong Company Limited (Ky Thuong) a trading company for insulation products in Vietnam. A new trading line of imported FFP from China was added in 2007 for the Vietnamese market. In 2010 Vu and Ich Tuan Hoang merged several Ky Thuong entities and called the new joint-stock company TEKCOM Corporation. Business was brisk and TEKCOM experienced double-digit growth from 2005 to 2011. By 2010 95 per cent of FFP used in Vietnam was imported from China primarily for the construction industry. Sensing the growth in demand for higher quality FFP to support the local construction boom the founders decided to venture into FFP production in 2011. Raw materials for making plywood were not readily available and there were only two plywood manufacturers in Vietnam. Therefore a key supporting strategy was identifying and cultivating a supplier base of raw materials.Investors were initially concerned with TEKCOM’s ability to transform from trading company to manufacturer. The transition period was indeed difficult. TEKCOM encountered low labour productivity supply disruption high inventory and long lead times. However with discipline teamwork and the mindset of an organization eager for learning and continuous improvement TEKCOM gradually stabilized production and expanded capacity. From 2013 to 2016 production capacity for FFP increased 10-fold from 12000 to 120000 cubic metres. In 2016 TEKCOM’s total sales reached US$30 million with domestic and export markets accounting for 30 and 70 per cent respectively. The founders attributed TEKCOM’s success to its core values of determination integrity teamwork and collaboration.Wood Products Value ChainFrom wood logs (timber) three categories of wood raw materials could be derived: sawn timber wood chip and veneer (see Exhibit 1). Wood logs could either be hardwood (e.g. mahogany birch oak teak or rubberwood) or softwood (e.g. cedar pine redwood or spruce). Veneer was the main raw material for plywood manufacturing.Although Vietnam had large forests to support the manufacturing of wood products local businesses found it difficult to compete with foreign rivals due to Vietnam’s highly fragmented wood-product supply chains. Disjointed supply chains led to high logistics costs and protracted lead times. More than 90 per cent of local wood-product manufacturers were small- and medium-sized enterprises. Most wood-products manufacturers produced raw timber and low-value furniture products for export. Plywood manufacturing constituted only a small percentage of total wood-products manufacturing. Most plywood manufacturers produced low- to mid-range quality plywood for construction applications. Furniture and flooring products required high quality plywood such as fancy plywood (FP) which was not readily available in Vietnam. Therefore manufacturers had to import plywood from overseas suppliers. More than 70 per cent of local wood logs were exported as veneer sawn timber or wood chip. Of the remaining 30 per cent very few were used to make veneer. Therefore local plywood manufacturers such as TEKCOM found it difficult to source local veneer. PlywoodPlywood was commonly categorized by its ability to resist cracking shrinkage splitting twisting and warping. Plywood could be made from softwood or hardwood veneer. Depending on intended use plywood was coated on the surface to give it special properties. For example FFP was commonly used in construction and covered with a special film to increase strength and waterproofness. Other plywood products such as melamine-faced plywood and FP were used to make furniture and flooring.With shifts in the global economy plywood production had moved to new emerging countries due to favourable production costs and increased domestic demand for plywood. Most plywood was manufactured in Asia-Pacific countries such as China Indonesia and Malaysia. Tropical wood species were used as the main raw material in Asian plywood production. China was the world’s largest manufacturer of plywood. European manufacturers tended to focus on producing high-end plywood. The availability of a skilled workforce and large amounts of high-grade plantation forests (in terms of size knots surface smoothness and other factors) in countries such as Finland and Russia were key to advancing the plywood industry in that part of the world. High-end plywood commanded high prices and generated high returns. Korea the Middle East and Europe had leading plywood markets where environmental impact was an important buying factor. For example these markets only purchased plywood with low formaldehyde emissions for flooring and furniture applications. To enter developed markets plywood manufacturers had to provide certifications on quality supply sources and production information. VeneerMost veneer producers in Vietnam were small family businesses. Due to a lack of regulations and forest management knowledge wood-log plantation owners experienced variable harvest size and output quality creating problems for veneer producers in classifying and controlling raw material for plywood manufacturers. Veneer consisted of thin slices of wood usually no thicker than 6 millimetres (mm). Veneer was obtained by peeling the trunk of a tree or slicing blocks of wood. Because the makeup of the wood log varied from the surface to the core of the trunk the peeled veneer would have slightly different properties creating different qualities of veneer. After peeling the veneer slices were classified into A B and C grades and dried. Veneer was graded on criteria such as size smoothness surface quality (i.e. holes or knots) and colour. Multiple layers of veneer were glued together to make plywood. The plywood production process was labour-intensive and required long lead times for pressing trimming sanding film overlay and finishing (see Exhibit 2).Two major considerations in veneer manufacturing were production yield and wood waste utilization. Veneer production yield referred to the percentage of the timber log that could be turned into usable veneer. The remainder of the log or wood waste could be sold to companies to make wood chip products. Otherwise veneer producers would have to incur costs to dispose the wood waste.TEKCOM’s Veneer SuppliersTEKCOM bought veneer from local suppliers in the Binh Duong and Dong Nai provinces. The proximity of these suppliers to the TEKCOM factory helped reduce transportation cost. Most of the veneer supplied to TEKCOM was made from hardwood logs usually rubberwood. Suppliers sold mostly grade A and grade B veneer to TEKCOM and grade C to other plywood producers. TEKCOM used grade A and grade B veneer to make mid-range FFP whereas grade C veneer was used to produce regular FFP which commanded lower prices and offered lower profitability.TEKCOM was a preferred veneer customer for two reasons. First it provided an attractive purchase policy where long-term contracts were signed for the purchase of grade A and grade B veneer with short payment terms. Second TEKCOM had a good supplier development program where TEKCOM provided training to suppliers’ workers and worked with suppliers to improve their management processes. TEKCOM also worked with local banks to support suppliers to upgrade their veneer production facilities. Because wood logs were limited veneer suppliers competed aggressively to secure raw materials which in turn pushed up the price of veneer. Rising veneer prices posed a great challenge for TEKCOM operations and needed to be a key factor in future strategy formulation. To mitigate high veneer prices TEKCOM could raise FFP prices but this would price TEKCOM out of its markets. TEKCOM’s MarketsAlthough FFP came in several different categories TEKCOM offered two variations—mid-range FFP and regular FFP—and sold its product to distributors. In both domestic and overseas markets TEKCOM’s FFP was better known in the mid-range segment because of its higher quality in durability and reusability. TEKCOM avoided the premium FFP segment despite its higher margins because making premium FFP required high-grade veneer which was in scarce supply in Vietnam. In 2016 TEKCOM accounted for 20 per cent of the FFP market share in Vietnam. TEKCOM’s FFP products were also sold in overseas markets such as Turkey the Middle East and South Korea (see Exhibit 3). Entering export markets required high levels of quality safety and environmentally-friendly practices. Therefore TEKCOM worked with independent test organizations to obtain certifications such as ISO 9001 and EU certification of conformity to verify TEKCOM’s use of eco-friendly production practices and responsible forest management.TEKCOM products were widely trusted. Although an anti-dumping tax was imposed on many plywood companies in China and Vietnam TEKCOM was spared because it worked with legal representatives in export markets to provide full information and disclosure to prove that its products were genuinely made by TEKCOM. This enhanced TEKCOM’s competitiveness in export markets.TEKCOM was also an original equipment manufacturer for customers in South Korea and the Middle East which helped TEKCOM not only expand its scale of production and lower production cost but also increase its competitiveness through product and process innovation and market familiarization. TEKCOM also provided value-added services to its customers. Although most FFP manufacturers offered two main FFP sizes (i.e. 1250 × 2500 mm and 1220 × 2440 mm) TEKCOM could deliver FFP to meet specific size requests from customers. This saved customers time and effort to post-process the delivered FFP. Challenges and OpportunitiesA major challenge for TEKCOM was the rising cost of veneer due partly to limited sources of wood logs—70 per cent of Vietnam’s wood logs were exported. In addition recent developments had further reduced the availability of rubber trees for wood log which was TEKCOM’s main source of veneer. TEKCOM’s veneer suppliers who had bought rubber plantations in the southeast and highland areas of Vietnam earned income either by harvesting latex from rubber trees or by cutting down rubber trees for wood log. From 2013 to 2016 global oversupply and limited storage capacity caused natural rubber prices to fall steeply and farmers cut down rubber trees to sell as wood log. During that period prices of rubberwood were relatively low and plywood manufacturers using rubberwood veneer gained advantage from the low cost of raw material. By mid-2016 however most farmers had began to run out of rubber trees that could be harvested as wood log. The suppliers also wanted to keep some rubber trees to hedge against a future rise in demand for latex. Both issues worked together to create a reduction in the supply of rubberwood logs. TEKCOM’s supply problem was also aggravated by increased competition from overseas buyers to purchase wood logs and veneer produced in southern and central Vietnam who used these raw materials to make a wide range of wood products. One strategy that TEKCOM adopted to cope with the limited veneer supply was to redesign production processes to make better use of all grades of veneer. Improvements to the production process allowed TEKCOM to use some grade C veneer to make FFP of a similar quality to grades A and B veneer. This strategy improved the production yield of high quality FFP but it was still not enough to mitigate the general shortage of veneer supply.TEKCOM also looked for new sources for the supply of raw materials. With the scarcity of rubberwood TEKCOM considered making veneer from the Acacia Auriculiformis tree which grew in abundance in the Mekong Delta region. However the veneer manufacturing industry in the Mekong Delta was not well developed. Most wood-product manufacturers there focused on wood-chip and sawn-timber production. Therefore the bulky Acacia Auriculiformis trees would have to be shipped from the Mekong Delta to Ho Chi Minh City in barges and from Ho Chi Minh City to Binh Duong in trucks. This additional transportation raised the cost of making veneer. TEKCOM considered building an FFP factory in the Mekong Delta near the sources of the wood log supply but the lack of veneer manufacturers and suitable labour posed major challenges. Veneer made from Acacia Auriculiformis also tended to be of lower quality. There were also some veneer sources in northern Vietnam but their veneer had more defects and would result in a lower plywood production yield.TEKCOM also considered augmenting local sourcing with overseas supply. Being larger and better organized overseas suppliers from Europe Russia and the United States offered higher quality wood log from which higher quality veneer could be obtained. Grade C veneer from wood imported from these countries was easily as good as grades A and B veneer from local suppliers. Plywood production yields were also better. However importing veneer was expensive. Another option was to vertically integrate by importing wood logs and making veneer in TEKCOM. Initial cost analysis however showed that the higher production yield generated from making veneer this way was not enough to compensate for the cost of importing wood logs and equipping facilities to make veneer (see Exhibit 4). More importantly this option would divert TEKCOM from its core competency in FFP production and would require TEKCOM to build new capabilities.Another challenge TEKCOM was facing was the saturation of domestic demand for FFP. The growth projection of the FFP market in Vietnam over the next three years did not align well with TEKCOM’s growth target especially with the presence of FFP competition. With 70 per cent of total revenue coming from exports TEKCOM could step up its efforts to expand into existing and new overseas FFP markets. Overseas FFP markets were expected to grow steadily but without a stable and reliable veneer supply base it was difficult for TEKCOM to increase production and expand sales. TEKCOM noticed that markets for certain plywood applications like furniture and flooring had been growing rapidly in Vietnam. However these applications used FP made from high-grade veneer which was available only from overseas suppliers and required automated production processes that TEKCOM did not have. A March 2017 incident had forced TEKCOM to seriously review its corporate and market strategy. A sudden surge in back orders triggered by a shortage of veneer had rattled several of TEKCOM’s key customers. Normally back orders could be filled by running the factory at full capacity over a specific period. However the factory’s supply of veneer at the time was so low that it could only operate at a maximum of 50-per-cent capacity. The build-up of back orders was the worst case that TEKCOM had seen in years. Some key customers were so upset that they complained directly to Vu and threatened to take their business elsewhere. Vu realized that the recurring problem of supply disruption required a fresh look and a more robust solution. Because veneer supply was related to the larger issue of growth and sustainability Vu decided to gather senior management to review its strategy and deliberate on how TEKCOM should move ahead.The first strategy meeting was a brainstorming session. Vu raised the possibility of using market and sourcing diversification to mitigate the reliance on local veneer suppliers. Marketing representatives suggested entering the new premium FFP segment in current markets where profit margins were higher. The idea was opposed by the Research and Development and the Operations departments who felt that the order-winning criteria of these markets required TEKCOM to incur additional investment in research and development and acquire more sophisticated production processes and controls including a requirement for special veneer (e.g. veneer made from birch) from overseas suppliers. Conforming to these standards would take time and it was unclear if the higher margins could offset the higher production costs. Operations representatives suggested that TEKCOM should continue to do what it did best—make FFP to serve its current markets. Operations would continue to improve on its production process to increase yield from grade C veneer and look for new veneer sources within Vietnam and the region. Furthermore market consolidation of local FFP players was likely to happen which could allow TEKCOM to increase market share. Vu and the business development department pointed out that it might be an opportune time for TEKCOM to venture into new markets and new products namely FP and medium-density fibreboard (MDF). The FP and MDF markets were already large and continuing to expand compared to the FFP market and the FP and MDF margins were relatively more attractive. Operations representatives raised the concern that FP production required high-grade veneer that could only be sourced from overseas suppliers and would require some automation. MDF production would need an enormous amount of investment in automated production processes. TEKCOM currently focused on labour-intensive operations where it had an advantage in understanding and managing local workers. There were already some companies in Vietnam with large-scale MDF operations who had extensive experience in automation so it would take TEKCOM a long time to catch up to the competition. The first strategy meeting ended with more questions than answers. More meetings were planned to help resolve these questions.THE PATH FORWARDA few meetings later in June 2017 Vu was looking to his senior colleagues across the large mahogany table for advice. Knowing the TEKCOM culture he was aware of the need for buy-in from senior management to influence the rest of the company. He had earlier argued that TEKCOM would need to move beyond a single-product strategy to sustain growth. Entering the FP market with its higher margins could be a good start for TEKCOM to develop its capabilities of introducing new products in new markets. He was aware that TEKCOM’s experience was based only on FFP production. Therefore selling and producing new plywood products was a risky proposition. He was also unsure if TEKCOM could develop the engineering expertise needed to reconfigure its production processes for the manufacture of FFP and other new products. Given the risks Vu wondered how he could convince the investors that this was the right strategy for the company. What if it took so long to build up internal capabilities that the markets changed? How could TEKCOM ensure that it could compete in markets with well-established manufacturers? Could TEKCOM’s culture embrace change? The status quo seemed unsustainable and likely to limit growth. So how should TEKCOM proceed?Exhibit 1: Wood Products		Source: Company files.exhibit 2: Production Process for Film-Faced PlywoodSource: Company files.exhibit 3: TEKCOM’s MarketsDistribution of Markets (in Percentage of Revenue)Market ShareNote: m3 = cubic metreSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: Raw material and product informationPurchase prices and production yieldsNote: All currency amounts are in US$; m3 = cubic metre; FFP = film-faced plywood; * percentage of wood log on average that could be turned into useable veneer; ** percentage of veneer on average that could be converted into FFPSelling prices and marginsNote: All currency amounts are in US$; m3 = cubic metre; FFP = film-faced plywood; MDF = medium-density fibreboardSource: Company files.

Starting early in 2015 Water Operations in London was consistently experiencing higher operational costs with electricity bills accounting for up to 30 per cent of direct costs. While exploring options to reduce this cost Soltani read the Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater Facilities report that was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 and was delighted to read that the City of Columbus Georgia had managed to achieve 25 per cent energy costs savings by eliminating pump inefficiencies at water pumping stations. Soltani wondered whether she could replicate this success at the City of London. Given that the city’s electricity bill was consistently increasing due to rising electricity costs the possibility of reducing electricity usage was even more appealing. Soltani knew that in the short term there was little possibility for improvements to infrastructure for efficiency gains; however she wondered whether hourly water pumping could be scheduled during off-peak electricity periods when prices were lower. Soltani began to explore hourly electricity prices and wondered whether the pricing schedule could be accurately predicted 24 hours in advance. She knew that creating an accurate prediction model would be critical to optimizing pumping schedules and therefore reducing electricity usage and costs.London’s Water SystemLondon received its water from two main sources: Lake Huron and Lake Erie (see Exhibit 1). These water sources were administered by the Lake Huron Primary Water Supply System and the Elgin Area Primary Water Supply System respectively. There were also two backup emergency wells: the Fanshawe well field and the Hyde Park well field. In 2015 London Water bought 44.3 billion litres of water from the supply systems for a total cost of CA$21.5 million. To move water from the lakes and into its final treated form at individual households London had a complex distribution system of treatment plants reservoirs pumping stations and 1550 kilometres of pipes (see Exhibits 2 and 3).Water Pumping OperationIn determining the optimal pumping schedules London Water needed to address three priorities: meeting demand quantities maintaining water quality and meeting pressure needs. Meeting Demand QuantitiesReservoirs needed to meet both peak water consumption demands and unexpected demands. For example many cities maintained capacity for extraneous demands such as firefighting needs. In 2015 London’s average daily water demand was 120.33 million litres. The largest daily amount pumped in 2015 was 151.45 million litres on July 28 2015.Maintaining Water QualityPumping schedules impacted the age of water in reservoirs and thus affected the water quality.Meeting Pressure NeedsA minimum quantity of water also needed to be maintained in reservoirs to ensure adequate water pressure to deliver water through London’s network of pipes.Meeting the prioritiesTo meet these priorities reservoir levels needed to be maintained between a maximum capacity and a minimum required level. Accordingly over a 24-hour planning period pumping operations were scheduled at low-price hours as long as the key priorities were met. The potential for cost savings by optimizing pump scheduling was thus significant. Soltani believed that London Water was filling the water tanks too early in the day and not benefiting from periods of low energy prices. By efficiently scheduling pumping operations and operating at lower levels throughout the day she estimated that electricity costs could typically be reduced by 10–15 per cent. Energy costs accounted for up to 80 per cent of the processing and distribution costs of drinking water. This wide range existed because the costs included multiple factors in addition to pump scheduling. For example the water pumping cost was much higher in Toronto where the topography forced the distribution system to mostly pump water upstream which required much more energy than in London where 80 per cent of the city was fed by gravity. The efficiency of water infrastructure also had a large impact especially when leaks in the pipes led to water loss. Construction and maintenance costs also varied for different utilities. In regions with colder climates pipes needed to be installed further underground to reduce the likelihood of frozen watermains which made any infrastructure upgrades or repairs very expensive.Despite the benefits of optimizing pumping schedules using predictive and algorithmic methods most pumping schedules were managed manually by water operators. In general however increasing energy costs and water constraints necessitated that all water utilities consider various methods to optimize their efficiency and reduce costs.Electricity MarketsElectricity markets were managed and operated by independent system operators (ISOs). The ISO that operated the Ontario market was the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO). By balancing supply and demand of real-time electricity the IESO determined the hourly Ontario electricity price (HOEP) which was the market price of wholesale electricity in Ontario.The Hourly Ontario Electricity PriceLarge electricity consumers that used more than 250000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity paid the wholesale electricity price or the HOEP. The IESO determined the HOEP by forecasting demand 24 hours in advance and accepting supply offers from generators and electricity importers. Supply price offers were mostly affected by fuel and generation costs such as the cost of natural gas for a generator converting natural gas into electricity and fixed costs such as ongoing operating costs. After supply offers were received a small number of large consumers (local distribution companies or LDCs) bid on the price they were willing to pay for a certain amount of electricity. LDCs determined their bid by forecasting the demand that they expected from their customers which ranged from individual households and private businesses to public utilities such as London Water. Demand was primarily impacted by weather business needs and general usage efficiency. Apart from supply and demand factors inefficiencies in the transmission grid and in the network of high-voltage power lines impacted the transportation and delivery of energy and subsequently the actual clearing prices of electricity.The IESO collected supply offer and demand bids up to two hours in advance of actual energy use. It stacked all supply offers from the lowest-priced offer to the highest purchasing through the stack until energy demands were met. The HOEP was the average of these market clearing prices in any given hour. An additional operating reserve price was set which paid suppliers to have on-call electricity generation capabilities in the case of a demand surge or supply shortage (such as a generation breakdown).Global AdjustmentIn addition to the HOEP electricity consumers were also charged a global adjustment (GA) fee. The GA fee was the discrepancy between the HOEP and any predetermined IESO contract prices with specific conservation generators such as renewable-energy generators. For example the feed-in tariff for on-shore wind electricity generation was $0.128/kWh meaning that IESO guaranteed a price floor of $0.128 for electricity from these generators. When the HOEP went below this price the GA fee was increased to account for the cost of covering the feed-in tariff. The GA was calculated and charged on a monthly basis. To incentivize consumers to reduce electricity demand during peak hours Class A electricity users (defined as having an average hourly peak demand of greater than or equal to 5 megawatts) were charged for their portion of the electricity demand during the five highest annual demand peaks. For example if on an annual basis a consumer accounted for 2 per cent of total electricity demand during peak hours the GA rate would be 2 per cent of the total GA cost. The DataSoltani collected the HOEPs from 2003 to 2015 (see Exhibit 4 and Student Spreadsheet [Ivey product no. 7B19E004]). The data provided the date hour (using the 24-hour clock) and the corresponding hourly prices.Impact and DecisionWith such large potential electricity savings Soltani knew that optimizing the schedules of pumping operations would hold significant merit. Because few other water utilities had adopted such methods London had the opportunity to become an innovation leader and present a best-practice scenario. To make this decision however Soltani first needed to find an accurate way of predicting the electricity prices 24 hours in advance for any given day. Because cost savings were predicated on lower electricity prices determining the best prediction model was critical to addressing any questions about future optimization. After making a large cup of Persian tea Soltani sat down to contemplate how she should proceed.EXHIBIT 1: Sources of Water for the City of LondonSource: Water Treatment and Distribution in London: The Teaching Toolkit slide 3 City of London Canada accessed October 19 2017 www.london.ca/residents/Water/Teacher-Resources/Pages/Water.aspx.

Though Elon’s comments are unpredictable we will continue to monitor Tesla’s operations to ensure no chaos there and will work in step with the company.Kazuhiro Tsuga president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Panasonic CorporationIn October 2018 Tesla Inc. (Tesla) an American automotive and energy company received an approval from the Shanghai government to acquire a plot of land to build a new electric-vehicle (EV) factory. The factory was planned to produce the first cars within three years with an initial annual capacity of 250000 vehicles. Discussions leading to the deal began in July 2018 in response to the rise of the Chinese EV market and the additional tariffs imposed on imported vehicles by the Chinese government during the 2018 trade war with the United States. In 2013 Tesla partnered with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) the consumer electronics company and world leader in battery technology to build “Gigafactory 1” in Nevada United States to manufacture batteries—the most critical component in electric vehicles—and this partnership resulted in significant mutual benefits. Panasonic hoped to launch full-fledged battery production in China in partnership with Tesla but first wanted Tesla to give priority to building additional capacity at Gigafactory 1. Because there was no obligation for either company to not collaborate with other companies Tesla and Panasonic could each be worried that the other would collaborate with a third company which would threaten their respective markets and large investments in Gigafactory 1. In fact Tesla announced that it was considering partnership with several battery cell suppliers for its first overseas factory in China and Panasonic was also considering collaboration with other battery suppliers and automakers to strengthen its competitive position in the country.Management at Tesla had many decisions to make and questions to answer for the near future: What should be Tesla’s growth strategy in China the world’s largest automotive market? Could Tesla establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in China on its own? Should Tesla continue its partnership with Panasonic in China or should it look for other Chinese or non-Chinese suppliers or partners? Could Tesla still be successful globally if it were not successful in China?TESLA AND ITS DEVELOPMENTHistoryTesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning with the vision to produce fully electric sports cars designed to offer performance aesthetics and sex appeal. Within a short history of 15 years the company had mastered many challenges and experienced soaring growth. Although the impressive growth had not resulted in significant profits by 2018 Tesla had managed to become one of the most valuable car companies in the world with a market capitalization of about US$59 billion and approximately 46000 employees. Elon Musk joined the company in 2004 as chairman and took a decisive role in the design and development of the Tesla Roadster a battery-powered sports car that was introduced to the public in July 2006. After many production delays and financial troubles the board of directors dismissed the two founders and Musk took over as CEO in October 2008. At that time Tesla was producing less than 200 Roadsters filling a niche in an industry that produced several million vehicles per year. Tesla was facing serious liquidity problems with cash reserves reaching a critical level during the financial crisis of 2008 but the company eventually managed to secure financing to keep its business going. Beginning of the TurnaroundIn 2010 several events turned out to be in favour of Tesla’s growth. First Daimler AG (Daimler) a German multinational automotive company bought a 10-per-cent stake in Tesla for $50 million while also providing the company with engineering supports and parts for the its planned new Model S. Meanwhile Tesla continued to provide battery packs and battery integration and management services for Daimler’s smart electric cars. Second the U.S. federal government granted Tesla a loan of $465 million to produce and market its Model S. Third Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) due to the financial crisis sold its production facilities—with a capacity of 500000 vehicles a year—to Tesla which then shifted its production sites from Lotus in England to Fremont in California. Fourth Tesla announced its initial public offering (IPO) while establishing an agreement with Toyota to jointly develop EVs. Toyota also purchased $50 million worth of Tesla stocks at the IPO even though Tesla had increasingly accumulated losses of $154.3 million compared to $55.7 million in 2009. Tesla’s success continued in 2012 with the delivery of the Model S; Tesla reported the first quarterly profit in 2013 of $11.2 million. Tesla then unveiled a prototype of the Model X a sport-utility vehicle (SUV) built on the platform of the Model S. The company also announced the Model 3—an affordable car to serve the mass market. It also planned to introduce superchargers which would allow a car to replenish 50 per cent of its batteries in 30 minutes along with the accompanying charging network to reduce the owner’s “range anxiety.” Tesla also ventured into the stationary energy field by introducing solar panels and home batteries (e.g. the “Powerwall”). In 2017 the company introduced the Tesla Semi an all-electric battery-powered truck. Batteries were the most critical component in all battery-powered vehicles. Since 2013 Tesla partnered with Panasonic the consumer electronics company and a world leader in battery technology to build Tesla’s Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and then Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York. In 2018 the company planned to enter the world’s largest automotive market in China with a local production site. After building Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo there was a chance that Tesla might partner with Panasonic again to build Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai. However Tesla was also considering other local and overseas potential partners.OVERVIEW OF the ELECTRIC-VEHICLE MARKET Significant Rise of the Global EV MarketThe EV market had grown globally at a compound annual growth rate of 32.57 per cent and was on track to grow from an estimated 1.50 million units in 2018 to an expected 10.79 million units in 2025. This trend was in response to a massive decline of urban air quality volatile global oil and fuel prices and the public’s attempts to de-carbonize transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries in Asia Pacific especially China were the largest markets for EVs. The alarming levels of pollution in these countries had prompted their governments to provide incentives to promote the sales of EVs. Globally governmental subsidies grants and tax rebates contributed to the EV market’s growth as did improved charging infrastructures increased EV battery range and reduced battery costs. In 2017 the total number of EVs in circulation worldwide exceeded 3 million an increase of 50 per cent from 2016 with the United States Europe and China consuming approximately 0.76 0.82 and 1.23 million vehicles respectively. The number of new vehicles sold around the world—both battery-powered and plug-in hybrid types—was over 1 million. China had the largest number of sales at 579000 vehicles while the second largest market—American customers—bought 198350 vehicles (see Exhibit 1). The market share of EVs in the highly competitive Chinese market was around 2.2 per cent compared to 1.2 per cent of the U.S. market. Norway had the most impressive market share of 39 per cent with sales of 62260 vehicles. The sales figures in emerging economies like India and Brazil where road and electrical infrastructure still needed further improvement were only 2000 and 360 vehicles respectively.Importance of Lithium-Ion Batteries for the EV IndustryBatteries accounted for over one-third of the total vehicle price. Sourcing the right suppliers was therefore crucial for vehicle manufacturers and the market for lithium-ion batteries was expected to grow strongly to $50 billion in 2020. In 2018 the major lithium-ion battery makers were Panasonic Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) BYD Auto Co. Ltd. (BYD) LG Chem Ltd. (LG Chem) and Samsung Group (Samsung). These makers held over 60 per cent of the global market share (see Exhibit 5). Primarily located in Asia these manufacturers created an oligopolistic industry structure with a relatively high bargaining power toward vehicle manufacturers. To reduce its dependency on battery makers in 2014 Tesla in partnership with Panasonic began the construction in Nevada of Gigafactory 1—the world’s largest production plant for lithium-ion batteries. This factory expected to be completed in 2020 would eventually cost Tesla around $5 billion. Tesla estimated that this plant would reduce the battery price by roughly 30 per cent by using economies of scale and having the production plant on its doorstep. Through the $2.6-billion acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (SolarCity) in 2016 the companies built Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo to produce photovoltaic components. TESLA’S BUSINESS MODEL The Sustainable Solutions for the World’s Transport and Energy Tesla’s business model was different from that of traditional car manufacturers (see Exhibit 2). The company did not set goals of producing high-end EVs for the affluent to make money and move up in the business rankings. Instead its value proposition was to offer sustainable solutions for the world’s transport and energy needs. The initial target customers were in the premium segment and the company planned to make its cars more affordable in the future. In 2014 Tesla’s typical customers lived in California and earned more than $100000 a year. However its Model S and Model 3 introduced respectively in 2012 and 2017 were designed to be affordable cars for the mass market. To keep this value proposition Tesla had established strategic partnerships in various sectors. Growth through Strategic Partnerships In 2010 Tesla acquired Daimler as a shareholder and strategic partner with whom it exchanged knowledge in research and development (R&D) production processes supply-chain management and battery technologies. Tesla also partnered with Toyota on the development and production of Toyota’s EVs and Toyota aimed to learn from Tesla’s decision-making and management style. Tesla established partnerships with mobile communications operators such as AT&T Inc. for installing wireless connections in its cars to enable machine-to-machine communications for safety diagnostics as well as for remote monitoring and repair. Tesla collaborated with Nvidia Corporation early during the development of its Model S in 2012—all Tesla’s vehicles including the Model S Model X and Model 3 were equipped with Nvidia’s supercomputer which could provide full self-driving capability.In the energy sector Tesla established strong partnerships with Panasonic and SolarCity. Panasonic became Tesla’s shareholder in 2010 when it invested $30 million in the company. Tesla partnered with SolarCity an active enterprise in the solar energy field to exploit its battery know-how to develop a complete off-the-grid kit for storing solar power. This backward integration would enable Tesla to become more than just a car manufacturer. The close collaboration with SolarCity and the eventual acquisition of the company in 2016 allowed Tesla to diversify into solar energy services. In 2015 Tesla announced the release of the Powerwall—an energy storage unit targeting niche households that already had a solar panel—to store surplus energy that could be used when a home’s solar panel was not producing enough energy. Financial services and sales or leasing of the Powerwalls were also added to Tesla’s revenue model. Key Resources Activities and Revenue SourcesSome of Tesla’s strategic resources were its patents which included expertise in software and battery technology. The charging infrastructure for its vehicles plus their energy management and storage were also counted among Tesla’s strategic assets. Located in Palo Alto California a part of the Silicon Valley Tesla could attract highly qualified employees which were its key human resource. Musk was also regarded as a key resource. By using Twitter for marketing activities Musk had made Tesla’s overall business highly dependent on him. The biggest change in Tesla’s key resources was the transfer of all of its patents to become open-source platforms in 2014. Tesla believed that technology leadership was not defined by patents; rather that they were small protection against a determined competitor. Tesla applied the open-source philosophy to its patents arguing that it would strengthen rather than diminish its competitive position. It might be argued that Tesla intended its patents to become industry standards for networks of charging infrastructures—to be used by its customers and competitors. The wide adoption of such standards could help Tesla sell more of its cars and other innovative products and could become the foundation that would support its future business models.Tesla’s three key activities and main revenue sources were R&D sales and service activities of its cars and energy storage products and its charging infrastructure. GROWTH STRATEGY IN CHINAAttempts to Enter the World’s Largest EV MarketTesla began to enter the Chinese market in 2014 and 2015 but failed to gain traction. In 2016 however its sales in China exceeded $1 billion—three times more than 2015 sales. In 2017 the company failed to maintain this growth rate but still doubled its sales to surpass $2 billion. China was the largest automotive market in the world and the fastest growing EV market as of 2016 (see Exhibit 3). The market potential was attributed to the rise of a middle class—people who were willing and able to spend on innovative and sustainable cars. Importantly the Chinese government offered a substantial subsidy for electric cars that was worth up to $15000 per vehicle in 2016 (see Exhibit 4). To fully penetrate the Chinese market Tesla decided to establish a manufacturing plant in Shanghai to sell cars directly without having to ship them from the United States. Tesla could significantly leverage China’s lower labour costs and proximity to rare minerals—especially lithium—that were required to build the batteries. While markets for EV batteries were predominantly located in Europe the United States and Japan an increasing shift toward China was predicted for the near future. These location advantages would lower Tesla’s production costs allowing the company to sell its cars at a more competitive price in the Chinese market. The China location would also lower the risks and expenses of shipping components by air especially flammable and heavy batteries from the United States.A more recent aspect which influenced Tesla to make the relocation decision was the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. The Chinese market contributed 17 per cent to Tesla’s revenue in 2017. In response to the trade war which had raised the tariff on imported American cars Tesla had to raise the prices of its cars in the Chinese market by an average of $20000 to maintain its profit margin. An additional tariff of 25 per cent on imported American products imposed by the Chinese government could be bypassed if Tesla produced the cars in China.Construction of the Shanghai Gigafactory 3In July 2018 Tesla announced a deal with Chinese authorities to build the battery manufacturing plant—Gigafactory 3—in Shanghai to accelerate production and to avoid increasingly expensive import tariffs. The government approved the acquisition of an 864885-square metre plot in Shanghai’s Lingang area where several auto manufacturers with foreign ties had facilities. In March 2019 the Chinese authority also approved that part of the production line would begin operation by the end of the year. Tesla was advancing its plan to produce around 500000 vehicles per year for Chinese customers by 2022–23 which would double the size of global electric car manufacturing. In March 2019 Musk confirmed that Tesla would also produce battery cells in the Chinese factory which had not been included in his initial plans for China thereby returning to the goal of producing everything at the same place in a “one-stop shop.” Tesla manufactured its lithium-ion batteries in Nevada and its vehicles in Fremont California. According to Musk “Things are moving fast. This will actually be once complete the equivalent of our Fremont factory plus our Nevada battery Gigafactory combined. It’s integrating the two which kind of make sense.” The new factory was expected to cost around $5 billion. Meanwhile Tesla secured as much as $521 million in loans from Chinese banks bringing the carmaker a step closer to producing the Model 3 sedans at its first overseas plant. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH PANASONICSynergistic BenefitsPanasonic was engaged in the development of electronics technologies and solutions for the consumer electronics housing automotive enterprise solutions and device industries. The automotive batteries were made in a three-pillar global production system in Japan the United States and China. In 2010 the company began mass production of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid EV automobiles. It had developed strong partnerships with Tesla and Toyota and focused sales in the high-growth Chinese market. In March 2018 the company commenced mass production of automotive lithium-ion batteries at its first plant in Dalian China. In 2018 with about 274000 employees Panasonic achieved revenues of $75 billion in which Japan China Asia Europe and the Americas contributed 47 12 14 10 and 17 per cent respectively.In 2014 Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a $5 billion lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant known as the Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. This factory would produce cells modules and packs for Tesla’s vehicles and for the stationary storage market to reduce cell costs and to produce more lithium-ion batteries annually. This partnership continued in building the next Gigafactory 2 in New York to manufacture solar cells following the $2.6-billion acquisition of SolarCity in 2016. Both Gigafactories were Tesla’s backward integration to secure the critical supply of batteries and alternative energies.Tesla could also benefit from its supply contract with Panasonic which reduced uncertainties in the supply of batteries. The partnership also provided the opportunity to drive down the unit price of batteries by 30 per cent by 2020. Panasonic would not have committed to such high investments if it did not expect sales and profitability to be driven by battery sales through scale economies. As expected Panasonic’s operating profits had significantly increased by 11.7 per cent to $3.87 billion in fiscal year 2018. Other potential synergies included additional visibility and market reach for Panasonic in the United States and for Tesla in Asia through their strong brands in their respective markets. Panasonic hoped to launch full-fledged production in China together with Tesla; however that agreement was not yet confirmed. The continued collaboration would make sense because Tesla and Panasonic worked together before and their technologies were already customized to be compatible. This prior experience would reduce the lead time and costs of the cars when production was finally ramped up in China. Panasonic also had a strong interest in having a production facility in China to leverage the country’s lower labour cost and weaker currency. Japanese companies were in fact struggling with their sales figures due to the strong performance of the yen. Uncertainty of Partnership in ChinaIn November 2018 Musk announced that Tesla was considering several battery cell suppliers for the factory in China. In January 2019 Tesla signed a preliminary agreement with state-owned Lishen Battery just days after Tesla began building a factory in Shanghai with an aggressive production goal. It was unclear however what the firms had agreed to. In March 2019 Tesla was reportedly discussing a partnering potential with CATL for its battery supply. The partnership between Tesla and Panasonic seemed to be diverging in the Chinese Gigafactory 3 project. In December 2018 Panasonic joined with LG Chem to add more production capacity for EV batteries in China. This collaboration was in response to the Chinese government loosening of its restrictions to attract foreign investments and to promote new-energy vehicles as the country’s environmental problems worsened. In January 2019 in order to compete more effectively on cost and scale with rising Chinese players Panasonic planned to establish a joint venture to produce batteries with Toyota in 2020 and also planned to move some plants in Japan and China to this new facility. However the U.S. plant with which Panasonic had partnered with Tesla would not be involved in the Toyota deal. The new venture aimed to supply batteries to Mazda Motor Corporation—Toyota’s partner on electric car technology—Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. and Subaru Corporation. The venture would also encourage Honda Motor Company Ltd. which used Panasonic batteries in its hybrid vehicles to adopt the new cells.OTHER POTENTIAL PARTNERSIt would be convenient for Tesla to continue collaborating with Panasonic to build Gigafactory 3. However another player among the top four makers—Panasonic CATL BYD and LG Chem—might provide more partnering advantages in some other aspects (see Exhibit 5). The Chinese CATL and BYD and the South Korean LG Chem companies were the top battery suppliers with sales revenues totalling $4.4 billion $17.7 billion and $25.6 billion respectively in 2018 and the number of employees amounting to 14000 220000 and 18000 respectively. CATL and BYD had respectively 98 per cent and 87 per cent of total sales in their home Chinese market while LG Chem had 32 33 and 20 per cent respectively in its home South Korean market China and other Asian markets.Chemistry of the BatteriesTesla claimed the highest energy density and low cobalt for its lithium-ion batteries which were co-produced with Panasonic. BYD and CATL could offer a lithium-iron phosphate battery that did not contain cobalt. Lithium-iron phosphate batteries had lower energy density but were safer especially in terms of flammability while offering a cycle life similar to those batteries with cobalt. Cobalt was a very rare earth primarily found in the unstable Democratic Republic of Congo which in turn created supply uncertainties. Lithium-iron phosphate batteries could therefore be a viable option for Tesla especially to prevent new scandals about spontaneously burning cars. CATL and LG Chem were also working to lower cobalt content in their batteries (see Exhibit 5).Lithium as the main component of batteries was a critical cost driver. Although lithium was mostly used in lithium-ion batteries it was also widely used in the production of glass grease air treatments polymers pharmacy drugs metals and other products. The price of lithium had continued to rise over the years which increased production costs of batteries (see Exhibits 6 and 7) and access to a local reserve of lithium was therefore very valuable. BYD seemed to be a potential partner for Tesla in China because of its location advantage—available access to 80 per cent of the local lithium reserves in China’s Xining city.Regulations and Incentives from the Chinese GovernmentTo stimulate the transfer of new more advanced technologies from abroad the Chinese government required that for foreign companies entering the automotive industry partner with a local company the foreign equity be capped at 50 per cent. Although either CATL or BYD could be a good candidate Tesla could be subject to the risks of losing its strategic intellectual-based assets to these local companies due to the joint venturing and partial control. Given the continuing desire of the Chinese government to stimulate the use of renewable energy through various regulations and incentives and given Tesla’s strong technological capability in the field Tesla would need to negotiate with the government to establish a wholly-owned production facility in the country.Since 2012 the Chinese government had invested over $10 billion into the EV battery industry which resulted in a significant rise in the number of EV manufacturers. This support would end in 2020 however as the government sought to encourage companies to become more competitive. BYD and CATL would have to be careful about the prospect of competing without subsidies with foreign rivals like Panasonic and LG Chem. In response to the soaring demand for new-energy vehicles to gain a larger market share and to expand its production capacity BYD planned to spin off its automotive battery division by 2022. Meanwhile CATL joined forces with many powerful domestic and global automakers that were aiming to reduce the pressure of supplying batteries and expedite the production of new-energy vehicles. LOOKING FORWARDTesla had managed to expand its business successfully through various strategic partnerships with Daimler Toyota Nvidia and Panasonic as those companies brought in essential technologies and financing. Panasonic had helped Tesla reduce the bargaining power of its battery suppliers thereby mitigating the inherent risk of supply bottlenecks and excessive production costs. Through this partnership the unit costs for lithium-ion batteries were expected to be reduced at the Gigafactory 1 in Nevada thereby giving Tesla the opportunity to significantly increase profit margins. Meanwhile Panasonic could capitalize on the massive contract volume with Tesla thereby increasing its operating profits in the battery cell business. Although this partnership had been very fruitful for both Tesla and Panasonic Tesla was considering whether to go it alone or to partner with other companies for its expansion in China. The company could also consider continuing its partnership with Panasonic and one or more other companies. Two potential partners seemed to be the Chinese CATL and BYD which held the second- and third-largest share in the global lithium battery market (see Exhibit 5). Tesla needed to answer several important questions before making a final decision.What was the overall competitive situation of Tesla and its partnership with Panasonic? How should Tesla and Panasonic strategically manage their partnership to optimize the mutual benefits? How should Tesla overcome challenges in investing in China the world’s largest automotive market? Which battery suppliers other than Panasonic could be potential partners for Tesla in its direct investments in China? Tesla as a young start-up company strove to maintain its leadership as one of the top-selling manufacturers in the established automotive industry as the large incumbents were beginning to make significant investments in the manufacture of EVs and other related sustainable businesses. Overall could Tesla still be successful globally if it were not successful in China?

(Koho). Investors saw that his start-up had the potential to continue its growth trajectory and had provided a series B capital injection of $25 million bringing the total amount raised to US$57.5 million. Over the previous four years Eberhard had demonstrated that there was a need for a financial innovation like Koho and had shown that the company was ready to scale. Koho�s services had improved significantly since its inception but Eberhard needed to determine a strategy to grow the financial technology (fintech) company as quickly and successfully as possible.KOHO Financial Inc. (KOHO)Koho was launched in 2015 in Toronto by Vancouver-born Eberhard who had previously worked as a consultant and entrepreneur. Canada had some of the highest per-capita banking fees in the world. Eberhard sought to disrupt the banking industry in Canada where the banking experience was the same for both younger and older demographics by founding Koho as a new way for millennials to manage their money with no fees. Koho partnered with the Peoples Trust Company Galileo Financial Technologies LLC (Galileo Processing) and Visa Inc. (Visa) to create a fintech solution that provided a range of financial services including a mobile application (app) and Visa card. All three partners were vital in ensuring Koho�s success: the Peoples Trust Company held consumers� money and issued cards Galileo Processing processed transactions and Visa allowed users to make purchases. Koho�s initial product offering included a prepaid Visa card and a mobile app that had all the same functionalities as a traditional bank account including direct deposit automatic bill payment and e-transfers. The company focused on creating a frictionless customer experience by mapping it from scratch and challenging the typical role of a bank. One of Koho�s unique features was its practice of providing each user with two balances: the total amount in the user�s account and the amount that the user could spend. Koho�s spendable balance provided users with a more realistic cash position than a typical chequing or savings account balance. Coupled with a modern user interface this feature helped Koho�s users save more spend less and better understand their financial positions. By 2019 Koho had grown its services by offering real-time balance updates; giving users 0.5 per cent cash back on all purchases; rounding up purchases to add to users� savings; securing partnerships to reduce foreign-exchange fees; and establishing in partnership with Flinks its first openbanking leveraged service What the Fee to uncover how much users were paying their banks in fees. To diversify its revenue stream the fintech start-up also began offering a premium account that offered 2 per cent cash back no foreign exchange fees free financial coaching and more for a fee of $9 per month or $84 per year (see Exhibit 1). In November 2019 Koho had over 200000 users had raised a total of $57.5 million and hoped to grow its user base and deliver complementary products.Koho combined two unique fintech business models: a digital wallet and digital banking. Under the digital wallet model Koho�s main source of revenue came from merchant discount rate (MDR) fees from vendors (see Exhibit 2). When a customer made a purchase with their Koho card the vendor received the payment minus the MDR and this fee was then shared between Koho and Visa. Fintech businesses leveraging the open-loop payments model effectively removed costs to achieve profitability. Similarly the operation of the digital banking business model was almost identical to that of traditional banking businesses with two main differences: (1) a tremendous savings on human capital and real estate costs and (2) the forgoing of high-risk services such as loans which allowed fintech start-ups like Koho to offer low-cost products. This unique business model created an accessible and affordable option for customers who no longer had to pay traditional banking and credit card fees. Koho also used machine learning technology to better understand customers� spending habits and curate product recommendations. As a result Koho also earned commission from referrals to other products such as Wealthsimple and Willful. MARKETINGKoho�s main marketing messaging was about restoring financial balance. Koho strategically positioned itself as an anti-establishment option that offered low prices. Aligned with its message of transparency Koho created custom content to educate its users on how to better manage and save money using its platform. Both growth and customer acquisition were vital to ensuring its successful long-term viability as a fintech start-up.  As a mobile app Koho gathered data and real-time insights on users� spending habits. For example Koho discovered that Canadian users put one-third to one-half of their paycheques into their Koho accounts every two weeks. These users also logged in and opened the Koho application an average of eight times per month�far more than regular online banking platforms which they used an average of once per month. Armed with this data Koho could hyper-target specific customers with recommendations for other products and earn commissions from merchants. This user-level data also allowed fintech start-ups to create personas and to develop a better understanding of different types of users. Social media platforms such as Facebook offered services that enabled them to create lookalike audiences�audiences that shared similar traits and interests�when creating digital advertisements.STAKEHOLDERS Koho�s recent funding round included fintech venture capital firm Portag3 Ventures and U.K.-based Greyhound Capital among others. Investors in Koho�s current series B funding round expected the company to grow further by increasing customer acquisition entering new markets or developing new products and services. In exchange for mentorship and funding venture capital firms typically expected successful portfolio companies to generate returns up to 10 times the size of their investments with a typical time horizon of eight to 10 years. Exit strategies of venture capital firms included initial public offerings acquisitions and management buyouts. Like other fintech companies Koho mainly targeted millennials who prioritized convenience value and trust when choosing the products and services they would adopt. Unlike older consumers who preferred traditional channels such as brick-and-mortar stores millennials sought digital user experiences that were seamless and fast. Millennial users also sought products and services that provided the best value. According to a study 93 per cent of millennials saw a fee-free service as essential when choosing a financial institution and 83 per cent would switch to banks that offered better terms or rewards. Finally millennials tended to have little trust in financial services due to the impact of the financial crisis in 2008. Fintech companies had to recognize that trust and security were of utmost importance to retaining users.One of Koho�s main value propositions was the PowerUps cash back program where users received rewards when shopping at select merchants. Merchants participating in the program included Foodora Greenhouse Juice Co. and Chefs Plate which offered customers 1.5�5.0 per cent cash back when they used their Koho cards. This feature enabled merchants to use Koho as a marketing platform to attract new customers to shop at their stores and benefited both merchants through increased sales and loyalty and customers through cash back rewards.OPEN BANKING Open banking also known as consumer-directed banking was a framework that enabled third-party providers (TPPs) such as fintech companies to securely access consumer financial data. Through application programming interfaces (APIs) fintech companies were able to leverage financial data traditionally available only to banks to improve their product offerings by providing personalized solutions (see Exhibit 3). Typically customers were required to provide consent to allow third-party access to their financial data. Open banking was commonly used to analyze customers� transactional data aggregate data from multiple banks and create new transactions.Open banking allowed fintech companies to understand consumers better by analyzing their financial data. Benefits of open banking included innovation lower barriers to entry for new fintech start-ups efficiency through faster data sharing standardization and the creation of opportunities for marginalized communities. Consumers benefited from open banking as businesses were able to leverage user-level data to fuel insights and provide more personalized experiences. Businesses and financial services benefited from open banking as data sharing allowed for a more holistic accurate portrayal of a consumer�s financial position.Open banking which required consumers to share their personal data with multiple stakeholders came with major security and privacy risks. Open banking invited many stakeholders�such as payment processors banks customers regulators and start-ups�to share information. This resulted in information asymmetry and made it possible for parties to take advantage of consumers through methods such as predatory lending. Moreover open-banking operations were entirely online and the digital environment created a higher risk that hackers would attempt to access financial data. Consequently the higher potential for financial crime made it more difficult to identify suspicious behaviour.In Canada the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) applied to private-sector uses of personal information in the course of commercial business. Under PIPEDA companies had to be transparent and clearly identify for consumers the information they were collecting the purpose of collecting the data the stakeholders that had access to the data and any potential risks that might arise. However PIPEDA was not specific to open banking or technological uses. As a result the industry was constantly undergoing regulatory changes to ensure that consumers were protected.REGULATIONIn January 2020 the Canadian Department of Finance�s Advisory Committee on Open Banking released Consumer-Directed Finance: The Future of Financial Services a report that presented findings and recommendations regarding open banking. The report aggregated over 100 written submissions in response to the consultation paper the committee released in January 2019 A Review into the Merits of Open Banking. The submissions were written by various stakeholders including consulting firms financial services firms and regulators (see Exhibit 4).Key findings stated in the report were that the Department of Finance along with industry stakeholders should develop a white paper regarding an open banking framework and that open banking would help support Canadians� financial health. The most common method of sharing financial data was screen scraping which involves copying information shown on a digital display for future use; however screen scraping involved sharing password information to access user data and so created security and liability risks for all stakeholders. Additionally the report emphasized the importance of integrating consumer privacy and protection when designing user experiences and user interfaces. That report also said that financial institutions and start-ups needed to incorporate tools and processes to better educate consumers about the usage of their financial data. Governments and fintech start-ups needed to look to other markets that were leading in open banking for example Europe and specifically the United Kingdom. In Europe two frameworks had been created specifically to regulate fintech innovations: the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The United Kingdom�s Competition and Markets Authority had recognized the importance of open banking as a tool that would allow smaller fintech players to compete with traditional banks. As a result the Open Banking Implementation Entity was created to work directly with the government banks and fintech start-ups to build a framework and educate consumers on open-banking opportunities and risks.COMPETITIONKoho faced competition from several other financial services providers.Stack Fintech Inc. Stack Fintech Inc. (STACK) was a fee-free mobile banking alternative that provided rewards tools for money management and a reloadable Mastercard. Similar to Koho STACK operated in partnership with Mastercard Incorporated and Peoples Trust Company. The start-up leveraged machine learning to provide customizable tools to users and offered instant access to multicurrency and cryptocurrency services. Its main competitive advantages included fee-free foreign-exchange cash back at over 140 retailers and free money transfers. Despite its recent presence in the media STACK had not raised any public funding rounds suggesting a potential lack of capital and growth prospects.Drop Technologies Inc.Drop Technologies Inc. (Drop) was a Canada-based fintech start-up that leveraged open-banking APIs and targeted financially conscious millennials. Drop was a mobile loyalty and shopping platform that implemented a system which automatically rewarded users for their purchasing behaviour via reading their transactional data. Drop had raised a total of $75 million in funding by the spring of 2020 and had over 3 million users mostly in the United States. Drop�s business model was unique: its revenues were derived mainly from payments marketing or advertising from merchants. Using user-level data allowed Drop to uniquely target specific groups of users using machine-learning algorithms. American Express CompanyThe American Express Company (Amex) was a card issuer and payment processor. Amex operated a closed-loop payments business model: the company issued cards to and also processed payments for its users. The closed-loop model allowed Amex access to cardholder spending and transactional data which it could leverage to attract merchants and incentivize higher spending. The majority of its revenues were derived from the fees charged to merchants who decided to accept Amex cards. Amex members had access to many perks such as access to airport lounges and high cash-back values. However there were issues with Amex cards including a high exposure to credit risk and difficulties with merchant adoption.ALTERNATIVES To better understand Koho�s potential options and analyze which strategy would provide the most returns for Koho�s investors it would be beneficial to know the return on investment of the various alternatives.Eberhard could choose to continue Koho�s strategy by focusing on the fintech�s current business model without further external investments. Compared to regular brick-and-mortar banks Koho already provided significant cost savings to both shareholders and users. Most of Koho�s revenues were currently derived from MDR fees from the transactions made by Koho. The small portion of revenues derived from commissions was negligible. Eberhard would have to calculate the estimated revenues from the average MDR. Koho had made more than $500 million in annualized transactions over the past year and its major costs included marketing costs and salaries for approximately 96 full-time employees who all received market average fintech start-up salaries. Technological investments made were related to the maintenance of digital infrastructure required to store data and develop the application.Another alternative that should be considered was expanding Koho�s open-banking capabilities. This option would require making major investments in the infrastructure required to build an API or working directly with a current open-banking API start-up such as Flinks or Plaid. Koho could also follow the lead of its competitor STACK by offering cryptocurrency services. However Koho had not yet entered the cryptocurrency industry and had no knowledge or experience operating in this space. Costs for this alternative would include hiring a specialist and engineer to develop this feature. It would require major investments in cryptocurrency infrastructure or software.Other fintech business models that Koho could consider were asset management digital insurance small-ticket loans and peer-to-peer lending (see Exhibit 5).NEXT STEPSEberhard had decisions to make: How could he effectively deploy Koho�s latest $25 million investment to satisfy all stakeholders? Should Koho continue its current strategy and compete directly with traditional banks or should it invest in new technologies and compete with other fintech start-ups? How could Koho�s marketing strategy be improved to acquire more customers? How would the changing fintech regulatory environment affect Koho�s strategy and what could Eberhard learn from similar companies in other locations?EXHIBIT 1: KOHO PRODUCT FEATURESSource: Created by case authors based on �Simple.

The number on the screen was familiar. �Kevan I�m sorry to be calling at this time� the caller said. �We�ve been experiencing severe security issues in the last few hours. You�d better come here as soon as you can. We have pop-up screens with ransom notes for bitcoins and it looks like we�ve been hit with a cyber breach!�Austen was the associate director infrastructure operation and sustainment at the University of Calgary (U of C) and his portfolio included the operations centre which as the nerve centre of the university�s information technology (IT) infrastructure monitored all information systems on campus around the clock. Austen thought he had seen it all during his tenure on campusuntil the security breach that May. His experience and intuition told him that this was a money grab. He was not looking forward to the next few hours which he expected would involve heated discussions about whether to pay the ransom along with also trying to restore network services.Austen jumped into his truck and barrelled down the highway toward the city. Living on an acreage west of Calgary he had done this drive daily for years. As he drove he called the server technicians asking them to come to campus immediately.The University of CalgaryA young public research institution in Calgary Alberta the U of C had over 30000 undergraduate and graduate students and employed over 5000 academic and non-academic staff. It had originally been part of the University of Alberta but became a separate autonomous public university in 1966. The U of C had grown rapidly between 1966 and 2016 and now had five campuses including one in Doha Qatar. Its 14 faculties offered more than 250 academic programs. In 2011 the U of C embarked on an ambitious plan to be a top-five research institution in Canada. This plan known as the Eyes High strategy required the U of C to expand its research capacity and capabilities. It involved recruiting additional top-tier researchers and launching an extensive philanthropic campaign which increased the university�s media presence highlighting the many achievements scholars were accomplishing in Calgary. By 2016 the Center for World University Rankings had ranked the U of C eighth in Canada. There were six types of post-secondary institutions in Canada: comprehensive academic and research universities comprehensive community colleges independent academic institutions polytechnic institutions specialized arts and cultural institutions and undergraduate universities. The U of C was one of four comprehensive academic and research universities in Alberta and one of 15 large research universities with medical schools in Canada known as the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities. As such it received substantial public funds from the provincial government to support its priorities.The university�s main governing body was the board of governors. In Alberta university boards of governors operated in accordance with the Post-Secondary Learning Act and the Alberta Public Agencies Governance Act. The main responsibility of the board was to oversee the management and operation of the university�s business and affairs as legislated by the provincial government. The board�s duties were discharged through the president and senior officers of the university.Spring 2016 was an unusually busy time for the U of C. The campus was celebrating its golden anniversary. From May 28 to June 3 it also hosted the 2016 Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences with the theme of Energizing Communities. During the conference 12000 visiting scholars from around the world descended on campus participating in research symposia and colloquia. The U of C had also opened its residences to 1200 displaced victims of the Fort McMurray wildfire�an enormous blaze that had forced the largest community evacuation in Alberta�s history. Spring session classes were cancelled to accommodate the visitors yet the campus was bustling with people from around the globe.Emergency response team Response to infrastructure failuresAusten had started his career on campus in 1989 running the microcomputer store. His technical expertise had allowed him to continue to grow his career and he had taken various roles on IT services and infrastructure teams on campus. Austen who was passionate about emergency IT operations headed the emergency response team (ERT) which was responsible for ensuring the integrity of university data assets and quickly restoring service to the campus community in the event of an emergency. He understood the importance of IT services to research and teaching activities and took great pride in the ERT�s responsibilities to protect these vital functions (see Exhibit 1).In the early morning of May 28 questions raced through Austen�s mind: Where was the problem? Was it a cascading network failure or was the problem at the server level? And what was it: a propagating virus a corrupted disk? He knew that many of the network�s servers were not local disks. Theoretically the storage servers could have just gone offline; it had happened before. Initially the teams thought the network infrastructure might be failing and causing the alarm but as the night unfolded it became evident that this was not a standard network failure.By the time Austen arrived on campus IT operations had discovered a pop-up ransom note on a server (see Exhibit 2). The U of C�s system had been breached by ransomware. Austen called in the rest of the IT leadership and activated the ERT. Catherine Heggerud the director of customer engagement and experience was called around 4:30 a.m. As the duty director for the ERT Heggerud�s role was to take responsibility for the IT staff during any emergency and to safeguard the incident commander Austen freeing him from routine tasks in order to allow him to focus on the primary task: isolating the root cause of any problem. The duty director�s responsibilities also included ensuring good morale among the extended team.At 5:00 a.m. calls were also made to Linda Dalgetty vice-president finance and services; Janet Stein director of risk management and insurance; and Rae Ann Aldridge associate vice-president of risk. By 8:00 a.m. Austen and Heggerud had the ERT and supporting IT team assembled. As ERT members and support staff arrived on campus Austen went over the night�s events in his head. There were many moving parts and explaining what had transpired would take patience.IT operations had noticed unusual alarms on Friday evening May 27 2016. Austen was called in on Saturday at 1:00 a.m. At 2:00 a.m. IT operations called campus security after discovering a ransom note on a server: �All your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 encryption. RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. You will need a private key to recover your files. It is not possible to recover your files without a private key.�The ransom note demanded a payment of 27 bitcoin for the recovery key and stipulated a payment deadline in seven days after which the private key would be permanently deleted.Coincidentally Stein had signed a cyber-liability insurance policy just a few days before the breach happened. The policy included access to an independent breach coach. The coach was notified of the situation and was providing ongoing advice to the campus team. As they heard what had transpired in the middle of the night everyone knew they were mired in an emerging crisis.As incident commander Austen was at a fork in the road. The ransom request made it clear that the team had to stop the malware from propagating. Austen did not have time to think about the ransom. His priority was containment only not remediation; his focus was to preserve data and contain the malware stopping it from propagating from server to server. One option for doing this was to disconnect the network but that would affect the university�s entire operation. Austen felt uncomfortable shutting down key services like active directory servers which powered the campus email system.Since the propagation method was unknown Austen risked his professional reputation and recommended disconnecting the network to prevent further spreading of the virus. As Austen gave the ERT the green light the scenario looked like a scene from a movie: IT people physically pulled cables off the backs of machines in the data centre bringing university operations to a grinding halt. Was he making the right decision? Had he missed anything?crisis management team evaluation and handling of the breachDalgetty was the leader of the IT crisis team. She had joined the university in July 2014 transitioning from industry where she had served in a variety of senior leadership positions including as chief information officer and chief financial officer. Dalgetty preferred to be well informed; she did not like surprises. She highly valued open honest transparent communication.Dalgetty had a team of resourceful people who were supported by the breach coach and D�Arcy Moynaugh a consultant from a major consulting firm. The breach coach and the cybersecurity team from the consulting firm brought valuable skills and knowledge including knowledge about accessing the dark web�a part of the Internet whose access required specific software and that allowed its users to conduct business through anonymous peer-to-peer networks. The malware however was highly sophisticated. Servers were down files were encrypted and email had come to a grinding halt. More than 9000 email addresses had been lost which made communication on campus a true challenge. The immediate solution was to use posters on all entrance doors asking faculty and staff not to turn on their computers due to a network failure (see Exhibit 3).As the day wore on more decision makers were brought into the loop. By noon the executive leadership crisis management team (CMT) held its first meeting. At the request of U of C�s president Dr. Elizabeth Cannon Dalgetty called Bonnie DuPont chair of the board of governors to provide her with a briefing on the emerging crisis. Ensuring the appropriate management of institutional risk was a board duty. Dalgetty informed DuPont that years of university research had been hijacked�the U of C was being held hostage.Dalgetty�s previous crisis experience in industry had leveraged a command-and-control structure to rapidly address crises. However running a large university was complex and the governing structure of the university did not allow for the top-down directives prevalent in private industry. Dalgetty was now the bridge between the IT crisis team and the CMT. The IT crisis team made its recommendations to the CMT and the CMT took its decisions to the board of governors. While IT recommended shutting down the entire campus network Dalgetty knew these decisions could not be made strictly at the technical level because the university�s reputed ability to protect its researchers� intellectual property was at stake. The golden anniversary celebrations and all the visitors on campus meant the world was watching. When the posters went on the doors a wave of enquiries was prompted about how the university was managing the issue. Staff had no access to services like the active directory and scholars had more than just research data on their computers: personal files such as photos videos financial statements and other elements of their personal lives were out of reach. Compounding this issue was the lack of proper communication channels. With the rumour mill turning faster than ever the story leaked to the public. Every crisis meeting included communications professionals who were focused on crafting the message and controlling the story.Luckily the U of C website landing page was still operational and the university had a Twitter account allowing for some information sharing.As the days went by specific communication channels were set up through the UC Emergency Mobile app to allow the emergency operations groups to communicate directly with the leadership team. One of the CMT�s early decisions was to not go public with the breach. The word ransom was not mentioned outside of the CMT. But how could the CMT ensure information was still being shared with the community�and still control the story�without proper communication channels? This role became the domain of the senior leadership team (SLT).The SLT was composed of about 56 campus leaders including associate vice-presidents vice-provosts deans of faculties and associate deans. The SLT met on Tuesday May 31 where its members were asked to be key communicators within their faculties. This meant explaining what was happening within IT and preparing people to migrate their email boxes to Office 365 a cloud-based email solution. Paper-based instructions were required since digital communication was unavailable. However the CMT had decided not to disclose the root cause of the issue with the SLT. Instead Dalgetty�s team talked in general terms about malware issues and network failure�and this was the consistent message internally and externally.The discussion regarding a ransom payment did not officially start before Tuesday May 31. The ransom note had a seven-day deadline and the first 72 hours had been spent getting all the right people in the geographically dispersed organization onto the same page. This had meant ensuring that IT people were on rotational duty 24/7. It had also meant engaging with the cyber-liability insurer and setting contracts in place for specialized services such as the team from the consulting firm the breach coach and a public relations agency. This had been challenging because the university had no robust business continuity plan to deal with a cybersecurity breach of this size. Funding for IT security in 2016 was approximately 4 per cent of the IT capital budget (see Exhibit 4). Regardless the university continued to engage with its technical teams and other consultants. Teams worked around the clock allowing Dalgetty and her team to engage in dialogue about the ransom.On Wednesday June 1 the board�s executive committee met. Logistically it was not easy to bring 21 leaders from various committees together with the chair and vice-chair of the board. The meeting provided a formal sounding board and �stress test� for the decisions being made and weighed these against the university�s enterprise risk management framework. The enterprise risk management framework evaluated the institutional risks of operational impact financial impact and reputational impact. If the university paid the ransom the financial impact would not be significant as 27 bitcoin would cost approximately CA$21000.Malware Ransomware and CybercrimeWhile the U of C was near ground zero for this virus it was not the only one under attack. Collaboration with other organizations gave the university insight into the ransomware. The strain used to attack the U of C in May 2016 was known as SamSam which was known to attack organizations in the health care government and education sectors. However it was estimated that public organizations were more likely to disclose these incidents than private organizations and that more than half of SamSam�s victims were from the private sector (see Exhibit 5). SamSam targeted more than users� documents. It also encrypted the configuration and data files required to run applications like Microsoft Office and to email clients. This meant huge complications in terms of system recovery. It was believed that SamSam and similar kinds of malware were designed and launched for financial gain. Therefore they primarily targeted critical infrastructure systems since victims would be willing to pay to recover these.Notoriously sophisticated SamSam used operating system features to compromise its victims� networks. This malware exploited vulnerabilities in the systems to penetrate networks using a remote desktop protocol that allowed its hackers to gain access to domain user accounts. Once a domain administrator logged into a system the hackers stole the administrator�s credentials. With these stolen credentials the hackers took control of a server and used it as a command centre to map out the network. At this point the hackers used scanning tools to choose their target computers and access the file systems. The attack was usually launched late at night when the targeted organization was least prepared to deal with it. A deployment tool was released to copy files across the network and encrypt as much information as possible before presenting the organization with the ransom demand.Ransom payments were transacted in bitcoin a digital cryptographic currency without a central bank. In the second quarter of 2016 the market capitalization of bitcoin was almost US$10 billion. The anonymity that came with cryptocurrency made bitcoin a popular choice among criminals who used it to fund and facilitate their illegal activities. Approximately 49 per cent of the total value of bitcoin transactions was associated with illegal activities such as the trade in illegal drugs pornography terrorism money laundering and avoidance of capital controls.The attackers provided instructions on how and where to buy bitcoin in their ransom notes. Victims could confirm payments and receive decryption instructions via a payment site hosted on the dark web where a timer indicated the �time played.� The hackers provided their victims with three payment options: In the first option victims could pay a small fee in bitcoin and receive the private key to decrypt one computer. The second option was more cost-effective; victims could pay the full ransom amount in one payment and receive the keys needed to decrypt all affected computers. The last option involved paying half the ransom and getting the keys to decrypt half of the affected computers (randomly selected by the hackers). Each option meant something different for the victim in terms of remediation. There was very little evidence to suggest that the SamSam attacker ever negotiated on the price. In fact the value of the ransom demands had increased over time. With the average monthly take around US$300000 SamSam had brought its hackers more than US$5.9 million since late 2015 (see Exhibit 6).Next StepsAs the clock ticked on the ransom note the U of C faced considerable challenges. Austen and the ERT had not found patient zero�the source of the infection�which meant the university was still vulnerable to further attacks. Dalgetty faced pressure from the board and faculty who wanted open transparent internal communication and hoped to recover years of research. The morale among the IT team reached new lows as members continued to work around the clock on containment and remediation. To complicate matters sleep deprivation was impairing their decision-making skills.Should the university pay the ransom? The cyber-insurance policy would not cover ransom payments. If the university paid the ransom how would the public react assuming taxpayer money would go to criminals? The CMT had decided to shield both the SLT and the public from the fact that the situation was a ransom attack. Was this decision prudent? File recovery meant that researchers� files had to be scanned risking their privacy. The order in which files were recovered also meant there would be quick access for some and delays for others. How should privacy and prioritization be managed?Exhibit 1: University of Calgary Organizational chartsNotes: SLT = senior leadership team; VP = vice-president; AVP= associate vice-president; IT = information technology; ERT = emergency response team.Source: Created by case authors using institutional information.Exhibit 2: University of Calgary Ransomware Attack TimelineNote: IT = information technology.Source: Created by the case authors using institutional information.EXHIBIT 3: DOOR POSTERSSource: Organization files.Exhibit 4: University of Calgary�IT capital budget for 2016�2017Note: IT = information technology.Source: Create by authors using institutional information.Exhibit 5: Percentage of Samsam victims going public by sectorSource: Adapted by the authors from Sophos Ltd.

It supplied hydraulic manifolds—pipe fittings with several lateral outlets to connect to other pipes—for the steel plastics and valve industry. Manifolds simplified the numerous connections formerly provided by a series of hoses and tubes resulting in an accurate and simple design.Demag Plastic Group (DPG) a large firm with global operations had one facility near Terrell. DPG produced manifolds for its own use and also purchased manifolds from Terrell for additional requirements. DPG was Terrell’s most important customer providing more than 30 per cent of Terrell’s revenue. Toward the end of 2015 DPG decided to stop producing manifolds and approached Terrell with a proposal: Terrell could buy DPG’s Giddings & Lewis (G&L) Orion Machining Center (the Orion machine) and use it to process what would be additional orders from DPG. DPG would pay a 10 per cent markup on Terrell’s approved cost to process DPG’s orders.Terrell ManufacturingTerrell Manufacturing was established by George Terrell in 1954. In its early years the company provided manifolds primarily for the steel industry. The steel industry was growing at that time resulting in strong growth for Terrell.Terrell added the plastics industry to its portfolio in the early 1960s when Van Dorn Corporation (Van Dorn) a Cleveland-based producer of plastic moulding machines began to use hydraulic manifolds as a replacement for its current system of hoses and tubes. Van Dorn gave the order for its manifold requirements to Terrell creating Terrell’s first market diversification. As a result of its efficient work Terrell soon became well-known in the plastics industry for its ability to produce complex high-quality manifolds. As the plastics industry flourished in the 1970s Terrell grew again. By then Terrell had large machines capable of machining manifolds of up to 10000 pounds (4.5 metric tons).In early 1994 Van Dorn purchased an Orion machine and began producing manifolds in its own facility. The Orion machine was a technological feat in its ability to produce manifolds at speeds three to four times faster than conventional equipment. As a result Terrell lost more than a quarter of its business.When George Terrell died in 1996 he left his business to his three daughters none of whom was active in the company. Louis Palombo was acting as president of Terrell at that time. For nearly a decade Terrell remained stagnant without any major decision or initiative—no new investment no marketing and no strategic plan. Key personnel began to leave and overall sales declined from a high of US$3.5 million in 1994 to $2.1 million in 2004.In December 2004 Palombo bought Terrell. By then Vincent Palombo’s son was also working for Terrell. For the year ending December 2004 Terrell achieved profits of $44000 based on sales of $2.1 million. The company had 17 employees—three in management positions and 14 in production activity. As the new owner Palombo purchased a DeVlieg boring mill fully retrofitted it at some cost and placed it into production in March 2005. The DeVlieg boring mill became the most accurate and modern machining equipment in Terrell’s facility (see Exhibits 1 and 2).The OpportunityVan Dorn became Demag Plastic Group (DPG) after it was bought by a German firm in 2002. The new management continuously reviewed the company’s operations and strategies to improve profitability and focus on the main business. At one stage management decided to shut down the company’s manifold operation and outsource the manifolds from a reliable supplier. They naturally thought of Terrell which was already supplying DPG and was nearby. DPG approached Palombo and Vincent in December 2015 inviting them to bid on DPG’s line of hydraulic manifolds with an annual use that translated to sales of approximately $500000.Terrell did not have enough capacity to meet DPG’s total requirements without reducing Terrell’s other customer base. When this limitation was expressed DPG made an additional offer: DPG would sell its 20-year-old Orion machine to Terrell at an upfront cost of $200000. DPG was open to negotiating the terms of payment if doing so would help Terrell.The Orion machine would replace Terrell’s initial two processes (see Exhibits 1 and 2) and Terrell would use its existing machines for the remaining processes needed to complete the manifolds made on the Orion machine for DPG. DPG asked Terrell to establish the base hourly rate for processing DPG’s orders on the Orion machine and on Terrell’s existing equipment. DPG would then discuss and negotiate the markup to determine the hourly rate that it would pay to Terrell. The offer came with one condition: Terrell could not use the spare capacity of the Orion machine to process orders for DPG’s competitors.DPG was also concerned about Terrell’s capabilities because of the significant technological skills required to operate the Orion machine. DPG therefore offered to train Terrell’s selected operators and help with troubleshooting should the need arise all free of cost. If everything went well for both companies DPG would be willing to offer its second Orion machine to Terrell at some later date. Vincent thought this offer represented a great opportunity. The technological advancement backed by an experienced multinational customer such as DPG could give Terrell an additional advantage over its competitors. Vincent began calculating the hourly cost of processing on the Orion machine so he would have a base for negotiating the rate.Vincent’s AssumptionsAfter investigating the costs and issues and discussing them with his father Vincent concluded that the Orion machine could be used for 100 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This usage implied two shifts of operations every day for five days a week and 50 weeks a year. One skilled worker and one semi-skilled worker would be required on each shift to operate the machine. A skilled worker would be paid $20 per hour and an semi-skilled worker $15 per hour. Employee benefits could be calculated as an additional 30 per cent on employees’ hourly wages.Vincent’s accountant told him that the depreciable value of Terrell’s building was $500000. The Orion machine had a remaining life of 10 years. These assets could be depreciated on a straight-line basis at a rate of 10 per cent.Additional tooling expenses were expected to be $10000 per year and maintenance expenses for the Orion machine $10000 per year. Annual property tax of $10000 and real estate tax of $14000 would not change but the workers’ compensation tax would increase from $8000 to $10000 yearly. Insurance for the building was $12000 per year and unlikely to change. Utilities (water gas electricity and telephone) were $71400 annually but the Orion machine would add $15000 to those costs.The accountant also told Vincent that it would be appropriate to charge to the Orion machine 15 per cent of common expenses (such as depreciation on the building taxes insurance for the current building and utilities). General administrative expenses were unlikely to change due to the purchase of the Orion machine but Terrell could still charge 10 per cent of those expenses to the Orion machine.Jobs completed on the Orion machine would be further processed in four subsequent processes: deburr; grind; inspect; and stamp wash wrap and ship. The hourly cost for these processes for a job produced on the Orion machine would be as follows: deburr $6.50; grind $6.50; inspect $2.25; and stamp wash wrap and ship $1.20.Vincent decided to run his calculations by a consultant. The consultant visited Terrell; understood the industry and Terrell’s operations; talked to Vincent his father supervisors and some workers; and studied the complete facility. He then asked Vincent and his father a series of questions (see Exhibit 3).Consultant’s AssumptionsBased on the consultant’s inquiry the consultant changed some of Vincent’s assumptions and added others.The consultant fairly assumed that the productive use of the Orion machine would be 90 per cent of the gross availability estimated by Vincent. The consultant also learned that the Orion machine could be operated by a skilled worker in each shift without any help from a semi-skilled worker. This arrangement implied that each skilled worker would work a 10-hour shift including two hours of overtime every shift. The overtime hours would be paid a premium of 50 per cent of the base wage rate. The benefit rate would be applied to the regular wages and not to the wages paid for the overtime. Transportation of the Orion machine and its installation on Terrell’s premises would cost $10000. The new washing capacity and higher-capacity transformer would require an additional investment of $100000. Terrell would also require additional working capital of $25000 to support the additional sales coming from DPG’s order. After the fifth year the Orion machine would require an overhauling which could cost as much as $50000. The machine would likely then maintain its productivity for an additional five years after which it would be scrapped at no net gain or loss.The insurance for the building and existing equipment was $12000 per annum. The general insurance premium for the Orion machine washing capacity and transformer would be 2 per cent of the purchase price.The consultant estimated that the breakage and scrap of jobs would cost $1.20 per hour of work on the Orion machine. The consultant also proposed charging 20 per cent of the common expenses (including general administrative expenses) to the Orion machine rather than the 15 per cent estimated by Vincent.Terrell had obtained a current loan at 6 per cent interest but the new investments increased the perceived risk so they would need to be financed through the bank at an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. The consultant also advised Vincent that he and his father could attribute 12 per cent as a cost of owners’ capital to the Orion machine which had been set at 10 per cent. The consultant studied the owners’ tax bracket and suggested that their marginal tax rate would be 35 per cent.The consultant was confident that DPG would agree to a proposal of being paid for the machine in equal monthly instalments over 48 months and that DPG would not charge interest on the outstanding amount. The consultant found Vincent’s other assumptions to be in order.The consultant obtained the latest balance sheet of Terrell Manufacturing and prepared a projected balance sheet after factoring the proposal of purchasing the Orion machine and factoring all other assumptions. These balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 4. The consultant also prepared an Excel spreadsheet with the initial data and assumptions on one worksheet and calculated the full cost for pricing on another. The consultant then gave Vincent the detailed calculation of the hourly cost for processing the job order on the Orion machine and asked Vincent to submit that cost as the commercial bid for the Orion machine along with the suggested lower limit for the hourly rate. The consultant also discussed the negotiation strategy with Vincent. Exhibit 1: Manufacturing Processes at Terrell Manufacturing—the Manual process and the Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) processManufacturing Process (without a CNC machine)The traditional machined product ordinarily required nine sequences in an assembly line:Blanchard Grind: The Blanchard grinder used rotating stones to create a smooth finish on the top and bottom of the rectangular block of raw material.Mill: The remaining four sides were milled using carbide inserts to achieve a smooth surface.Program/Spot: This machinist created the blueprint and marked the block with small “dimples” to indicate the proper locations of the bored holes.Drill: The drill press operator compared the blueprint with the dimples and machine-drilled all the holes according to the blueprint.Finish Machine: The finish machine performed critical machining operations that included machining O-rings and diameters that required a tolerance range of 0.001 to 0.015 inches (0.025 to 0.381 millimetres). (A single thread of hair measured 0.001 inches or 0.025 millimetres.)De-Burr: The de-burring phase required employees to use a handheld device that rotated rolled sandpaper into every machined hole. This function cleaned out the internal block removing metal chips and other debris that contaminated the block during machining.Finish Grind: Finish grinding provided a smooth finish to the blocks. This process improved the cosmetics of the block and created a smoother surface on which to assemble valves and O-rings.Inspection: A full inspection was required for each machined block.Stamp/Wash/Wrap/Ship: Parts were then manually stamped washed wrapped and shipped.Manufacturing Process (with a CNC machine)Program/Spot: This machinist would create a CNC program using the coordinates on the blueprint to completely machine the block. This function included the use of milling cutters to mill and finish-grind and the use of engraving to eliminate the stamping procedure.CNC Machining (Milling Drilling and Finishing): The CNC machine completed these tasks at a high speed often 40 to 50 per cent faster than manual machines. De-Burr: The de-burring phase required employees to use a handheld device that rotated rolled sandpaper into every machined hole. This function cleaned out the internal block removing metal chips and other debris that contaminated the block during machining.Inspection: A full inspection was required for the first block produced on the CNC machine. Once the program was approved the subsequent blocks in the batch would not require inspection.Stamp/Wash/Wrap/Ship: Parts were then manually stamped washed wrapped and shipped.Source: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 2: Terrell manufacturing’s Process DiagramNote: G&L = Giddings & Lewis; CNC = computerized numerical controlSource: Created by the case authors based on company documents.Exhibit 3: Consultant’s Inquiry and Vincent Palombo’s responsesNote: DPG = Demag Plastic GroupSource: Victor Palombo (Partner Terrell Manufacturing) in discussion with the consultant Date: June 25 2016.EXHIBIT 4: Terrell manufacturing’s BALANCE SHEET at the End of 2015Notes: *Amount equal to additional working capital loan is added in the current assets; **Costs of Orion machine and washing facility of $300000 added here; ***Installation cost of $10000 added to other assets as a miscellaneous asset; **** Includes bank loans of $310000 ($10000 for installation $100000 for washing facility and $200000 payable to DPG for Orion machine).

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-10-25On March 19 2017 the online health care company HaoDF Online (HaoDF) announced that its patients in Yinchuan China could receive reimbursement from the country�s social medical insurance after receiving treatment. The health care services were offered mainly online by what was referred to as HaoDF�s �Internet hospital.� This move represented a major step in the development of HaoDF�s online medical ecosystem. Since it was launched on December 10 2016 HaoDF�s Yinchuan Smart Internet Hospital had served more than 31 million users and conducted online diagnosis and treatment for almost 1 million patients during its first three months. HaoDF�s online health care services could collaborate with physicians to remotely monitor patient conditions and guide paramedical staff in the decision-making process. However beyond diagnosis consultation and prescriptions patients needed a physical hospital or clinic for the actual treatment. An online health care platform could not achieve its full business value without either establishing its own facilities or collaborating with existing traditional health care organizations. HaoDF chose an asset-light strategy so it sought the collaboration of existing traditional hospitals or clinics rather than establishing its own facilities. However traditional hospitals were reluctant to embrace the online health care system as a medium for interaction with patients. This factor became a major challenge for HaoDF in its efforts to attract traditional medical organizations for collaboration. Another notable challenge for HaoDF was how to become profitable. Since its inception in 2006 the company had been relying on venture capital investment and subsidies to attract new users but it had yet to generate a profit from its own operations. Online health care delivery was a promising new industry in China that attracted large investments from which HaoDF had benefited. However dozens of newcomers were also entering the market enticed by the readily available venture investment and funding. Therefore a second challenge for HaoDF was to develop a business strategy to sustain its competitiveness.FOUNDing of HaoDFDuring the previous several decades the Internet had evolved rapidly in China. By 2015 the country had the largest number of Internet users in the world. More than half a billion people in China were active mobile Internet users of approximately 1.3 billion mobile subscriptions that had been registered. The market value of publicly traded Internet companies reached more than �3.95 trillion. Internet giants and e-commerce companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba); Tencent Holdings Limited; Baidu Inc.; and JD.com Inc. had been listed among the top 10 Internet companies globally. Established in 2006 HaoDF (literally translated as �good doctor�) was one of the most popular online health care platforms in China. The company was based in Beijing and had approximately 600 employees. Access to doctors was difficult for many people in China. With resources and medical information not readily available many patients travelled long distances from remote locations to major city hospitals for medical services where they expected to find a higher level of care. At the end of 2005 a state-owned media organization conducted a survey to identify the top concerns of Chinese citizens and found that access to reliable medical care was one of the most significant problems in Chinese society. By 2006 Alibaba had already become a vastly popular e-commerce platform in China but advances in online technology had not brought major improvements to the traditional medical industry. Major hospitals featured websites that were rarely updated and lacked essential information. Patients had no choice but to visit each hospital for details about its specific medical resources. Other hospitals without the resources to even host a functional website were simply unable to take advantage of Internet technology to improve patients� experience. Hang Wang the founder and chief executive officer of HaoDF had a wealth of experience in both the medical industry and Internet technology before establishing HaoDF. Together with partners Shaoyu Hu and Dan Luo Wang invested �500000 to establish HaoDF with the goal of helping patients find the right doctor for their ailments. The company�s name (�good doctor�) was intended to reflect this basic purpose. HaoDF posted each doctor�s areas of specialty and available appointment times on the website so that patients could easily schedule their visits. HaoDF went live soon after the company�s founding. However most hospitals were reluctant to collaborate with the new online service so Wang paid hospital workers to keep HaoDF informed each day on doctors� available appointments slots for the next day. HaoDF�s employees also imitated computer �spiders� in seeking and recording all available announcements from hospitals on online notice boards which they then sorted and posted on HaoDF. Gradually as the information on the website about doctors� availability and services became more thorough and reliable traffic to the website increased steadily. Wang soon discovered that the website�s visitors enjoyed sharing their experiences with other patients so he decided to make efficient use of that information. In early 2007 HaoDF introduced a new feature where patients could rate doctors and provide general information to improve the knowledge base among physicians and patients. From that point on HaoDF obtained five rounds of investment which amounted to approximately US$300 million in total. In mid-2007 �3 million was invested in HaoDF by Chinese venture capitalist Lei Jun and new venture capital firm Lianchuangceyuan. In 2008 HaoDF received an investment of approximately $3 million which was followed by $15 million in funding in November 2011. Several years later in June 2015 $60 million was invested by Trust Bridge and China Renaissance Capital Investment. The latest round of funding HaoDF received was $200 million (in series D funding) from a venture capital group led by Tencent Holdings Limited. With this financial support Wang launched various new services on the platform to meet the increasingly diverse needs of HaoDF�s users. MAJOR BUSINESS LinesIn its early stages HaoDF provided basic information for patients and their relatives about hospitals and doctors. Details included hospital addresses hospital ratings by patients doctor appointment schedules and doctor ratings by patients. The primary objective of HaoDF�s business model was to reduce misinformation about physicians and to provide more reliable details for patients about the health care industry. Initially HaoDF could provide only the most basic services. Doctors could conduct some consultations over the telephone or online but any diagnosis or treatment advice was not available through the platform. Nevertheless HaoDF�s online appointment and referral services helped it gain a competitive advantage. Appointment Schedules and Access to Knowledge Base The platform displayed each physician�s detailed areas of expertise and appointment schedules. Information from major hospitals was updated each evening so patients would have doctor availability details for the next day. HaoDF was therefore considered a highly informative and timely appointment information portal by its users. However misleading or inaccurate medical and health care information was prevalent throughout China which could have a negative impact on patients and doctors. It was generally accepted that prevention was a much better approach than treatment after the fact. However little information was available to Chinese patients about disease prevention or treatment which was mainly due to lacking government resources for public health education. HaoDF worked to remedy this gap by providing patients with disease prevention and treatment resources in written audio and video formats. The materials were created by medical experts and provided patients with comprehensive and reliable information about a variety of ailments and methods for their prevention. Recommendations and Reviews of DoctorsHaoDF was the first outlet in China to provide information from patients about their experiences with doctors in the form of reviews ratings and recommendations. After being treated by a doctor in HaoDF�s online health care system patients could submit a detailed description of the service they received from the doctor a review of their experience and a letter of recommendation for the benefit of other patients. Patients were urged to consider the expertise and reputation of the doctors and their affiliated hospitals when preparing their recommendation of doctors for the benefit of other patients and their relatives. Users could then read the patients� remarks and letters of recommendation to make more accurate and informed decisions before scheduling appointments with doctors.Online and Telephone ConsultationIn 2009 HaoDF launched an online and telephone consultation service for patients from registered doctors. Patients and their relatives could consult a certified doctor to receive online consultation regarding medical services and needs. Each patient could use this service free of charge three times after which they would be charged a fee for each subsequent online consultation. The revenue from patients� fees was received by HaoDF and shared with the appropriate doctor.The telephone consultation service enabled patients to communicate with doctors via telephone. The cost for this service varied depending on the doctor�s expertise but prices ranged from approximately �50д500 per call. Each consultation call could range 5�15 minutes in duration and the generated revenue was shared between HaoDF and the appropriate doctor.Online Referral and AppointmentsTraditional hospitals normally assigned patients to doctors according to waiting time on a first-come first-served basis. This meant that patients suffering from relatively common ailments could be placed ahead of others suffering from more serious afflictions. This system could be ineffective and wasteful for some specialist health care providers in treating patients with minor issues while not allowing enough time to treat other patients with complicated problems. In response HaoDF established a new online referral system intended to provide health care services from medical experts to patients according to the severity of their illness. The system also allowed appointments with doctors to be scheduled and confirmed using a smart phone which was among the first of such services in China. Health care experts interested in treating patients suffering from complicated ailments could use this function on the HaoDF platform to contact patients. Basically patients in need of a specialist�s care would submit all information and materials related to their condition to seek a referral or an appointment with the appropriate specialist. A team of medical professionals would assess the patient�s information and submitted materials. The HaoDF team would then submit a request for service to the appropriate specialist who would make a final decision on whether to accept the referral request and schedule an appointment with the patient. The service provided first priority to the most serious cases.The medical experts who took part in this service did so outside of their responsibilities at their hospitals or clinics so regular appointment schedules were not disturbed. Neither physicians nor patients exchanged payment for this service.Remote Diagnosis and SurgeryAfter the launch of the HaoDF Internet-based hospital physicians who were registered on the HaoDF platform could apply for certification to provide online diagnosis and treatment advice. HaoDF collaborated with traditional clinics and community hospitals to provide diagnosis by medical experts over the Internet. The service took the form of a video call with the aid of local physicians. Highly skilled medical experts who worked in Shanghai or Beijing were able to diagnose and write prescriptions for patients in distant locations after an online consultation and assessment of medical reports provided by the patient. Local doctors would then assist the patients in obtaining medical treatment and prescribed medicine. In addition HaoDF provided expert technical staff to help doctors become familiar with the technology.Patients whose conditions were serious and required surgery could schedule an appointment with the appropriate surgeon online. The platform could also arrange for the surgeon to travel to the patient�s location for the surgery if the patient could not be transported to the surgeon�s location.COMPETITORSAccording to one study China�s mobile health (M-Health) care market was valued at �2.21 billion in 2013 representing an increase of 18.8 per cent over the previous year (see Exhibit 1). It was projected to exceed growth of �10 billion over the next several years to reach �19.05 billion by the end of 2018. Consequently China�s M-Health applications market was becoming crowded with start-ups and investors. Various health care mobile applications (apps) were being developed to provide services to address the needs of patients. In recent years major companies small developers and hospitals had all developed a variety of mobile apps to make health care services more accessible and to help reduce the costs of medical treatment.Among the thousands of mobile apps to reach the market We Doctor Chunyu Yisheng and Dingxiang Doctor were most popular in China. These mobile apps covered booking appointments with doctors health care consultation disease management self-diagnosis and medical knowledge sharing. The services mobile apps provided were largely similar so competition was becoming fierce.However providing solely consultation did not allow M-Health companies to achieve profitability because patients needed to visit a traditional health care organization to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Given the drawbacks of operating health care platforms that operated only online more and more organizations moved to integrate physical health care organizations with Internet technology. The first Internet-based hospital launched in China was the Guangdong Province Internet Hospital established in 2014. By integrating Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital with offline clinics and pharmacies the hospital enabled patients to receive medical services from well-known medical experts via remote video. By the end of 2016 China had more than 35 Internet-based hospitals.Some large companies tried to improve the patient�s experience when visiting a doctor by collaborating with the government. China Information Technology Inc. was a leading provider of integrated cloud-based platform exchange and big data solutions in China. On May 12 2015 it announced a five-year strategic agreement with Sznews.com Co. Ltd a subsidiary of Shenzhen Press Group Limited to collaborate on the Internet + Smart City project. This project involved industries such as health care education and transportation. One month later on June 24 2015 China Information Technology Inc. (CNIT) signed a strategic agreement with the Linyi municipal government of Shandong Province to implement the CNIT Internet + Smart Linyi project. Smart health care was an important part of that project intended to resolve the problem of long wait times for patients. It would also provide full-service online health care services by connecting with hospital digital systems. HOW TO GENERATE a PROFITBecoming profitable was a constant challenge for M-Health companies. Online diagnosis and treatment was seen as the top revenue-generating business. The next main source of revenue was e-commerce for pharmacies and pharmaceuticals. HaoDF relied on venture investment and subsidies to acquire new users but its profit model was not entirely clear. Although reluctant to disclose detailed financial information Wang HaoDF�s founder confirmed that the company�s online and telephone consultation services were its major revenue sources.WeDoctor was founded by Tencent and earned �1.2 billion in revenue in 2016 from advertising and referring patients to doctors. However Wang emphasized that HaoDF would not earn a profit by offering advertising services because it would compromise the neutrality of the platform and jeopardize the trust of its users. Wang also revealed that HaoDF�s appointment and referral services did not generate a profit because these services were free. Online medical information was also provided free to users. Therefore HaoDF�s profits were mainly generated by sharing revenues from fees with doctors who were paid for consultation services in cash or by digital �gifts� from patients that ranged from �5д200. HaoDF retained around 10 per cent of all fees charged to users. The rest was paid to doctors affiliated with the platform.HaoDF Online also posted links to other websites on its official website. It attracted user flow by offering free trials for services then directed some of this traffic to benefit its partners. For example based on strategic co-operation between HaoDF and the Chinese Internet company Sohu Inc. (Sohu) HaoDF featured a link to the health section of the Sohu website (health.sohu.com) in the footer of its website pages.The development and popularization of online inquiries led to a new development stage for M-Health services but online consultation had its limitations. Clear and efficient communication between doctors and patients was sometimes difficult to achieve and some diagnosis and treatment could not be performed online alone. Relying on online consultations to generate profits was not a reliable business model for the M-Health industry. According to Wang �In the future HaoDF Online will explore offline business. Only by closely co-operating with offline medical organizations or getting involved in the whole process of health care could you create a higher value.�INTERNET HOSPITAL On April 6 2016 HaoDF partnered with Yinchuan�s municipal government and formally signed a contract to jointly build the Yinchuan Smart Internet Hospital later that year in December. Yinchuan hospitals community health centres and pharmacies worked with HaoDF to launch the new hospital. Yinchuan had a shortage of high-quality medical resources being located in a remote area so its collaboration with HaoDF enabled residents to access remote diagnosis and treatment. Conveniently patients suffering from common ailments could be seen remotely and follow-up consultations could be conducted over the Internet.This was a big step for HaoDF as it expanded its M-Health consultation service to both online diagnosis and traditional treatment. The uneven distribution of medical resources in China had led to patients crowding into well-known hospitals in big cities. Although the government had been trying to establish a hierarchical system for diagnosis and treatment among hospitals at different levels collaboration among the various hospitals was difficult to achieve mainly due to conflicting benefits. However Internet-based hospitals were an ideal solution for hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and patients from all locations could receive treatment from medical experts based on the patient�s need. THE FUTURE OF HAODFThe landscape of the Chinese and global online health care market was rapidly changing. HaoDF already occupied a large market share but it still needed to address some complex issues. How would HaoDF convince more traditional medical organizations to collaborate with an Internet-based hospital? What was a sustainable profit model for an Internet-based health care company? What strategies would HaoDF need to develop to sustain its competitiveness?EXHIBIT 1: market value of the Mobile HEALTH care MARKET IN CHINA (2011�2017)Note: growth rate = (current year value _ previous year value) � previous year value _ 100; � = RMB = Chinese yuan renminbi; �1 = US$0.14 on March 19 2017.Source: �China�s M-Health Market Value from 2011 to 2017 (in 100 Million RMB)� Statista accessed July 23 2018 www.statista.com/statistics/328927/mobile-health-market-scale-in-china.Endnotes

In recent years the company had been struggling with operating profits and by December 2014 the company had experienced three consecutive quarters of decline. In addition to its financial issues the company’s former president and CEO Patrizio Di Marco and creative director Frida Giannini had abruptly stepped down leaving the company with limited strategic direction and a desperate need to once again be at the top of the luxury retail market. Bizzari was faced with a tough decision and difficult task: how could he turn Gucci around?Industry DynamicsThe luxury goods market had experienced a growth rate of 7 per cent in 2014 exceeding €850 billion. The current core within this market was personal luxury goods in which Gucci competed. A Deloitte report defined personal luxury goods as the “aggregation of designer apparel and footwear (ready-to-wear) luxury bags and accessories (including eyewear) luxury jewellery and watches and premium cosmetics and fragrances.” In 2014 this market reached sales of over €223 billion tripling its size over the past 20 years. However due to the slow recovery following the financial crisis in 2008 the growth rate was slowing to a rate of 5 per cent per year. As the economy began to recover and establish a “new normal” demand for luxury goods continued to rise. This was primarily driven by Chinese Japanese and U.S. consumers. Moreover specifically within the personal luxury goods segment accessories captured over 29 per cent of the market more than the next two largest categories of apparel and jewellery and watches.The shopping experience for consumers was split between shopping at stores that offered single brands (mono-brand shopping) shopping at multi-brand stores and shopping online. With the high growth in the industry competitors were aggressively vying for market share in terms of growing their brand strategies assortments or product offerings. The luxury industry was unique in that large conglomerates owned a majority of the individual luxury brands within their portfolios. In order to offer a diverse selection to individuals conglomerates expanded through mergers and acquisitions of individual fashion houses. For example Gucci was held under the Kering group umbrella. The fashion market in particular was further segmented into various categories (see Exhibit 1). Many luxury fashion houses operated mainly in the haute couture and ready-to-wear segments. Haute couture was the smallest of the segments; here designers created exclusive and limited pieces to be worn by celebrities and the upper echelon of society. As luxury retailers began looking to reach other segments in the market many established ready-to-wear lines. These lines were much more accessible to high income individuals and were more widely available in the markets either through online or boutique locations. Some fashion brands had further entered into more accessible product line extensions to target younger audiences who strove for brand association at more affordable prices but Gucci had never employed this strategy. Fashion House and Conglomerate StructureVarious roles within luxury fashion houses contributed to streamlined design processes and collections that fit with the brand image. The creative director or director of design headed the design department coordinating all the designs of each product line. This person worked alongside the product manager and purchasing directors to make sure each collection was created on time and was synonymous with the brand image of the fashion house. Regional directors or sales directors were in charge of either geographic areas or product lines to market and merchandise.Traditionally luxury fashion houses created haute couture collections. Members would design made-to-order items for exclusive lists of private clients according to strict guidelines which included having a minimum of 15 staff members and creating a minimum of 50 original pieces for each of two seasons in January and July. Over the years designers began to create ready-to-wear collections that were more accessible to the market and were less difficult operationally due to standard sizing with no alterations. These designs were presented at multiple shows almost six months ahead of the season. Most designers created over 10 collections per year.Gucci’s Group: KeringKering was a global group that operated in various lifestyle sports and luxury goods markets. The group’s revenues grew over 4 per cent by the end of fiscal 2013 to €9.748 billion. Kering was in charge of 19 different apparel and accessory brands. Specifically within the luxury retail space Kering dominated with brands including Bottega Veneta Yves Saint Laurent Balenciaga Alexander McQueen and Ulysse Nardin. Gucci was considered the group’s flagship brand and over 55 per cent of the revenue in Kering’s luxury division stemmed from this brand. Kering’s operations and brand distribution spanned over 120 countries worldwide.Luxury Fashion Brand CompetitorsGucci’s primary competitors were other major luxury fashion brands that were either independent fashion houses or held under conglomerate umbrellas. Moreover given the nature of each fashion house Gucci further competed with companies and brands under the Kering umbrella (see Exhibit 2). Louis Vuitton Established in 1854 Louis Vuitton Malletier SA (Louis Vuitton) had continued to dominate the luxury retail industry with its recognizable print and assortment of products including ready-to-wear collections leather goods and other accessories. Behind the powerful luxury brand was the group LVMH Moët Hennessy–Louis Vuitton (LVMH) which owned over 70 other distinct brands. In 2013 LVMH generated over €29.149 billion in revenue and €9882 in just the fashion and leather goods business group. In 2013 Louis Vuitton re-established its dominance in the luxury industry by creating new interpretations of iconic pieces and timeless collections and by continuing to collaborate with major artists and designers for limited edition collections. Given its creative momentum in 2013 Louis Vuitton continued to expand its presence in various locations worldwide including London Tokyo Beijing Venice and Munich. However its distinct brand had brought unwanted attention from the counterfeit market. As a result the brand had been through multiple legal disputes surrounding the mass production of counterfeit purses and items with similar or identical prints. BurberryFounded by Thomas Burberry in 1856 Burberry Group PLC (Burberry) was one of the most distinctive global luxury brands. Burberry took pride in maintaining its British identity and enjoyed a strong reputation related to design capabilities innovation and craftsmanship. The brand had carried itself through decades of quality design including adapting its design for the First World War. Moreover Burberry had established a well-known pattern and creative pieces such as its trench coat which was synonymous with the brand. In fiscal 2014 Burberry generated over £2330 million in total revenue. In fiscal 2014 Burberry operated 427 locations worldwide. The company’s strategy was to continue its global expansion through opening over 25 stores worldwide enhancing its digital marketing strategy and continuing to leverage its brand recognition into complementary segments.ChanelGabrielle “Coco” Chanel established this well-known luxury fashion house in 1909. Primarily known for its haute couture collection Chanel International BV (Chanel) continued to dominate in every specialization including ready-to-wear collections leather goods perfume and cosmetics. In comparison to the other luxury brands Chanel was one of the higher-priced fashion houses. The company’s global operations consisted of both boutique locations and items sold at high-end third-party retailers. In 2013 the company generated €$6.862 billion in revenue. Given the smaller size of this family-owned private company Chanel operated its businesses through regional heads that reported to the global CEO. This structure differed from that of many luxury conglomerates including Kering and LVMH as it provided regional managers greater autonomy in managing their areas of the business. Yves Saint LaurentFounded in 1961 Yves Saint Laurent SAS (YSL) began as an haute couture house. In 1966 the brand expanded into the luxury ready-to-wear segment through Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and it had since been known for capturing “the impulses of youth freedom and modernity.” In 2013 the brand generated €557 million in revenue and continued to add company-operated boutiques to its existing 115 locations. As of June 2013 YSL had invested in establishing its online presence by adding over 30 more countries to its e-commerce platform. The brand also continued to utilize social media to build a loyal brand following and promote its products. As of December 2013 YSL was one of the most popular brands on Twitter Inc. with more than 1.7 million followers on the social media platform. The brand continued to enhance its modern fashion nature by collaborating with various artists: in March 2013 it established the Music Project with celebrities including Daft Punk Courtney Love and Chuck Berry all embracing pieces from the YSL collection.Fast-Fashion CopycatsThe increasing power and growth of fast-fashion companies including Zara SA Forever 21 and H&M placed pressure on the luxury retail market. All of these companies offered affordable alternatives and they had often been accused of stealing the creative designs or implementing similar creations in their collections. Given the cheap production costs and efficient operations of many of the fast-fashion companies they were able to outpace luxury retailers. Because there was a six-month lead time on the delivery of collections in luxury goods fast-fashion companies were sometimes able to bring their versions of luxury designs to market before the original brands were for sale. Company HistoryInauguration of GucciFounded in 1921 by the talented leather manufacturer Guccio Gucci in Florence Italy Gucci established itself as one of the world’s most recognizable luxury fashion brands. As a successful leather manufacturer Gucci was known for its ability to create timeless classic pieces out of various materials. Due to the League of Nations’ embargo against imports from Italy in 1935 Guccio Gucci found creative ways to incorporate other materials including hemp and diamonds to create the company’s signature print. As a classic Italian brand Gucci did not expand outside of Italy until 1953 when it opened its first store in New York. Although Guccio Gucci passed away 15 days after the store opened the brand continued to establish well-known pieces including its iconic loafer with metal horse bit. In 1994 Tom Ford was appointed as the creative director of the company and established its first successful collection focused on jet-set glamour and sexy pieces in 1995. The brand was known for risqué commercials and advertisements that drew attention and media coverage for the brand in turn creating brand awareness. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s Gucci continued to relaunch and revamp fashion-forward pieces and various celebrity features including its beloved Jackie bag renamed for the former U.S. First Lady Jackie Kennedy. In 2000 the company experienced a hostile takeover bid by LVMH; however it was ultimately purchased by investment firm Pinault Printemps Redoute (PPR) now known as Kering which was looking to expand its portfolio of luxury brands. Gucci continued to establish itself as the “it” brand of fashion in the early 2000s and continued to expand into various complementary avenues including fragrances with the help of Giannini who joined the company after previously working for Fendi. In 2004 Ford left the company after he and PPR failed to come to terms on a new contract and in 2005 Giannini became creative director. As of 2015 the company had over 514 company-operated locations and headquarters in Italy.Recent HistoryFollowing her promotion as creative director Giannini continued to work within the template of Ford’s designs. The brand was product focused; however given the quickly changing trends of consumers especially in the fashion industry Gucci found itself experiencing creative stagnation and its overtly sexual marketing approach was no longer as successful. The brand began to lose its credibility and by the second half of 2013 Gucci experienced three consecutive quarters of declining sales. With over 55 per cent of revenues for Kering being driven by Gucci (see Exhibits 3 and 4) Kering was highly concerned about the brand’s ability to remain competitive in the ever-changing luxury market.Opportunities Given increased competition in the luxury goods industry and the rise in fast fashion many observers felt that Bizzari needed to reposition Gucci. In December 2014 Kering announced that Giannini would be leaving Gucci. Under pressure from Kering and dealing with the departure of Giannini the brand had no creative direction to move forward. Industry observers recognized an immediate need for a decision in the increasingly competitive personal luxury goods market. Repositioning and RehiringGiven the limited success of the previous three quarters industry observers began to wonder if Gucci’s brand needed a new direction; what would a new brand position entail? Ford and Giannini had left the company with an image and direction that had been successful for decades and had only recently began to lose credibility in the market. Was this just a bad period? Was it time for Gucci to divert itself from the sexy image for which it had been known for so long? If Gucci were to reposition itself what would its new image be and what message would the company send? Moreover Gucci needed to find a new creative director. Typically directors needed to have several years of experience in the industry as they would be responsible for the brand image and all the collections of the company. The company had some candidates in mind and long lists of individuals with decades of experience at luxury firms. In the luxury fashion industry it was common to switch firms and change directors. However industry observers were intrigued by one candidate: Alessandro Michele. Michele had been with Gucci’s creative department since 2002 and brought a young flair to his work. He was not as well-known as the other candidates nor did he have as much experience. However he had been with the company through many stages and understood the nature of the business. Picking the right creative director was key in this situation as this position held the key not only to Gucci’s performance but also to its relationship with Kering and its shareholders. Thus industry observers wondered how perceptions of the company would change depending on whether it hired an insider or a new celebrity outsider.Digital Marketing InvestmentsLooking at Gucci’s major competitors observers wondered whether this was the time for the company to establish a greater digital presence. In 2012 Kering had launched a digital strategy to revitalize its online presence by designing an interface for each brand’s website. In 2013 Kering entered a joint venture with online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter Group (Yoox) to distribute its brands and boost their e-commerce presence. In 2013 Gucci was ranked 38th out of the best global brands (Zara was ranked 36th; H&M was ranked 21st; and Louis Vuitton was ranked 17th). This ranking not only incorporated brand value and equity but was also based on brands’ digital and social media influence. By 2014 Gucci had dropped to 41st while Zara and H&M had maintained their positions and Louis Vuitton was ranked 19th. With brands like YSL continuing to expand their digital platforms and marketing strategies what should Gucci do next to remain competitive in this market?Product Line ExtensionWith the success of accessible luxury brands including Marc by Marc Jacobs Armani Exchange and DKNY Bizzari wondered if it was time to consider entering the affordable luxury market and creating an alternative line at lower price points. This strategy had driven growth from a younger consumer market and generated significant income for other brands. In luxury consumption millennials were three times more likely to be driven by trends than older consumers. Was it time for Gucci to consider following these other brands? The brand had stayed away from this strategy for fear of brand dilution; however could this segment be a new way for Gucci to grow? The DilemmaIn short Bizzari was faced with several interrelated decisions. In regard to Gucci’s brand position he needed to decide whether the company’s positioning should remain as it was created under Ford or if it was time to change the perception of the brand. Following this decision he had to decide whether it would be better for the company to hire internally or externally for a creative director. Additionally what digital investments if any should the brand make? Was this the time to focus on building a digital strategy? Lastly should Gucci attempt to create a product line diffusion similar to some of the other luxury brands? If so what should be the new line’s value proposition? All of these decisions would end up determining the future of Gucci’s empire.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-04-28In October 2020 Google LLC (Google) found itself involved in a controversy with both India�s government and the country�s developers of mobile applications (apps). Google announced that it would be enforcing its global payment policy for Google Play the company�s digital distribution platform for apps and digital media including books movies magazines music and television programs. The policy required app developers to pay a 30 per cent commission on all in-app purchases of digital goods bought on Google Play. Google�s policy would become effective worldwide starting in September 2021 when all developers who sold digital goods on their apps would have to use Google�s billing system and pay Google a 30 per cent commission on all �app sales in-app purchases and subscriptions made within apps.� Google justified this commission as the price for providing consumers the benefits of a �trusted system� that allowed them to �safely securely and seamlessly buy from developers worldwide.� Google clarified that the commission would not be charged on in-app advertising or purchases of physical goods made through an app.Google�s announcement drew particular opposition in India. Technology start-up companies that used Google Play to distribute their products strongly objected to paying the 30 per cent commission which they referred to as a �Google tax.� They challenged Google�s imposition of the commission and threatened to file an antitrust complaint against the company. India�s technology companies began discussions on building an alternative local version of Google Play that would make Indian apps available. In addition the Indian government suggested that it was prepared to launch its own version of an app store in support of the country�s start-ups and technology entrepreneurs.As the market leader in India�s app distribution industry Google had to resolve these issues to retain its top position. What was the basis of Google�s advantage that allowed it to impose a �Google tax� for use of the Google Play Store as alleged by the Indian start-ups and app developers? Could such an advantage be replicated by the alternative platform envisaged by Indian start-ups or by the Indian government? How should Google respond to these start-ups� complaints and their threats to initiate antitrust complaints?GOOGLEGoogle was founded in the United States in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin with a mission �to organise the world�s information and make it universally accessible and useful.� Google�s core business was web search services and many of its products and other services were related to its core business. Google�s revenues in 2019 reached US$160.74 billion after exponential growth from only $0.4 billion in 2002. Google�s search-based advertising provided one of the most lucrative business models in the world. The model was based on consumer access and use of the Internet. However the way people accessed the Internet was changing. More and more people were using cell phones (especially smartphones) rather than computers to access the Internet which made apps far more popular than websites. Therefore the company�s most important tool became Google Play its distribution service for apps.Google Play and the App MarketIn October 2008 Google launched a service named Android Market that offered apps and games written specifically for the Android operating system (OS). In 2012 Google added books movies and music on the platform and renamed it Google Play. All devices that were powered by the Android OS had the Google Play app pre-installed on them to allow users to easily access apps games and digital content. By 2020 the market for apps included 3.5 billion smartphone users around the world. In India 36 per cent of the population owned mobile devices representing a user base of 500 million. In 2019 India was the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China. In August 2020 74.25 per cent of mobile devices across the world were powered by the Android OS. Its main competitor the iOS by Apple Inc. (Apple) had the second-largest OS user base in the world with 25.15 per cent of all mobile devices being Apple products. Other platforms held miniscule shares of the market (see Exhibit 1). In India the mobile devices market was even more skewed. In September 2020 95.85 per cent of mobile devices in India were powered by the Android OS while the iOS accounted for a miniscule 0.54 per cent (see Exhibit 1). Google Play which dominated the app market listed over 2.7 million apps that were available for downloading on Android devices. Globally the number of apps downloaded increased by 45 per cent from 2016 to 2019. In India the rate over that same period was 190 per cent. With 7 billion app downloads in the second quarter of 2020 it was also the global leader. Across the world (other than in China) most app downloads came from Google Play (see Exhibit 2). From 2016 to 2019 Google Play app downloads increased at a significantly higher rate than iOS app downloads especially for videos and games although the rate for social media and entertainment apps also increased considerably (see Exhibit 3).App use around the world also increased significantly. From 2017 to 2019 the average time spent using apps on Android devices globally increased by approximately 35 per cent to 3 hours 40 minutes. In the first half of 2020 usage time on Android devices was registered at a total of 1.6 trillion hours. India experienced similar increases in app use. Its daily mobile usage hours grew by 25 per cent from 2017 to 2019 and by 37 per cent between 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. Only Canada saw higher growth during this time.App RevenuesDuring the period of 2017�18 app revenues grew steadily for both Google and Apple (see Exhibit 4). Industry analysts projected combined Google and Apple app revenues to reach $156 billion by 2023 based on an assumed compound annual growth rate of 16.8 per cent. In July 2020 Google Play reported $17.3 billion in app revenues growing at a rate of 20 per cent year on year while Apple�s App Store reported app revenues of $32.8 billion growing at a rate of 24.7 per cent year on year. Globally the app ecosystem had generated revenues of $50 billion representing 23 per cent growth over the previous year�s figure of $40.6 billion for the same period.Although Google Play revenues grew at high rates most apps were available to users for free. In fact the proportion of free apps on Google Play had actually grown between 2019 and September 2020 to a high of 96.5 per cent (see Exhibit 5). To generate revenue from their products app developers could choose from various business models (see Exhibit 6). Interestingly the business model that contributed the highest amount of Google Play global revenue (at 98 per cent) was the �freemium� model which made available a basic version of the app for free to users who could pay to get premium features. For monetization of their apps developers again had several different options for pricing models including in-app purchases; paid app downloads; in-app advertising; subscriptions; rewarded video advertisements where users were required to watch a short video to receive a reward; and interstitial video advertisements where users had to wait for full-screen (rather than banner or pop-up) advertisements to complete before they could resume the use of the app. Of all monetization models in-app purchases and interstitial video advertisements were considered most effective by developers whereas paid app downloads and subscriptions scored low on their perceived monetization effectiveness (see Exhibit 7).Revenue Model for Google and Its CompetitorsGoogle and Apple used similar revenue models. The share of revenue generated by paid app downloads and in-app purchases was 70 per cent for the developer and 30 per cent for Google or Apple. For in-app subscriptions the share that Google or Apple charged was 30 per cent in the first year and 15 per cent in successive years. However for in-app advertising and in-app sales of physical goods the developers kept all revenue (100 per cent). The pricing model of 30 per cent commission that Google and Apple charged was also adopted by many smaller app distributors including the Galaxy Store by Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (Samsung); the Amazon Appstore; and the Microsoft Store.Google�s Android OS and Google PlayGoogle claimed that its OS Android was open source software that was free for anyone�s use without any licensing fees. Analysts however noted that Google had monetized the Android OS by combining it with firm-specific advantages. The OS was thereby able to earn the company estimated revenues of $9.1 billion in 2019 through Google Play broken down into $7.3 billion from apps and $1.8 billion from music books and videos. This revenue could not have been possible without the Android OS.In reality only a stripped down or bare version of the Android OS (without Google Play and other core Google services) was free to use as open source. However smartphone manufacturers were reluctant to use the bare version of the Android OS. Most consumers considered Google Play and other Google system services essential for the full operation of their mobile device. As manufacturers soon realized Google Play and Google Play Services�an integral background technological service�were core components of the overall Android ecosystem. They were critical to the proper function of all Android phones. Google and Apple enjoyed nearly total domination of the global smartphone market. Smartphone manufacturers around the world (other than Chinese companies) who rejected Google�s Android and tried to create their own OS were doomed to fail as proven by Mozilla Corporation (Firefox OS) Canonical Ltd. (Ubantu Phone) Microsoft Corporation (Windows phone) Samsung (Tizen OS) and BlackBerry Limited (BlackBerry OS). Amazon.com Inc. also attempted to enter the smartphone market with its Fire Phone in June 2014 as a rival to Apple and Samsung. However the product failed to capture enough market share and was discontinued in 2015. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. met a similar fate to when it attempted to adopt a bare version of the Android OSin the wake of trade hostilities between China and the United Statesand create its own app store to compete against Google Play. One analyst made the following observation:If we disregard this �bare� Android version than [sic] we can clearly say that�Android is not open source but Google�s proprietary software. [emphasis in the original] To use it the manufacturer does not need to pay anything but they need to comply with many of Google�s conditions to be able to use the full version of Android with [Google] Play and other Google�s apps.With a search market share of about 90 per cent worldwide Google had managed to create and control �a suite of apps like Chrome Gmail YouTube Google Maps Google Docs and many other popular web services.� In fact it had been accused of using its dominance to force partners to bundle Google�s apps including Google Search and Google Maps into their offerings.�THE CONTROVERSY Google�s StanceGoogle announced on a blog post in September 2020 that it would enforce its policy of levying a 30 per cent commission on all in-app purchases of digital goods bought on Google Play. The blog post was intended to provide �clarity� on billing policies among app developers on the types of transactions that required the use of its app store�s billing system. It also addressed Google�s concerns regarding developers such as Netflix and Spotify who had been bypassing the billing system requirement by prompting users to pay directly using a credit card.Google stated: �We�ve always required�developers who distribute their apps on Play to use Google Play�s billing system if they offer in-app purchases of digital goods and pay a service fee from a percentage of the purchase.� Google Play Console Help sought to clarify the language and make the requirements of using Google Play�s billing system more explicit for app developers selling digital goods in their apps. Google pre-empted any criticism of its announcement by stating that choice had been a core tenet of its policy allowing developers who failed to come to an agreement with Google on business terms to operate their own app stores and distribute their apps on the Android OS. It provided the example of app developer Epic Games which had benefited from Android�s third-party app store policy by distributing its popular game Fortnite directly from its own app store as well as from other companies� app stores including Samsung�s Galaxy Store.Google insisted that its 30 per cent commission was part of the commitment to honour consumer trust and provide consumers with security benefits:Consumers get the benefit of a trusted system that allows them to safely securely and seamlessly buy from developers worldwide. Google protects consumers� payment info with multiple layers of security using one of the world�s�most advanced�security infrastructures.Google claimed that the commission also sought to fulfill developer expectations for powerful tools and devices needed to grow their businesses thus providing them with marketing benefits: �For developers Google Play�s billing system provides an easy way for billions of Android users to transact with them using their local preferred method of payment.�Google expected the enforcement of its billing policy to affect a small proportion less than 3 per cent of app developers who had sold digital goods over the past year. Within this small group the vast majority (97 per cent) were already using Google�s billing system. Google also spoke of equal treatment among all of its own apps and third-party apps including competitor apps that were featured in its Editor�s Choice picks for providing a great user experience.Contention of Indian Start-UpsApp developers across the world challenged Google�s 30 per cent commission as an excessively high fee compared to the standard credit card fee of approximately 2 per cent for example. Indian start-ups who had apps hosted on Google Play claimed that because 99 per cent of the country�s 500 million users were running smartphones on the Android OS Google could exert excessive control over the types of apps and other services they could offer. Vijay Shekhar Sharma the founder of India�s largest mobile payments company Paytm called Google the �big daddy� that controlled the �oxygen supply of (app) distribution� on Android phones. His anger and frustration was not surprising given that Google had removed Paytm from its app store in September 2020 citing policy violations. Paytm had been forced to make certain changes before it could be relisted on Google Play.In October 2020 Indian start-up founders and venture capitalists decided to meet to discuss filing antitrust complaints against Google. However some were skeptical about the ability of Indian app developers to take on Google especially with US standards for legal disputes as one start-up founder expressed:Taking on a giant like Google in the Indian courts involves the hefty court and legal fees and the battle will be incredibly long drawn . . . because these big Internet firms do not fully follow the rules and regulations in India and a developer might have to fight a concurrent case in the US court as well.App developers were highly dependent on Google Play as Gaurav Garg a co-founder of the educational technology start-up Study IQ stated: �I think it is impossible for a digital company to move out from the Play Store. I don�t think we will do that we have 1.5 Mn [million] subscribers on our Android app.� But the 30 per cent commission was an extreme amount to pay for many app developers especially small companies. For some of them the commission would mean absorbing a 30 per cent loss on their calculation of earnings before interest depreciation and amortization. Therefore to reduce their dependence on Google some Indian start-ups were considering building a local app distribution service that charged only a reasonable service fee. According to Vishal Gondal co-founder of the Bengaluru gaming firm nCore Games �If we have to give 30 per cent fees to Google and also pay for customer acquisition how will our budding businesses survive?�DOMINANCE AND ABUSE OF DOMINANCETo gain a dominant position companies could consider using barriers of entry into their market by controlling access to key resources by using exclusive rights and licences granted by the government or by creating natural monopolies through economies of scale. A natural monopoly occurred when a single company could produce the entire output at a lower cost compared to the cost when several companies were involved. Natural monopolies which were normally based on supply-side economies of scale occurred during the industrial era. In the era of the Internet market power (or dominance) of large platform monopolies such as Google were based on network externalities. They were created by demand-side economies of scale.Digital Platform Businesses and Network ExternalitiesNetwork externalities referred to the incremental benefits that current users gained with each new user joining the network and could be direct or indirect. For example the phone industry represented direct network externalities where the value of the service went up simply as the number of users went up. Only when all family members friends and relevant network members also had a phone could an individual user benefit from the phone service. On the other hand digital platform businesses represented indirect network externalities where two or more types of user groups exchanged value with each other. With consumers and app developers representing the relevant user groups for app stores such as Google Play an increase in the number of consumers increased the value of the network for the app developers while an increase in app developers increased the value for consumers. Such externalities could also be classified into within-country or cross-country externalities based on their location. Food delivery platforms such as Just Eat or the Indian Zomato represented within country indirect network externalities because the customers and restaurants in one country did not benefit from other customers and restaurants that joined the platform. However dating platforms such as the US-based app Tinder or the Indian matrimonial platform Shaadi.com represented within-country direct network externalities because users were seeking partners from other users in their respective geographies. App store platforms such as Google Play and Apple�s App Store combined both cross-country direct and indirect network externalities. Cross-country direct network externalities could be seen in the increasing number of entrants in multi-player online gaming platforms whereas cross-country indirect network externalities resulted when other app developers sold complementary software applications globally. App users on these platforms could benefit from the existing global user base while the growth of the user base helped stimulate further app development. Digital platform businesses based on network externalities had three unique features. First the cost for the user groups outweighed the value from joining the network until the network attained a critical mass. After that point the network was able to deliver greater value than the cost of joining the network. Therefore these companies had to grow user groups through incentivizing and promoting early usage through initial referral fees and other means. As one analyst noted �In a platform�s early days there�s a chicken and egg problem�consumers only want to be on a platform with an existing network of producers and vice versa.� Second digital platform businesses differed from traditional non-platform businesses (called linear businesses) in the shape of their cost curves. As traditional businesses scaled up their per-unit average costs at first decreased followed by increasing costs per unit leading to U-shaped cost curves. Digital Platform businesses on the other hand experienced a logarithmic reduction in costs per unit leading to continuously declining average cost curves. The difference was due to traditional businesses needing to acquire assets and expand capacity to grow whereas digital platform businesses needed to acquire more users for growth entailing a near-zero cost. Third digital platform businesses also had near-zero marginal distribution costs. After an app was developed it could be simply copied and distributed.These network effects had a positive impact on both consumers and vendors but they also led to allegations of predatory business practices and winner-take-all behaviour because they imposed their terms and conditions on ecosystem partners as one analyst explained:While sellers feel squeezed consumers may continue to benefit from better prices. This wards off scrutiny by regulators who are often looking for predatory pricing on the consumer side as evidence of antitrust practices.�This is the dark side of winner-take-all platforms.Other observers however felt that network effects did not restrict competition nor did they present an insurmountable barrier to new competition.Competition Commission of India and AntitrustThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) was India�s regulatory body for fostering competition in India and restricting anti-competitive practices under the Competition Act 2002. An important objective of the CCI covered under Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 was to prevent �abuse of dominance� by enterprises in their exercise of market or monopoly power which was also known as having a dominant position. Dominance was determined by the enterprise�s economic strength in the relevant market that enabled it to �act independently of the market forces prevailing in the market� and to �affect its competitors customers or the relevant market in its favour.� The relevant market to determine dominance could be a substitutable products market (for both goods and services) or a relevant geographical area. The level of concentration could be assessed by using the concentration ratio which was based on the market share of the top five competitors or by using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index which was based on the sum of squared market shares.The CCI identified 10 factors of an enterprise as being responsible for dominance: (1) market share which referred to the size and resources of the enterprise; (2) size and importance of competitors; (3) economic power of the enterprise; (4) vertical integration where the enterprise owned the supply chain; (5) dependence of consumers on the enterprise; (6) extent of entry and exit barriers in the market; (7) countervailing buying power; (8) market structure and size of the market; (9) source of dominant position (i.e. how it was gained); and (10) social costs and obligations as well as contribution to economic development by the enterprise enjoying a dominant position.The CCI did not consider it a problem for an enterprise to occupy a dominant position within its relevant product or geographical market. The need for regulation arose only when the enterprise or a group of enterprises abused dominance through exclusion (e.g. by denying market access) or exploitation (e.g. by using predatory pricing). A dominant enterprise�s exclusionary practices constituted abuse of dominance if they were �directly or indirectly imposing unfair or discriminatory conditions in the purchase or sale of goods or services; limiting or restricting production of goods or provision of services or markets; denying market access in any manner.�The CCI also applied an essential facilities doctrine to invoke abuse of dominance. The doctrine applied if a dominant enterprise controlled an essential infrastructure or facility that was necessary to access and compete in the market. If that infrastructure or facility was not easily reproducible in the short term or replaceable with other products and services the dominant enterprise could not refuse to share it with its competitors at a reasonable cost (without sound justification). If the CCI deemed that this doctrine was being violated it could order the dominant enterprise to share its facilities with competitors in downstream markets.The CCI had the authority to direct enterprises found to be abusing their dominance to stop their practices. Its actions were seen as helping foster competition and also mitigating the societal loss caused by market power which was theoretically referred to as deadweight loss. GOOGLE AND ANTITRUST LEGISLATIONSGoogle had been under antitrust scrutiny for a long time. It also had experienced a series of conflicts with antitrust regulatory authorities across the world including the European Union the United States and Russia. In 2017 it reached a $7.8 million settlement with Russia�s Federal Antimonopoly Service in an antitrust case involving the bundling of Google�s search engine with the Android OS. The regulators ruled that Google had to actively provide users with a choice of different search engines rather than simply making Google Search the default search engine. The ruling had the effect of overturning Google�s monopoly in the Russian market.In March 2019 Google had to pay �1.49 billion for breaching European Union antitrust rules in a case involving abusive practices in online advertising. After the regulator�s decision Google was required to allow users a choice�of browser and search engine on their phones rather than pre-installing Google�s own services.�However Google�s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai defended Google�s position:Rapid innovation wide choice and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them. Today�s decision rejects the business model that supports Android which has created more choice for everyone not less.Google�s goal was to expand its presence in India. In July 2020 the company invested $10 billion in Jio Platforms India�s largest technology conglomerate with a plan to begin producing its own low-cost smartphones for the Indian market. However the company soon faced three major antitrust challenges. In 2018 the CCI fined Google $21 million for �abuse of a dominant position in the market for online search through practices leading to �search bias� and search manipulation among others.� In 2019 the CCI initiated a probe against Google to investigate the misuse of its dominant position for preventing smartphone manufacturers from opting for other Android mobile operating systems. In May 2020 another complaint was raised against Google in India for abusing its dominant position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app Google Pay over that of competitors Paytm (backed by SoftBank Group Corp.) and PhonePe (backed by Walmart Inc).Google�s conflicts with Indian start-ups was straining the technology giant�s relationship with app developers who were actively working on an alternative app distribution service with lower fees. The developers were also taking their complaints to the CCI. Even the Indian government was contemplating launching a new app store as part of its Atmanirbhar Bharat vision to make the country self-reliant. The initiative would make it mandatory for all Android devices in India to have pre-installed the government�s app store (instead of Google Play). The government�s service would then support Indian start-ups and entrepreneurs without charging the Google commission fee of 30 per cent. Would this alternative platform or the one being planned by Indian start-ups succeed in reducing Google�s monopoly? Could Google defend its position of charging a high fee for �trust� while facing multiple antitrust allegations?

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-06-18In August 2018 Mohit Mardia the managing director of Grace Castings Ltd. (GCL) was preparing for an upcoming board meeting. At the meeting which was expected to take place in GCL�s head office in Ahmedabad India Mohit planned to present the strategic plan for GCL�s future expansion and chart the future path for the company. GCL was a small mill that manufactured steel products including structural bars thermomechanically treated (TMT) bars angles and channels. In fiscal year 2017�18 the fully family-owned business had a financial turnover of US$33.85 million. With the recent growth in India�s steel industry Mohit was considering various options for GCL�s expansion. The first option was backward integration which meant increasing the capacity of billet manufacturing by adding a 30-metric-ton induction furnace. The second option was to expand the business by adding a new power plant. Mohit had to decide whether to recommend one or both of these options or simply maintain the status quo and grow the company at a slow pace. Preliminary estimates indicated that the capacity expansion of the induction furnace to produce castings and billets would cost $6.5 million whereas setting up a new power plant would cost $7.7 million. The board meeting was the following week; by that time Mohit would have to be sure which path to recommend in order to ensure GCL would be well prepared to compete in India�s steel market over the next decade.THE INDIAN MARKET FOR STEELIndia was the third-largest steel producer in the world in 2018 after China and Japan up from eighth-largest in 2003. In 2018�19 India was expected to produce 104.98 million metric tons (MMT) of finished steel. India had seen an increasing trend in steel demand and production in recent years (see Exhibit 1). Part of this growth was due to the availability of raw materials (e.g. coke and iron ore) and cheap labour as well as growth in the country�s real estate automotive and infrastructure sectors. Crude steel consumption in India had grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5.49 per cent between 2011 and 2017 to reach a consumption level of 97.4 MMT whereas finished steel production had grown at a rate of 8.39 per cent between 2011 and 2018.The National Steel Policy 2017 envisioned 300 MMT of steelmaking capacity for India by 2030. To facilitate this goal the Indian government had allowed up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the country�s steel industry. The government had also allocated steel development funds to promote research and development in the country�s steel sector. To boost domestic production the Government of India had increased the minimum import price on many steel goods which resulted in a lower rate of imports over the previous two years. Specifically imports from China Japan and Russia were down to 7.4 MMT in 2016�17 compared to 2015�16 for a drop of 36.6 per cent. Over the same period exports of finished steel increased from 4.1 MMT to 8.2 MMT.The steel industry comprised many products that had different shapes specifications and uses including sheets ingots structural bars billets rods pipes and angles. At a broader level the products could be divided into two categories: (1) flat steel products such as flat sheets and hot- and cold-rolled products which were at the higher end of the quality scale and (2) non-flat long steel products such as structural bars channels angles and TMT bars which were at the lower end of the quality scale. Customers came from a variety of industries including real estate (construction) automotive appliances and sugar production. Many customers were price sensitive; others gave more importance to delivery time and quality. Based on the production process and the product the Indian steel industry could be roughly divided into two segments: (1) integrated steel plants (ISP) or primary steelmakers and (2) mini-mills or secondary steelmakers.Integrated Steel PlantsISPs were vertically integrated steel companies that added key activities across the value chain. They had large capacities and a minimum efficiency scale (approximately 1 million metric tons). These mills used a blast furnace to convert raw materials (e.g. coke and iron) into pig iron. They then used a basic oxygen furnace to convert pig or sponge iron and ferrous or steel scrap into molten steel. Most of these ISPs used modern technology such as continuous casting to convert molten steel into billets or other steel products. Older plants that had been upgraded for better efficiency levels across the steelmaking process had state-of-the-art technology (see Exhibit 2a).Private companies such as Tata Steel Ltd. Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. and JSW Steel Ltd. as well as public sector units such as the Steel Authority of India Limited and Vizag Steel fell under this category. According to Mohit many of these companies owned raw material (e.g. coke and iron ore) mines and had their own power plants. These companies provided a wide range of steel products to their customers such as automotive companies and produced mainly high-quality steel products such as hot- and cold-rolled steel products; TMT rebars; wire rods; and bare and pre-painted galvanized Galvalume and special steel which fell under the category of flat steel products. Their customers were spread across various sectors including agriculture automotive energy and power construction engineering and government institutions. These customers placed orders in bulk and were particular about product quality durability and timely delivery. ISPs employed unionized workers with high labour costs. The sheer size of the ISPs allowed them to achieve scale as well as scope. According to a report by the Joint Plant Committee the Steel Authority of India Limited produced 13.22 MMT of finished steel between April 2016 and February 2018. During that same period Vizag Steel produced 3.581 MMT and Tata Steel Ltd. produced 10.548 MMT. JSW Steel Ltd. had an installed capacity of 18 MMT per year and 91 per cent capacity utilization compared to 98 per cent at Tata Steel.  It had seven operational plants in India. In 2017 JSW Steel Ltd. was India�s second-largest steel producer and the largest steel exporter. It planned to increase production capacity to 40 MMT by 2025. Other ISPs had similar aggressive expansion plans. The report by the Joint Plant Committee also noted that approximately 52 per cent of steel production in 2016�17 was contributed by six ISP companies: the Steel Authority of India Limited Vizag Steel Tata Steel Ltd. ESSAR Steel India Limited JSW Steel Ltd. and Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.Mini-MillsUnlike ISPs mini-mills (secondary steel producers) were small steel plants that operated on a smaller scale and were not fully vertically integrated. Mohit noted that these mills had a low minimum efficiency scale; some mini-mills had an installed capacity of just 0.1 MMT. They were active in certain parts of the value chain; for example some mills produced only billets by using electric arc furnaces or induction furnaces; some mills were independent hot- and cold-rolling units; some were sponge and pig iron producers; and the remaining were re-rolling mills and galvanizing and tin-plating units. A few mini-mills had modernized their plants to include continuous casting although most of them still followed traditional casting technologies (i.e. batch or non-continuous) because of their small scale of production.These mini-mills were dependent upon suppliers for raw materials such as steel scrap or sponge iron and direct reduced iron or hot briquetted iron. Use of steel scrap as a raw material affected product quality because impurities in the material were difficult to eliminate completely. Therefore products from mini-mills included structural bars angles castings and channels generally categorized as low-end long (non-flat) steel products. Mini-mill customers were mainly traders or micro and small companies involved in industries including construction sugar production and valve or machine manufacturing. Because of the undifferentiated products these customers were very price sensitive and required on-time delivery. Mini-mills were affected by the high cost of electricity which increased their cost of production and led to low capacity utilization. There were 1628 rolling mill units 1244 induction furnace units and 39 electric furnace units. The secondary steel producers segment produced 57 per cent of all steel in India during 2017�18. GRACE CASTINGS LTD.Rajeev Mardia had 25 years of experience running a steel mini-mill that was 100 per cent family owned. In 2002 Rajeev decided to leave the joint family business to pursue a new opportunity in Mehsana District near Ahmedabad Gujarat India. The mini-mill GCL which was established in 1992 was up for sale and in need of repairs. Rajeev decided to buy the unit and start his own business moving away from the partnership with his brothers.Rajeev used his own funds to purchase GCL a mini-mill that used an induction furnace to produce steel. Rajeev became chairman and chief financial officer of the company. He then appointed Mohit his son as managing director. GCL had manufactured mild steel structural rolling products such as equal angles channels flat rolls round rolls square rolls TMT bars and mild steel ingots. In 2002 GCL had only one rolling mill which produced about 1000 metric tons per month. Over time however Rajeev and Mohit made minor technological changes to increase production to 3700 metric tons per month. Mohit explained how the mini-mill�s conversion took place:To increase production we took simple measures. For example we decided to keep spares required to run the plant ready and also upgraded the mill with minor changes without hurting the production even for a day. Having the spares ready allowed us to reduce our downtime drastically and increased our production. We also improved on the quality from the time we took this unit and have always been working towards it.In 2003 the new company installed two additional induction furnaces: one with a capacity of 3 metric tons the other with a capacity of 3.5 metric tons. Each furnace had two crucibles. In 2006 GCL became a certified company with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In 2007 the promoters decided to diversify and set up a foundry division to manufacture quality castings of various sizes with single piece weights ranging from 50 kilograms (kg) to 5000 kg as well as cast iron casts spheroidal graphite wrought carbon grade B and alloy steel manufacturing valves wing jaws and crushers catering to customers in various industries including valves sugar cement rubber and other infrastructure areas. GCL was then able to manufacture quality structural rolling products and castings under one roof. In 2009 with the growing Indian economy and the emerging needs of infrastructure development GCL decided to expand its capacity and installed a fully automatic TMT bar mill producing best-quality TMT bars ranging from 8 millimetres (mm) to 32 mm. In 2013 GCL modified its TMT plant and upgraded its rolling capacity.In 2014 GCL further expanded its melting capacity by replacing the existing induction furnaces with a new 8-metric-ton-capacity induction furnace with two crucibles which was a departure from previous times when only one crucible was used for heating and each crucible could hold 8 metric tons of material. Given the growing demand for quality products GCL installed a locally made continuous casting machine. The company thus changed the melting process to a much more refined form. It started making billets for its own use which were used to manufacture higher-quality products. This change also helped GCL increase its product range of castings. As a result the company gained an advantage over competitors by producing 5500 kg single piece castings which only a few industry competitors were able to do. In 2015 the company installed a 2.1-megawatt windmill in Porbandar (a coastal city in Gujarat India). The new windmill helped the company save electricity costs by providing 50 million units of electricity per year.GCL in 2018By 2018 GCL was a mini-mill that used an induction furnace to produce steel and it had become an active member of various business organizations. Raw materials such as sponge iron and steel scrap were melted in an induction furnace at a temperature of 1500�1600 degrees Celsius using a steelmaking process that created molten liquid steel (see Exhibit 2b). The molten steel was then cast in a high-speed modular caster to produce billets. It was then given the desired shape and size using rolling mills. GCL had an installed capacity of 43800 metric tons of billets per year and an installed finished steel (structural steel and TMT bars) rolling capacity of 146000 metric tons per year. All the billets produced in GCL were used in-house for manufacturing finished goods. However GCL had to purchase some billets from the marketplace because the billets it manufactured in-house were not adequate to meet the requirements of its production capacity. By this time GCL had become a certified with ISO 9001-2015 and the Indian Standards Institute (ISI). The ISI certification mark was granted to Indian companies and products by the standardization authority of India. In 2017�18 GCL had a financial turnover of $33.85 million (see Exhibits 3 and 4).GCL had become an integrated company to some extent by setting up several major components: a captive wind farm in Porbandar to produce electricity a steel-melting induction furnace for making billets a foundry and casting division for producing single piece castings that ranged in weight from 50 kg to 5500 kg and two rolling mills for producing structural steel bars and TMT bars. The company drew its revenue from the sale of these products (see Exhibits 5a and 5b). With four different divisions under one roof GCL was unmatched by any competitor in Gujarat and had considerably improved its client servicing ability with vertical integration. Customers could plan their requirement for a variety of products from one single source which saved them valuable time money and inventory. Also all products were manufactured in-house which ensured good quality from one end of the value chain to the other. This factor had become GCL�s manufacturing strength. The main customers of finished goods (e.g. bars angles or channels) were traders who accounted for 90 per cent of GCL�s sales; the remaining 10 per cent of finished goods were sold directly to end consumers. According to Mohit �Traders prefer to do business with GCL because of the trust and relationship that GCL has built over time; traders know that GCL will never bypass them to reach the end customer directly. This trust is valued by traders who themselves are small and medium sized [businesses].�According to Mohit casting-related products were sold directly to machine manufacturers�the end customer. Most of these companies were micro and small manufacturers and were thus often sensitive to pricing. In 2018 GCL started producing high-margin product rolls that were used in rolling machines of different grades such as stainless steel hot-rolling mills adamite rolls spheroidal graphite iron rolls or EN 31�grade high-carbon rolls. It started selling these rolls to rolling mill manufacturers.The company�s growth was generally directed by Rajeev and Mohit who made most decisions on the basis of five criteria: (1) opportunities for use of the product (2) associated risks (3) number of years required to break even (4) profit margins and (5) cost savings. According to Mohit the company�s growth was made possible by several key factors:The biggest advantage we had over the years was that we always had space to expand. Also our main strength in expansion was the turnaround time which we have reduced by 50 per cent as compared to our competitors; all expansions were carried out without hurting our daily production; our plants were not closed even for a day. This helped us in saving costs and earning better profits. I would also like to mention that all the expansion was done without taking any external financial help; this too had helped us in reducing costs.However GCL�s growth created various challenges. For example the steel-melting induction furnace used for making billets and castings was operated at 33 per cent of its capacity because of the high cost of power (i.e. $52.31 per metric ton) which accounted for about 5 per cent of GCL�s production costs. GCL�s induction furnace was operated for one shift of eight hours during the night when India�s government provided an energy subsidy to businesses. If GCL operated the plant continuously (i.e. three shifts per day) the cost of power would rise to $80.00 per metric ton accounting for 8 per cent of production costs. Other issues related to labour finance production competition sales and marketing also contributed to hampering future growth plans.Labour IssuesGCL employed approximately 300 workers directly and 200 others indirectly. Most GCL employees were unskilled and semi-skilled. The portion of employees who had prior skills and education were either managers or sales people as Mohit explained:Steel production is a tough task as a person has to work in very high temperatures and the temperature of the metal is close to 900 degrees Celsius when re-heated and also at times the liquid metal temperatures are as hot as 1600 degrees Celsius. The persons willing to work in such temperatures are not easily available since it is tedious hard and requires a high level of endurance. In today�s world everyone wants a timed white-collar job where the working hours are fixed and [they] do not want themselves to be accountable. Also employees want a good salary. Management is ready to give salary as per the market rate but the management wants the employees to be responsible as well as accountable. Since 2012 GCL had been giving incentives to its customers (i.e. traders) and to its sales representatives to promote the sale of company products. The incentives were based on the quantity of products sold and dispatched by the sales representatives and the quantity of products bought by traders. Traders and sales representatives were ranked under three categories for incentives based on volume. Incentives included tour packages to Goa or Dubai as well as trips to Singapore which were awarded for the highest business volumes. Unskilled workers at the plant would receive a small bonus along with free food during the Diwali festivities every year.Finance-Related Issues According to Mohit the steel industry had various finance issues that needed to be considered when running a steel business: The payment cycle in the steel industry is purely credit based and no one pays in advance. The business is considered to be a high-risk one as the margins are very thin and credit varies from a 10-day period to a three-month period. The steel industry is again a very capital-intensive business�a volume game purely. The higher the volume the better is the chance of profitability. Bad debts are a common story in this business and at times capital gets blocked badly resulting in losses.Most of GCL�s business (90 per cent) was with traders rather than with end customers such as infrastructure and real estate companies. End customers normally required long credit cycles that could extend 90�180 days but traders used shorter credit cycles.Production-Related IssuesGCL also faced issues related to the company�s production planning process as Mohit explained:GCL always tries its best to fulfill orders on time but sometimes challenges related to production planning make it difficult to complete the order on time leaving customers unsatisfied. Having over 100 different products (in terms of different specifications) under a single roof is the biggest benefit we have but with limitations as it becomes very difficult to maintain a minimum inventory level of all products. At times we do run out of stock in some sections (sizes or products) as a few of them are very slow-moving items. The principle that we use in production planning is completely based upon orders and market requirements. Our delivery in most of the cases is immediate and in some cases it may also take a week�s time for us to deliver the same. When the delivery schedule takes longer than usual the challenge kicks in to have the customer satisfied.Other ChallengesThe biggest challenge GCL faced according to Mohit was related to sales and marketing. The competition at the mini-mills level was regional because a mini-mill could not easily enter another region within the state that was already served by other manufacturers. High transport charges also made it difficult to supply products across the state. Manufacturers were also compelled by customers to give rewards such as discounts incentive schemes such as tours gift articles and calendars which added another $77000 in cost each year and made it difficult to calculate product prices accurately.After the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2016�17 GCL was able to supply its products within Gujarat because check-posts and tolls had been removed. The shorter transportation time resulted in cost savings. However GCL was still unable to supply products to neighbouring states because of high transportation costs although material from other states could come to Gujarat very easily which made it even more difficult for local manufacturers like GCL to survive. According to Mohit GCL was forced to sell some products at prices below manufacturing cost which resulted in losses for the company.Power charges and raw material costs accounted for the bulk of costs in the steel industry. Power charges ranged from about 3 to 12 per cent of total manufacturing costs. For plants that had their own power plant power charges were near the low end of that range (approximately 3�5 per cent of manufacturing costs) whereas for plants that were dependent on the state electricity board power charges were closer to the higher end of the range (approximately 8�12 per cent of manufacturing costs). Because electric power charges in Gujarat were very high the cost of steel products was high compared to states such as Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh where the cost of steel products was lower as were power charges. Competition Despite rising demand for steel across India mini-mills in Gujarat faced increasing competition as Mohit explained: The products we manufacture are very location centric as transportation plays a big role in expanding our footprint and presence. The pricing is also very volatile; it fluctuates on a day-to-day basis due to the variation in raw material prices. For mini-mills the challenge is greater because prices are not stagnant for a fortnight or a month like they are for main steel producers or ISPs. Competition is also very high not only from within the state but also from manufacturers in other states such as Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Chhattisgarh etc. There are more than 100 mild steel manufacturers in India. Gujarat�s steel production capacity is 10.712 MMT which is 10 per cent of India�s steel production capacity of 101 MMT. Moreover the average capacity utilization of mills in Gujarat is 48 per cent which is very low compared to the average capacity utilization in the country of 81 per cent. The only advantage Gujarat state has is Alang�Asia�s largest ship breaking yard�whereas other states are rich in materials like coal and ore.Compared to competitors like Electrotherm India GCL had an advantage in regard to location because most projects were in Ahmedabad but most competitors were based in the regions of Kutch Bhavnagar Rajkot and South Gujarat. However some of these competitors had the advantage of proximity to ports for ease of export (see Exhibit 6).Mohit made the following observations about GCL�s competition: some competitors had a continuous-casting facility in addition to a direct or hot-rolling facility to manufacture bars channels and angles. The benefit of hot rolling was that it reduced the cost of production by approximately 30 per cent. Materials that were casted continuously were already hot which avoided the need for reheating. The result was savings in power fuel and labour to some extent. Another advantage of hot rolling was that the material could be given any length required by the customer which GCL was unable to provide with either of its rolling mills using the direct or hot-rolling method.GCL�s competitors who were based in the Kutch region generated higher profit margins and lower production costs for the following reasons: They owned a power plant which reduced their power-generation costs to $0.05 per unit compared to $0.14 per unit for companies that relied on electricity boards.They had better-integrated plants which provided them with several advantages: power generation; production of sponge iron from iron ore; use of an induction arc furnace for melting with larger capacities (minimum of 15 metric tons each); and direct or hot rolling of end products such as bars angles and channels.They had better access to export thanks to their proximity to the port which also made it easy to source raw materials with lower import duties and incentives for export of 3.25 per cent of the invoice value.�Their remote location for far off destinations and cities was very competitive negating their geographical disadvantage of transporting goods within India.Mohit was eager to expand operations at GCL. He believed that some issues were due to the company�s limited operation size. In February 2018 to sustain growth GCL had added a high-margin product to its portfolio�rolls which were used in rolling mills. The production of the additional product had required an investment of only $0.5 million because 60 per cent of the needed infrastructure to produce the rolls was already in place at GCL. The new product generated a 10�15 per cent margin but it had only quarterly demand and limited growth potential. Mohit aspired to transition his small family business into a large company and eventually compete with ISPs. He felt that the time had come to begin the transition and was considering various options. Option 1 was to add capacity in billet production through backward integration. This option would allow GCL to add melting capacity (i.e. an induction furnace) for 150000 metric tons per year and start manufacturing castings and billets which would help the company fulfill its rolling requirements for in-house production. Currently approximately 70�75 per cent of the billets required by GCL were being purchased from the marketplace (see Exhibit 7). However a new induction furnace with a 30-metric-ton capacity would cost $3 million. As well infrastructure such as cranes shades accessories and water pipes would cost an additional $3�3.5 million for a total cost of $6.5 million. In addition the power required for this project would have to be purchased from private companies at a rate of $0.10 per unit compared to $0.14 per unit from the state electricity board. The main reason for GCL to consider increasing the capacity for billets was because the continuous casting process required the billets to go to rolling mills on a continuous basis. Increasing capacity would save the cost of reheating the billets which was incurred for non-continuous or batch processes. The cost of reheating a billet for rolling was $11 per metric ton. Currently because most billets were purchased from the marketplace GCL had to incur a reheating cost which increased operation costs and reduced profit margins. However an investment of $6.5 million for a company with a net income of $0.23�0.62 million seemed daunting (see Exhibits 4 and 5). To pursue this first option GCL would have to take out a loan at an interest rate of 9�10 per cent. GCL also had to consider that it was not the only mini-mill interested in this option. Its competitors also had expansion plans which increased the risk of the investment not yielding the required return for GCL. In addition with increasing demand for steel there was a possibility that prices of steel scrap would increase further leading to reduced margins. If GCL wanted to reap the entire benefit of this project it would have to set up its own power plant which would lead to an additional cost of approximately $7.70 million. Option 2 was for GCL to integrate backward into casting and billets as well as set up its own power plant. The total cost would be approximately $14.2 million (calculated as $6.5 million for the furnace plus $7.70 million for the power plant). Although this option would eventually reduce power costs from $0.10 per unit to $0.05 per unit the initial investment was significant (see Exhibit 8). Owning a power plant would also increase use of the existing steel-melting induction furnace which was currently running at 33 per cent of capacity. This would certainly increase production in the induction furnace threefold.Option 3 was to first set up only the power plant and then increase the use of the induction furnace from 33 per cent to 99 per cent of capacity. Backward integration could then be done a couple of years later. As a fourth option Mohit wondered if he should maintain the status quo and stabilize the production of the new product�the rolls�which had been added recently as he rationalized: Rolls as a product seems promising because five out of the seven rolls producing mills in India are on the verge of bankruptcy leaving room for other mini-mills to fulfill the unmet demand of rolls. Rolls are a high margin product at 15�20 per cent margins but involve a technical process. They have a limited growth potential as they are used in rolling mills which makes rolls a very slow-moving product. Given the bankruptcy of the five mills that produced rolls there is room to grow in this product segment.Mohit had only one week left to prepare for the board meeting. He wondered which option the company�s resources should be directed toward in order to give GCL a competitive edge for the next decade.Exhibit 1: Steel production in IndiaSource: �Steel Manufacturing Companies in India� India Brand Equity Foundation accessed October 18 2018 www.ibef.org/industry/steel/showcase.Exhibit 2a: Steel Manufacturing Process at Integrated Steel PlantNote: TMT = thermomechanically treated.Source: Company files.Exhibit 2b: Steel Manufacturing Process at Grace Castings Ltd.Note: TMT = thermomechanically treatedSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: BALANCE SHEET OF Grace Castings Ltd.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2019 CEIBS (China Europe International Business School)	Version: 2019-07-26Between 1998 and 2018 JD.com Inc. (JD.com) transformed from a compact disc (CD)-burner shop into a technology-driven group of service companies and China�s largest retailer by revenue (US$55.7 billion). Headquartered in Beijing and listed on NASDAQ JD.com was a Fortune Global 500 company and the third-largest Internet company in the world by revenue. It had also been diversifying: for instance in 2017 it turned its core competency�smart supply-chain management and logistics�into a profit-making business JD Logistics serving various industries. JD.com�s global research hub in Silicon Valley with about 12000 engineers and researchers drove research and development (R&D) on machine learning cloud computing big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance both the online and offline shopping experience. In 2011 and 2012 the company�s founder chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Qiangdong Liu recruited several chief officers (COs) to strengthen JD.com�s internal management in order to prepare for rapid growth to start in 2014. Yu Long was one of the new recruits. She joined in August 2012 as chief human resources officer (CHO) and general counsel. The staff increased from nearly 30000 employees in 2012 to nearly 180000 employees in 2018. Over these six years Long launched various initiatives to strengthen the human resources (HR) team and improve its practices including the annual talent review and several talent-development programs. She reorganized the HR team and was involved in designing management mechanisms to match the rapid growth and restructuring of JD.com. In 2018 JD.com aimed at developing proprietary technologies to transform into an �intelligent� conglomerate. The company aspired to revolutionize retail in China and other countries and to diversify into other sectors. To prepare for this JD.com had already conceptualized and tested several new organization models that demanded a new mindset of its management and staff. Long thought about what her team could do more or differently in developing talent to support JD.com�s next phase of technology-driven growth. Rapid Growth (up to 2017)After Liu founded JD.com and closed all his brick-and-mortar stores in 2004 he focused on online retailing. Starting in 2007 with the aim of enhancing customer experience by offering speedy reliable and pleasant delivery services Liu obtained a series of private equity investments to build the company�s own logistics centres and to employ its own warehouse and delivery staff. Between 2010 and 2012 JD.com�s headcount quickly grew from several thousand to nearly 30000 66 per cent of which were warehouse and delivery staff. In 2012 the company was already China�s biggest online retailer with various brand partners. Liu set the theme for 2013 as �Xiu Yang Sheng Xi� a Chinese idiom that meant �taking a rest to improve in order to revitalize.� In October 2013 the recently acquired finance business became an independent business group (BG) JD Finance. Being specialized JD Finance took strategic guidelines from JD.com but remained autonomous in operations. In March 2014 JD.com formed a strategic alliance with Tencent Holdings Limited to gain access to the latter�s WeChat social groups. In April 2014 the e-commerce business became the business group JD Mall held by JD.com (the Group) (see Exhibit 1). The COs stayed with JD.com at the JD Group level. In May 2014 JD.com Inc. was listed on NASDAQ to obtain funding for further growth. In 2015 JD Mall was reorganized into four business units (BUs) according to the major product categories: 3C (computers telecommunications and consumer electronics); Home Appliances; FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods); and Apparel & Home Furnishings. It launched the New Path BU to provide consulting services to small retailers and a Silicon Valley R&D centre was established to redefine customer experience through cutting-edge technologies. In 2016 it added a Fresh Food BU and in 2017 it branched out the Fashion BU from Apparel & Home Furnishings. In 2017 the logistics cost centre became a separate business group JD Logistics which had undertaken research on smart fulfillment capabilities such as drone and autonomous-vehicle delivery as well as automated warehouse technologies. JD Logistics had built the technologically advanced infrastructure of �Asia No. 1� smart fulfillment centres including a nationwide network of about 500 warehouses with a total of 11.6 million square metres as well as temperature-controlled supply chain facilities for temperature-sensitive merchandise. Its delivery service covered 99 per cent of the population in China. JD Logistics was able to deliver orders from within six hours to the next day depending on the location in China and this set the industry benchmark. In 2017 JD.com�s net revenues reached �362.3 billion a 40 per cent increase over 2016 (compared to �41.4 billion in 2012) and its non-GAAP net income increased 140 per cent over the previous year. Its core business JD Mall achieved a gross merchandise volume (GMV)�total sales value for merchandise�of �1300 billion (compared to �86.9 billion in 2012) which was a multiple of 130000 of the GMV in the year of foundation in 2004 thereby achieving a compound annual growth rate of about 150 per cent. The company served 292.5 million active customers in China in 2017 (compared to 29.3 million in 2012). management challenges (UP TO 2017)Liu brought in new COs from local industry leaders or foreign multinational companies (MNCs) in 2011 and 2012. Long having work experience in foreign MNCs discovered that the company�s HR problems were interrelated. In her first year (fall 2012 to fall 2013) she completed culture consolidation and talent review projects while integrating into the top management team. In mid-2013 Liu travelled to the United States to take a half-year �study break.� Just before he left the talent review initiated by Long was completed resulting in a pool of identified high-potential talent and successor pipelines. Liu said to the top management team �The talent review gave me confidence to leave the business in your hands.� When Liu returned executives could feel the change of his mindset and leadership style. He became more open-minded and tolerant and showed respect to hierarchy and decision-making processes. In 2014 Liu no longer attended the entire management meeting or gave instructions on the e-commerce operations every morning. He attended the daily group-level top management meeting to listen to executives� reports for 20 minutes only then left the CEO of JD Mall to run the rest of the operational meeting. To speed up decision-making JD.com implemented the ABC approval process. An employee C needed to obtain approval from only two levels up�from the employee�s supervisor B and that supervisor�s supervisor A. Senior vice-president (VP) Yan Xiaobing commented �[Liu] used to micro-manage us. Restraining himself from interfering with us needed courage.�After the 2013 year of �rest to improve in order to revitalize� Liu believed that JD.com needed to innovate and to mitigate the risk of the top management team operating further and further away from customers as JD.com grew. Liu set the theme of 2015 as �let the front line make decisions.� At the strategic meeting held at the end of 2015 Liu said to the executives �From now on I want you to take charge. My primary role is to nurture leaders.� Liu set the theme of 2016 as �find the boundary through delegation empowerment and activation.� He also realized that different businesses had different goals growth paces and resource requirements. Such variance demanded different employee capabilities and incentives. All of these management issues called for the support of the HR team.Sophistication of HR management (2012�2017)Long grouped the interrelated HR problems under the solution of culture talent and organization. She believed that culture would sustain the business talent would execute strategies and organization would win in the future. After completing the culture consolidation and talent review in 2013 she started on other improvement projects in accordance with her five-year strategic plan set in late 2012. Long remarked To promote strategic HR management the first step is to get involved in strategic business planning. I take the lead to participate in those strategy meetings. From the HR perspective we need to understand the CEO�s management concepts and to diffuse them into the organization.Being one of the few female COs Long saw herself as using her communication skills to act as either a �lubricant� or an �adhesive� within the top management team.Talent DevelopmentRegarding talent development Liu expressed Our successes are attributable to our team a very strong team. That�s why I scout around for the best people. We emphasize potential. An important element of potential is the sharing of our corporate values.As JD.com diversified its complexity demanded versatile talent who could manage various product categories or even business groups.Anticipative Talent Reserve JD.com started a management trainee program in 2007 taking in only a few people in each of the first two years. It then gradually increased the number of annual intakes. In the beginning Liu personally mentored trainees and regularly had lunch with them to discuss their lives and careers. In 2012 when the annual intake number was close to 100 the respective department heads took over the coaching role. Still Liu wrote encouraging emails to the trainees. The HR team also ran special training programs for the trainees and set aside a budget for their activities. Each trainee went through a three-year program which included military training initial job rotations and one-year job assignments. With their supervisor�s approval trainees could attend morning management meetings to observe how the executives operated. By 2017 JD.com had admitted a total of 510 trainees. Among them 118 people became JD.com managers by about the age of 30�for example Rui Yu who joined the program in its second year with Liu as his mentor became a regional director within five years of completing the program and later became JD.com�s youngest internally groomed VP. To support the internationalization strategy Long launched an international management trainee program in October 2013 recruiting MBA graduates from top schools in the United States who also had three to five years of prior working experience. In the first year Long took her HR team members to six schools and recruited six candidates to go through a one-year job rotation program. Liu maintained regular idea exchanges with these international management trainees. As a result the trainee team from the first year (2015) took only 102 days to launch the JD Worldwide cross-border e-commerce platform which gave Chinese consumers access to imported goods. Long also launched an internship program recruiting high school students worldwide. These interns spent the first week learning JD.com�s operations and then had nine weeks of practice. The HR team monitored their progress and selected the best students to participate in interviews for the respective management trainee programs.Internal Talent Pool In the first half of 2013 among 700 managers and directors assessed during the talent review 198 high-potential individuals were identified using the three-by-three matrix (see Exhibit 2). Such identification did not immediately lead to salary increases or promotions but the HR team and the newly established JD University designed a series of leadership programs specifically for them. In that year based on performance 30 per cent of those identified as high-potential talent received a job promotion (compared to 25 per cent of the rest of the staff). Liu declared �By 2018 at least 80 per cent of the directors and executives must be from internal promotion.� JD.com identified high-potential talent every year and the HR team monitored their development. For instance in 2014 among 1650 managers and directors assessed about 400 were identified as high-potential. Long added Not only did the talent review help us develop a common managerial language but it also let the management team agree on the talent selection criteria and formed the talent development consciousness. JD University also started building a systematic educational system to support managerial and professional staff in progressing in their careers within JD.com. Reorganization of the HR Team The HR team members adapted to JD.com�s growth and restructuring by reorganizing themselves. Before JD.com became a group of companies there were already HR business partners (BPs) allocated to the businesses and they performed all HR duties. In 2015 after JD Mall branched out the HR team was split into Group HR and JD Mall HR. The HR VP of JD Mall directly reported to the CEO of JD Mall and indirectly reported to Group CHO Long. In 2016 the Shared Service Centre (SSC) was established at the Group headquarters. The SSC and the e-HR information system established in 2013 formed the back office to support all the BGs. In 2017 to enhance efficiency and competency the Group HR and JD Mall HR shared the Centre of Excellence/Expertise (COE) which emerged to take over the role of setting HR policies and practices from the HR BPs. Since its corporation in 2013 JD Finance had its own HR head which led to a dedicated team of HR BPs and continued to have its own COE. The specific purpose of each of the three layers of the HR team became clear (see Exhibit 3). JD.com formed a management committee for making strategic HR decisions headed by Group CHO Long (see Exhibit 4). The HR VP of JD Mall and the HR head of JD Finance indirectly reported to Long. After the branching out of JD Logistics its HR VP who directly reported to its CEO and indirectly reported to Long also joined the committee. Head of Organizational Development Qian Mao commented On the one hand the changes of the HR teams followed the changes of JD.com. On the other hand the reorganization of the HR team stemmed from the foresight and planning of how to better manage HR professionals. We need to consider the member composition and team dynamics and to reposition the team as often as needed.Management MechanismTo make the theme of the year 2016 �find the boundary through delegation empowerment and activation� come alive JD.com created and implemented a new management mechanism (see Exhibit 5). Delegation Long knew that clarifying authority between the Group parent company and the BGs or BUs and making decision-making processes transparent and simple would be essential (see Exhibit 6). When the Group level passed the decision-making power to the BGs and BUs there were three management aspects: finance people and business. In terms of finance the Group parent company controlled the overall budget while each BG or BU set its own profitability target and had the autonomy to use the approved budget. In terms of people the Group parent company handled HR decisions regarding executives while each BG or BU made decisions regarding directors and below. For instance each BU could decide the salary range of a job rank. In terms of business the Group parent company set the overall strategy mitigated risks and allocated cross-BG resources while each BG or BU set its own business strategy allocated its own resources and managed daily operations. Mao reflected At the beginning people were testing the boundary. When we did a review in end-2016 we found out that some people grasped the real meaning of delegation while others were still not good at [resource] allocation. In 2017 we adjusted the degree of delegation by tracking data to monitor how they used resources. For BG/BUs that showed good use of resources we gave them more autonomy.In August 2017 to help the managers find the performance boundary JD.com offered 14 management principles of organizational efficiency to do the following (see Exhibit 2):Affirm the use of corporate values as the most important performance evaluation criterion�the principle of �Corporate values first capabilities second.�Build an internal promotion path�the principles of �Backup� and �70 per cent 80 per cent.�Refine performance evaluation�the principles of �Three-by-three matrix elimination� and �Ironman triathlon assessment.�Minimize hierarchical levels�the principles of �ABC� and �8150.�Improve management quality�the principles of �One taking two� �No no no� �24 hours� and �Meeting 333.� Strengthen cross-department communication�the principles of �Two subordinate support two job rotations� �Internal communication four� and �Open five.�Empowerment There were four ways to enhance the management capability of the BGs and BUs and to strengthen the expertise of HR BPs: mechanisms organization practice and professionalism. JD.com had developed various mechanisms to support its increasingly complex operations. For instance the �internal transfer� mechanism stated clearly the value of internal resources to facilitate transactions among departments. The �internal communication� mechanism required vice presidents and above to attend a weekend business meeting once a month. The �alert-and-improve� mechanism showed the people in charge their business results and reminded them to improve accordingly. Organization-wise JD.com dedicated experts in functions such as HR finance and R&D to support the BGs and BUs. Practice referred to the support given by the headquarters and BGs to new BUs. When the scale of a new business such as Fresh Food was small the Group and the BGs acted as coaches to help it make important decisions or launch big initiatives. Once the business matured the BU became autonomous. The key of professionalism was the sharing of information through the availability of information systems and analytical tools as well as through regular formal and informal communications across departments. Activation Activation was intended to motivate and energize employees in an effective managerial environment that had been created through delegation and empowerment.the Future (2018 onwards)In 2017 Liu announced that JD.com would transform into an �intelligent� conglomerate during the next 12 years by making use of the capabilities it had accumulated in the previous 12 years. Its global research hub and innovation labs would continue to develop and apply technologies in the areas of smart supply-chain management and logistics machine learning cloud computing big data and AI. Not only would JD.com diversify to other sectors such as intelligent insurance but it would also aspire to revolutionize retail operations in China and other countries. In 2018 Google LLC (Google) agreed to invest US$550 million in JD.com to explore joint development of retail solutions for expansion into Southeast Asian North American and European markets. In return Google acquired a stake of JD.com. Meanwhile after the successful launch of the first JD X-Mart unmanned store in Beijing JD.com continued to open more unmanned stores across China and launched its first international unmanned store in Indonesia. In August 2018 it launched a new blockchain open platform for enterprises building on multiple underlying technologies. Liu knew that the reasons for JD.com�s rapid growth in the past might not be its competitive advantages in the future. Rather updating business models developing proprietary technologies establishing sound and relevant management systems and enhancing organizational efficiencies would be crucial. To achieve this JD.com would need to use innovative ways to reorganize its people. JD.com would not only need talent with relevant competencies but also talent with the right mindset to match Liu�s new vision. New Organization ModelsFacing this huge transformation Liu believed that the organization should be more flexible and agile; he thought of �building blocks� with the idea that the organization should transform into many modules that could be assembled differently to satisfy external or internal customers. JD.com came up with the following three business models in the spirit of �flexibility and agility.�Customer-Oriented �Net�This model consisted of three parts�terrace structure task marketplace and net relation (see Exhibit 7). The keys of terrace structure were customer orientation and new division of labour. The idea was to rearrange employees into three layers of role�front line middle ground and back office. The front line aimed at quickly responding to customers and satisfying customers� individual needs. The middle ground aimed at developing expertise and excellence to satisfy customers� common needs. The back office aimed at building an infrastructure to offer shared services. In the second half of 2017 JD.com finished the pilot of the terrace structure at JD Mall�s R&D department. Its front-line employees then focused on interacting with internal customers. Its middle-ground employees focused on renewing technologies to support the front line in offering customers more open technological solutions. The back-office employees focused on maintaining the platform infrastructure. The �task marketplace� aimed to solve problems of internal resource allocation. Front-line staff would specify each customer request as a job then the job would be translated into a set of tasks that called for the formation of cross-department task teams. Each team�s performance would be evaluated. Because of the task teams employees no longer reported to their supervisors only but also to their team leaders. This would form net relations and lead to net appraisals. The net relations would have two levels: within the organization and with external parties such as customers brand partners and suppliers. To enable net appraisal JD.com would use the e-HR information system to allow each party in the nets to give feedback to every employee. In the beginning of 2018 JD.com finished the pilot of the net model at JD Mall�s R&D department and other functional departments. JD.com planned to roll out this model to the rest of the organization. �Diamond�At the end of 2012 when Long had devised her five-year HR strategic plan she thought about introducing the concept of a �performance contract.� In 2017 Long refined this thought and proposed the �diamond� model to use corporate values and a psychological contract as the �glue� to strongly hold people together (see Exhibit 8). The model aimed to use a psychological contract rather than just a legal contract as before to regulate employees. It was also designed to use corporate values rather than individual values to guide employees� judgments and behaviours. The diamond had two elements: Three cultural pillars�corporate culture leadership culture and team culture. Two Ts: the first T was what an employee could offer�breadth and depth of capabilities; the inverse T was what JD.com could offer�platform value and developmental space.The diamond model showed that JD.com aimed to develop its workforce to share the same characteristics of a diamond�pure transparent tenacious and long-lasting.Interdependent �Bamboo Grove� This model was designed to connect the organization�s management and staff with its customers brand partners and suppliers in order to integrate internal and external resources and empower external parties as in a bamboo grove ecosystem (see Exhibit 9). Such an ecosystem�which would be built by openness co-creation and empowerment�symbolized the interdependence of all parties. To demonstrate this concept the HR team launched TELink (Talent Eco Link) in 2017 to extend talent development beyond JD.com. It established a cross-organization job-rotation mechanism to allow staff to work in other organizations within the ecosystem.New Talent WarBecause of Liu�s new vision JD.com needed more talent who were savvy regarding the relevant breakthrough technologies and who could also work internationally. By the end of 2017 the HR team had already given training to 86 per cent of its managerial staff and 60 per cent of its professional and technical staff. But such internal training would not be enough for the new competencies required. For example in 2010 Amazon started developing and adopting intelligence technologies to enhance shopping experiences and to improve big-data-driven analytics consumer targeting and inventory management. In October 2017 it opened a new research centre the fourth in Germany to focus on AI. Amazon had not only developed new talents in this emerging field but had also preluded a war for these talents. JD.com�s head of Talent Development Dongni Ji remarked We are very concerned about anticipating and preparing for our talent requirements. With our internationalization we have stringent requirements for management skills business knowledge and cross-culture interpersonal skills. With our new technology-driven vision we have to intensively develop new core competencies. We face the challenge of how to identify and recruit this new breed of talents [in China and other countries]. We also need to create an echelon for them.The new corporate vision and organization models would also impact existing management and staff. They would need to have a new mindset�to be more flexible and agile. What options would Long have regarding talent management to meet these new organizational needs?

Ltd.âs German subsidiary presented a strategic co-operation proposal to Hisenseâs headquarters. However after six months of heated debate Hisenseâs decision makers still found it difficult to decide whether they should establish a strategic alliance with the German high-end television (TV) maker Loewe AG (Loewe). Loewe a 90-year-old company with a good reputation was suffering severe financial distress and preparing to file for bankruptcy protection. Loewe thus urgently needed both a new investor and a technology infusion to ease its huge financial pressure and help restructure its TV business. In turn Hisense despite being the worldâs fourth-largest TV producer wanted to improve its brand reputation and believed an association with Loewe could help. Both companies would gain access to the otherâs primary distribution networks. No matter the form of involvement Hisense would be risking significant financial losses if Loewe went bankrupt or continued to have unsatisfactory performance. LOEWE: A GERMAN luxury tv brand Loewe Technologies GmbH (Loewe) was a German high-end TV and entertainment system producer famous in Europe for its modern designs sleek user interfaces and high quality. Since it first invented and launched colour TVs in Germany Loewe had kept the promise of âMade in Germanyâ a business philosophy that was popular and welcomed by the European market. Despite Loeweâs high consumer recognition its luxury-brand positioning limited its product range which was only targeted at high-end customer needs. However fierce market competition and the diversification of customer needs forced TV producers to be both cost-effective and able to respond quickly to technological changes; otherwise they would face bankruptcy. As a result Asian producers had gradually dominated the TV industry. They were more cost-effective than other producers in various aspects of large-scale production in part due to their lower research and development (R&D) costs per product line and to their synergies in a wide range of products. Loeweâs flat-screen TVs even without the most advanced technologies and the best hardware configurations sold for as much as â¬5000 (US$6650) each. This led Loewe to struggle for survival in such a highly competitive industry. Loewe had suffered heavy losses for years due to its Asian competitors. Loeweâs sales revenue dropped from â¬374 million ($508 million) in 2008 to â¬250 million ($340 million) in 2012 (see Exhibit 1). In the first six months of 2013 Loeweâs sales worsened. Its revenue was â¬76.5 million ($104 million) a decline of 39 per cent versus the previous year and net losses rose to â¬26.7 million ($36 billion) for the period. If Loewe failed to make significant business adjustments it would go bankrupt. The Ideal New Investor for LoeweInitially the strategy for Loewe had been to negotiate with potential investors to ease its financial distress. Moreover Loewe hoped this new investor could also help restructure its TV business and strengthen its TVsâ competitiveness. In addition Loewe wanted to expand its business to other promising markets. However Loewe soon learned that no investor option could specifically meet all of its requirements and expectations.Among the potential investors who could help Loewe restructure and strengthen its TV business might be the main global TV producers. By 2008 the global TV market was dominated by Chinese Japanese and Korean producers. With the increasing competition between TV producers the market structure soon changed. By 2013 Chinese and Korean producers dominated because many Japanese TV producers had lost their competitive advantage and had withdrawn from the TV market (often by divesting their TV business). Thus it was highly unlikely that a Japanese TV producer would purchase a German TV producer. There were still Korean and Chinese TV producers potentially available. In the European high-end TV market Loeweâs market share prior to 2012 ranked second behind only Samsung. As a world-famous TV brand in its own right Samsung arguably did not need another brand label and did not necessarily want to help a competitor. LG another famous Korean brand was in the same situation as Samsung.  The many Chinese TV producers such as Haier Changhong Konka and Skyworth undertook no TV manufacturing in Europe and exported few products from China to Europe. Therefore the possibility of them acquiring Loewe seemed low. Only two Chinese TV producers TCL and Hisense adopted localization strategies and might have the capabilities and interest to purchase Loewe. In the case of TCL in 2004 it acquired the French TV producer Thomson but subsequently encountered unanticipated integration difficulties. Therefore it seemed unlikely that TCL would quickly commit to purchase a German TV brand. Hisenseâs Possible Role: Technical SupportHisense certainly had the potential ability to provide technical support to help Loewe strengthen the competitiveness of its TVs. In Hisenseâs view the design and development of a new top-class product should be the priority for Loewe. Only if newly designed products attracted more consumers would Loewe be able to materially increase its sales. It was also difficult for Loewe to decide whether it should establish strategic co-operation with Hisense. If Loewe decided to co-operate with Hisense for technical support Loewe still needed to find another new investor within a short period of time and ensure that this new investor would support its restructuring proposal and the long-term strategic co-operation with Hisense. Hisense: A Chinese cost-effective TV BRANDHisense was founded in 1969 in Qingdao China. It was a leading global company producing consumer electronics household appliances information technology equipment and mobile communication devices with 69000 employees worldwide. Hisense was best-known for its smart TVs and had been the Chinese flat-screen-TV champion since 2004. After gradually accumulating technological capability international experience and overseas distribution channel resources Hisense began in 2007 to adopt its own brand internationalization strategy and give priority to overseas market expansion. The effect of this strategy was obvious: by 2013 Hisense had become the worldâs fourth-largest TV producer.Though Hisense had a large sales volume it was not yet a globally prominent brand. For example Hisense had a relatively small market share in Europe and North America. Thus if Hisense wanted to become a truly global brand it needed to further improve its market share in these two regions.To increase its limited European market share Hisense could expand and strengthen co-operation with local distribution channels. In addition co-operation with well-known European producers such as Loewe could potentially help Hisense expand its brand awareness and enhance its European sales volume. If Hisense was to establish some form of strategic co-operation with Loewe it would have to be based on comprehensive consideration of four aspects: market demand brand demand technology demand and channel demand.Market DemandIn 2004 Hisense began to expand in Europe choosing Germany France Italy Britain and Spain as its focal markets. It soon encountered great challenges such as the complexity of productsâ design and development the lack of local business experience and professional talent and cultural and language barriers. Regarding product design and development for example despite their geographic proximity to each other these five European countries differed greatly in their TV formats certification standards and TVsâ local intelligent applications. If Hisense wanted to expand its TV business there it would have to adjust its products to match various local technical standards and meet different consumer usage preferences on a country-by-country basis. These high market-entry barriers presented great difficulties for Hisense.Despite these difficulties Hisense was making strong efforts to expand there. David He Hisenseâs European sales director said:We have a lot of opportunities in Europe and this market is Hisenseâs blue ocean.â Why? Currently only a few Asian TV brands are active the European TV market. Japanese brands have exited or are preparing to exit this market. And except for Hisense and TCL other Chinese TV producers who are very competitive in China and many other overseas markets have not expanded their businesses in Europe yet. European TV brands such as Loewe and Metz [Metz Consumer Electronics GmbH] with both long histories and good reputations only focus their TV businesses on the high-end market segment. Although the number of TV producers is declining European consumers still need to buy TVs and it is highly unlikely that they would want to select TVs only between the Samsung [Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.] and LG [LG Corporation] brands. Therefore as long as we can overcome the initial entry barriers and difficulties we are confident we can achieve good sales performance in the future. In contrast the Chinese market has too many brands competing there. Almost every day we are forced to face âbarbaricâ price wars and only have âpaper-thin profit margins.â Our domestic TV market is really a âred ocean.âIf Hisense and Loewe could establish strategic co-operation Loewe could provide Hisense its European business experience and a distribution network in the high-end TV market (see Exhibit 2). In turn Hisense could offer Loewe marketing experience in selling TVs in Asia and access to the Asian market.Brand DemandThough Hisenseâs brand was famous in China most European consumers had never heard of it. When European consumers selected traditional home appliances they were very unwilling to accept products of little-known brands. However to build a famous brand the company needed unremitting brand construction efforts for a long time. Then the brand could gradually gain recognition by consumers. Hisense had adopted two ways of improving its brand reputation: one was to strengthen its own brand building and the other was to establish strategic co-operative relationships with well-known European companies.First Hisense actively attended global consumer electronics tradeshows and sponsored popular sporting events. The tradeshows with a significant impact provided Hisense with opportunities to meet key retailers buyers and the media. These stakeholders could help Hisense expand in Europe and in other new locations. Sponsoring sporting events could enable Hisenseâs brand to become familiar to more people. Indeed these brand construction efforts helped Hisense expand its brand influence.Second Hisense also actively looked for technical co-operation with many well-established European companies. Though such partners might present high requirements such as product models and production standards Hisense would gain the benefits of co-brand advertising. If Hisense was to establish a strategic co-operative relationship with Loewe for example it might be able to âstand on the shoulders of a giantâ and be more easily accepted by European consumers and distribution channels.Technology DemandIn 2007 Hisense founded a European R&D centre in the Netherlands in order to gain a better understanding of European consumersâ needs and be able to provide them with the most suitable products. The main task of this R&D centre was to help Hisenseâs China-based R&D centre collect information on product features technical requirements consumer usage habits certification standards and so on. Based on this information Hisenseâs domestic R&D centre could then design new products or make functional adjustments to the existing ones to cater to the European marketâs needs. With sufficient technological and marketing experience in Europe Hisense would then be able to provide TVs that could meet local preferences.Among global TV producers Hisense had its own advanced panel-display technologies and was a leader in drafting international light-emitting diode (LED) backlight standards. Moreover Hisense held a lead in Internet and intelligent application technologies and had launched the first personal smart TV globally. Hisense also excelled at hardware design and had developed and built Chinaâs first mass liquid crystal display (LCD) module production line. If Hisense was to apply its own advanced display technologies to Loeweâs products and help Loewe design its TVsâ hardware it would help Loewe increase its TVsâ competitiveness. Furthermore by co-operating with Loewe Hisense could expand the application range of its TV technologies.Channel DemandThe traditional TV distribution channels mainly included appliance retail chains supermarkets and independent retailers. With the development of the Internet more and more consumers had begun to shop online. Thus most distributors had gradually developed their online business. As a result TV producers had to arrange and balance product categories and pricing not only between different distribution channels but also between each distribution channelâs online and offline sales. Moreover due to differentiated consumer shopping habits and behaviour the business scale proportions of channel types and the proportion of online and offline sales also differed greatly in each European country. This made it quite difficult for TV producers to manage such a complicated distribution network across countries. For example for each of Hisenseâs TV products which distribution channels were suitable and willing to sell it? How should Hisense price it for the different distribution channels? Should this product be sold online or offline or both? If both should the prices of the same TV product be the same or different? It was quite hard to arrange its distribution channels because TV producers first needed to possess in-depth knowledge of distribution channels and consumer consumption characteristics. They also needed to adopt different co-operation strategies with various types of distribution channels in different countries. They further needed to arrange and coordinate product prices product models time to market logistics and after-sales services in different European countries. All these issues were very difficult and time-consuming for Hisense to learn and adapt to. If Loewe could provide relevant experience to Hisense Hisense would save time and avoid at least some missteps.Conflicting Views from Hisense: Worthwhile or Not? Hisenseâs German subsidiary presented the co-operation proposal to Hisenseâs headquarters in early January 2013. This proposal was discussed at length and not approved. Hisenseâs decision makers had conflicting viewpoints in terms of Loeweâs sales potential difficulties in designing and developing Loeweâs new TVs the two partiesâ strength in terms of resources and management Hisenseâs potential gains and Loeweâs potential bankruptcy risk. Detailed discussion followed.Loeweâs Sales VolumeLoewe was positioned as a luxury TV brand with many people marvelling at its unique designs and quality. However only a few consumers could afford its TVs at such high prices. Because of its low unit sales volume Loewe had been slower to update its TV technologies than other mass TV producers. Loeweâs product competitiveness had thus declined. In the TV industry sales volume was a very important indicator of a producerâs survival. Youhai Yu Hisenseâs former European general manager said:Loewe usually just sells hundreds of thousands of TVs globally each year while Hisense sells tens of millions of TVs. Therefore Hisense has obvious competitive superiority over Loewe in terms of bargaining power over suppliers production efficiency ability to spread R&D expenses over products and other perspectives. Scale is a magic weapon for winning in the TV industry. The strengths and weaknesses of Loewe according to Yu were as follows: One Loewe TV creates much more profit than one Hisense TV. Profits from the co-operation with Loewe will better support Hisenseâs expansion in Europe.However Loeweâs scale is too small and its products are quite different from ours. This will cause us a lot of trouble. For example the guaranteed period for our TV parts is five years but Loewe requires a 10-year guarantee. Given Loeweâs requirements we would have to obtain specialized procurement from our global suppliers for its TV parts. This procurement quantity is so small that only a subset of our global suppliers would be willing to accept such a small order.Difficulties in Designing and Developing Loeweâs New TVsIf Hisense and Loewe decided to jointly design Loeweâs new products they might encounter at least two major challenges: product development time and complex product development co-ordination. If they decided to combine the two companiesâ R&D advantages Loewe would be primarily responsible for software design and Hisense for hardware design. However Loeweâs new product development required a long time. It was unknown whether new products would be successful. To launch new TVs rapidly Loewe and Hisense would need to quicken their development speed. However the two companies had different R&D management principles and processes and would need time to adapt to each other. David He also Hisenseâs leader for strategic co-operation in addition to his European sales director role said:If we want to jointly develop Loeweâs new products we would have to coordinate between Hisenseâs R&D partners in China the Netherlands and the United States Hisenseâs Chinese and German R&D centres and Loeweâs headquarters in Germany and subsidiary in China. You can imagine how complicated the coordination of this project would be as hundreds of engineers from different companies would take part. Another problem is that you cannot ensure that everyone has enough initiative to undertake this project. The most difficult thing is that Loewe still requires a very high standard for all its new products though it is encountering severe difficulties. One supporting argument according to He was that: Hisense has established many strategic co-operative relationships with various global leading high-tech companies and has also founded several overseas R&D centres. Therefore we need to further optimize our global R&D efficiency and accumulate more international R&D co-operation experience. Strategic co-operation with Loewe would be a good opportunity to improve ourselves.One opposing argument according to Xiaofeng Lin Hisenseâs R&D director was that: Every companyâs R&D resources are limited. We export our products to more than 130 countries and regions every year. Because each has its specific requirements for our products our R&D staff have to make adjustments according to different requirements. Moreover our R&D staff also need to develop new technologies and new products for our global market. Therefore considering our limited R&D resources our R&D staff should focus more on our own products.Analysis of the Two Companiesâ Resource and Management Superiority Loeweâs strengths were embodied in its luxury brand strict quality-control system prestigious design capabilities well-established distribution network and marketing experience in selling TVs in the high-end TV market. Comparatively Hisenseâs strengths were embodied in its high R&D efficiency and capacity innovative display and intelligent application technologies large-scale procurement and manufacturing cost control system and marketing experience in selling TVs in highly competitive markets. If Loewe and Hisense could establish strategic co-operation Hisense would help Loewe design its TVsâ hardware and provide Loewe with marketing experience in Asia; in turn Loewe would provide Hisense with Loeweâs European marketing experience in the high-end TV market and Loeweâs distribution network. The strengths and weaknesses of Loewe according to Lan Lin Hisenseâs vice president were as follows:Though we have been striving to improve our brand image our top-class products can only be accepted by consumers who are willing to purchase at medium prices. We still lack sufficient marketing experience and available distribution channels in the European high-end TV market. If we co-operate with Loewe distribution channels and consumers will accept our products at higher prices more easily. The advertising effect of this co-operation will be very helpful for us to improve our brand reputation and expand our business in the high-end TV market.However Loewe is a luxury TV brand. Because of its long history consumers will pay a premium for its products. Because Loewe is unique it cannot be imitated or replicated by other TV competitors. It is currently unrealistic for Hisense to position itself as a high-end TV brand and we need to improve our brand image step-by-step. If we use Loeweâs marketing experience and distribution network and then think that we can sell Hisenseâs same products at higher prices in Europe it will be a big strategic mistake. Enhancing our brand image will take a long time.Hisenseâs Potential GainsBy 2013 Hisense had been expanding in Europe for nine years. Before considering the strategic co-operation with Loewe Hisense had established not only its European headquarters in Germany but also a European R&D centre and several subsidiaries in many main consumption regions in Europe. Hisenseâs Czech TV factory was also under construction and planning to manufacture TVs in 2015. Therefore the first step of Hisenseâs strategic approach to Europe was nearly complete. Hisenseâs next step was to improve its European sales volume and its brand reputation. Hisenseâs decision makers who supported the co-operation with Loewe said that: It can help us enhance our brand reputation in Europe. When people talk about Loewe Hisense will be mentioned as well. Moreover Loewe can help us extend our distribution network in the European high-end TV market and provide us with the relevant marketing experience. The potential profits from the joint development will be satisfactory. We really need to accumulate international R&D co-operation experience. Product design co-operation with Loewe is a good opportunity.Hisenseâs decision makers who objected to the co-operation with Loewe said that:Firstly co-operation with Loewe will increase the pressure on Hisenseâs R&D system and procurement system. Secondly this joint development project needs a long period of time. Thirdly it is uncertain whether this project will be successful and how much Hisense can benefit from this co-operation. Hisense will deviate from its consistent business philosophy of steady management if co-operating with Loewe.Loeweâs Potential Bankruptcy RiskAs Hisense considered the issue of co-operation with Loewe Loewe was on the verge of bankruptcy. It needed to find a new investor and also to make significant adjustments to strengthen the competitiveness of its TV business. However Hisense was not particularly interested in making an equity investment in Loeweâonly in possibly providing Loewe with technical support. It was beyond Hisenseâs control whether Loewe could find a suitable new investor and a feasible restructuring scheme. These issues also played an important role in determining whether Loewe would survive.One positive view at Hisense was that:Loeweâs decline in recent years is caused by its slower response to new technologies and hardware updates especially its hardware updates. The design and development of high-tech hardware is exactly our strength. If we can integrate the two companiesâ complementary R&D capabilities the new products will be very popular and Loewe will survive.A more negative view at Hisense was that:The TV industry is a sunset industry characterized by production overcapacity a slow increase in consumption demand and relatively low profit margins. So I think it is difficult to find some investors who would like to invest in the highly competitive TV industry. Moreover Loeweâs scale of sales is small and Loewe always persists on the promise of âMade in Germany.â Both of these two points deviate from the TV industryâs two general principles of large-scale production and outsourcing manufacturing to lower-cost regions. Thus it will be even more difficult for Loewe to find a new investor let alone find an ideal new investor within a short period of time. If Loewe cannot find the new investor everything is over!Loeweâs New Product PlanningOne objective of any new co-operation would be to jointly design and develop Loeweâs new products. To a large extent these new products would determine whether Loewe would be able to retake its lost market share and survive its bankruptcy crisis. However with regard to Loeweâs future product planning Hisenseâs decision makers held different concerns. One Hisense decision maker said that:It is better for us to help Loewe design a wider TV product range spanning medium-end to high-end products which can subsequently attract more consumers. However if Loewe also provides medium-end products it may compete with part of our higher-end products. This will negatively influence Hisenseâs high-end productsâ sales. This effect should be taken seriously. Another problem would be whether we should provide our best designs to Loewe or keep them for our own use.Another Hisenseâs decision maker said that:If Loewe begins to provide TVs with mid-range hardware configurations in the market because of its luxury brand positioning these products may be even more expensive than Samsungâs products with the highest hardware configurations. In this case I think consumers will prefer to purchase Samsungâs highest-end products than Loeweâs medium-end products. In my opinion it is more reasonable for Loewe to develop only high-end TVs that are as good as or better than Samsungâs highest-end TVs. For the same high-end level of TVs Loewe could sell its high-end TVs at prices much higher than Samsungâs because of Loeweâs brand premium. Consumers will find it relatively easier to accept Loeweâs high-end TVs at the highest prices in the market.  Therefore Loewe is only suitable for selling the best TVs at the highest prices in the high-end market segment. Hisenseâs technical support for Loewe is critical because only by combining Loeweâs traditionally outstanding software designs with Hisenseâs best hardware designs could Loewe then provide TVs that are at least good enough to compete with Samsungâs.For Hisenseâs decision makers it was unclear how to proceed.EXHIBIT 1: KEY FINANCIAL DATA FOR LOEWE AG 2008â2012 (â¬ MILLION)Note: EBIT = earnings before interest and tax; DVD = digital video discSource: Created by authors using data from www.morningstar.com.EXHIBIT 2: lcd tv market in western europe and loeweâs shareNote: LCD TV = liquid crystal display television; â¬ = EUR = European euro; â¬0.76 = US$1 on January 2 2013.

(SATS) Asia�s leading provider of food solutions and gateway services was studying the 2019 Digital Carrier Connectivity report published by the online freight booking platform Freightos. The report compared the digital maturity of the ocean cargo and air cargo industries and found that the ocean carriers generally matured more than their air counterparts. As a crucial logistics industry the air cargo industry transported over 35 per cent of the global trade by value accounting for only 1 per cent of the global volume in 2018. After the 2008 financial crisis demand for air cargo had normalized and a steady annual growth of 4.9 per cent was forecast for the next five years. However the industry faced multiple headwinds. The growing influence of e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) in the logistics industry coupled with the strong supply-chain expertise of vertical integrators such as DHL International GmbH (DHL) United Postal Services Inc. and FedEx Corporation had intensified competition in the industry. Backed by strong financial power and enabled by the latest digital technologies these companies had disrupted the existing air cargo industry which was in dire need of digital transformation.A leading player in the industry SATS had always been ahead of its competition in identifying trends and leveraging opportunities. Its pioneering development of the cargo management system COSYS Intelligent Solutions (COSYS) as early as 2010 was a testament to its strategic foresight capability winning accolades such as CIO magazine�s 2017 CIO 100 Award for its innovative utilization of information technology to create and deliver business value. SATS was also awarded the title of �Best Air Cargo Terminal in Asia� at the 2013 Asian Freight and Supply Chain Awards. In recognition of its innovative use of smart watches for technical ramp operations SATS had also emerged as the winner of the 2018 Ground Handling Conference Innovator Competition organized by the trade association of the world�s airlines the International Air Transport Association (IATA). However the turbulent nature of the air cargo industry would not allow SATS or any other established terminal operator to rest on its laurels. SATS had set its sights on two initiatives to address industry challenges and leverage opportunities: cargo automation and digitalization. The first initiative would require SATS to invest in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) to fully automate its cargo picking and packing operations in order to address the issue of an aging workforce while improving operation efficiency. However the development of robotics technology for the logistics sector was still in its early stages where the possible range of technological applications was wide the risks of technology obsolescence was moderate to high and the demand for high-skilled labour to program operate service and maintain the robotics would pose new challenges. On the other hand the second initiative would allow SATS to build on its prior experience with COSYS implementation to undertake digital transformation to sustain its competitive advantage. However the initial capital investment to re-engineer and integrate operation processes with digital technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) the Internet of things (IoT) and big data would be prohibitive with a relatively long payback period.While both initiatives seemed equally important and urgent for SATS to develop its capabilities for the future Khoo knew that he had to prioritize SATS�s investment and resource allocation.The AIR CARGO INDUSTRYOverview of the Air Cargo Value ChainThe air cargo value chain typically consisted of six major entities: shipper freight forwarder regulatory authority ground handling agent carrier and consignee (see Exhibit 1). The shipper could be an individual or institution that initiated the transport of the goods. At the origin end the freight forwarder was the first party of the logistics services in the supply chain and its primary task was to contract with a cargo airline company or carrier for air delivery of the consignment (i.e. a batch of goods destined for or delivered to someone). After collecting the consignment from the shipper the freight forwarder would deliver the consignment to the airport ground handler which would then load the consignment onto the airplane. At the destination end the airport ground handler would unload the consignment from the airplane and the consignment would be picked up by a local freight forwarder to make the final-mile delivery to the consignee. The freight forwarder�s responsibilities were limited to the land side of the logistics chain.Located on the air side of the chain the ground handling agent would provide warehouses to accept handle prepare and tag cargoes (including mail) upon their receipt from the freight forwarder at the origin end. The ground handler would perform loading unloading sorting and customs declaration of cargo entering and leaving airport and transit operations. It would work with the regulatory authorities to perform screening and customs checks on the moving cargo.Industry Dynamics in SingaporeBy 2019 Singapore�s Changi Airport had been ranked the world�s best airport for seven consecutive years by London-based research firm Skytrax. In 2018 Changi Airport moved 2.15 million metric tons of cargo and 65.63 million passengers. The ground handling services were provided by two key playersSATS and Dnata Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Dnata Singapore). Established in 1972 SATS was a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (SIA) before it was divested from SIA in 2009. Dnata Singapore on the other hand was incorporated as Changi International Airport Services in 1977 and then fully acquired by Dubai-based Dnata Group in 2007. By 2016 SATS dominated Singapore�s ground handling market with approximately 80 per cent share at Changi Airport. It managed close to 45 million passengers and about 133000 flights annually while Dnata Singapore handled three million passengers and 40000 flights. On the state of competition Mark Edwards the former chief executive officer (CEO) of Dnata Singapore remarked in 2016 �I am still struggling to understand the strategy of my competitor which only seems to be about cutting prices even as costs continue to escalate amid headwinds and the manpower shortage.� For a full-service carrier the turnaround cost of operating a 180-seater Boeing 737-800 involved cabin cleaning cargo and baggage handling and refuelling. Such costs had been cut down to between SG$1500 and SG$1600 in 2016 from about SG$2000 a few years earlier. Beyond Singapore competition between SATS and Dnata Singapore remained intense in the global ground handling market. Since 2016 Dnata Singapore had made acquisitions of cargo terminal operators that enabled its entry into the United States Canada and Brazil. A sizable portion (68 per cent) of the company�s US$3.6 billion in revenue in 2018 was attributed to the progress of its international business. The growth Dnata Singapore achieved through acquisition had shifted its strategic relationships with its airline customers.For the past two decades the duo had witnessed new players� attempts to enter Singapore�s ground handling market. In 2005 the Switzerland-based ground handler Swissport International Ltd. entered the market but found its local operation �not of sufficient size to ensure its sound profitability.� It went on to incur losses of up to SG$50 million before exiting four years later. Attracted to the growing aviation market in Singapore and Asia US-headquartered ground handler Aircraft Service International Group (ASIG) arrived in 2011 but only managed to secure its first airline contract with Jetstar Airways Pty. Ltd. in 2014. However ASIG ended the contract due to commercial disagreement before exiting in 2015. The president of Dnata Singapore Gary Chapman attributed ASIG�s swift exit from the country to its wrong strategy of engaging in a price war: �ASIG came thinking it could do the work for half the price. They got it completely wrong. It was crazy.� Chapman highlighted the knock-on effect that the flawed price war strategy had on the expectations of airline customers: �It�s very easy to reduce prices but very difficult to increase.�In the broad cargo industry air cargo operators competed against their ocean cargo counterparts. As the operational costs per kilogram of cargo was higher in the air cargo industry than in the ocean cargo industry shipments using the former were generally lighter and less bulky than those using the latter. Although air freight was on the whole faster than ocean freight it was significantly more expensive. For example a US$195 ocean shipment could cost US$1000 by air. Safety regulations were stricter and more extensive for air cargo shipments than for ocean counterparts. For instance multiple items that were prohibited on air cargo delivery routes were permitted for ocean cargo such as gases (e.g. lightbulbs) and magnetic substances (e.g. speakers). There had been an increase in less-than-container-load cargo shipments by ocean as opposed to full-container-load shipments by air thereby enabling faster and cheaper ocean cargo services to compete with air cargo services. Driving this trend was the upgrading of ships and canals as well as improvements to ocean tracking.Air cargo operators� customers were primarily made up of airline companies handling cargo deliveries. Most airlines would enter into fixed contracts with air cargo terminal operators while some would prefer to perform cargo handling functions internally. One such example was the decision of Hong Kong�based airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (Cathay Pacific) through its wholly owned subsidiary Cathay Pacific Services Ltd. to design construct and operate the new air cargo terminal Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal at Hong Kong International Airport with air cargo throughput capacity of 2.6 million metric tons and a common-use facility open to all airline customers. The HK$5.9 billion facility commenced in February 2013 and accounted for over 20 per cent of the Cathay Pacific�s revenue.In Singapore there were over 500 freight forwarding agents ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises to big multinational corporations such as Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG (Panalpina) Kuehne + Nagel International AG and CEVA Logistics. With a large number of players the air freight forwarding sector was highly competitive and saw frequent mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Despite the air cargo industry�s growth operators faced mounting pressure to digitalize to stay relevant within the industry.Given the significance of air trade routes to economic growth the public policy-makers of most cities developed their aviation industry in an effort to attract international business trade and investment. Singapore�s economic policy reflected its prioritization of the logistics and air cargo industry. In 2017 Singapore�s Ministry of Trade and Industry announced the air transport industry transformation map a national blueprint to upgrade the capabilities of aviation companies through 2025 to boost productivity in the industry by 40 per cent. Ng Chee Meng the second minister for transport affirmed his intention to augment �smart� applications in the air transport industry to enhance industry�s competitiveness: �Systems will talk more to each other and more autonomous systems will support our work. We want to track every piece of baggage cargo and equipment moving across the airport in real time.�CHALLENGES OF the AIR CARGO INDUSTRYDuring 2018 the global air cargo industry achieved growth of 3.5 per cent in cargo volume. Estimates from IATA forecast industry growth of 4.9 per cent over the next five years. Despite its growth the industry faced several challenges.The air cargo industry was labour intensive for operations such as cargo handling and delivery. As the labour market faced acute shortages rising demand for skilled labour had led to escalating labour costs. This crisis was expected to worsen as global labour shortages of 85.2 million skilled workers were projected by 2030 across all industries resulting in potential lost revenue opportunities of US$8.452 trillion. If left unchecked such labour shortages could restrict the growth of the industry potentially putting many players out of business. In many developed countries the challenge of labour shortages was exacerbated by falling birth rates which gave rise to an aging workforce.With the increasing convenience of e-commerce driven by advances in social media and electronic payment technologies the air cargo industry saw rising customer expectations of the performance of air cargo delivery service providers. Both consumers and businesses expected to receive goods faster in a more flexible and transparent manner and at lower delivery prices. A study conducted by the National Retail Federation found that 75 per cent of consumers surveyed demanded same-day delivery but were not willing to pay for the service. The customer expected an e-commerce-like experience where services information and transactions were made available online and in real time. It was apparent that the sector was under growing pressure to deliver quicker and better services at lower costs.From terrorist attacks to geopolitical positioning the air cargo industry was one of the industry�s most vulnerable to safety and security risks. To address these risks the governing bodies had heightened measures to improve the safety and reliability of the industry. However these measures came at an increase in compliance costs that were partially borne by the logistics operators. The related security expenses cargo screening costs training and delayed transit times were estimated to exceed US$4 billion for the industry.Compared to the ocean cargo industry the air cargo industry was found to have lagged on three fronts relating to digital connectivity: customer connectivity online experience and transformation. Customer connectivity pertained to the ability of customers to be serviced on a suite of functions through digital technology comprising documentation shipment tracking invoicing and online payment. The online experience would thus follow focusing on creating a business-to-consumer kind of e-commerce experience for customers. While the second dimension built on the first it also included door-to-door delivery functions and request-for-quotation forms. Finally transformation referred to a top-down focus on improving systems processes and cultures both internally and externally through business information technologies that could make the value chain more seamless. This digital lag of the air cargo industry resulted in a loss of cost competitiveness to its ocean cargo rival. Major electronics companies such as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (commonly known as Ericsson) and Sony Corporation admitted to shifting their transport operations from air to sea modes due to costs.THE THREE CsTo address the challenges in the air cargo industry the existing players had responded in various ways. According to the management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company three trends were observed in the industry. First there had been an increase in M&A among the incumbents. One example was DSV�s acquisition of Panalpina to form DSV Panalpina A/S in 2019 for US$4.6 billion the largest acquisition the industry had ever witnessed. Second a digital wave was imminent on the freight forwarding industry�s horizon as the disruption caused by three groups of new players was placing increasing pressure on traditional players to adopt digital technologies. The first group involved digital forwarding specialists (e.g. the software-as-a-service company Fleetmatics Group PLC) offering solutions for one or two elements of the value chain and providing airline operators with information on vehicle location mileage and other relevant metrics. The second group comprised digital forwarders such as Amazon offering as wide a range of logistics services as traditional forwarders but with better customer experience and at a relatively lower cost. The third group consisted of airlines building their own digital channels to serve customers directly rather than relying on traditional freight forwarders to reserve space on flights (e.g. Brussels Airlines Cargo developing cargo slot booking application with its digital partner BRUcloud). Third the air cargo industry players were expected to embrace digital transformation in front- to back-end processes to reduce internal costs and enhance customer experiences. All surviving forwarders would be more digitalized by 2025 while those lagging behind on digitalization and collaboration were expected to struggle and decline.According to Khoo these trends of the air cargo industry could be summarized by three Cs. The first C would represent the competition heating up between traditional operators and the new digital forwarders. The second C would capture the consolidation of the existing industry players through M&A. The imperative of collaboration among the air cargo industry players across the value chain would be expressed by the third C. Khoo was confident in SATS�s market positioning:Because of our unique position in the market a very neutral position we [SATS] are not competing with the freight forwarders and we are not competing with the airlines. In fact we are either a service provider to the entire community or we are the key enabler to the community. We can help to build a platform that is collaborative in nature and everyone can run on it and play in a fair playing field.To address industry challenges and leverage opportunities SATS chose to focus on cargo automation and digitalization initiatives.SATS�S INITATIVESAutomating Cargo OperationsIn 2014 the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) launched the Aviation Challenge with the objective of developing innovative solutions to automate labour-intensive processes in airport operations. Its second iteration called for contestants to propose solutions for labour-intensive cargo handling operations through automation in breaking down and building up cargo pallets and containers. Singapore-based system integrator Singapore Technologies Dynamics Pte. Ltd. (ST Dynamics) and TUM Create Ltd. Singapore (TUM Create)a partnership between the Technical University of Munich in Germany and the Nanyang Technological University in Singaporewere two of the challenge�s finalists presenting the world�s first AI-enabled robotic solutions that could scan build and break down non-standardized cargo in the palletization process. The two finalists were awarded SG$4 million in funding to develop their prototypes which were expected to reduce workers� loads by 30 per cent and to improve storage space efficiency by 4 per cent. The promising potential of the finalists� robotic solutions caught the attention of SATS. Having envisioned that the future air cargo industry would harness the power of AI computer vision IoT and robotics to enhance its productivity SATS had worked closely with CAAS to actively provide industry requirements for the Aviation Challenge as well as to evaluate and review the participants� proposed solutions for the challenge. Khoo remarkedJust imagine that in five years 10 years 15 years from now where are you going to find people? This is dealing with the labour workforce for the longer-term planning . . . as we progress automation and efficiency become a lifeline for any organization. So TUM Create is another work in progress knowing that the future is going to be as such. It�s about what we need to do to start preparing for right now so that we will be able to deal with various scenarios in the future.Building COSYSIn 2010 SATS launched a cargo terminal management system COSYS jointly developed with New Delhi�based NIIT Technologies Ltd. With access to real-time and accurate information for tracking cargo movement SATS�s partners could improve their operational efficiency. By 2019 SATS extended the availability of COSYS to its joint ventures in Asian countries such as China Taiwan and Bangladesh as well as its strategic partners in South American countries such as Brazil. As more partners utilized the information system they became contributors to its network of information creating positive network effects for present and future corporate users. The success of COSYS was evident in the accolades that SATS had received. As Khoo reflected �Owing to its innovation in the digital front SATS was felicitated with a CIO 100 Award from IDG�s [International Data Group�s] CIO [chief information officer] in 2017. This award honoured the top 100 organizations around the world that used information technology innovatively to create and deliver business value.�To address the increasing need for digital connectivity among the players of the air cargo value chain SATS was contemplating the integration of COSYS with cloud-based technology to reach out to new users.BUILDING CAPABILITIES FOR THE FUTUREAs SATS formulated its strategic plans it knew it would be imperative to continue building capabilities for the future particularly in the active adoption of robotics and AI in cargo automation for managing a diverse and aging workforce as well as in IoT and big data in cargo operation for digital transformation.Cargo Automation with Robotics and AI for Managing an Aging WorkforceLike many other developed countries Singapore faced the challenges of an aging workforce. In 2016 there were about 4.7 citizens of working age (between the ages of 20 and 64) for every older adult (over the age of 64); this was a steep decline from 6.3 citizens of working age per older adult in 2006. The demographic shift in Singapore had led to labour shortages and wage increases. While automation in the logistics sector was a relatively new trend it had already become a norm in the manufacturing industries where robots were deployed to work alongside human workers to improve efficiency. One of the first industries to spearhead automation was the automotive industry which accounted for half of the world�s industrial robots achieving a 16 per cent increase in vehicle production since 2010.In recent years the air cargo industry had seen some of the most labour-intensive functions partially automated. For example in 2016 DHL built close to 100 automated parcel-sortation bases across Germany to reduce manual handling and sorting by human personnel. Many other important functions such as delivery warehousing loading and unloading had yet to be automated giving transportation and warehousing the third-highest automation potential of any sector. By 2014 Amazon spent US$775 million on installing robots made by Kiva Systems across 13 fulfillment centres to automate picking and packing processes at large warehouses. The deployment allowed Amazon to cut operating costs by 20 per cent reduce cycle times by 45 to 60 minutes and free up inventory space by 50 per cent translating into cost savings of US$22 million per fulfillment centre. Apart from robotics and automated systems other technologies such as AI were reported as critical for the logistics industry. The global mobile logistics robot market was forecast to reach US$11269.1 million by 2025 registering a compound annual growth rate of 21.2 per cent from 2018 to 2025.As one of the leading providers of air cargo handling services SATS had an excellent track record in technological integration. At the Changi Airfreight Centre SATS operated six cargo terminals with a floor space of 150000 square metres and annual capacity of 2.2 million metric tons. To add to its capabilities in 2017 it inaugurated the SATS eCommerce AirHub�a SG$21 million 6000-square-metre fully automated airside mail sortation facility co-funded with CAAS�to improve productivity by increasing (a) the mailbag processing capacity from 500 mails an hour to over 1800 mails an hour and (b) processing speed by 50 per cent.  Building on this capability SATS could invest in robotics and AI to fully automate its cargo picking and packing operations in collaboration with TUM Create or ST Dynamics to address the issue of an aging workforce while improving operational efficiency.However the development of robotics technology for the logistics sector was still in its early stages where the range of possible technological applications was wide (e.g. pick-and-place robots autonomous vehicles drones) and the risk of technology obsolescence was moderate to high. It would therefore be crucial to identify the right robotics technology and the right processes to automate for long-term commercial viability. As robotics solutions with AI software programs required regular software updates and hardware maintenance the required skills would have to be procured externally from a limited pool of vendors and at relatively high costs. While automation could curb the need for low-skilled labour it would also bring about the demand for high-skilled labour to program operate service and maintain the robotics.Cargo Operation with IoT and Big Data for Digital TransformationNew technologies such as big data machine learning and IoT could help companies digitalize to improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experience. Digital technologies would enable firms to capture critical data about consumer behaviours leading to better forecast capacity in response to changing consumer preferences and thereby presenting opportunities to build long-term customer relationships. Up to 5 per cent return on sales could be achieved for firms that were able to make creative use of their existing data and embed analytics in their daily functions. The use of digital platform and mobile connected devices combined with IoT in the cargo warehouse would make the booking tracking and monitoring of shipments easier and more accurate. The use of RFID in warehouses was gaining momentum at pallet- or item-level tagging. Once tagged with an RFID unit the cargo could be tracked not only within the warehouse but also end-to-end through the entire supply chain. Such technologies would help satisfy customer demand for greater shipment visibility.Digitalization was expected to address the connectivity issue of the air cargo industry by improving the industry�s competitiveness over its ocean cargo counterpart. Its implementation could tackle safety and security concerns across the industry by automating the cargo screening and tracking processes thereby reducing cycle time and compliance costs. Significant improvement in performance was forecast for companies that adopted digitalization to reduce operational costs by 3.2 per cent over five years. For example Brussels Airport launched the BRUcloud initiative in 2016 to bring the region�s transport players together onto a common data cloud to share real-time shipment data so as to facilitate seamless shipment tracking across the value chain. Luc Jacobs the CEO of DHL Global Forwarding commented �We firmly believe that an increasing transparency and reliability will decrease the overall supply chain costs in the future. We support initiatives as the community platform BRUcloud to support the industry in creating innovative tools to improve the logistic chain.�The industry had seen an increasing number of legacy players collaborate with new emerging technology start-ups to add digital capabilities within their ranks. For instance Lufthansa Cargo AG acquired the Portland-based digital logistics firm Fleet Logistics in 2018 to provide an online freight marketplace to connect businesses to freight forwarders and other shipping service providers. By enabling businesses to send requests gather quotes and review and compare freight services on its fleet marketplace the company aimed to enhance the freight booking experience by improving shipping transparency and standardization. By adopting digital capabilities in early stages the air freight industry could save between US$30 billion and US$50 billion in operation costs over the next decade. As more companies started to invest in the digital transformation of their supply chain and logistics operations industry spending on connected logistics solutions was forecast to grow to US$20 billion by 2020 (see Exhibit 2). On average the logistics sector allocated almost 5 per cent of its annual revenue to developing their digital operations comparable to the weighted average of investment across all industries which stood at 5 per cent. According to consulting firm PwC first movers in digital investment were far more likely to achieve both revenue gains of more than 30 per cent and cost reduction of more than 30 per cent at the same time.With its prior experience with COSYS implementation SATS would be well positioned to undertake digital transformation to sustain its competitive advantage. COSYS had enabled SATS to drive collaboration among not only its partners in the domestic market but also the overseas markets including Indonesia China and India. The success of the COSYS platform would enable SATS to develop a more advanced cloud-based cargo management system COSYS+ to augment real-time cargo visibility along SATS�s digital corridors in the Asia-Pacific region.However the initial capital investment to re-engineer and integrate operation processes with RFID IoT and big data would be high with a relatively long payback period. On average it would take over five years for a firm to gain a healthy return on investment in digital technologies. To fully reap the benefits of digital transformation it would be critical for SATS to build strong capabilities in digital technologies to ensure the design development and maintenance of a robust but agile cloud-based system that would enable the advanced digitalization and integration of the horizontal value chain with customers suppliers and other value-chain partners. As digital systems could be vulnerable to security and privacy threats SATS would also need to build its cybersecurity capability to protect and harden its systems against intrusion from hackers terrorists cybercriminals mischief-makers and others who wished to inflict damages.MOVING FORWARDBy embarking on robotics and AI in cargo automation SATS would be poised to tackle the challenges presented by an aging workforce and rising labour costs. On the other hand the call for digital transformation with IoT and big data in cargo operation would merit immediate attention. While both initiatives seemed equally compelling for building capabilities for the future Khoo knew that he had to prioritize investment and resource allocation. Should SATS invest in the design development and maintenance of robotics and AI systems to fully automate its cargo picking and packing operations in collaboration with TUM Create or ST Dynamics? Or should the company focus on the design development and maintenance of IoT and big data systems to expand the functions of COSYS+ to fully integrate its air cargo value chain?EXHIBIT 1: AIR CARGO INDUSTRY VALUE CHAINSource: Created by the authors based on �Paperless Air Cargo and Logistics Solution to Boost Productivity across Supply Chain� Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore accessed May 31 2019 www.caas.gov.sg/about-caas/newsroom/Detail/paperless-air-cargo-and-logistics-solutions-to-boost-productivity-across-supply-chain/.EXHIBIT 2: GROWING EXPENDITURE ON IoT-Based SOLUTION IN the LOGISTICS SECTORNote: Io

Reporting to the bank’s vice president (Fraud) McKenzie had been appointed as head of Enterprise Fraud Strategy a department tasked with protecting RBC’s global customers from fraud. McKenzie’s immediate priority was to prevent fraudulent transactions by RBC’s own customers—a phenomenon called first-party fraud—by implementing a bourgeoning technology called social network analysis (SNA). The technology used predictive analytics to forecast the occurrence of first-party fraud. McKenzie reflectedAs we begin to deploy predictive analytics in preventing first-party fraud at RBC I am facing three managerial dilemmas. First how should SNA be used to bring down the ratio of fraud alerts to actual frauds at RBC? [As of October 2013] the incidence of false positives as they are called [is high] at 85:1. We must bring it down to 10:1. Second how should the cost of maintaining SNA protocols be reduced? SNA is characterized by data intensity. The process of extracting transferring and loading large data sets (known as ETL) is expensive. We have to strike a balance between fraud loss avoidance and operational efficiency. Finally how should the issues around systemic performance of SNA be resolved? We should reduce the time lag with ETL processes and make ETL real time.RBCEstablished as Merchant’s Bank of Halifax in 1869 and renamed the Royal Bank of Canada in 1901 RBC was Canada’s largest bank as measured by assets and market capitalization. The bank was also the largest card issuer in Canada with 6.5 million cards. It had about 80000 full- and part-time employees and served more than 15 million clients in Canada the United States and 49 other countries. RBC was driven by a vision of “earning the right to be our clients’ first choice.” The bank was pursuing this vision through three strategic goals: (1) to hold on to the leadership position in financial services in Canada; (2) to provide capital market and wealth management solutions outside Canada; and (3) to offer in targeted markets products and services complementary to its core strengths. The bank’s strategy for growth and profitability had remained consistent over the years while its structure was being fine-tuned regularly.In October 2012 RBC had restructured its business into five segments: personal and commercial banking (meeting the banking needs of individuals and businesses) wealth management (serving high-net-worth individuals) insurance (offering insurance and reinsurance products through various channels) investor and treasury services (serving the needs of institutional clients) and capital markets (comprising global wholesale banking). These five business segments were supported by two streams: technology & operations (forming the technological and operational bedrock for the organization) and functions (including finance human resources risk management corporate treasury and internal audit). McKenzie explainedWe have four objectives at RBC with regard to fraud prevention: reducing losses; enhancing customer experience lowering costs; and minimizing overall risk. In balancing these objectives we have given high weighting to enhancing customer experience in two ways. We have converted areas of potential customer inconvenience into areas of customer care. It is mandatory in every . . . wire transaction for example for a bank to make telephonic enquiries with the home branch which in turn calls up the sender with specific questions to confirm the veracity of the transaction. Invariably the protocol causes processing delays often hours. The information would also fall short of requirement. What we have done at RBC is to set up a dedicated team to call the sender directly within minutes. Customers appreciate such calls. The resolution time has come down from an average of two hours to less than 20 minutes. Secondly we look for customer service opportunities in deploying fraud solutions. We have leveraged big data to provide a snapshot of each customer to the call centre to make [customers] feel better about offers made during the conversation fulfilling specific needs. RBC had more than six million customers but it was conservative about who it lent money or granted credit cards to. The core anchor of RBC’s fraud prevention program was the service reference file (SRF) which was specific to each individual customer. Each SRF provided multiple frames of reference as it unfolded progressively over the life cycle of an RBC customer. Before the bank introduced SNA fraud detection fell under the domain of the bank’s Corporate Investigations Services (CIS) division. CIS was similar to an internal police service but had other ongoing responsibilities as well like offering protection services for the bank’s senior executives. There was a dollar threshold to be met before the CIS could intervene in a fraud investigation. The CIS would interview the suspects and build a case for prosecution while RBC would “demarket” a customer proven to be indulging in fraudulent transactions.FIRST- AND THIRD-PARTY FRAUDIn general a banking fraud had five characteristics. First it was uncommon: the number of fraud cases in a data set was small usually less than 1 per cent rendering the data set imbalanced and making it difficult to achieve predictive accuracy. Therefore it was necessary to reconfigure the data in a bid to restore balance and make it work and this was usually done by over-sampling the minority class or under-sampling the majority class. Second each fraud was preceded by a well-considered plan of action and was never ad hoc. Third fraud was not an individual phenomenon; it was invariably the result of a networked organization. Fourth fraud was typically concealed so well that it would not be noticed until after it had been committed and so required expert intervention for detection. Finally fraud methods evolved over time meaning that the detection experts were always trying to catch up with the latest techniques. The two main types of fraud were first-party fraud and third-party fraud. Third-party fraud happened when a third party stole the identities of honest/legitimate RBC customers and used these identities to steal money both from the customer and the bank. Third-party fraud was difficult to detect because fraudsters went to great lengths to seem like those they were pretending to be. The account was usually put through the conventional collections treatment to be written off over time as bad debt. Third-party fraud was subject to a fuller investigation because it was officially classified as fraud (unlike first-party fraud). First-party fraud occurred when customers applied for credit cards loans overdrafts or unsecured lines of credit with a clear intent to swindle their own bank. Their applications would be backed by a good credit history built by conscious design over several years (through well-orchestrated moves like making regular payments from their accounts and purchasing high-profile products from the bank such as property insurance). During the period of build-up the fraudsters would also use a technique called “cash cycling” wherein they would create an illusion of legitimacy by circulating amounts at intervals among several other accounts both within their own bank and at other banks. The accounts would all be part of a fraudulent network sharing some common data elements (like name date of birth phone number address Social Insurance Number etc.). The account behaviours would be normal and would therefore pass through conventional customer analytics without raising any red flags. Once they secured sufficient lines of credit however the customers would “bust out” within days purchasing high-priced goods and withdrawing cash from various accounts that would be seemingly disparate but interconnected. McKenzie described the disastrous effects of first-party fraud:A unique feature of first-party fraud is the exponential nature of the relationship between the number of fraudsters and the overall dollar value being defrauded. Ten fraudsters sharing 10 common data elements can create 100 false identities; and if they defraud four financial instruments per identity each with a CA$5000 credit limit the potential loss to the financial system would be $2 million. This ability known as connected explosion is a source of strength for organized crime involved in first-party fraud but it is also its Achilles’ heel. It is their connectivity that renders first-party fraudsters vulnerable to modern fraud detection tools like SNA which leverages the very connectivity that is the basis of first-party fraud.National estimates of the magnitude of first-party fraud were not readily available because first-party fraud was not officially classified as fraud although the value of consumer credit being written off as bad debt provided some indication. In the United States for example the Federal Reserve System reported that out of US$850 billion outstanding in revolving consumer credit US$85 billion was written off annually as uncollectible. Roughly 5 to 20 per cent (US$4 to US$17 billion) was misclassified as bad debt when it should have been categorized as first-party fraud. In the United Kingdom the British Bankers Association estimated that 10 to 15 per cent of bad debt losses incurred by the banking sector were from first-party fraud. The United Kingdom had a higher proportion of “transient” people—students short-term workers—leading to a higher rate of “bust out” behaviour. Similarly the value of receivables being written off by an individual bank provided a clue to the extent of first-party fraud among its customers within its own premises.Financial fraud affected all stakeholders in the value chain to varying degrees. For instance the Federal Bureau of Investigation had estimated that fraud cost U.S. insurers US$30 billion each year and that in turn insurance fraud cost the average U.S. family between US$200 and US$300 per year in the form of increased premiums. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS SNA was defined as “the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people groups organizations computers URLs and other connected information/knowledge entities.” The concept had its beginnings in the 1930s as a metaphor for complex sets of relationships among members of a social system. In the 1960s and 1970s SNA was positioned at the intersection of psychology anthropology sociology organizational design and mathematics. The application of graph theory in particular enabled SNA’s evolution from suggestive metaphors to analytical models. SNA’s perspective of networks of human relationships and its provision for their visual and mathematical analysis enabled data scientists to make key assumptions about the frequency quality and expansive nature of interactions among individuals. A flow of money between two individuals was seen as evidence of a firm and clear link between them. McKenzie defined and described the role of SNA in detecting fraud:At its simplest SNA identifies interpersonal relationships among a group of individuals and also provides a degree of evaluation (see Exhibit 1) but it is different from social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. SNA focuses on interactions among customers of financial institutions. It enables financial institutions to examine collaborations of their customers as individuals by pooling information from multiple data elements. SNA picks up nuggets of information from seemingly unrelated data in order to identify motives of people with suspicious transactions and pinpoint for pre-emptive action those on the verge of committing a fraud. The volume of transactions flowing through banks was so huge that spotting evidence of fraud was usually like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. However SNA was unique in the sense that it used a single uncovered needle to identify other needles in the haystack and expose rings or patterns of fraud. SNA had its own terminology consisting of nodes (representing persons locations or companies) and edges (establishing connection between two nodes). Each node was assigned a weighting in terms of the level of its crime and each edge was assigned a weighting in terms of the intensity of its involvement. Because networks were very large making it difficult to extract features from them the focus of investigation was usually the neighbourhood of a network. There was also a distinction between first-order networks (comprising direct associates of a network) and N-order network (comprising all others). The manner in which a network structure was represented was also critical. The link representing financial resources transferred between two nodes could be binary (attesting to the shared resource) absolute (stating the number of resources shared) or relative (stating it as a percentage). The visual representation was mapped to a matrix with rows and columns to make it easier for investigators to work with. Resources were represented as diamonds. Several sociological tests were deployed to convert network knowledge however minimal into a fraud detection tool; an example was “homophily” a term borrowed from sociology where it represented the tendency of people to associate with “people like themselves” (e.g. those from the same city or with common interests). In the context of fraud networks homophily meant that fraudulent people were most likely to be connected to other fraudulent people. Data sets containing statistically significant patterns of homophily were called clusters which for that reason were subject to closer scrutiny by investigators. An important step in SNA was the extraction of features. The focus would usually be on the first-order “neighbourhood” as RBC referred to it internally. It was known more generally as egonet. The neighbourhood (or egonet) had two components: the specific node of interest (known as ego) and its direct associates (known as alters). The features would be egonet-generic (measured through metrics like degree relative degree and triangle) and alter-specific (measured through metrics like similarity fraud score and weighted fraud score). The nodes were ranked in terms of fraud risk probability on lines similar to Google’s PageRank algorithm.Because fraudsters were densely connected to one another network models like SNA were known to perform better in terms of parameters like accuracy (by using skewed distribution as the basis to distinguish fraudulent customers) precision (by identifying potential high-risk customers from a long list) and recall (by detecting fraudulent customers).FRAUD DETECTION ISSUES AT RBCMcKenzie identified several objectives in moving forward with fraud detection systems at RBC: Lowering the False Positive RateWhen fully implemented at the beginning of each week the SNA system would provide McKenzie with a visual representation linking individual entities that would potentially perpetrate larger-scale frauds (see Exhibit 1). The system would also provide him with a percentage of claim alerts scoring high for fraud potential.Attempts to identify fraudulent customers would sometimes lead to alerts that proved incorrect after further investigation (i.e. the customers were not fraudsters). As a result the false positive rate (FPR) or percentage of alerts that were found to be honest customers was a key metric of any detection system. Lowering the FPR was critical in avoiding the expense of investigating false positives. If McKenzie received 85 alerts at the beginning of a week and only one of them was actually a fraud perpetrator the remaining 84 alerts resulted in a huge waste of time money and human investigative resources. Bringing down the FPR also meant focusing on the most “high-likelihood” cases. This focus was important because false positives created undesired side effects. The last thing a financial institution would want to do was chase off legitimate customers by considering them as potential fraudsters. A fraud detection system was amenable to a high FPR because there was no customer interface. One possible solution to this issue was to replicate the model used by credit card systems which had no provision for a high FPR because it had to approve or decline the transaction within seconds. The system had a direct interface with the customer who would be waiting for closure of the transaction. Reducing the Cost of the Analytics SystemsThe analytics system had cost RBC $10 million upfront. The recurring annual costs of hardware maintenance were about $1 million but the major cost element was due to the data intensity of the system. The system was processing 30 terabytes of data every week. The system had to find the data make sense of it extract the data and format it in a way that was actionable; all of this was costly and time consuming requiring dedicated resources in terms of both staff time and machine capacity.McKenzie was considering two cost-reduction options in the long term. One was to store the data in the online server (cloud) but this option contrasted sharply with RBC’s traditionally conservative approach to protecting its customers’ data. It was unlikely that RBC would pursue this cloud approach unless the requirements of the technology were very strong. The second option (one that demonstrated RBC’s desire to embrace the latest technologies) was to outsource ETL; the limitation here was that the vendor ecosystem had not developed enough and there were not many individual vendors with the scale that RBC required.Resolving Issues around Systemic Performance of SNAThis objective was also linked to the issues regarding data acquisition. A giant server at the data centre of RBC had crunched data for five days straight providing historical rather than real-time data. The slow pace of the batch-processing backend was in contrast to the frontend wherein a potential fraudster did not have to wait for five days to get a credit card or open a new account. An alternative would be to run the analysis over the weekends (lasting for two days at a stretch) with incremental processing during four consecutive weeknights. The second performance problem with SNA was the prevalence of what were known as “super clusters.” A super cluster was a formation in which everybody was linked to everybody else. A super cluster required frequent changing of entry thresholds so that the clusters were manageable. Every time there was a change the network had to be run all over again. In a network of for instance one million there were bound to be frequent changes in composition.NEXT STEPSFraudsters were currently being detected using rule-based logical searches. A customer was selected and the pattern of that customer’s financial transfers to other RBC accounts was investigated by applying rules that searched for internal transactions that would reveal the types of networks illustrated in Exhibit 2. The complexity of the rules required the detection of complex networks and the large number of RBC accounts made executing the rules through the RBC customer database a prodigious data-processing task.In considering his next steps McKenzie decided to look at the data from a recent analysis. This historical analysis was summarized in an Excel spreadsheet where 16 fraud detection rules had been applied to 13731 customers who had been found to be “fraudsters” or “not-fraudsters” following extensive further investigations. McKenzie was interested in finding out which rule or combination of rules provided the best fraud detection and how effective this rule (or combination) would be if implemented for all RBC customers. Since applying even a single rule was very time consuming and costly it was also important for McKenzie to know if he could discard some rules as ineffective.Exhibit 1: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSISSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: TYPES OF NETWORKSNote: The above diagrams provide five hypothetical social networks involving a small number of nodes to illustrate some of the wide variety of networks possible. The first network involving five nodes is close to the situation where everybody goes to everybody else. In the second network involving 10 nodes the ties are all reciprocated but the network is highly fragmented. The third network comprising five nodes is connected but shows a concentration of power. It is held together by a single node whose disappearance will disintegrate the network. The fourth network involving six nodes is also connected in the sense that everybody can go to everybody else—but through a large number of intermediaries. The fifth network involving 13 nodes displays a strong hierarchy and although it is connected the ties flow in only one direction.Source: David Knoke and Song Yang Social Network Analysis 2nd ed.

Rubicon Minerals Corporation was just one of Lac Seul’s many development partners or potential partners and it had suffered a couple of serious setbacks: an environmental chemical spill and more serious a devaluation of its estimated gold reserves. Described as “one of the worst Canadian mining meltdowns in years” this was a vivid demonstration of the risk and cyclicality in the mining industry.The Chief wondered about the future benefits from agreements with other mining companies such as Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp) and the junior company AurCrest Gold Inc. (AurCrest) which was partially owned by Lac Seul. Lac Seul also had business interests in timber and hydroelectric power the result of negotiations with the government to ameliorate past wrongs. Goldcorp was a large player and its agreement with Lac Seul in 2013 included financial contributions to community development. Bull was confident the contributions would continue but less confident about benefits from the many smaller players in the market. As chief it was Bull’s job along with the band council to lead Lac Seul in its stewardship of the land individual and community development; and relationships with neighbours industry and government. The band had a long history of relationships with other groups that shared the land on which they lived. Since the First Nations came into contact with explorers to Canada many of these relationships had become one-sided. But more recently with the government’s support and increasing public awareness of Canada’s past opportunities for balanced partnerships were arising. The situation was improving but there were still many challenges. One difficulty was the community’s capacity to take advantage of subcontracting offers from mining companies. Lac Seul had a mining liaison office in Red Lake Ontario that was sitting empty for lack of qualified personnel to staff it.Bull looked at his watch and realized he had a meeting at the training centre a converted school in nearby Hudson Ontario purchased by Lac Seul with assistance from Goldcorp. As he departed the office he drove by the new arena and conference centre a tangible benefit from a settlement of past inequities. Bull reviewed the meeting agenda which concerned negotiations with yet another resource company. He wondered how receptive the company would be to sharing benefits with First Nations and respecting the lands on which his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years.The communityDemographicsLac Seul First Nation was an aboriginal community located in remote northwestern Ontario 1200 kilometres northwest of Toronto. The land area of 26800 hectares was approximately 10 per cent of the size of Manitoulin Island. Lac Seul comprised three settlements on the shores of Lac Seul: Whitefish Bay (including Canoe River; total population 100) Kejick Bay (population 400) and Frenchman’s Head (population 400). The total reserve population in 2015 was approximately 3400 with 900 people living on the reserve. Of the three communities Frenchman’s Head had the closest road access and was a 40-kilometre drive from Sioux Lookout Ontario. A chief and seven councillors three each from the two larger communities and one from Whitefish Bay governed the band. The chief was elected at large.Of note was the off-reserve population. This had significance for band elections and for other votes required to approve agreements with resource companies. A court decision in 1999 confirmed the right of off-reserve community members to vote in elections. This ruling had implications for how resource companies communicated with the community.HistoryThere was ample evidence that pre-historic peoples had occupied the lands in the region. Excavations at the Ballynacree site near Kenora Ontario (170 kilometres southwest of Lac Seul) revealed evidence of a Laurel culture village including three houses numerous ceramic sherds and projectile points. According to radiocarbon dating of charred wood found in the excavation Laurel people lived in the area sometime between 1200 and 1300 CE. They were subsistent hunter-gatherers congregating at a central summer location with ample resources of spawning fish and wild rice. Winters would be spent in smaller family groups at traditional locations to exploit the scattered animal resources.Wenasaga Rapids was a known historical gathering point of First Nations people likely because of prolific fish stocks. The rapids were at the bottom of the four-kilometre long Wenasaga River which flowed south into Lac Seul. This was 80 kilometres northwest of the community of Kejick Bay or approximately two days’ paddle as it would have been expressed. An excavation of the site revealed ceramic sherds typical of Laurel culture dated as late as the thirteenth century. Also found were materials from Blackduck and Selkirk occupations thought by some to be ancestors of the Ojibwa and Cree people respectively. Analysis of carbonized food residue from these sherds indicated the presence of maize which was not likely grown in the area. This supported the presence of trade networks between early societies involving maize wild rice lithic (stone) tools or points and other goods. What was not clear was if there was a direct link between the archaeological record of habitation and the current inhabitants. At the time of contact with explorers to Canada Lac Seul ancestors would have been hunters living in the same area northwest of Lake Superior. They may have ranged as far north as James Bay or Hudson Bay in summer spending their winter in their traditional family areas to trap and hunt. Speculation was that shortly before the time of contact Lac Seul’s ancestors might have begun travelling to Sault Ste. Marie for summer ceremonies and inter-tribal trade. While there they encountered and traded with other First Nations people from the shores of Lake Superior and Huron.Toward the end of the seventeenth century the need to travel for summer trade declined as the French and English traders built posts for trade on Hudson Bay Lake Superior and points inland. By 1803 a Hudson Bay post was established on Lac Seul; it operated until the mid 1900s. At that time the summer gatherings took place on Lac Seul because of its central location. Summer gatherings were a time for celebrations marriages trade and dispute resolution.The Community’s Land and ResourcesTreaty with the Canadian GovernmentCanada’s government was motivated to sign treaties with First Nations people to establish a cooperative relationship and improve communication and transportation links with the western part of the country. There had been some friction with the Métis people living west of Lac Seul and this was no doubt part of the urgency to begin negotiations. There were delays in negotiating the treaty due to the personalities of those representing the government the discovery of silver and gold in the territory and misunderstandings on both sides regarding what rights were being conveyed with a treaty. After several approaches and false starts Treaty 3 was signed on October 3 1873. Chief John Cromarty of Lac Seul signed an adhesion to Treaty 3 on June 9 1874.Terms of the treaty were meant to encourage farming and included an area of reserved land not exceeding one square mile per family a one-time payment of CA$12 per person and an annual payment of $5 per person. The band as a whole received $1500 per year for group purchase of ammunition twine for fishing nets and farming implements as well as farm animals and seeds for planting.During the treaty negotiations a Métis named Nolin was paid to interpret and take notes of the treaty details for the First Nations people. Those notes initially written in French formed what became known as the Paypom treaty. Its content was similar to the terms of Treaty 3 but also contained terms that had been discussed but were not included in Treaty 3 specifically with respect to mineral rights:If some gold or silver mines be found in their reserves it will be to the benefit of the Indians but if the Indians find any gold or silver mines out of their reserves they will surely be paid the finding of the mines.It was clear the parties were aware of resources related to the land in question and discussed the issue. It was also clear that the government was trying to promote farming which would tie the community to its reserved land.Timber ResourcesIn keeping with the management approach of the day the band was convinced in 1919 to surrender their rights to timber to the government to sell “upon such terms as the Government of the Dominion of Canada may deem most conductive to our welfare and that of our people.” The principles seemed appropriate: the land and timber would be measured an agreed upon amount of land and timber would be estimated fees would be set the timber harvested and fees paid and distributed to the band. The Department of Indian Affairs (as it was called at the time) hired Harold J. Bury as its timber inspector and it was he who did the timber cruise—a process of measuring the type and size of trees within a bounded area—to assess the value of timber present. The reserve was divided into northern and southern portions. A license for the southern portion was awarded to Keewatin Lumber in 1923. Bury had identified the northern portion as too remote for economic harvesting; however in 1926 Charles Cox was awarded a license for that very portion.Cox already had timber permits of a similar nature for the Gull River reserve (home of the Gull Bay First Nation) approximately 250 kilometres southeast of Lac Seul. Between 1923 and 1925 the Department of Indian Affairs had received numerous complaints regarding the way Cox was cutting the lumber. Bury was also responsible for the Gull River reserve. The two of them colluded the illegal activity resulting in financial damage to the Ginoogaming First Nation (then the Long Lac [alternatively Long Lake] 77 First Nation). Bury it seemed acted at least unethically and perhaps illegally in allowing Cox to cut more timber than allotted and pay less than was contractually required. Bury also renewed agreements without tender and generally acted outside the law. Cox for his part was unethical and acted illegally taking more than was contractually agreed upon without paying for it.Ginoogaming filed a claim in 1990 specific to Cox’s illegal behaviour. Canada settled the claim in 2002 with a payment of $13.8 million. At that point Mark Kuhlberg an historian who specialized in forest history contacted then Chief David Gordon and Bull who was then councillor of Lac Seul to inform them of his findings regarding Cox and the settlement obtained at Ginoogaming. After conferring with their colleagues the chief and council decided to proceed with their own lawsuit against Canada claiming the government had a fiduciary duty to manage the band’s timber assets for the band’s benefit.The band hired lawyer Will Major to pursue the suit. Major recruited expert researchers and witnesses including Kuhlberg and another historian a forester an economist and two accountants. The trial involved 15 days of hearings between September 3 and October 24 2008. The court held that Canada had indeed failed to share revenue protect the timber resources and manage the timber asset to the advantage of the First Nation. The court acknowledged that Canada did not monitor or measure the amount of timber harvested. The harvested amounts documented by the logging company amounted to approximately one-fifth of the estimated amount available for harvest. Therefore the compensation amount was less than legally required. The measure of the occupied area was also under-reported resulting in further reduction of legally available rent. In addition there was no retendering process at the end of license periods to ensure competitive compensation. It seems Cox had been up to the same illegal activities at Lac Seul as he demonstrated at Gull River and the Long Lac reserve while Bury was at minimum incompetent and acting either unethically illegally or both. The evidence was compelling: in total the court noted six different breaches of fiduciary duty. The judge summarized his findings in an understatement: “The Crown did not act in a prudent manner and in the best interests of the band.” The band was awarded a settlement of $27 million which they used to further their economic development goals including the purchase and operation of a Tim Hortons franchise in Sioux Lookout.Additionally and somewhat ironically Lac Seul received a license to manage the Lac Seul forest. The band had prepared a business plan for a wood supply competition held by the Ministry of Northern Development Mines and Forestry for the Lac Seul forest. In a controversial process the band lost to a larger company in the competition held in 2011. That winning mill subsequently went bankrupt and Lac Seul was awarded the contract based on their previously prepared plan. These were positive outcomes from negative historic experiences.Water ManagementIn the mid-1920s gold was discovered at Red Lake; by 1926 thousands of people had converged on the area. At the same time the Canadian Department of the Interior had concluded surveys on the English River system to determine its potential for generating power and to evaluate control issues that affected the Winnipeg River. With the population influx and prospecting and mining activities electricity was needed. The decision was made to store water in Lac Seul with the construction of a dam at its Ear Falls outlet. Construction of the dam and a powerhouse began in 1928.There were of course indigenous people living in the area specifically on the reserve. Some were farming as encouraged by Canada in the treaty. Lac Seul had learned through trade and communication networks that a dam was being considered for the English River. In 1923 an industrialist from Minnesota Edward Backus had constructed a dam at Lac des Mille Lacs 200 kilometres southeast of Lac Seul. That dam had also been constructed to control water and generate electricity. The result however included flooding of the Ojibwa settlement adjacent to the lake.Then chief of Lac Seul Paul Thomas visited the Indian agent at the time Frank Edwards to alert him of their concerns about a plan for a dam at Lac Seul. Edwards sent a letter to Ottawa in 1924 (see Exhibit 1). In it he voiced the chief’s worry about the possibility of losing hay fields gardens timber and housing. Edwards also noted the concern that the cemetery and burial grounds could be destroyed. The letter and the band’s concerns were paid little heed. Construction commenced on the Lac Seul dam in 1928. The band was assured that flooding would be minor.The Keewatin Lumber Company previously licensed to cut the south portion of the reserve was awarded a contract to cut the Lac Seul foreshore. They were meant to clear that part of the shore that would soon be flooded make use of the lumber and minimize organic material and obstructions on the new lake bottom. Instead the company cut a different area equivalent to the size of their license but much easier to access than the foreshore. This was indicative of the care and supervision the band could expect from the government.The Lac Seul people continued their traditional lifestyle which included summer gatherings at the lake meeting area and winter living at their clan territory. The events that subsequently unfolded were described on a plaque commemorating the event (see Exhibit 2):In 1934 without knowledge or permission of the Obishikokaang Anishinaabeg the dam was activated and the lake rose by 12 feet. The people of Obishikokaang returned from a winter of trapping to find their summer settlement along the reserve shoreline under water.The effect was devastating. Eighty-two homes were lost as well as food storage tools agricultural land 3300 acres of wild rice beds and other resources vital to the band’s livelihood. Hundreds were forced to leave the reserve to find a way to survive. Negotiations for construction of the dam had included compensation for the band. In 1928 Canada and the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario ratified the Lac Seul storage agreement for cost sharing. Anticipated damage was calculated in advance to compensate for land resources and housing that would be lost to the dam project. The anticipated damage was valued at $120000 and the capital cost of the project was set at over $750000. Compensation for Lac Seul was set at $50000 ($700000 equivalent in 2016). “Ontario and Canada considered the figure of $120200 as compensation to the band to be excessive.”In 1941 the valuation for lost resources was raised to over $280000; in 1943 it was reduced to $72000. Still in the end only $50000 was paid to the band. Lac Seul had been pursuing appropriate compensation ever since. In what was an illustrative irony the band itself did not get electricity until 1980.In 1985 the band filed a flood claim under the government’s Specific Claims Policy. Canada introduced the policy in 2007 to facilitate grievances resulting from an alleged failure to meet basic treaty obligations. (If there was no treaty in place bands were to use a “Comprehensive Claims” process.) The Specific Claims Policy was an update of an old policy that was inefficient and had created a backlog of cases. The process featured independent judges who could award up to $150 million in compensation. Canada maintained a record of Specific Claims with negotiated agreements. Settlements ranged from $100000 to millions for a variety of issues from improper surveys and easements to compensation for flooding and fiduciary obligations.Canada offered to negotiate Lac Seul’s claim in 1995. Thirteen years later the government offered Lac Seul a settlement of $7 million. The band rejected the offer and launched a lawsuit which was scheduled to begin in September 2016.Related to the flood claim was negotiation over expansion of the power station at Ear Falls. In 2004 Ontario Power Generation (OPG) a Crown corporation responsible for about half of the electricity generated for the whole province of Ontario was planning to expand the dam to capture water flow that spilled past the existing generating station. In typical fashion the band was the last to hear of the project. In fact Gordon still chief at the time only learned about the project by hearing about it on the radio. The band organized a bus and went to protest the province’s actions.A series of negotiations followed forced by requirements of the Ontario government for OPG to obtain a permit to take water. Lac Seul was awarded a financial settlement based on past hydro activity and sales. By reinvesting $4 million from the settlement Lac Seul became a 25 per cent owner of the new 12.5 megawatt Obishikokaang Waasiganikewigamig/Lac Seul Generating Station. The dam began commercial operation on February 18 2009. It featured a first-on and last-off the grid demand meaning the dam’s output and Lac Seul’s investment were maximized.Minerals Records show that the Red Lake area had been sporadically explored since 1893 but nothing was sustained at the time. E. L. Bruce a professor of geology at Queen’s University in Kingston visited and explored the area in the summers of 1922 and 1923. His report published in 1924 indicated the geology was similar to that at Kirkland Lake where a gold deposit was found. An investment group from Haileybury Ontario sponsored two prospectors brothers Lorne and Ray Howey to look for gold. They discovered gold-bearing rock in 1925; by 1926 the rush for development was on.Since 1925 mines at Red Lake had produced 28 million ounces of gold. Two-thirds of the gold (66 per cent) came from Goldcorp’s Red Lake mine formerly known as the Dickenson mine (1994) and before that the Arthur White mine. In 2006 Goldcorp acquired the Campbell Mine and began operating it and the Red Lake mine as a single project. Together they produced over 500000 ounces of gold in 2012. The Red Lake mine was the larger mine by far producing more than 400000 ounces of gold in 2014. Plans for the mining complex included continued production and exploration. As of 2014 Goldcorp estimated the mines would produce over 2 million ounces of gold. Although Goldcorp was the major player at Red Lake other mining companies were also exploring the region.Other First Nations also had experience with mining companies. A northern neighbouring band Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation (KI) clashed with Platinex Inc. (Platinex). KI was located on Big Trout Lake approximately 400 kilometres northeast of Lac Seul. Platinex was a junior mining company that began exploring in the area in 1999. KI and Platinex had initial discussions and negotiations but talks broke down. In August 2005 KI sent a letter to Platinex ending negotiations:It was decided that effective immediately August 30 2005 all previous Agreements and Letters of Understanding between all affected parties . . . related to your proposed work around the above mentioned area both verbal and written will be null and void.Subsequently to acquire a listing on the TSX Venture Exchange Platinex falsely reported “[KI] has verbally consented to low impact exploration.” A drilling team was then sent in and the band blockaded the road and airstrip. The drilling team departed and KI and Platinex each filed for a court injunction against the activities of the other. The matter resolved unhappily with a temporary halt on both parties and a directive to both parties to “begin [communication and honest and open dialogue] again.” The court pronounced that “the parties must continue to seek their own resolution of their issues and concerns.” Instead both sides took further actions. In 2008 KI members protested and were jailed. Platinex tried to land a floatplane at the community in August 2009 but was blocked by protestors. Finally Ontario settled the dispute with a payout of $5 million to Platinex in exchange for Platinex dropping all lawsuits against the government and KI. This unhappy episode was unfolding while Lac Seul was negotiating with a number of companies; clearly KI’s experience informed Lac Seul’s negotiations.GoldcorpThe Lac Seul chief and band were well aware of mining that was going on in the area. The remote area—160 kilometres northwest of Sioux Lookout but a four-hour drive by road—was part of Lac Seul’s traditional territory for time immemorial and had been the site of mining for more than eight decades. In 2006 talks were initiated with Gold Eagle Mines Limited a junior mining company in the Red Lake mine trend looking to develop a deposit of up to 6 million ounces. Initial meetings with the exploration manager seemed to be progressing if slowly. Lac Seul was interested in a small percentage of the exploration budget—approximately 2 per cent. This would have provided resources for the band to become more involved in the mining process.In the summer of 2008 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited invested $50 million in Gold Eagle for a 7.2 per cent stake in the company. This was intended to support Gold Eagle’s exploration program. Goldcorp which owned the larger mines in the area reacted to Agnico’s investment by offering to buy out Gold Eagle for $1.5 billion a premium of $500 million over the Agnico valuation. Gold Eagle sold immediately and the Lac Seul band was left without an agreement. The band recommenced negotiations with the local Red Lake mine manager and seemed to make some headway. However that manager left the company soon after and was replaced by a new manager. Relations seemed to be “less cordial” simply as a result of a change in personalities at the table.Goldcorp however was willing to negotiate and so discussions progressed. A negotiation protocol agreement was signed in April 2002. Goldcorp demonstrated goodwill by providing the band with $500000 for a new training centre before negotiations were complete. A new local person for Goldcorp relieved the tensions that had been building and negotiations continued. The major stumbling block was environmental issues which were a concern to the band. A typical gold mine used cyanide and arsenic which could find their way from the mine tailings into nearby lakes and rivers with obvious negative effects. Past practice had been less than ideal when considering environmental impact so the band wanted to prevent further damage to the environment and ensure recovery measures were in place.After years of negotiation through ownership and personnel changes an agreement was signed on August 16 2013. Legal precedents the need for water-taking permits and additional power were factors that would have motivated Goldcorp to negotiate. The agreement covered yearly financial support for community infrastructure as well as employment training and contracting and permits for environmental issues such as water and tailings. A $500000 equity fund was established to support new business development. This was a great asset for the community and helped them build their capacity in dealing with resource companies.RubiconRubicon Minerals Corporation (Rubicon) was a mining company formed in British Columbia in 1996. It had been exploring in the Red Lake area since the late 1990s. Rubicon and Lac Seul engaged in preliminary talks and in January 2010 Lac Seul signed another exploration accommodation agreement. The intent was to continue negotiating to reach an impact benefit agreement. There were difficulties when Rubicon’s purchasing department failed to follow through with their commitments. Then in 2012 Lac Seul learned that individuals formerly with Goldcorp had been hired into positions of power at Rubicon. Again personalities clashed. In spite of the challenges negotiations continued and a joint venture was established; Outland Camps would provide Rubicon’s workers with camps and food services.Rubicon had recently had its own difficulties: an ammonia spill in the fall of 2015 forced a closure of its mill causing a drop in share price. Then in January 2016 Rubicon reduced its gold reserve estimate from 2.2 million ounces to 300000 ounces an 86 per cent decrease. The correction was a result of Rubicon going straight from a preliminary economic assessment to construction skipping the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies that would have helped the company understand the structure of the deposit. Once in production in June 2015 Rubicon realized that the deposit was more complex than estimated; they were not mining gold in the expected concentrations and thus had to decrease estimates. The impact for Lac Seul was that all negotiations and potential agreements were on hold as the company tried to maintain solvency or find a willing buyer.AurCrestTribute Minerals Inc. (Tribute) was a Canadian gold miner with a property at Richardson Lake part of the Red Lake gold complex. Tribute’s chief executive officer was Ian Brodie-Brown. In 2006 Brodie-Brown sent a letter to the Lac Seul community to introduce himself and his company. Receiving an introductory letter was a first for Lac Seul; they were impressed. Although nothing materialized from those first interactions the two parties kept in touch over the years. When Lac Seul wanted to form a junior exploration company they asked Brodie-Brown for help. After considering several options they decided to rename and repurpose Tribute as AurCrest Gold Inc. In 2011 the community invested $500000 for a 9.9 per cent share and acquired a non-rotatable seat on the board of directors. Chris Angeconeb Lac Seul’s flood claim coordinator was appointed director. Subsequently Angeconeb was made general manager of economic development for Lac Seul; then in July 2015 he was hired by AurCrest as executive vice-president.Hiring Angeconeb into an executive position had interesting implications for Lac Seul given that the first sentence of AurCrest’s mission statement was “Create and maintain important relationships with the local indigenous peoples and share the benefits the industry has to offer.” AurCrest was attempting to honour their mission by having Angeconeb with all of his development experience as an executive of the company.Additionally in October 2015 AurCrest incorporated Wiigwaasaatig Energy Inc. to develop renewable energy projects including wind solar and biomass in partnership with First Nations communities proximal to AurCrest’s mining properties. This included Lac Seul. Cat Lake First Nation was also close to AurCrest’s Richardson Lake gold property. AurCrest signed an agreement to develop power with Cat Lake who had some experience and an Ontario license for electrical power transmission—keys for this kind of project. Although exploration and development slowed as part of the mining cycle developing renewable energy infrastructure showed potential for future benefits and developing relationships.Current statusLac Seul had made significant progress in recovering from past injustices committed by the government and private parties. The community had used past settlement money from the timber claim to improve infrastructure build an arena and provide resources for community members. A number of joint ventures had been established in construction food services and exploration services. A Tim Hortons franchise was purchased in partnership and was successfully operating in Sioux Lookout. The band owned a 25 per cent share in the Lac Seul Generating Station. Obishikokaang Resources Corporation established in 2012 was awarded a license to manage and harvest the local forest on behalf of the First Nations communities. A training centre had been established in a converted school in the nearby village of Hudson. The agreement with Goldcorp included training community members for work in mining. These were all positive exemplars for other communities.Developing the capacities of members in the community was an area of potential development. The most recent statistics revealed that the community’s level of education was much lower than the Ontario average (see Exhibit 3). Sixty-four per cent of the population had no degree certificate or high school diploma. Only 19 per cent of the community had a high school diploma compared to 27 per cent in Ontario. Convincing students to stay in school and complete their secondary education then go on to university would be a laudable and valuable goal. Financial resources combined with promotion and counseling would help the community realize this goal.In spite of the band’s economic development they still faced a higher than average unemployment rate. Census data indicated the unemployment rate for Lac Seul was 29.6 per cent compared to 8.3 per cent for Ontario. As well it had recently come to light that the government was underfunding children’s services for First Nations. In addition to education employment and children’s services there were health and housing issues to deal with. The market for timber harvesting was depressed and awaiting an upturn in the economy. Mining was also in a down cycle. The band was constrained by geography and personnel capacity issues limiting the number of initiatives they could develop or concurrently manage. Their immediate focus was the anticipated resolution of the flood claim and the benefits the settlement might provide for the community. FutureHaving arrived at the training centre for the meeting Bull joined the economic development manager Manitowabi and band councillors to discuss future directions. The band had resources for some initiatives but like other economic players they were waiting for an economic turnaround that would create opportunities for further exploration and mining agreements. The flood claim was coming to trial in September and would likely bring a significant settlement. The band had commissioned a survey of the community to identify priorities for use of any settlement from the flood claim. The survey revealed a need for health promotion (re)development of cultural heritage infrastructure education and business loans and opportunities. There was much planning to do.The atmosphere at the meeting was positive. The group discussed the economic environment and how companies were becoming more receptive to their duty to consult and accommodate aboriginal interests. The general public and the government seemed more receptive to holding companies accountable for their corporate social responsibility a topic of increasing interest for Canadians. The Red Lake gold trend held potential for more gold reserves particularly as deep mining techniques became more economically feasible. Bull inquired whether Manitowabi had heard of any new exploration or business opportunities at the Red Lake Camp. One problem was that the mining liaison office in Red Lake was not staffed. This meant that no one from Lac Seul was supervising the assignment of contracts employment or joint venture opportunities with Goldcorp or other mining companies. Although Manitowabi was not aware of any current opportunities he speculated that companies were more likely to approach the First Nation as Tribute had done 10 years earlier; it was less likely that the band would have to resort to legal channels again. Bull hoped Manitowabi was correct but vowed to remain vigilant for opportunities and the rights of his community. As the meeting broke Bull wondered what were the next concrete steps to take to ensure continuing economic development in the community.exhibit 1: Indian Agent Letter to Ottawa regarding Potential FloodSource: Lac Seul First Nation used with permission.exhibit 2: Transcript of the Lac Seul commemorative plaque located at entrance to reserveThe Flooding of ObishikokaangThe Obishikokaang Anishinaabeg have lived in the Lac Seul region since the glaciers receded during the last Ice Age. This is their traditional territory acknowledged as a gift from Giche-Manidoo. For generations the summer settlement of these people served as a spiritual centre of Midewiwin the Grand Medicine Society of the Ojibwe.For thousands of years the Anishinaabeg of Lac Seul lived prosperously through their traditional practices of hunting trapping fishing and harvesting. With the westward expansion of Canada the Obishikokaang people entered into 1873 Treaty #3 through an adhesion in 1874 signed by Napanayyahgaynum (Chief John Crow Martin later Cromarty). This Treaty promised the Lac Seul people relocation to a specific set of reserve lands and was committed to ensuring that they could continue to hunt trap fish and harvest. The Chief and Elders carefully chose the reserve site with a view to preserving their traditional way of life. The location offered bountiful fishing and trapping access to sweet water and a shoreline that was ideal for cultivating wild rice.In the early 20th century the demand for electricity in Northwestern Ontario grew. The river-lake system of Lac Seul was identified as a promising reservoir for hydroelectric generation and for flood control downriver and work began in the late 1920s.In 1934 without knowledge or permission of the Obishikokaang Anishinaabeg the dam was activated and the lake rose by 12 feet. The people of Obishikokaang returned from a winter of trapping to find their summer settlement along the reserve shoreline under water.Eighty-two reserve houses were destroyed along with the Council houses farms barns the powwow grounds and the sacred Midewiwin Grounds. Hundreds of Lac Seul people found themselves homeless and many families were forced to leave the reserve in order to survive. Flooding of the lake affected the resources the Lac Seul people depended on for their livelihood. Timber muskrat swamps and agricultural areas were lost and the vital wild rice beds decimated.This memorial is dedicated to those members of Obishikokaang's original seven Clans made homeless and destitute by the flooding of Lac Seul in 1934 and for those members who have lost their lives on a treacherous and changed lake.Source: Transcribed by the author.

Three days after Slimane�s surprising departure the brand announced that 36-year-old Anthony Vaccarello would be its next creative director. After decades of leadership turmoil and financial instability at YSL Vaccarello was facing increasing stakeholder pressure to build off the success that Slimane had achieved in just three years as creative director. Vaccarello�s first collection (debuted during the Paris Spring/Summer 2017 Fashion Week in September 2016) received mixed reviews from critics and shoppers raising questions about the brand�s future. The global luxury fashion industry had become increasingly competitive with over 20 top and other numerous brands competing for the industry�s estimated value of �265 billion in 2017. Had YSL made the right decision in selecting Vaccarello to lead the company? To help YSL remain one of the top brands in the fashion industry should Vaccarello implement a strategy that built upon the successful foundation created by Slimane or should he develop new strategies going forward?The Inspiration behind YSL Born in Oran French Algeria in 1936 Yves Henri Donat Mathieu-Saint-Laurent (Saint Laurent) spent his youth studying fashion and designing dresses for his mother and sisters. In 1953 at the age of 17 he won first prize at the International Wool Secretariat Contest in Paris sparking a lifelong fashion career. Arriving in Paris to receive his prize Saint Laurent met Michel de Brunhoff president of the International Wool Secretariat Contest and director of French Vogue. Brunhoff immediately recognized Saint Laurent�s talent for haute couture (literally translated to mean �high dressmaking�). While Saint Laurent continued school Brunhoff published the student�s drawings and designs in Vogue magazine receiving strong support from readers. Upon graduating high school Saint Laurent returned to Paris to enrol at the prestigious �cole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne to continue studying high-end dressmaking. Haute couture originated in 19th-century Paris and grew to become an industry that comprised works from influential brands like Givenchy Balenciaga Chanel and Dior. Haute couture was marketed to a wealthy elite clientele as the highest form of fashion offering luxurious hand-designed hand-sewn clothing using the most expensive fabrics of the highest quality. As time passed the industry grew in fashion markets around the world with haute couture designs becoming references for new fashion trends.Despite leaving fashion school after only three months Saint Laurent won the International Wool Secretariat contest again in 1953. Brunhoff recognized strong similarities between Saint Laurent�s work and that of Christian Dior the fashion designer Brunhoff was working with for his next collection. Brunhoff connected Saint Laurent with Dior and the young Saint Laurent was hired shortly after in 1955 as a design assistant in Dior�s couture house (the House of Dior). As Dior�s apprentice Saint Laurent gradually received more responsibilities while his contribution to the overall artistic direction of the fashion house also increased. Watching Saint Laurent grow and develop Dior stated �Saint Laurent is young but he has an immense talent. . . . I think it is time to reveal him to the press. . . . [He] will be my successor.� With Dior�s death in October 1957 management considered shutting down the House of Dior a common practice in the industry when the house�s creative director died; however with the support of management Saint Laurent was appointed as the creative director of the prestigious house in 1958. Saint Laurent was just 22 years old. Two weeks after his appointment as the House of Dior�s creative director Saint Laurent retreated to his home in French Algeria locking himself in his room to work on drawings and designs. Returning to Paris two months later with more than 800 drawings Saint Laurent recollected �I was in a complete state of euphoria while preparing this collection.� His drawings drew an unexpectedly positive reaction from the public after his first fashion show which was made possible with assistance from Pierre Berg� a rising figure in the Parisian art and fashion scene. The show provided the opportunity for Saint Laurent and Berg� to meet for the first time sparking a life-long working�and at times romantic�relationship. With Saint Laurent�s works receiving global recognition the French press labelled him �the little prince of the fashion industry� and a national hero for saving the House of Dior. Unfortunately this initial success and recognition would soon give way to difficulties and setbacks.LAURENT�S EARLY STRUGGLES AS CREATIVE DIRECTOR With the House of Dior reaching new levels of success under Saint Laurent�s direction the Algerian War began in 1954 as Algerian separatist movements entered into an armed conflict with France. In 1960 Saint Laurent was notified by the Algerian military of his obligatory military service; however he resisted conscription causing public disapproval with many calling him a coward and a traitor to his country. As a result of this intense public criticism Saint Laurent developed mental health issues including depression and was hospitalized making him physically incapable of serving his military service in Algeria. In light of his avoidance of military service and his fight with depression Saint Laurent was released by the Dior brand in 1960 leaving him struggling to find work in the couture fashion industry. After leaving the House of Dior Saint Laurent�s depression intensified because he asserted he was not designing or creating anymore. Nevertheless Berg� supported Saint Laurent throughout this ordeal ultimately convincing Saint Laurent to open his own couture house. Berg� suggested that he serve as administrator of the couture house with Saint Laurent serving as the creative director. Lacking funding for such a project Saint Laurent entered a legal battle with the House of Dior over a breach of contract for his unfair dismissal as creative director. Winning the dispute and collecting �48000 the partners Saint Laurent and Berg� along with assistance from former Dior employees and financial backing from U.S. businessman J. Mack Robinson opened Saint Laurent�s own fashion house (YSL) in Paris in January 1962. Yet many questioned whether Saint Laurent was ready to overcome his battle with depression and lead his new brand to success. going his own way: The RISE of YSLRelying on his early experience Saint Laurent introduced his first haute couture collection under the Yves Saint Laurent logo modernizing women by designing clothes with similar dress styles and codes as men yet with a more feminine appearance. As Saint Laurent continued to design he released famous works including the caban and trench coat in 1962 the first smoking suit for women in 1966 the saharienne and the first tailleur pantalon in 1967 and the first jumpsuit in 1968. That same year Saint Laurent shocked the fashion world with his �see-through� design for shirts a style that would continue to inspire for decades to come. Saint Laurent found creative inspiration in his love of theatre and the d�cor and costume designs that appeared on stage and in films. Continuing to redefine women�s clothing and styles throughout the 1960s he expanded his creative repertoire to include fashion for men and a ready-to-wear line targeting a rising new trend that focused on less affluent shoppers.Aiming to make haute couture more accessible Pierre Cardin was the first designer to release luxury ready-to-wear clothing in 1959. With global disposable incomes rising and the world becoming increasingly interconnected (with products and services easily traded between countries) ready-to-wear fashion immediately became a threat to the haute couture industry. Traditionally the haute couture industry was highly product oriented emphasizing the extraordinary quality of its products without regard for costs and profitability but the ready-to-wear business revolutionized the garment industry by dramatically decreasing the price of clothes and shifting focus to everyday styles for customers around the world.Saint Laurent�s passion for women�s fashion stemmed from his desire to emphasize both the beauty and comfort of women�s clothes. He sought to provide high-fashion dresses to all women regardless of wealth or status. Aware of Cardin�s ready-to-wear fashion revolution Saint Laurent opened his first ready-to-wear store Saint Laurent Rive Gauche in 1966 separating his haute couture collection from this new ready-to-wear collection. Saint Laurent Rive Gauche sold luxurious high-end ready-to-wear clothes at more affordable prices than those in traditional haute couture stores and was the first ready-to-wear shop that carried the name of a haute couture designer. Following the success of Saint Laurent Rive Gauche the company opened a second shop in New York City in 1968 and another in London England in 1969. In the same year Saint Laurent opened a new boutique featuring his ready-to-wear men�s fashion Rive Gauche Homme. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR YSLComplementing the new ready-to-wear couture business YSL slowly diversified into additional industries. In light of its growing success in 1963 YSL was bought by Charles of the Ritz an established cosmetics company highly recognized for its perfumes with Berg� stating that the purchase �fulfills the longstanding desire of Mr. Saint Laurent to assume a more personal role in the creative and artistic development of high-quality perfumes and makeup.� With the acquisition Charles of the Ritz aimed to launch the YSL Beaut� brand by releasing cosmetics and perfumes. Integrating with Charles of the Ritz resulted in a series of successful YSL perfumes including Opium (launched in 1977) and YSL Nu. Eventually despite Saint Laurent�s passion for haute couture fashion and clothing represented only a small portion of YSL�s activity. In addition to its highly successful and globally recognized clothing perfumes and cosmetics the company also manufactured leather goods shoes and jewellery and even began licensing for everyday accessories ranging from eyeglass frames to pens. Reacquiring the YSL BrandIn 1986 Saint Laurent became the leader of his own house again through the sale of Charles of the Ritz to U.S. pharmaceutical company E.R. Squibb & Co. presenting Saint Laurent and Berg� with the opportunity to purchase full control of the group�s couture activities. For approximately �422 million Saint Laurent not only regained control of the perfume business but also added operations roughly 10 times the size of the company�s couture house. Although reacquiring the brand caused Berg� and Saint Laurent to amass a significant amount of personal debt the partners received financial backing from a small number of third parties to help finance the deal including a well-known Italian businessman and investor Carlo De Benedetti who purchased 25 per cent of YSL.Once Saint Laurent and Berg� regained managerial control the business partners began making strategic decisions to revive their struggling brand�s business successfully grouping all YSL products under the same company. Hoping to recover some of the large expenses involved in acquiring the perfumes division Saint Laurent prepared the launch of a men�s perfume Jazz representing the company�s first perfume line developed entirely in-house to compete with the dominant brands in the men�s perfume market (e.g. Azzaro Paco Rabanne and Laroche). Seeking to relieve the debt Saint Laurent and Berg� aimed to publicly release the company to Paris�s secondary market. However a 1987 stock market crash halted all public stock plans and the subsequent laws brought strict restrictions on new public offerings leaving Saint Laurent and Berg� with an increasing debt that prevented a turnaround of their businesses.Losing Control of the Business and Bowing outDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s YSL saw declining interest from the public. Fearful of a hostile takeover from its third-party owners Berg� took the precaution of changing the company�s structure transforming YSL into a limited partnership. Berg� and Saint Laurent quickly found the funds to purchase all of De Benedetti�s shares bringing the pair�s personal debt to an estimated _850 million. Although the limited partnership allowed Berg� and Saint Laurent to retain control of YSL�s direction in the short term the debt it created ultimately led to the partners� loss of the company entirely.As global competition in the fashion and luxury industries rose the YSL brand image slowly deteriorated. With its accumulating high debt Berg� Saint Laurent and their partners were unable to make strategic moves to turn around the company�s performance. At the time only Elf Sanofi a French medical and beauty brand remained capable of acquiring YSL and assuring its future. However Berg� and Saint Laurent struggled as negotiations with Elf Sanofi continued through 1992 the 30th anniversary of YSL. While negotiations dragged on Berg� and Saint Laurent�s personal debts grew taking their toll on the partners. The partners privately sold a portion of their stock to raise an estimated _100 million providing temporary debt relief. Unfortunately the sale violated insider trading policies forcing YSL to reveal first-half losses to the public in 1992. As a result French pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi acquired YSL through a stock swap in 1993. Surrendering control of their couture house Saint Laurent and Berg� received a small stake in Elf Sanofi and partial control of their fashion businesses but Elf Sanofi would fully manage the YSL Beaut� brand looking to create synergies between cosmetics and perfumes. However the years of turmoil at YSL had left Elf Sanofi a new division with declining sales small profits and a bleak future. In 1997 Elf Sanofi ended production of YSL�s ready-to-wear business focusing solely on the haute couture business. Although the company hired well-known Slimane in 1997 (to revive the Rive Gauche menswear fashion) and Alber Elbaz in 1998 as creative directors the two artists left in 1999 due to rumours of a subsequent takeover. As Elf Sanofi aimed to sell its brand in 1999 French billionaire Fran�ois-Henri Pinault owner of the Pinault-Primtemps-Redoute Group (PPR) sought to diversify his businesses and enter the luxury goods industry. THE PPR GROUP: NEW IDEAS AND LEADERSHIPA huge conglomerate engaged in developing high-growth consumer and luxury brands PPR aimed to grow by focusing on the luxury industry while selling its non-luxury businesses. PPR acquired 42 per cent of Gucci a highly successful Italian ready-to-wear company through a series of transactions in 1999. Yet when PPR made the strategic business decision to expand Gucci into more business segments Gucci�s brand became easily accessible and its valuable sense of exclusivity was lost. PPR also acquired 14 other luxury brands to support its Gucci acquisition leveraging the group�s resources and capability to scale up and making its business more focused and profitable. Accordingly PPR chose to have multiple brands complement one another rather than compete. Through the experience of acquiring Gucci Pinault gave the creative directors a high level of autonomy and control allowing them to be involved in decisions about product design brand image store concept and marketing. Pinault believed that a creative director should be matched with a strong chief executive officer (CEO) to align the company�s strategic and creative visions.Seeing success with Gucci and its other newly acquired brands PPR took its first steps toward the development of a multi-brand luxury goods group by acquiring YSL YSL Beaut� and the Italian women�s footwear company Sergio Rossi in 1999. Contrary to YSL�s past acquirers PPR denied unconditional authority to Saint Laurent and Berg� because their vision did not align with the company�s vision. Relinquishing power and control to Pinault Saint Laurent and Berg� both announced their retirement in 2002 but remained advisors to their company. However without Saint Laurent�s creativity as a fashion designer and Berg��s influential managerial control and involvement some questioned whether PPR could succeed with its focused turnaround strategy for YSL.Shifting StrategiesUnder PPR YSL shifted focus back to the haute couture business unilaterally implementing a drastic turnaround strategy. During the 1990s many luxury brands began building and selling out of directly operated stores; franchised operations were bought out or closed while wholesale distribution through department stores and independent boutiques was halted.  PPR separated YSL�s Beaut� brand perfumes and cosmetics business from the couture house. Although directly operated stores represented a costly proposition this arrangement allowed luxury houses to maintain full control over their store operations presentation services and pricing as well as the range of products available and sold reducing vulnerability to the �grey market� or parallel trade (i.e. the trade of a product through some distribution outlets that were legal but unintended by the original manufacturer).In 1999 Tom Ford the creative director of Gucci joined YSL�s couture house implementing his �porno-chic� style that had achieved global success and recognition with Gucci. However despite his historical success with Gucci Ford failed to revive the YSL brand and was replaced by Stefano Pilati in 2004. Upon becoming the new creative director Pilati stated �Saint Laurent did everything. . . . You go to the YSL archives and you feel he thought of any idea I could ever imagine. It�s intimidating.� At the same time Pilati had a history with YSL leading the design of ready-to-wear clothing designs since 2000. As creative director Pilati introduced styles like the tulip skirt muse bag and YSL Tribute sandal; however he struggled to revive the brand his designs being often questioned by the public. YSL began buying back a number of licensing agreements in order to maintain control of its brand image. Following the decision to decrease the number of licences 80 per cent of YSL sales were made in-store.  Saint Laurent�s control of licences allowed the company to design its products with an in-house team control manufacturing and only use licences for areas of technical expertise. As YSL struggled with licensing issues PPR faced its own financial instability and shrinking competitiveness. Due to internationalization PPR�s revenue began dropping leaving stakeholders wondering if PPR would be able to turn around the struggling YSL brand. Despite the group�s diversification and market entry strategies through acquisitions the competitive nature of the luxury fashion industry remained a formidable obstacle. BEYOND SAINT LAURENT: THE LOSS OF A LEADER AND START OF A NEW ERA On June 1 2008 Saint Laurent died of brain cancer at his Paris residence. The world mourned his unexpected passing. For more than 40 years he had designed everything from gowns to ready-to-wear fashion helping bring global recognition to haute couture fashion. With designs and styles aiming to create �empowering yet feminine looks for women� Saint Laurent revolutionized the way modern women dressed popularizing styles such as the pantsuit pea coat safari jacket �le smoking� tuxedo and trench coat as well as unisex perfumes. Saint Laurent�s legacy continued to inspire fashion designers and influence the way women dressed and despite his death the YSL brand continued its operations releasing new products under PPR. Paul Deneve CEO of YSL�s couture house from April 2011 confessed that the company might return to competing in the haute couture business. In 2011 YSL�s sales increased by 32 per cent to �354 million�significant progress from its struggles in the early 2000s when YSL fought to remain profitable (and had even recorded losses of �37 million in 2000). Hedi Slimane: Stepping out of Saint Laurent�s ShadowWith Pilati leaving YSL in February 2012 Slimane had returned again to the couture house assuming the position of creative director for both men�s and women�s styles. Before during a brief period from 1997 to 1999 Slimane had been appointed by Berg� (CEO at the time) to work with the house. This time Deneve appointed Slimane with the idea of reviving the previously abandoned ready-to-wear line. Pinault explained �We needed someone who understood the brand who knew what the brand was in the 1960s and 1970s but to use that in a very modern new way . . . [and Slimane] is the only one capable of that. This appointment was also said to be endorsed by Berg� who always defended [Slimane] against his critics. His understanding comes with a very strong very clear vision.� Slimane�s artistic impact was immediate increasing YSL�s operational income to �41 million in 2012 (a figure that had been just �300000 in 2008). Slimane received strong support from YSL management as well as Berg�; however his dictatorial style of decision-making drew some concern. In June 2012 Slimane changed the name of YSL�s ready-to-wear brand from Yves Saint Laurent to Saint Laurent Paris releasing its first line as part of the spring�summer collection. The line was meant to act as a means to unify the ready-to-wear brand with YSL�s historical roots. The displayed objective signalled a return to the company�s original ready-to-wear shop (Saint Laurent Rive Gauche). Slimane wanted to preserve the Yves Saint Laurent brand for a potential comeback of the house�s haute couture branch which had halted a few years prior to Saint Laurent�s death; however the brand renaming confused the public. Fearing that the Yves Saint Laurent logo would disappear customers rushed to buy what they thought would be the last clothes with the historical logo. At the same time Slimane moved the house�s design studios from Paris to Los Angeles the city Slimane resided in since 2010. Some perceived this move as the opportunistic decision of an empowered manager who was already living in Los Angeles. In spite of the criticism Slimane continued designing and creating out of Los Angeles making a collection inspired by the grunge music scene and appointing rock artists like Marilyn Manson and actress Courtney Love as the new ambassadors of the brand. In both art and business names and faces for a brand had always been important; the choice of Manson and Love confused many YSL�s customers. Yet the public�s opinion never influenced Slimane; he rarely spoke with the press or fans after fashion shows and did not explain the inspiration or references behind his works.Slimane used his own leadership style to bring a number of significant changes to the house repositioning the brand by bringing back the �utmost modernity and fashion authority� while maintaining the original value of the founder during his short tenure with the house. As YSL�s creative director Slimane was entrusted with the supervision of all strategic projects resulting in the creation of a new concept shop in Paris and the development of a new website (ysl.com). Berg� recognized behind Slimane�s grunge inspiration the desire to flaunt conventions believing it was consistent with Saint Laurent�s principles of questioning the nature of luxury and colliding street fashion with the painstaking techniques of couture. Slimane was described as running a �fashion dictatorship� but management trusted him because of his success in reviving YSL�s ready-to-wear business. Nevertheless the public questioned whether the success of Slimane and the house�s ready-to-wear business would continue long term. On April 1 2016 YSL and the Kering Group (previously PPR) announced Slimane�s departure. Slimane had successfully turned the once-sluggish couture house into one of the world�s leading luxury brands with a reported revenue of �974 million in 2015�a 38 per cent increase since Slimane�s appointment as creative director (see Exhibit 1). The Kering Group had also experienced recent growth and success (see Exhibits 2 to 4). Chairman and CEO Pinault stated �What [YSL] has achieved over the past four years represents a unique chapter in the history of the house. I am very grateful to Hedi Slimane and the whole [YSL] team for having set the path that the house has successfully embraced and which will grant longevity to this legendary brand.� However neither Slimane nor the Kering Group made further comments about Slimane�s departure or successor raising questions about the brand�s ability to succeed without his leadership and direction.Anthony Vaccarello: SAINT Laurent�s Legacy Lives On Three days after Slimane�s departure on April 4 2016 YSL introduced Vaccarello as the next creative director of the YSL brand. Vaccarello possessed a background in the fashion industry; he had founded his own brand in 2009 and served as the creative director of Versus Versace since 2015. His responsibilities as creative director for YSL extended to the women�s and men�s clothing categories as well as the revived couture line and overall brand image. (YSL Beaut� was managed separately by French makeup artist Tom Pecheux.) In September 2016 Vaccarello announced the presentation of his first collection during the Paris Spring/Summer 2017 Fashion Week (see Exhibit 5). He noted that he wanted to reference and acknowledge Saint Laurent�s influence without recycling old ideas: �He did so many things I don�t want to repeat the things he has done. It�s not about the garments my idea of YSL lies in the attitude and how we handle things.� Vaccarello went on:I think luxury shouldn�t look like �luxury� today. It�s about the finishing inside the clothes or the quality of the fabric without it necessarily looking luxurious. It�s about the attitude of the girl also; it is not necessarily the clothes; you can have a luxury T-shirt and luxury jeans with some really great accessories. You can find really good clothes everywhere now. It�s the attitude. In 2014 the global luxury fashion industry was estimated to be a �224 billion market (a 3 per cent rise from 2013) and it was predicted that this growth rate would continue through 2017 with industry value estimates of up to �265 billion. Yet the luxury industry had become increasingly competitive with more than 20 brands competing against each other (see Exhibit 6). Despite the size of the industry recent currency fluctuations and the rise of company-owned retail and e-commerce had caused many high-end brands to struggle financially. Moreover shoppers were moving away from luxury brands and firms wondered how to establish the right pricing model (see Exhibits 7 to 10). Had the luxury fashion industry priced itself into extinction or would luxury fashions continue appealing to the global market in the future? Vaccarello�s debut at the Paris Spring/Summer 2017 Fashion Week was a success but some critics perceived the collection as cautious and closely resembling Saint Laurent�s past works. By promising that each new collection would emphasize different elements of Saint Laurent�s past designs it seemed Vaccarello was following the shadow of his predecessors at YSL rather than carving his own path. Could Saint Laurent�s legacy continue living on through Vaccarello or were new strategies required for the YSL brand to continue �walking down the runway� in this competitive industry?

Little information was available in Western literature about the Hermit Warrior concept. Rooted in the annals of ancient martial arts pedagogy the notion aptly described Chye’s personal motivations and professional mission. An equally appropriate literary analogy—and one more familiar to Western readers—for Chye and Yunquan’s business was the Robin Hood principle which matched the concept outlined by Yunquan. “We make money from people who can afford [it] and we subsidize people who cannot afford to pay” Yunquan explained. For Chye being the titular Hermit Warrior culminated in founding Kapap Academy Pte. Ltd. (Kapap Academy) in 2007. For over a decade Kapap Academy had been hailed as “the top realistic self-defense academy in Singapore” with a clientele of “over 140 companies and 90 schools.”On a damp Tuesday afternoon April 17 2018 Chye and Yunquan were nestled in Kapap Academy’s Robinson Square studio in the heart of Singapore’s central business district. They were deep in discussion contemplating their next moves. For over a decade Kapap Academy had trained thousands of people from all walks of life with its brand of self-defence known as Modern Street Combatives. And yet Chye and Yunquan were only just beginning to achieve their mission on a global scale. Not resting on their laurels Chye and Yunquan were determined to ensure that Kapap Academy’s social mission would proliferate internationally. This posed a number of challenges the most difficult being how to enter new markets. The partners debated the benefits of adopting either a licensing model or a franchise arrangement. Both options had their advantages and drawbacks. Adopting a licensing model would allow Kapap Academy to keep costs low and to reach customers without high set-up or marketing costs. However licensing was a piecemeal approach where expansion would be slow and quality control issues could potentially arise. On the other hand franchising meant that Kapap Academy as the franchisor would have more control over the overseas operations in order to better ensure training quality. However it would also be a much more costly endeavour. The economic support required by franchisees and the investment involved in managing operations were both substantial. As the afternoon passed this dilemma continued to worry the two founders as they wondered what their next step should be.THE HERMIT WARRIOR: MASTER TEO YEW CHYEAs the self-professed Hermit Warrior Chye made it his life’s mission to equip everyday people with the necessary skills to sense keep at bay and protect themselves from danger if ever called upon to do so. Chye’s mission mirrored that of Kapap Academy: to empower ordinary citizens to learn realistic self-defence skills. “Ordinary people” Chye explained “included [those] without martial arts skills or [without] the strength and size advantage.” Chye pointed out that this vulnerability “transcended communities [and therefore] also included the disadvantaged community.” Chye grew up with an abusive father and this had had a strong impact on him as Chye explained: “I grew up surrounded by domestic violence. I grew up constantly living in fear wondering when the next time violence would come. As a result of all this negativity no less from my own father I was very withdrawn. The violence formed the foundation of my deep-seated insecurity.”However it was not until many years later after a terrible tragedy that Chye founded Kapap Academy. “The main stimulus behind [Kapap Academy] was my brother’s death” Chye recalled. His brother had died in December 2007 following a seven-year coma. In 2000 Chye’s brother who had been badly beaten by five men and suffered a fractured skull remained in a coma until he died. “It was then that I decided to do something about people getting victimized” Chye said in a local paper interview. In Chye’s mind everyone deserved to be equipped with skills that would be “sufficient to make it out alive of such grave situations” whether or not they could afford the training for it.Having been a practitioner of martial arts for four decades Chye at age 59 had a muscular physique that was very advanced for his age. Chye’s study of martial arts included an expansive list of different disciplines ranging from Asian practices such as tae kwon do wing chun and ju-jitsu to Western combat styles such as Savate. Chye was a certified instructor for various techniques including Kapap the combat technique of his company’s name. Kapap was the original hand-to-hand combat used by the Israeli Special Forces. However Chye noted that the self-defence techniques taught by Kapap Academy also incorporated elements of Chinese martial arts American and British wrestling and others and were suitable for the everyday person on the street. Aside from being an accomplished martial artist Chye had also had a career in investment promotion at the Economic Development Board of Singapore and at private holding companies such as Wuthelam Holdings Pte. Ltd. He was a qualified psychologist who understood that a large part of self-defence involved environmental awareness taking preventive measures to “avoid and get out of danger” and “try not to get into trouble [in the first place].” Apart from his personal tragedy Chye’s background as a psychologist had also spurred him to establish Kapap Academy as he explained: “[Over] the last 20 to 30 years I’ve been providing free counselling for ladies who’ve been sexually assaulted and raped. It always troubled me because they describe how they got attacked [and] as a martial artist I could imagine them getting out if only they knew what to do.” THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET?Although the social impact of violence was clear a pressing issue that could not be ignored was whether it presented a viable business opportunity for Kapap Academy to pursue. What was the serviceable market for martial arts classes?The growth of the Singapore-based ONE Championship represented a strong case for a burgeoning martial arts market. ONE Championship was a mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion that boasted more than one billion viewers across 75 countries in 2015 just five years after its launch. In July 2017 it raised a total of US$100 million and was scheduled to stage a record 24 live events across Asia in 2018. However in December 2017 the Straits Times reported the difficulty of hosting large sporting events in Singapore given its small market highlighting the limited growth potential for the local sports industry. It further stated that ONE Championship’s growth would come from other parts of Asia rather than from the local population. The logical argument could then be made that given the country’s small domestic population and fan base there would similarly be a limited number of persons interested in any given sport. ONE Championship did not fairly represent the same market segment as the martial arts training market that Kapap Academy ostensibly served though it was related. A better comparative analysis would have been the performance of Singapore’s leading martial arts gyms. MMA gyms had seen a rise in popularity in Singapore since the early 2010s; Impact MMA and Evolve MMA were two market leaders. In an interview with the American news channel CNBC Impact MMA’s owner and founder Koh Kok Kwang said “MMA has really come on the scene here [since 2010].” Since opening its doors in 2010 Impact MMA had seen its membership steadily increase and stabilize at 400 to 500 active members at any given time. With an annual membership fee anywhere between S$1260 and S$2600 its estimated annual revenue amounted to almost S$1000000. Viewed with respect to the overall popularity of martial arts (using ONE Championship as an example) the growth potential in this industry was somewhat limited.THE CONFLUENCE OF MARTIAL ARTS AND REAL ESTATEWhen Kapap Academy opened in 2007 Chye was surprised to find that most of his students were female. His assumption was that “fighting” classes would appeal more to males. However it was clear by the initial response that the segment Kapap Academy served was differentiated from the gyms that provided services and products related to fitness aesthetics or sports. Kapap Academy was in the business of self-defence. It appeared that Yunquan’s opinion about rape being “the worst thing that could happen to a girl” resonated with others. Chye explained Kapap Academy’s value proposition to consumers as follows:There is a clear distinction between martial arts as a sport and martial arts used for self-defence. Modern Street Combatives is a very simplified way of engagement it’s not stylized so it’s very functional. Apart from combining various disciplines [to constitute Modern Street Combatives] we removed elements which were ineffective when the person was under duress. Pertinently it also teaches people to be good in the art of hurting people to get away from danger. What we teach is so different from the sport of martial arts [where] it’s over once the referee says it is. Sportsmen aren’t here to hurt people. It’s a different degree of intensity more basal animalistic and ferocious—it’s about survival. Your life depends on it.Therefore while the sporting and martial arts industry in Singapore did not appear to be a large serviceable market Kapap Academy was in fact operating in a different market segment altogether. It was operating in the niche personal safety industry. It appealed to consumers’ personal safety concerns. Despite its lean setup and considerably lower marketing presence compared to Impact MMA or Evolve MMA Kapap Academy generated a steady revenue of about S$300000 annually from its classes. This was a generous amount of revenue considering that the company maintained affordable rates even for persons who fell outside the scope of its target beneficiaries. For each hour-long session Kapap Academy charged an average of S$250 for corporate classes S$20 for adults and S$15 for students. Each of Kapap Academy’s courses lasted no more than 10 sessions with no expiry date for usage. This was in contrast to MMA gyms which relied heavily on repeat long-term customers paying a monthly subscription.  Kapap Academy’s outreach was mainly focused on institutions and corporations but that segment consisted of only about 30 per cent of its training revenue. Most revenue—about 70 per cent—came from direct consumers. One of Kapap Academy’s structured courses Personal Protection Level 1 (see Exhibit 1 Part A) could be subsidized by SkillsFuture credits. Other courses could be customized for people with specific needs (see Exhibit 1 Part B). These two features helped explain why most revenue was generated from individual customers. Chye noted that many students had registered for classes because they had moved to or were visiting countries with higher safety risks. However the revenue was generated by only 85 per cent of all users of Kapap Academy’s training services. Yunquan estimated that 15 per cent of the people Kapap Academy trained each year were its target beneficiaries. For several months each year instructors would provide free weekly training sessions at various shelters for women who were victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse. Kapap Academy also provided free (or at a heavily discounted fee of S$5 per hour) ongoing training for seniors and occasionally partnered with other social enterprises to help disadvantaged individuals. These indicators of strong consumer demand suggested that the personal safety training segment had a relatively more organic and larger growth potential than MMA gyms. Kapap Academy’s training schools were performing well but it was still difficult to determine if the business was able to sustain its mission. “We operate in a very low value industry and where overheads are high” Chye stated which was why he had always looked for other streams of income to remain independent and sustain growth.Chye invested in various properties to sustain his mission and add diversification to the business. Kapap Academy’s training revenue accounted for only half of the company’s total income. Yunquan estimated that another S$200000 in annual revenue was passive income generated from real estate investments. These assets were owned either by Gracie Asia Pte. Ltd. (with Chye and Yunquan as shareholders) or by Chye and his daughter (see Exhibit 2). Kapap Academy owned interests in both Singaporean (90 per cent of its portfolio) and Australian (10 per cent of its portfolio) properties.Chye and Yunquan expected this passive income to double within the next five years. Although the plan was optimistic they felt that it was attainable with a disciplined approach to growing these investments. The asset value of the real estate portfolio amounted to almost S$30 million. Half of the passive income generated each year was channelled back into reinvesting and acquiring new properties; the other half was reinvested in Kapap Academy to support its growing training division. Chye also invested S$150000 of his own savings each year to support Kapap Academy. By growing the portfolio and generating more passive income Chye was facilitating Kapap Academy’s mission. “We believe having strong passive income will allow us to keep our training fees affordable to as many as possible” explained Yunquan.THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IN SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA AT A GLANCEChye’s years of experience as an investment officer had clearly influenced his strategy to diversify his revenue streams and add passive income as a source of support for Kapap Academy’s mission. Unlike the MMA industry in Singapore the property market was generally on the rise given the island state’s land scarcity and high population density. According to a Business Times article Singapore’s property market was the most promising market among the Association of Southern Asian Nations or ASEAN member states which included the Philippines Thailand and Indonesia among the 10 member countries. The Morgan Stanley research report projected a bullish 8-per-cent rise for 2018 and again in 2019. It further expected new home sales growth to accelerate from 40 per cent in 2017 to nearly 50 per cent in 2018 citing reasons such as buyer demand outweighing a tight supply of unsold inventory. A substantial factor for increasing buyer demand could be attributed to the buoyant collective sale market Singapore had experienced in late 2017 and early 2018. Albeit less optimistic a Bloomberg survey similarly projected a sizeable increase in residential property prices by about 5.5 per cent in 2018. Historically Singapore’s residential property prices were always rising steeply. The country’s property price index (PPI) which measured price changes in residential housing was consistently above 100 per cent (except after the global financial crisis of 2007–2008) with an average of approximately 130 per cent each year for the previous decade (see Exhibit 3).Another rising property market was Australia. Investors and developers such as Far East Organization a leading Singaporean property developer were eager to enter the Australian market with expectations of increases in the coming years. In 2017 alone residential property prices increased in almost all major cities in Australia (see Exhibit 4) although real estate analysts had mixed expectations for 2018 and beyond. THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY AND GLOBAL MARKETSBeing a social enterprise had its perks. Government-supported agencies such as the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE) provided forms financing. Some local banking corporations such as the DBS Bank offered a Social Enterprise Package with favourable banking terms for a “business with a social purpose that has—or is striving towards—a commercially sustainable business model and delivers social impact to the chosen social cause.”Although Chye recognized the value of these benefits he was not keen on taking advantage of all of them as he claimed:A lot of people start something but the sustainability is not there so many of the organizations depend on government funding or charity from people and we do not believe in that. . . . I’m sceptical of charity because it’s based on goodwill . . . we create our own money . . . the idea is that in the future we don’t have to ask for money from the government.He went on to explain his motivations:We [at Kapap Academy] don’t want to become dependentonce the funds run out we might get into trouble. What we’re trying to do is create a vehicle to sustain it beyond my life. I never talk in terms of 10 years but in terms of 20–30 years when I’ll probably be dead; but before I die I need to know that the pieces are in place and even without me [the mission] will continue.Theoretically all social enterprises had to be financially stable. To achieve sustainability an enterprise’s costs were expected to fall as the number of its beneficiaries increased. This would be a key challenge for Kapap Academy as it pursued plans for international expansion. “When we first started we probably didn’t think beyond Singapore but now we’re thinking of communities beyond our borders like China and India” Chye admitted. Therefore Chye and Yunquan had to devise a strategy to go global while balancing cost speed and quality. As they deliberated on the various expansion pathways available they focused specifically on two options: the licensing model and the franchise model. Licensing Model OptionThe first option was for Kapap Academy to grant licences to teach self-defence under the Modern Street Combatives brand which Kapap Academy had registered as a trademark and use its structured syllabus and methodology in the training. The syllabus consisted of instructional videos and mandated workbooks created by Chye and Yunquan in Kapap Academy’s Singapore headquarters. Licensees could range from other martial arts schools to personal instructors. To be a licensed trainer either individually or under the auspices of a martial arts school the individual would have to undergo a week-long intensive training period to become a certified Modern Street Combatives trainer. Would-be instructors also had to negotiate a royalty fee to use Kapap Academy’s intellectual property. Kapap Academy planned to sell each licence for S$5000 to S$10000 with a nominal monthly contribution of under S$500 (which was part of the royalty fee that licensees were required to pay Kapap Academy) to continue using the license. Yunquan noted however that although they would have preferred to standardize the duration of licensing contracts across all licensees localized practices demanded that there should be variances.Kapap Academy considered adopting the “hub and spoke” concept for selling licences to would-be Modern Street Combatives instructors as Chye explained:The idea is to have a hub in every city with one or two “country managers” as partners and master licensees who would support sub-licensee instructors. The sub-licensees would be the spokes who would then in turn teach their local community Modern Street Combatives. Our licensees both master and sub-level are more akin to social activists and evangelists who are spreading [Kapap Academy’s] social mission.These master licensees would oversee the sub-licensees in governance and operational matters such as upholding quality of training ensuring compliance with the laws of the country they operated in and effecting timely collection of monthly licensing fees. Master licensees would be given defined geographical boundaries to operate in as Yunquan explained: “For example the master licensee for large countries like China would be defined by the city level. Within the city they may have say 20 to 40 spoke-level sub-licensees under their supervision and governance. For smaller countries the master licensee may be at a country level instead.”Structurally Kapap Academy would sign a contract with its hub-level master licensee partners and any disputes would be resolved under the Singapore judicial forum. The engagement with sub-licensees however would be directly with the hub-level master licensee where the agreement would be governed and settled under local laws. As a matter of consistency Chye had prepared a standard template for the basic terms but he was also aware of the need for flexibility to accommodate local practices. “The important thing here is that the substantive terms regarding the use of our intellectual property are consistent across all master licensees and sub-licensees” he said. As a go-to-market strategy Chye further advised on-boarding licensees to adopt the same tactics he used when he first acquired customersattracting corporations to control costs as he explained: When you just start out it’s not always necessary to have a large studio or any studio at all for that matter. Aim for the corporates. Offer to go to them and they will definitely be more likely to engage your services. More often than not they also have better [amenities] than what you as an instructor will be able to provide.However a key challenge with adopting the licensing model was lack of control over the quality of the Modern Street Combatives training being provided by licensees. Modern Street Combatives instructors could operate virtually autonomously after being certified and having paid the royalty. Although Kapap Academy as the licensor would retain control over the use of its intellectual property it could have no control over the licensee’s business. The issue of control was exacerbated by Kapap Academy’s lean set-up of only five core members which it continued to abide by (in principle) even as it expanded overseas. With only one or two managers overseeing each country supervising the quality of instruction would be an operational challenge. Therefore licensing was an affordable option for trainers to provide Modern Street Combatives to their local communities but it lacked quality control for Kapap Academy. Additionally Chye and Yunquan had hoped that licensees would be able to sub-licence the intellectual property through the “train the trainer” program if instructors were able to certify more licensees. The program would create a positive network effect and increase reach although potential quality issues were unavoidable. However Chye noted that one way to ensure that the Modern Street Combatives training was being taught correctly was to ask students to rate their instructors and training sessions. Franchise Arrangement OptionSetting up franchises would mean that Kapap Academy retained a considerable degree of control and could effectively have independent branches of the company overseas. Unlike the licensing model where independent instructors or other martial arts schools would teach Modern Street Combatives using the company’s supplementary videos and workbooks relatively autonomously a franchisee would have to operate the business with specific directions. It would also have to comply with the stipulated guidelines of the level and type of marketing the franchisee should carry out in its own local area. Chye and Yunquan would set up global Kapap Academy franchises as opposed to licensing the Modern Street Combatives methodology. However this would require the franchisee to have a physical studio (in most cases) which was a significant investment unless a studio was already available. Apart from the economic burden on the franchisee the franchising model also seemed to be a more cost-intensive market expansion option for Kapap Academy compared to the licensing model. The franchisee would presumably negotiate for more economic support in return for its own considerable investment. Although the franchisee was legally independent it was economically dependent on the integrated business system of the franchisor. However a key motivation of becoming a franchisee was to take advantages of the larger corporation’s brand and access to resources capabilities and market positioning. Unlike the licensing model where Kapap Academy would only need to certify the would-be instructor during the intensive one-week training period franchising would involve ongoing assistance by the franchisor. Setting up franchising arrangements also required both the franchisor and the franchisee to comply with jurisdictional requirements (where applicable) which represented an additional cost for all parties involved.However if the franchisor was able to support its network of franchises it could reap great benefits. For Kapap Academy setting up global franchises would offer the benefit of having a more permanent and reliable physical presence in new markets. This would intrinsically create greater brand awareness. Working with corporations and institutions could save Kapap Academy the expense of renting studios because these clients generally had their own facilities that allowed on-site training. However it would better serve Kapap Academy’s social mission if the franchisees could welcome customers to their own studios for training. Without a dedicated studio Kapap Academy would have to rely on partner martial arts gyms with licensed instructors to teach Modern Street Combatives to a non-corporate clientele. The Modern Street Combative program would thus be just be one of many self-defence techniques offered by the partner gyms which would lack active promotion of Kapap Academy’s brand equity. Overall however franchising would be a quicker way to penetrate and establish a presence in a new market. THE NEXT GENERATION AND BEYOND“I’ve spoken to my daughter about this and she knows that when I die the plan is for all the property investments held in my name be given to Kapap Academy’s cause” Chye stated. “She understands and is already carving her own path at 21” he added “but I’m glad that she too feels a strong compassion to help those in need.” Chye’s daughter Nicole was also actively involved in Kapap Academy’s mission as she worked on enhancing the product offering by introducing new technical elements to the fold. “It’s still [in its] early days but we are adding some features leveraging technology to our Modern Street Combatives training program to help keep people safe” Yunquan said. Chye would only consider his mission a success if he was able to “to reach out to at least two generations.” While he would not see it happen in his lifetime he had certainly laid the foundation for success. As the day wound down Chye and Yunquan’s conversation came to a close. The skies had cleared and the sun was setting. Yunquan packed up as she prepared to head out for an evening training session. She was in a hurry because the rush-hour crowd would soon flood the local subway train stations. “So we’ll pick up again tomorrow okay?” Chye asked as Yunquan was leaving. “Yes of course. See you in the morning” Yunquan responded before closing the door behind her. And suddenly the room was still. Chye stood squarely in front of the door taking a moment to organize his thoughts from the day’s discussion as the sound of Yunquan’s footsteps tapered off down the corridor. “It’s in good hands” he thought to himself.EXHIBIT 1: Modern Street Combatives MaterialsPart A: Level 1 and 2 WorkbooksPart B: Containment of Aggressive Situations Course for Front-line StaffSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: FINANCIAL STATEMENTs 2015–2017 (in S$) Note: S$ = Singapore dollar; US$1 = S$1.31 on April 17 2018Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: SINGAPORE’S Property Price Index 2008–2017Source: Prepared by the case authors with information from “Private Property Price Index by Type Quarterly” Data.gov.sg accessed October 19 2018 https://data.gov.sg/dataset/comparison-of-property-price-index?view_id=cced35b6-4c8a-477f-bca6-9cb480775f27&resource_id=5d9a30b6-137f-497d-ab38-b2a9508c7b18.EXHIBIT 4: AUSTRALIA’S Property Price Index ACROSS EIGHT CAPITAL CITIES FOR 2017Source: Prepared by the case authors with information from “6416.0—Residential Property Price Indexes: Eight Capital Cities Jun 2018” Australian Bureau of Statistic’s statistics accessed October 19 2018 www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6416.0.ENDNOTES

(AkzoNobel) was at the company’s Delhi headquarters going through reports on Dulux TileShield (TileShield) a brand on which she had been working for the last two months. Launched by AkzoNobel in 2006 TileShield quickly became synonymous with roof tile protection so much so that most competing brands in the category had adopted similar-sounding names. AkzoNobel’s competitors such as Asian Paints Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac Paints had all developed similar technologies which stepped up competition in the new category of exterior paints. As competition grew it became increasingly difficult for TileShield’s sales force to ensure that it continued to be the preferred brand among customers. Even though the brand was facing profitability pressures the regional sales office in Kerala was putting pressure on the brand team to reduce prices. The time for urgent action had arrived.Dhawan knew she had to address the immediate pricing demands of the brand. She had to decide whether this was the right time for a major change in the brand offering even though the effects of such a change would not be felt before the next sales season about six months away. The alternative option was to wait and make only minor changes based on the identified issues and see how the market responded in the coming months. This wait-time delay however might take away TileShield’s early-mover advantage something the company had been cashing in on for a long time. Dhawan and her team were also debating whether or not there was a need to take any steps at all. Perhaps what TileShield was experiencing was simply the norm in the life cycle of a product that operated in a fiercely competitive market.THE Indian Paint IndustryUntil the 1960s the Indian paint industry was dominated by the unorganized sector. As late as 2009 the unorganized sector catered to about 35 per cent of the total demand. Most of the organized players in the paint industry operated at the national level while their unorganized counterparts operated primarily at the regional level.The industry was broadly divided into two segments—decorative paints and industrial paints. In the organized sector decorative paints accounted for about 70 per cent of the market share and industrial paints accounted for the rest (see Exhibit 1). The decorative paints segment had a clear advantage over the industrial paints segment in terms of both market share and growth potential. Many types of decorative paints had been developed over a period of time and were classified under a unique system (see Exhibit 2). Between 2001 and 2010 the industry had grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 15 per cent attracting many national and international players. By financial year 2011 the size of the industry was estimated at approximately US$4.2 billion. There were four major participants in the market: Asian Paints Kansai Nerolac Paints Berger Paints and AkzoNobel Global (see Exhibit 3). A variety of products were available in the exterior paints segment as well. By and large organized participants sought to offer a wide range of products and variants (see Exhibit 4).Buyers and Influencers in THE MarketThe do-it-yourself culture was nearly absent in the Indian paints industry so channel members and other influencers played a key role in this market (see Exhibit 5). Since painting usually involved technical steps such as dilution (i.e. percentage of solvent added to the paint before application) opacity (i.e. non-visibility of the undercoats) and coverage (i.e. area covered by one litre of paint under the recommended dilution and number of coats) consumers in India rarely undertook the work themselves. Instead they outsourced painting jobs to contractors or to architects who generally made the paint-brand decision. Although this trend was changing somewhat with homeowners becoming gradually more involved in paint purchase decisions their input was restricted to choices of paint colour and shade. By building brands through mass advertising paint companies tried to reduce the influence of contractors and architects (customers) and increase the influence of homeowners (consumers) in decision-making; however they were still a long way from achieving their goal. AkzoNobelIn 1911 Brunner Mond & Co. began operations in Calcutta (now Kolkata) the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal to sell alkalis and dyes. It was one of the four companies that would eventually combine with three others in 1926 to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) (India). What followed was a period of sustained expansion diversification and growth. ICI began manufacturing activities in India in 1939 with the establishment of Alkali and Chemical Corporation of India Ltd. in Rishra West Bengal. In 1984 the ICI group companies in India were merged into what was one of corporate India’s largest mergers of that time. Nalco Chemicals India Ltd. was formed in 1987 with Nalco Chemical Company (United States) and AkzoNobel each holding 40 per cent of the equity. The first phase of AkzoNobel restructuring was completed in 1993 with the divestment of the seed fibre and fertilizer businesses. In 1995 the agrochemicals business was transferred to a joint venture with Zeneca Limited United Kingdom.In 2008 AkzoNobel N.V. became the sole owner of ICI. This shift in ownership became possible through an arrangement under Section 425 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 when ICI became a subsidiary of AkzoNobel N.V. To leverage the global strength of the AkzoNobel brand in 2010 ICI India Limited was renamed AkzoNobel India Limited.Roof Tile PaintsRoof tiles were a common feature of buildings in parts of India that experienced high rainfall such as the state of Kerala where these tiles were part of the traditional architecture. In Kerala AkzoNobel broadly divided housing into four types (a classification that was also used for consumer segmentation): middle-class houses bungalows villas and high-rise buildings.The state of Kerala had a high average annual rainfall and its two monsoon seasons—Edavappathy or the southwest monsoon (June to August) and Thulavarsham or the northeast monsoon (October to December)—tested the roofs of houses. Roof tiles were designed to bear the vertical impact of heavy rain and except for high-rise buildings were used in most homes in Kerala. The use of paint on the surface of roof tiles was intended to mitigate the effects of rain on the tiles. Historically regular exterior paints fulfilled this function; however research and development in the paint industry and growing customer awareness about the efficacy of painting roof tiles led to the birth of a new product category—roof tile paints. These new paints were made with a strong latex film that allowed them to bear the impact of rain much more effectively and for a longer period compared to the existing exterior paints. AkzoNobel India Ltd. (then ICI Paints) launched its pioneering product in this category in 2004 under the brand name Dulux TileShield (see Exhibit 6).By 2010 the category had acquired an identity of its own and consumers were able to distinguish between roof tile paints and other exterior paints. This level of improved consumer awareness was an outcome of promotional efforts by companies that provided point-of-sale material and by key influencers such as painters and contractors who purchased and used these paints. This growth in consumer awareness was accompanied by greater competition as other participants entered the market. By 2011 the category was expected to grow at a CAGR of 30 per cent for the next five years. Despite this growth spurt beyond the distribution of print material (e.g. product guides and paint-shade booklets) at the point of purchase no participant in the roof tile paint category spent additional money on media and promotional activities.Despite the growth of the category especially in the key state of Kerala TileShield sales did not grow in financial year 2011/12. According to the sales team the brand’s high price and increased market competition were responsible for its plummeting sales. Some time earlier on the recommendation of the sales team in 2010–2011 the company had adjusted the price of TileShield by offering a discount on the prevailing dealer’s price; however this adjustment had no visible effect on sales. Decreasing the price further would have resulted in reduced margins for dealers who were already complaining of the negative effect of past price cuts. Dhawan knew that further reducing TileShield’s price was not an option particularly given AkzoNobel’s bid to develop a premium brand image by keeping its prices 7 to 10 per cent above those of Asian Paints the overall leader in the decorative paints category.Apart from price Dhawan and her team had identified other potential problems related to past issues with TileShield such as increasing competition and rising consumer expectations among others.ProductAbout two years earlier one of TileShield’s product lots had been found defective. Consumers complained that the paint peeled off and faded quickly. The company recalled the entire lot after receiving multiple complaints but the negative effects of that product failure persisted. There had also been complaints by contractors regarding coverage issues but subsequent product testing showed that these charges were baseless. In 2012 TileShield contributed nearly 3 per cent to overall sales in AkzoNobel’s exterior paints division.PricingLike other industry participants AkzoNobel offered dealers a 5 to 8 per cent margin on the recommended prices which were market-driven and were called “market operating prices” (MOPs). The company followed a similar margin structure for TileShield. Only Asian Paints offered a lower margin of 3 to 4 per cent. As a brand in the premium paint category TileShield promised dealers higher margins. AkzoNobel’s policy of keeping its prices higher than those of Asian Paints allowed it to give dealers higher margins. The main paint base used in TileShield was sold to dealers at a price of US$83.60 per 18 litres as per the dealers’ price list (DPL) while the DPL of Asian Paints’ equivalent product TileGuard was US$72.40 per 18 litres. Despite this price difference dealers complained about the lower margins they were getting per 20-litre can (of which 18 litres consisted of base paint and the rest a mixture of tints required to get a desired shade). The volume was not necessarily always 20 litres but 20-litre cans were the market standard. Exhibits 7 8 and 9 show the pricing structure of the different participants for the two major shades “Terracotta Red” and “Sunrise” which accounted for 70 per cent of the volume of shades. After their discussions with the dealers the field team reported that despite higher base prices and percentage margins dealers were getting lower absolute margins on some of the TileShield shades they were selling. This point was yet to be verified.CompetitionTile paints belonged to a super-premium category of paints; therefore middle-class households did not accept them easily preferring instead to use regular exterior wall paints on their roof tiles. Even for companies with a presence in the tile paints category the focus area was bungalows. By 2011 the company faced strong competition from national players such as Asian Paints Kansai Nerolac Paints and Berger Paints. As the category gained greater acceptance and consumer awareness improved regional competitors began to enter the market. The attractiveness of the market also lured some international participants like Sherwin-Williams and Nippon Paint who were keen to make a foray into the Indian market. Some Southeast Asian companies also entered the fray. Southeast Asia had been the preferred employment location for residents of Kerala which made product acceptance relatively easy for these companies because of their existing connection to the country of origin. By 2012 there were about nine companies competing in the roof tile paints category in India (see Exhibit 9).AkzoNobel had seen its sales stagnate in recent years but having led the category with more than 30 per cent market share in the past the company expected sales to grow as the roof tile paint category grew. Market Research and Consumer BehavioUrThe company hired a market research agency to evaluate consumer perception and behaviour with a view towards gaining a better understanding of consumer needs and influences. The research targeted consumers contractors and dealers primarily in the city of Cochin in Kerala. It focused on people whose homes had been painted in the last six months and who had used either Dulux roof tile paints or selected competitor brands. The market research showed that increased competition had diluted the degree of product differentiation among the various brand offerings. Product attributes in the paints industry could be broadly divided into performance (durability coverage and ease of application) and aesthetics (the beauty or visual effect of the paint on the tile surface in terms of colour finish and similar factors). Typically consumers of paints placed value on the aesthetic aspects of the product while painters and contractors concentrated on performance attributes. However an initial exploratory study on consumer behaviour conducted as part of the overall market research reported that in the tile paint category consumers were more interested in the performance of the paint than in aesthetics. They saw roof tiles as the primary feature of the house which needed good protection (see Exhibit 11). Since the life of the paint emerged as the most crucial parameter for consumers most of the paint manufacturers in this category focused on paint quality.The study indicated a high preference for natural shades with Terracotta Red and Sunrise dominating among more than 2000 shades and constituting nearly 70 per cent of the demand. The study also identified some shades of blue and green that were gaining popularity. However natural shades emerged as the clear winners in both Indian and world markets. To understand consumer requirements the study tested three product concepts. Of these the first focused on performance the second on aesthetics and the third on aspects of both. The third concept was primarily used to reinforce an understanding of consumer expectations with respect to the first two concepts.The results of this part of the study revealed that consumers were well aware of the importance of the roof tiles’ function and therefore regarded performance as the primary requirement from roof tile paint. Further consumers were found to identify closely with use of the local terms for the various conditions of the monsoon seasons a factor that raised the question of how to use the local language on the product packaging as a way to attract buyers. Although the study results confirmed the importance of performance characteristics they also made differentiation more difficult. Repositioning the product in the minds of consumers emerged as the only option. Some of the positioning points identified in the study included longer life anti-fungal properties the stability of the colours (anti-fading) and anti-leak/waterproofing properties. Some of these attributes would necessitate product improvements by the company’s research and development (R & D) team.New Shade RangeAround the same time in 2012 AkzoNobel’s R & D team came out with a new range of metallic paint shades a product range that had already been accepted in some parts of the world. The historical attachment of Kerala temples and households to sheen supported the introduction of this new shade range. In 2011 one regional player Indigo Paints began to offer metallic shades in the roof tile category but despite using mass media to promote the product it had been unsuccessful. On the other hand metallic shades continued to be a popular choice for interior walls. For AkzoNobel the new shade range offered an opportunity to break free of similar offerings in the market but it was important to first gauge the acceptance of the product and the influence on decision-making.The study indicated that consumers regarded metallic shades as superior to matte-finish paints but tended to limit their use when it came to exterior paint jobs. For instance for aesthetic effect metallic paint would be applied on the borders of the roof for aesthetic effect. An alternative usage prevalent in Kerala temples was the application of metallic shades to pillars in houses. This use of paint was a market-abusive practice and posed another challenge to the company: Should it attempt to prevent this practice or should it support it to improve sales? The company was aware that encouraging the practice could lend support to the argument that tile and other exterior paints could be used interchangeably.Dilemmas and Decisions Dhawan and her team had to tackle the problem on two fronts: one involved gaining some clarity on product differentiation and positioning and the second involved getting the right combination of product promotion and other market parameters especially price. The team also had to make a decision on the introduction of the metallic shade range. Should they launch it separately as a new product range or as a new shade range in the existing product line? Alternatively should they opt against launching it at all?TileShield was still the market leader and due to the continued high growth in the roof tile paint category it still had reasonable growth potential. However the company could not ignore the pressure from the rapidly increasing competition. Further dipping sales and revenues posed a definite concern and the fact that dealers were demanding higher margins to push sales added an additional pressure. After considering multiple options in deciding the future of TileShield Dhawan and her team shortlisted three options. Continue with the Existing Value PropositionThe first option was to continue with the existing value proposition and focus on improving the paint’s quality and performance and if required adjust the price to make sure that both dealers and consumers were satisfied.In the team’s view one of the major advantages of this option was that it could be implemented quickly. The peak season for tile paint sales would end in less than a month and the other alternatives would take at least three to four months to implement. AkzoNobel believed that the main differentiators for TileShield in its current form were its quality and performance (see Exhibits 11 and 12). The management team felt that by making some adjustments to the product formulation the R & D team could help bring down prices to the extent that everyone in the value chain would benefit.The only concern with this alternative was that many international players had already entered the market and most of them claimed to have a better quality product than TileShield (see Exhibit 13). In such an environment it was unclear whether TileShield’s current positioning on quality was sustainable or not especially given that the brand had already lost about 5 per cent of its market share in the last two to three years; the current market share for TileSheild stood at 30 per cent.Relaunch TileShieldThe market research study had already established that performance more than aesthetics mattered to the consumer. Thus another option for the marketing team was to strengthen TileShield’s position in the market by redefining its consumer value proposition. This option could help the company in two ways. First it could help redefine the price which would reduce the pressure on the R & D department by removing the need for a reformulation effort. Second it could help TileShield achieve the desired differentiation in a highly competitive market.However the identification of a new value proposition was a challenge that would possibly require the company to redefine other product elements such as packaging and collaterals. The question was whether such a huge undertaking was called for since TileShield was still the market leader (see Exhibit 14). The other disadvantage of this alternative was that it would not benefit AkzoNobel in the current season; the company would have to wait until the following year to register the impact of the relaunch.Use the Brand Equity of WeatherShieldWeatherShield was the front-runner in the exterior paints division at AkzoNobel. It was a highly regarded exterior brand not only in India but also internationally. The company had given special attention to WeatherShield and had promoted it aggressively in recent years. It was the only brand in the exterior paints division at AkzoNobel that was promoted through television commercials in India and the company’s research had shown that this approach had helped WeatherShield gain high brand equity. The brand name WeatherShield was associated with many products at that time; however the advertising focus was primarily on Dulux WeatherShield and Dulux WeatherShield Max both of which were exterior wall paints.Could the company capitalize on WeatherShield’s brand equity to reduce some of the risks associated with the relaunch of TileShield? As Dhawan saw it there were two alternatives in associating with WeatherShield: one was to completely replace the brand name TileShield with WeatherShield Tile (one of the names that was under consideration) by the start of the next major sales season; the second was to retain both brand names namely TileShield and WeatherShield Tile and split the tile paint into two variants with TileShield focusing on its current positioning. This strategy was in line with the option to continue with the current value proposition. Launching WeatherShield Tile with the new positioning before the start of the next season would require the company to undertake some consumer research in the coming months. In either case the marketing team was not considering spending any additional promotional money on different media largely because of the absence of promotion within the category and also because the company was in the process of mapping out its media activities for the umbrella brand WeatherShield.Although the latter of the two alternatives seemed to address the existing problems there were some embedded issues. Keeping both brand names could lead to confusion among consumers. It could also lead to more supply chain problems as a result of doubling the number of stock-keeping units. Forecasting accuracy and the availability of stock-keeping units were already prevalent problems and the related issues were likely to double if there were two brand names to deal with. If the marketers chose to replace the brand name TileShield with WeatherShield the company would not be able to implement the change in the next three to four months. In either case there was the risk of a negative impact on the WeatherShield brand name.The Way ForwardDhawan had to weigh all the options in light of future considerations and the current market scenario. There were many unanswered questions: Was there a problem in the pricing structure? If so why had it not been identified by now? What changes if any needed to be made in the price points? What was more feasible— upward movement or downward movement in the price point? If the company did not increase TileShield’s market operating price what could it do to make sure that its profitability as well as that of its dealers was not affected? Could the different consumer segments be targeted in different ways? Could different value propositions be used for different segments? What should they do about the metallic shade range? Should it be launched or not? Should the positioning be changed? If so what would be the most suitable positioning point? Was further consumer research called for? Even if she was able to answer all these questions Dhawan faced a much bigger strategic decision: How should AkzoNobel’s marketing team execute the relaunch? Given the above questions if it were possible to make the necessary changes was a relaunch even required? The decision was an important one. If successful it would help one of the company’s more profitable brands retain its leadership and market share. If not the failure could affect the company’s profitability. Additionally Dulux’s other brands could also take a hit.EXHIBIT 1: INDIAN PAINT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS (2011)Notes: **Premium range is a major driver of growth of the decorative paints and roof tile paint category;Source: Company records.

She informed Amari that the school thoroughly enjoyed the demonstration he had given at its professional development day the previous week and was interested in buying several Speak-On packs. Amari had not expected such a fast response. He was still in the throes of preparing for future demonstrations at schools throughout September and October. While the government grant he received at the start of the summer helped to fund the prototype of Speak-On Amari needed to determine how much cash would be required in the first year of business once he incorporated on September 1. Furthermore Amari was contemplating what to do once he graduated next year and wondered if Speak-On could grow into a full-time venture or whether he should focus on school instead. He knew the new venture would require a great time commitment. COMPANY BACKGROUNDSpeak-On developed from the idea that students specifically in high school were not being adequately prepared in communication and public speaking skills. When Amari was in high school he was involved with an organization called DECA. DECAâs mission was to develop and help future leaders and provided Amari with an immense amount of practice with public speaking. He had won several competitions at both the provincial and national levels. In preparation for these competitions he would play games intended to improve his communication skills. DECA had provided Amari an avenue to develop his public speaking skills but he realized that most students didnât get this opportunity in high school. Education guidelines in Ontario described public speaking as an important skill to learn; many schools offered an optional public speaking course but Amari felt students were still unprepared once leaving high school. Amari had developed the initial business plan for Speak-On ha while enrolled in Business 2257 an accounting and business analysis course at Western University. He applied for and received a Government of Ontario Summer Company Grant that allowed him to develop a prototype of the game. SPEAK-ONSpeak-On was an educational game designed to be used in high school classrooms to improve communication and public speaking skills in students. It consisted of a paper card deck a digital rubric and an online tracking tool (see Exhibit 1). The questions in the card deck were organized by domain of knowledge relating to courses taught across high schools in Ontario. The main version of the game had students coming to the front of the classroom picking a card from the deck and speaking about the topic on the card for up to a minute. The digital rubric allowed teachers to grade and give feedback to students. The online tracking tool to see progression was a future development Amari hoped to have ready next year. Multiple variations on the standard version were provided in the instruction manual with Speak-On. The rubric also integrated with the Ministry of Educationâs curriculum. The initial versions Amari was planning to sell in the first year of operations were for grade 10 business and grade 9 and 10 English classes. Biology chemistry physics math French geography and history decks were under development. CONSUMER ANALYSIS Private SchoolsAmari attended a private high school and decided to focus his sales efforts on these schools due to both his relationships with past teachers and the financial flexibility these institutions had. Private schools generally charged fees for students to attend and therefore had more financial resources available. To help attract students and convince parents to send their children to private schools rather than free public schools private schools needed to provide an exceptional learning experience. This led private schools to be early adopters of new and experiential learning tools and games. Ontario had approximately 700 private schools. If teachers wanted to procure a learning tool for their students a pool of money was available for use. The teachers would approach their department head who had a budget of up to CA$1500 to spend on learning tools and games throughout the department as well as an additional $200 for each classroom. New learning tools and games would be used for only two to three years as private schools were constantly innovating. Amari believed that public schools would start implementing these games and tools after they had been widely used in private schools. StudentsStudentsâ future personal and professional success was increasingly tied to their competence with communication and more specifically oral communication skills. Competent speakers were more successful in conveying their knowledge ideas and opinions. This increasing importance had led to several countries such as Germany integrating public speaking into education standards. Mastering public speaking was now seen as a core competency for well-educated students. Interestingly while the question of how to promote public speaking competence in pre-school to grade 12 and higher education had increased research on higher education had greatly outpaced research for elementary and high school students. When students were developing public speaking skills research had concluded that authentic learning tasks opportunities to practice and self-assessment were best practices leading to positive effects.INTIAL YEAR OF BUSINESSSummer Company GrantAfter developing the idea for Speak-On earlier in the year Amari applied for a government grant through the Ontario Summer Company program. The program was set up to encourage students to become more entrepreneurial and gain valuable experience in running a company. Successful applicants received $1500 to help with upfront costs and a further $1500 after meeting all the program criteria. After applying in June Amari received the initial payment in July and completed the program requirements to receive the final payment in September. He planned to incorporate the company in September but had already spent the initial $1500 grant. Amari had also planned to invest $500 of his own savings alongside the second half of the grant payment in September.SalesThe first year of operations had two distinct phases. Phase one consisted of prototyping the decks in classrooms leveraging Amariâs relationships with his previous teachers to better understand the consumer. Once prototyping was done Amari would start sales meetings in December. The sales process consisted of a one-on-one meeting with teachers at select private schools where Amari demonstrated Speak-On and described the potential benefits to their students. If teachers wanted to make a purchase they would go through their school procurement process and a sale would be completed one month after the sales meeting. Given his inexperience Amari expected to convert only 20 per cent of these sales meetings at first before improving in future months. Amari assumed each teacher would buy an average of two decks per purchase (see Exhibit 2).Logo and Website Development One of the first things Amari wanted to do was develop a permanent logo for Speak-On. The current logo was a starting point but Amari wanted to improve it. Logo Joy was a website that gave customers a multitude of basic logos to choose from and then allowed customization. The one-time fee for the website was $87 to be paid in September. After the logo was finished Amari would then purchase a subscription to Canva a graphic design tool website which allowed businesses to upload their logos to the website and design marketing materials. The cost of the Canva subscription was $168 for the year and gave the member access to the website. Payment was made in monthly instalments starting in September. Any marketing materials made through Canva would be at an additional cost and Amari planned to develop business cards from Canva. The business cards would cost $60 and would be paid for in October.Initially Amari had planned to design the website on GoDaddy a website builder and domain hosting service but then he discovered Fiber which was a freelance software and programming website that connected entrepreneurs with website programmers. Amari had connected with a programmer during the summer and had contracted out the design of the Speak-On website for $633. Amari had negotiated for the payment to be due once the website was functional in November. Once the initial build of the website was complete Amari would spend several months uploading specific content about the business. He had taken several computer sciences courses in school and felt comfortable with the process. Even though Amari did not design the website on GoDaddy he was still going to purchase the domain name SpeakOn.com through the website and pay for a membership. Claiming the domain name required a one-time fee of $10 to be incurred in September with membership fees of $5 per month also starting in September.Card DesignAmari had already designed Speak-On decks for English and business classes in high school. He was currently designing a wider range of topics and purchased a membership to Component Studio. Component Studio was essential in card development by helping to format images for cards and Amari estimated he would use the site more frequently as he developed new decks. The monthly cost was $20 and he had started that subscription in July. Banking Fees and InsuranceIncorporating the business was an easy process that would take only a few minutes. Amari would register with the Government of Ontario under the name of Confidence Games Canada. The cost of a business registration was $68 to be paid in September. Amari would also need business insurance. Insurance would cost $138 for the first three months due in September and then revert to a monthly payment format. On the same day of incorporation Amari would go to his bank and open a separate bank account for Speak-On. His bank had told him monthly fees would amount to $20 per month and would be charged to his account on the first day of the month following service.InventoryAmari had initially purchased prototype inventory in the summer but he realized he would need to have a supply ready before the sales process started in December. The supplier of Speak-On decks and Amari negotiated 20 decks to be delivered in December. Further purchases of 70 decks in February and 40 decks in May would ensure enough inventory for the busy spring season. All decks would cost $20 and payment was due in the month of delivery. Line of CreditSpeak-On would initially run based on the government grant and Amariâs investment. However with future investments required before sales could begin more financing could be needed. Amari had been approved for a line of credit with a $10000 limit. The line of credit had an annual interest rate of eight per cent based on the outstanding balance at the end of each month. Payment would be due the next month. If more financing was needed above the line of credit Amari was unsure where it would come from as his own personal finances were stretched thin with school payments.Other OptionsWhile Amari believed he was conservative with his sales projections he also wanted to perform sensitivity analysis on his calculations. The quick reaction and sales request from his old high school was unexpected and Amari wanted to see the effect on his cash balance if he started the sales process earlier than projected. Amari assumed the same sales levels for September October and November as was projected for December. For his supplier to deliver Speak-On decks in September Amari would be charged a rush fee of $5 per deck ordered. Amari estimated an additional purchase of 35 decks in September. Additionally more business cards would be needed and the expense would rise to $80. However Amari also needed to see the negative effect slower sales would have on the business and the potential need of a credit line. Amari assumed if other teachers were less receptive than his old high school teacher the number of decks sold would be 50 per cent less than projected. With a decrease in sales he would not require as much inventory. While the December purchase order could not be changed Amari would reduce his February and May orders by 35 and 20 decks respectively. CONCLUSIONAmari understood the impact Speak-On could have on high school students and their public speaking skills. He needed to determine his financing requirements and project a cash budget for the first year of operations. Upon analysis of the results Amari needed to decide whether to continue to invest his time and money in his new venture or focus on school and the upcoming employment recruiting experience. If Amari decided to continue he needed to choose whether to start selling earlier or continue with the original plan. With the school year about to begin difficult choices needed to be made.EXHIBIT 1: SPEAK-ON DECKSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: SALES ESTIMATE FOR FISCAL 2018Notes: Speak-On decks were sold for $50 each.Source: Company files.

He was responsible for approximately 100 staff members including teams of engineers technicians and administrative staff. Kokomo�s department ensured that the management team of buildings owned and occupied by the federal government complied with local provincial and federal regulations.One of the team members who reported to Kokomo was Mathilde (Mattie) Johnsen an engineering analyst. Johnsen joined the civil service in 2012 after graduating from the University of Regina at the top of her class in environmental systems engineering. She started with the federal service on a team that did basic compliance audits and quickly advanced through various job grades. In 2016 with a laudable record of professional growth Johnsen was the successful applicant for a job in the management stream as part of Kokomo�s group. Johnsen led one of the multidisciplinary teams negotiating with stakeholders for shared use of facilities. Johnsen and her team ensured that facilities the federal government shared with provincial and municipal levels of government Indigenous peoples and industry were developed and maintained to comply with applicable environmental regulations and standards.In 2018 Public Services was tasked with updating Canada�s network of aging laboratories. An anticipatory job posting went up for several senior directors to provide �leadership in developing planning managing and implementing frameworks strategies policies and plans� to update the Government of Canada�s science and technology infrastructure. The infrastructure update was specifically intended to ensure that the government�s science and technology facilities were environmentally sound with the latest green technology and equipment. Johnsen applied for one of the senior director positions. She had the required level of education was familiar with the service and had been extraordinarily successful in negotiating and maintaining compliance with environmental standards. Kokomo acknowledged Johnsen�s potential and admired her confidence and enthusiasm. However he was also aware that Johnsen could be arrogant and presumptuous. Was she the right person for the job?Public Services and Procurement CanadaPublic Services was one of the largest Government of Canada departments. It was the central purchasing agent for all required items from office supplies to naval ships for all government departments. It also served in several other important capacities: as treasurer and accountant for the government pay and pension administrator for more than 275000 employees linguistic authority and integrity advisor information and digital services provider and real property manager. The department had 15 branches and bureaus with specific responsibilities. For example the real property branch managed a large real estate portfolio that included office buildings courts monuments buildings (both within and outside Canada such as embassies) and the Parliament of Canada and its facilities in Ottawa. The real property branch also maintained a collection of numerous bridges dams and highways.The department was led by the Minister of Public Services and Procurement who was also the Receiver General for Canada. The minister was supported by a large team that included a deputy minister and over 10 assistant deputy ministers as well as a dozen other senior executives and regional directors. The department employed more than 6500 people. About 40 per cent of the department�s staff were employed in the real property services program.Landon Kokomo was a director general in the real property branch. He was a career civil servant having joined the federal service out of high school. He had started with a basic administrative position but worked hard and methodically advanced up the federal service employment grid. The government�s early professional development program helped pay the costs of pursuing a university degree at night school and this had allowed Kokomo to pursue opportunities in the executive category of jobs. Kokomo had enjoyed his career but he was looking forward to retirement. He had his required 30 years of service so he could retire on a full pension in just over a year at the early age of 55�a key benefit of civil service in which he fully planned to take part. He was aware that some younger staff members considered him out of touch with the latest management trends referring to him as �old school.� However Kokomo was observant and most colleagues preferred Kokomo�s hands-off approach to performance reviews. The official forms were 10 pages long and needlessly bureaucratic. Nobody was likely to read all parts of the completed forms except to sign them at the time of review (or appeal for promotion if necessary). Kokomo opted for brevity rather than lengthy notes in the documents and allowed the staff member to complete most parts of the forms including parts he would normally be required to complete. If a problem arose he would speak directly to the employee and find a suitable way to resolve the issue.Mattie JohnsenJohnsen was a brilliant environmental engineer. Born and raised in Saskatchewan she had earned both undergraduate and graduate degrees in environmental systems engineering from the University of Regina after which she joined the federal service. Tens of thousands of jobs had been cut from the civil service when Johnsen graduated in 2012 and the science and technology sector of the federal service�the sector with most of the jobs in environmental engineering�had been hit particularly hard. But Johnsen had excellent grades and was passably bilingual�a requirement for most federal service jobs. When she saw the opportunity for a one-year temporary assignment with Public Services Johnsen took her chances and applied.The job would mean relocating to the Canadian capital city of Ottawa for the year at her own expense but Johnsen reasoned that the risk was worth the opportunity to break out of the limits of employment in Saskatchewan. Most of her environmental engineering classmates applied for dwindling career opportunities with the government�s Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans Natural Resources Canada or Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry but Johnsen applied to Public Services because she felt it was an essential department at all times�whether supporting the government in downsizing or in growing. Her gamble paid off. Johnsen landed a contract position with Public Services and then secured a coveted permanent position with the federal service before the end of her one-year term.In 2016 Public Services was restructured and Johnsen joined the management team overseeing a team of engineers technicians and administrative support staff. Instead of ensuring that buildings already in the government�s portfolio complied with environmental management standards Johnsen and her team were responsible for negotiating with municipal and provincial governments regulatory agencies the private sector and Indigenous peoples for shared use of facilities. In some cases the federal government was looking to use someone else�s property or land; in other cases the other party was looking to use property or land that was already in the federal government�s portfolio. In either situation Johnsen was involved. In the fall of 2016 Johnsen took advantage of the federal service professional development program. She had applied to three executive MBA programs and was accepted by all three. However she chose Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al to stay within the grant amount available under the federal service program and to improve her French language skills. Kokomo was eager to see Johnsen in the program; his only requirement was that she commit to take a specified number of credits in people management noting that �success and advancement are dependent on how well you can manage your team.�The AppealNow Kokomo was in a bind. Johnsen had applied for one of the senior director positions in the new science and technology infrastructure project. She had all the technical skills and experience but Kokomo was concerned about Johnsen�s lack of interpersonal skills. Hiring decisions were made by a committee that referred to Kokomo as Johnsen�s current manager for an evaluation of Johnsen as a candidate for the senior director positions. He informed the committee that her performance appraisals were excellent but he was concerned about a gap he noticed between the strengths she exhibited in her current position and the skills that would be required in the new job. He also commented on the EX-02 job grade of the new positions in the second level of the executive classification of jobs. If Johnsen were offered the job she would advance in the executive class of the federal service and bypass the usual entry-level executive position of EX-01 which provided senior executives with the opportunity to tightly manage an employee�s growth as a new executive.Kokomo voiced his concerns that based on past incidents and behaviours Johnsen lacked the interpersonal skills that were foundational to the new positions. Therefore he could not recommend her for the job. The hiring committee members were impressed with Johnsen�s performance record based on her performance appraisals. Her ability to negotiate agreements and get building managers to comply with complex regulations would be an asset in the new project. Johnsen had also presented herself well in the interview showing confidence in her own skills and a keen interest in the program. Therefore the committee outvoted Kokomo. However trusting his assessment of the situation they decided that instead of appointing Johnsen to one of the posted positions that she had applied to they would instead offer her a secondment as a temporary EX-01 level position for one year. When Johnsen was informed by Kokomo about the committee�s decision and job offer she was clearly disappointed. Exercising her right to request a review of the selection process she launched an appeal of the hiring decision (see Exhibit 1). The next step was for Kokomo to explain to the hiring committee in writing his reasoning for not recommending Johnsen for the posted positions (see Exhibit 2). The committee members would then review Johnsen�s appeal and Kokomo�s explanation and reassess their hiring decision.Exhibit 1: Email from Mattie Johnsen to Landon Kokomo Director General Real Property Services Branch Public Services and Procurement CanadaSource: Created by the case author.Exhibit 2: Email from Landon Kokomo to Selection Committee (#2018-SVC-EA-HQ-375480)Note: BASc = bachelor of science; MASc = master of science; CCC = highest of three levels (A B and C) for written comprehension written expression and oral proficiency.Source: Created by the case author.

(Shanghai Euclid) considered the JV a partnership between a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) and an American multinational enterprise. After almost two decades and following multiple rounds of downsizing the JV was coming to a close. It was to be succeeded by a wholly owned SOE called Shanghai Gutenberg Printing Machine Co. (Shanghai Gutenberg) and Wang was anxious about the many questions raised by this situation. The first issue the leadership of Shanghai Euclid had to address was how to maintain the SOE in any form after the JV ended since many SOEs in China had closed in recent years. If the SOE portion of the JV was to continue operations as a standalone business a second issue was how to determine the appropriate scale of operations. How many employees should the post-JV company employ? If the scale was to be reduced what basis should the leadership use for inviting people to remain with the organization? Historically the pressure of management and restructuring had caused considerable employee stress; employees were worried about being laid off and felt anxious about going to work. Wang had to make some hard decisions in order to gain employee buy-in and prevent disruption during this time of transition. In particular he had to take into account the nuances of the Chinese approach to downsizing. Were there any alternatives to downsizing? This situation was the biggest challenge Wang had faced in his 30-year career in the printing machine industry. First Stage: 1958–1993 (Pre-Joint Venture)The JV’s Chinese predecessor was established on August 1 1958 as the People’s Printing Machine Factory. Back then it had over 600 employees. As a local SOE it was formed through the merger of seven factories. At that time China had a planned economy and most private factories were transformed into SOEs through public–private partnerships. In December 1958 the People’s Printing Machine Factory produced the first LB403 high-speed rotary press in China for the Southern Daily News. The press could print over 80000 copies of a four-page newspaper every hour. Over the next 35 years the company introduced more than 20 products and won regional and national scientific awards and accolades. Its market share reached around 75 per cent in China. At this time production tasks were issued by government authorities. The company and its employees faced no pressure or competition in the planned economy and SOEs in this era functioned almost like small societies. Each SOE had its own canteen dormitory fleet of cars clinic kindergarten and employee school. Even the space where employees got married was assigned by the company. Whoever contributed to the company got priority in housing and employees paid a small amount of rent to the company each month.In 1992 there were over 1800 employees at the People’s Printing Machine Factory. That same year Deng Xiaoping the paramount leader of the People’s Republic of China between 1978 and 1989 appeared on the cover of Time magazine. He had taken a 2440-kilometre (km) train ride at age 88 to visit South China and had affirmed the achievements of China’s reform and its push towards a market economy. China was changing and opening to foreign investment and business methods.In order to improve operational efficiency many SOEs had begun to enact enterprise reforms in connection with the three types of foreign-funded enterprises: wholly foreign-owned enterprises Sino–foreign JVs and Sino–foreign co-operations. In April 1992 the People’s Printing Machine Factory began a pilot program for its transformation which saw the liberalization of operations and a move towards a market orientation. Departments unrelated to production and operation—such as kindergartens clinics restaurants and guest houses—were separated and profit maximization was prioritized over social services. As China’s economy continued to reform and open up there was a drive to acquire advanced foreign technology and improve products. The company had manufactured and processed parts and products from Germany and the United States starting in the mid- to late-1980s. With changes in the development of enterprises and the needs of domestic users Chinese companies were becoming more ambitious. The People’s Printing Machine Factory wanted to partner with a company that had a long history of printing machine manufacturing world-leading product technology an appropriate product line and a mature global marketing and service network. It wanted to leverage the manufacturing strength of China and consolidate an expansion in the Asia-Pacific market. Thus it sought out an opportunity for a joint venture marking the beginning of the second stage in the company’s development.Second Stage: 1993–2008: Foundation and growth of the Joint VentureThe People’s Printing Machine Factory and the US firm Euclid Printing Machines jointly established Shanghai Euclid Printing Machine Co. in December 1993. While the American company held 60 per cent of the shares the People’s Industrial Group (the holding company that owned the People’s Printing Machine Factory) acquired 40 per cent of the shares. The JV at that time had registered capital of US$15.5 million. The American firm was among the world’s three largest printing machine manufacturers and had over a century and a half of experience.Like its predecessor the JV operated in the printing machine industry—designing manufacturing selling and maintaining printing machinery and related parts (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The company did not make print products such as newspapers or books themselves. The most common types of printing machines used offset lithography digital flexography and screen techniques. The offset printing technique involved transferring an image from a metal plate to a rubber blanket or rollers before it was printed on media such as paper. This technique did not require contact between the paper and the metal plate. Because it was reliable affordable and good quality offset printing was highly efficient for all scales of production. Large-scale bulk printing publications leveraged two primary types of printing techniques: In the first sheet-fed offset printing sheets of paper were placed in the machine one by one and then cut prior to printing. In the second web offset printing paper rolls were printed on and later trimmed and assembled. Because it was cost efficient web offset printing was often used for large-scale printing that varied frequently such as newspapers. Offset printers were the most common type of machine. The digital printing technique used electronic or digital files as a source; press plates were not required to carry the image nor were set-up sheets needed. Compared to traditional (offset) techniques digital printing offered better quality but it entailed higher per-page costs. Other printing processes included flexography (also called rotary printing) and contemporary letterpress printing which represented one of the main choices for large-scale printing. Over the years the change from traditional to digital printing affected Shanghai Euclid’s operations substantially.As part of an effort to foster efficiency during the foundational stages of the JV more than 600 of an initial 1800 employees at Shanghai Euclid were diverted at the end of 1993—that is they were given new jobs elsewhere or retired with compensation. To facilitate the smooth progress of organizational adjustment the company formed a re-employment engineering office. Especially in the beginning the American and Chinese sides disagreed on several issues the first of which was the correct method of dismissing or diverting employees. The Chinese side insisted on gradual and stable methods to promote the optimization of personnel structure and efficiency whereas the American side was used to taking more drastic action.After the JV was created advanced management concepts were introduced and the company’s organizational framework was set up: there was a chairperson on the Chinese side and a general manager on the US side. Departments for personnel finance sales manufacturing quality development and engineering were established. The number of management layers was flattened which led to faster information flow and more efficient decision making. This flat organizational structure presented challenges however as it was a departure from the operating method that was familiar to the Chinese managers and employees. The Chinese employees had particular difficulty adapting to advanced management methods from abroad. Under the SOE mode of operation they had been accustomed to working and getting paid regardless of the firm’s health or profits with wage levels unaffected by performance or effort and they retained the idea of “eating out of one big pot of rice”—a metaphor for egalitarianism. Moreover foreign companies in China sometimes struggled to understand the kinds of employee benefits paid in China. For example when family planning came under government control as a national policy in the 1980s incentives were enacted as part of the one-child policy. A single-child family might receive ¥5–10 per month from an employer as a reward for compliance. Subsidies such as this child benefit were not always entirely understood or taken into account by foreign firms when operating in the Chinese market.Despite the challenges however Shanghai Euclid prospered. In 2000 the JV’s per capita income was the highest in the national printing industry. Later in 2006 Shanghai Euclid set two records. It obtained 22 tower rotary offset presses from Nanfang Daily which together were worth over ¥70 million. The company also set a record for high contract values in the domestic market as it undertook orders totalling more than ¥400 million. Third Stage: 2008–2012: Decline and Closing of the Joint VentureBy early 2008 however a need for change started to become obvious. On February 18 2008 the company set up a re-employment working group according to government requirements. In 2009 the 28th board of directors contemplated closing the foundry and on November 25 the company decided to restructure the foundry. In 2010 the holding company People’s Industrial Group acquired a 100 per cent equity interest in Euclid International (the US partner of the JV). After the acquisition of Euclid International by the People’s Industrial Group the strategy was to integrate Euclid International’s global resources in places like the United States France the Netherlands and Japan; this would make Shanghai Euclid the largest printing machine production base and Euclid International’s Asia-Pacific centre. However with the outbreak of the global financial crisis the sharp decline in paper media advertising and the impact of Internet multimedia the print volume of paper media had also fallen and the demand for printing machines in the market had plummeted. Printing machinery manufacturers were the first to bear the brunt. Their performance declined and many companies lost money. Printing machine companies with more than 600 employees would often dismiss more than 100 employees at once. Due to the global financial crisis Shanghai Euclid’s profits in 2010 were half of those in 2006. After 2011 the international printing machine market further declined due to the development of the Internet mobile phones and new forms of multimedia. Shanghai Euclid’s sales income nonetheless had grown from ¥87 million before the JV to ¥600 million in late 2011. It was the dominant firm in China in terms of market share with two domestic competitors: one state-owned enterprise and one private enterprise. Competition also came from countries like Germany the United States Italy Japan and South Korea. In October 2012 the People’s Printing Machine Factory acquired 60 per cent of Shanghai Euclid’s equity held by Euclid International. Shanghai Euclid became a 100-per-cent state-owned holding company and was renamed Shanghai Gutenberg thus effectively terminating the JV. The foreign employees then left China. While co-operation in the JV had been more or less successful there was a perception that the American side had given up. As well the People’s Industrial Group no longer regarded printing and packaging as key strategic sectors. The future of the printing machine industry pointed to leaner more technologically advanced firms rather than sprawling industrial operations. Around the same time Shanghai Gutenberg signed a land agreement with the Minhang District Planning Bureau marking the official start of the relocation of the new Shanghai Gutenberg factory. This was in line with requirements regarding the transformation of the urban environment whereby the SOE had to follow government orders and relocate the factory 30 km away. The new plant would be located in the Pujiang Town area of the Caohejing Development Zone in Pudong Minhang District and would have a land area of 9.4 hectares (141 mu). The new factory was 15 km from the city centre 37 km from Pudong Airport and 27 km from Hongqiao Airport. The existing staff lived close to the current factory location and were able to ride or drive there within half an hour. The factory relocation meant that the one-way journey to work would require more than two hours. Staff would have to leave at 6:00 a.m. for work leading to employee complaints and management headaches. At the same time some employees of the younger generation presented challenges because they preferred more exciting work such as jobs in social media and struggled with the discipline required for industrial factory work.At this point 668 employees remained at the JV and considerations around diverting and redistributing them rather than terminating their positions outright were a major challenge. It was to be carried out according to China’s labour laws and standards for negotiating employee terminations with respect to labour relations (see Exhibit 3). The People’s Industrial Group included a human resources unit that attended to many thousands of laid-off workers including many elderly people. These workers often faced illness or disabilities and had no children or support network. Because many had devoted their lives to the enterprise they expected that the enterprise rather than the neighbourhood community would care for them. As such this human resources unit often helped these workers purchase insurance attain medical services procure daily necessities and deal with the aftermath of family deaths. The unit had established 12 regional locations that provided services such as living assistance and medical care for the elderly.The human resources department of the company analyzed the circumstances of each company position. Because the company was planning to relocate in the future and wanted to give some veteran employees the opportunity to choose whether or not to work at the new location it also formulated a special Shanghai Euclid employee termination plan. The management wondered whether the diverted or redistributed staff should be able to choose their new destinations. Regardless it would be necessary to formulate a system for evaluating employees. Shanghai Euclid employees knew about this development so the atmosphere of the whole company was tense. Almost everyone was at risk and worried that they would be laid off. The company had formulated guidelines titled “Operational Measures for Workers’ Labour Relations in the Human Resources Optimization Configuration Plan of Shanghai Euclid Printing Machine Co.” (see Exhibit 4) which ran to 5000 words. The problem faced by the management was that employees had to support the rules at the Workers’ Congress and yet a large number of employees would have to be laid off. Management believed that the reforms might lead to the departure of dozens of employees who were less critical for the company’s operations. As a result nearly 200 people wanted to leave and there were many skilled workers in key positions and this was simply too much for the company to maintain. 2012: THE DECISION POINTJack Wang had been with Shanghai Euclid and before the JV with the People’s Printing Machine Factory for almost 30 years having started as a mechanic in the workshop. Because of his creativity and leadership he had been promoted to assistant general manager deputy general manager and then general manager. He was familiar with every facet of the company and he understood its entire history. Because Shanghai Euclid had performed well in recent years employee incomes had improved and employees greeted Wang enthusiastically whenever they met him. The company’s business had spread throughout North America Europe and East Asia. Wang admired Jack Welch of the General Electric Company in the United States and he imagined that one day he could become China’s Jack Welch. Now Wang was challenged with managing employee downsizing in an acceptable way if that was the approach chosen by the post-JV SOE. He had to get employees on board and choose who would relocate to the new plant. What was the appropriate size of the SOE? On what basis should people be invited to remain with the organization? How could Wang implement these changes without unduly or excessively alarming employees or losing the best talent whom he hoped to retain? Were there any strategies besides or in addition to downsizing that could be deployed? How could employee stress be mitigated? He knew he had to make some tough decisions soon.EXHIBIT 1: Shanghai Euclid—OPERATIONS 2009–2013E (in ¥ thousands)Source: Company information.

EXHIBIT 3: EMPLOYEE DOWNSIZING IN CHINA Versus in THE WESTThe Chinese people were taught from their childhood that they were the masters of their country and that enterprises belonged to the nation. As such having a job was their birth right. Under the planned economy almost no one could be fired in the conventional sense; instead people were sent to new jobs or given paid early retirement. Chinese culture pursued social harmony in contrast to the Western pursuit of law and contracts. Although Chinese employees could terminate their labour contracts relatively easily (by providing 30 days’ written notice or three days’ notice during a probation period) employers generally could not terminate employees’ contracts without strong cause and severance payments.Note: SOE = state-operated enterprises.Source: Created by case authors with data from Dan Harris “Terminating Your China Employee. It Ain’t Easy….” China Law for Business Blog January 9 2010 accessed May 1 2019 www.chinalawblog.com/2010/01/terminating_your_china_employe.html.EXHIBIT 4: EXCERPT FROM “OPERATIONAL MEASURES FOR WORKERS’ LABOUR RELATIONS IN THE HUMAN RESOURCES OPTIMIZATION PLAN OF SHANGHAI EUCLID”Employees who belong to one of three categories can be directed to the retirement centre of the superior group company to retire early and the centre is responsible for managing and issuing monthly living expenses which are regulated by the Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau. The payment base is “three insurances and one gold.”* The three categories are:(1) Employees within five years of the statutory retirement age (including five years)(2) Female employees between 42 years and 45 years; male workers between 52 years and 55 years (3) Workers who are disabled due to work and suffer from occupational diseasesEmployees can negotiate with the enterprise to terminate the labour contract in the following three ways:(1) If you are away from the statutory retirement age by more than five years you may receive economic compensation and one-time incentive fees for self-employment.(2) Workers who are disabled due to work suffer from occupational diseases or have lost their ability to work due to illness may apply for financial compensation rewards one-time subsidies and other subsidies.(3) In the case of employees within five years of the statutory retirement age (including five years) the enterprise shall not terminate the labour contract in principle. If one negotiates with the enterprise to terminate the labour contract one shall submit a written application and the enterprise may consider giving a one-time subsidy.The economic compensation rewards one-time subsidies and other subsidies for the termination of labour contracts are to be negotiated and details include:(1) Quick reward fee:Signing time for completing the labour relationship cancellation procedureWithin 10 working days: RMB10000 + 2 months’ wageWithin 15 working days: RMB7000 + 1.5 months’ wageWithin 20 working days: RMB4000 + 1 month’s wageMore than 20 working days: RMB0(2) Re-employment subsidy: a one-time employment subsidy of RMB6000(3) For employees who have special difficulties after the application is filed by the enterprise the enterprise union will verify the employee’s one-off difficulty subsidy:Subsidy content (RMB5000 each):Children who are still in school (preschool primary school university) Spousal unemploymentWidowed or single parent supporting underage children Employee spouse and minor children who are seriously ill or undergoing treatment Spouse who was an employee of the company and has been diverted from their postDisability Service retired military support Other help (except for other subsidies and circumstances mentioned above) The statutory retirement age of the employees referred to in these measures: men 60 years; women 50 years. In the 15 working days after the completion of the formalities for the cancellation of the contract the enterprise will settle the compensation and incentive fees at one time and remit the employee’s salary card or the bank card provided by the employee.Notes: *Three insurances = pension insurance unemployment insurance and medical insurance; One gold = housing provident fund (used in the purchase of a mortgage) until formal retirement (the individual payment was partly borne by the enterprise); RMB = Chinese yuan.Source: Company records.

(Patanjali) stated its intentions to introduce swadeshi jeans to the Indian market. Established in 2006 Patanjali had experienced dramatic growth by stressing traditional Indian values of wellness and naturalness and offering low prices. The company quickly became a significant player in the Indian markets for Ayurvedic medicines personal care products and consumer packaged foods. The growth of Patanjali not only unnerved many multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in India but also unsettled many large Indian-owned companies. Launching jeans would be the company’s first foray into clothing.Clad in saffron robes and adorned with a flowing beard yoga guru Baba Ramdev Patanjali’s charismatic co-founder and brand spokesperson explained some of the key premises underpinning the company’s strategy and its entry into clothing: “World-class quality low price and giving away our entire profits to charity are the three main reasons for the boom seen in Patanjali products.” By having a yoga guru as its spokesperson and employing traditional ingredients and formulations in most of its products Patanjali also appealed to Hindu antiquity tradition and spiritualism. When promoting Patanjali Ramdev regularly called upon Indian nationalism with statements such as “In India food cosmetics and medicines are mostly made and sold by foreign multinational companies that take the country’s money abroad. They invest less money but their profits are huge. . . . We want that India’s money should stay here.” Patanjali’s unique combination of Indian nationalism yoga spiritualism and traditionalism along with its low prices had proven to be a successful formula in India’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) markets. However some observers doubted whether this recipe could be successfully applied to jeans. One skeptic noted “Patanjali products . . . [do] well because of purity of formulation and quality at the right price which are the narratives but that cannot be extended to fashion. . . . This [move into jeans] is to my mind a stretch.” Other observers felt the jeans initiative was problematic not because it was necessarily a bad idea but rather because Patanjali had other more compelling growth opportunities such as increasing sales of its existing products within India or perhaps selling more of those products outside of India—in the Indian subcontinent in countries where the Indian diaspora had a large presence or in Western developed countries where natural products were increasingly popular and could command a premium.Founding and HistoryPatanjali was the product of the unique talents long history and special relationship of its two co-founders. Ramdev was the flamboyant public face of the organization whereas Acharya Balkrishna was the more reserved behind-the-scenes operations-oriented member of the duo. Born in 1965 Ramdev studied Indian scriptures Sanskrit and yoga; quite early in life he renounced worldly possessions and become a sannyasi. Balkrishna was born into a Nepalese family of modest means in 1975. He was educated at various Indian gurukuls and met Ramdev in 1988 while attending Kalwa Gurukul in Haryana India. They established a strong relationship keeping in touch by letters over the next few years while Balkrishna travelled India studying plants and their medicinal properties—a key aspect of Ayurveda. The two reconnected in 1993 while Ramdev was living in the Himalayan caves of the Hindu pilgrim town of Gangotri. Commenting on this time in their lives Balkrishna said:When we were students we never thought we wanted to become very big businessmen or make a lot of money that was never our mind-set. . . . We didn’t come from any major family background. Had that been our thought we would never have gone to a gurukul. Everyone knows going to a gurukul and studying Sanskrit no one becomes rich. We went to the gurukul thinking we’ll become experts in our ancient texts and philosophies.In 1995 the duo founded a charitable trust dedicated to bringing Ayurvedic therapies to neglected parts of the country. After first focusing mostly on natural herbal medicines they then added more complex medicines from traditional Ayurvedic formulations and eventually established Ayurveda clinics. At about this time Ramdev started hosting free yoga camps. His accessible style and personable demeanour proved popular and attendance at these events grew. Ramdev would extol the benefits of yoga and Ayurveda to his followers complaining of various ailments. Meanwhile Balkrishna made Ayurvedic medicines and doctors available at these yoga camps.A turning point came in 2003 when Aastha TV a spiritual TV network in India featured Ramdev in its morning yoga slot. He quickly developed a huge following and the demand for Balkrishna’s Ayurvedic therapies grew in step and provided the base for expanding to larger-scale production. Balkrishna explained their motivation: “There was no commercial planning. It was all driven by demand from people that we responded to.” To fulfill this demand Patanjali was formed in 2006. The company was named after Patanjali a scholar from the period between the fourth and second centuries BC credited with writing the first treatise on yoga principles. Ramdev and Balkrishna contributed 20 hectares of land they already owned and with several of Ramdev’s followers as backers they secured a $40 million bank loan to register the company and begin construction of what eventually became Patanjali Food and Herbal Park at Haridwar in northern India. As part of its operations Patanjali was committed to helping India’s rural farmers working with them to supply its production facility. Because of his commitment as a sannyasi Ramdev took no ownership interest in the newly formed company; Balkrishna owned over 90 per cent of the shares and the remainder were held by two of the original financial backers. Because of his equity stake in Patanjali Balkrishna was listed by Forbes as India’s 46th-richest person in 2016. Despite Patanjali’s success both founders lived modestly and reportedly took no monetary compensation from the company. Moreover while Patanjali was registered as a private company the espoused purpose of its founders was not profits. Ramdev stated “Our profits are small because unlike multinationals like Coca-Cola or Nestlé our main aim is not to make profit but to benefit others.” He also often stated that all profits from Patanjali’s products went to charity. What constituted charity was subject to interpretation but as currently espoused Patanjali’s vision and mission were different from those of most businesses: VisionKeeping Nationalism Ayurved and Yog as our pillars we are committed to create a healthier society and country. To raise the pride and glory of the world we are geared up to serve people by bringing the blessings of nature into their lives. With sheer dedication scientific approach astute planning and realism we are poised to write a new success story for the world.MissionMaking India an ideal place for the growth and development of Ayurveda and a prototype for the rest of the world.Unsurprisingly Patanjali’s operations were not limited to commercial activities but also included education research cattle protection poverty eradication and health. These objectives were served through a host of related organizations (see Exhibit 1).Patanjali focused on natural herbal products and Ayurvedic formulations at the time of its founding but it expanded quickly into personal care products (e.g. toothpaste hair care and skin cleansers) and food (e.g. ghee or clarified butter; noodles; biscuits; edible oils; and juices). As of 2015 about 85–90 per cent of all production was still done in-house mostly at the company’s original but much expanded 60-hectare complex outside Haridwar. By 2016 Patanjali had extended its original sales network of yoga camps and Ayurveda clinics to include approximately 10000 retail stores nationwide. The company directly employed nearly 20000 people and had supply relationships with over 100000 farmers.By 2016 Ramdev had become a very influential public figure in India commanding unparalleled star power. His actions and words were a staple for the Indian media; a comedy talk show in which he participated held the distinction of garnering the highest ever viewership in Indian television history. Ramdev’s Facebook page had accumulated 7.3 million likes and his Twitter handle had six million followers. Sales Profits and ProductsPatanjali’s sales revenues had grown dramatically since 2012 (see Exhibit 2). To enable this growth Patanjali had developed and launched a wide range of products in several categories of the FMCG sector: natural healthcare (44 products) natural food products (49 products) herbal homecare (14 products) and natural personal care (93 products). These products adhered to Patanjali’s principles of using natural and Ayurvedic ingredients and offering high-quality products at a cheaper price than most competitors. Patanjali’s best-selling product was ghee which contributed 30–35 per cent of revenues making food the largest share of Patanjali’s revenues (see Exhibit 2). Healthcare including traditional medical products was the second-largest product category at 19 per cent followed by toiletries (15 per cent) dental products (11 per cent) hair care (11 per cent) and cosmetics (7 per cent).Patanjali was a private company with limited financial reporting requirements. Its profits for the March 2016 fiscal year end were reportedly $105 million on sales of $758 million—a substantial increase from its $11 million profit in 2012. According to Balkrishna profits were being reinvested to better serve the Indian people with more Patanjali products. He said “We want to use this wealth [profits] to serve others and not ourselves. But at the same time we don’t believe in giving things for free because if we did that within a year we’d be . . . going around with a begging bowl. We need the wealth to serve the people.”Food and BeveragesGoing beyond its popular ghee Patanjali had greatly expanded its food products to include instant noodles flour biscuits and honey. During 2015 Patanjali announced the launch of Patanjali Atta Noodles after market leader Nestlé’s Maggi noodles were temporarily banned from Indian store shelves because lead had been discovered in the products. Patanjali took advantage of this opportunity to launch its own instant noodle brand. According to Ramdev these noodles were healthier than others on the market and free of toxic ingredients. Similarly Patanjali marketed its ghee as being a higher-quality healthier alternative to regular butter. Although Patanjali’s products were mainly priced lower than competitors’ products its ghee was priced higher. Patanjali had experienced some controversies. In one instance products with manufacturing dates six months in the future were found in retail stores. In another fungus was detected in some bottles of ghee. Patanjali Atta Noodles were also found to be substandard containing a high level of ash. Ramdev denied that Patanjali products contained any harmful ingredients and claimed these allegations had been made to ruin the reputation of the brand. In any event Patanjali’s sales continued to grow. In addition to ghee wheat flour and honey were some of Patanjali’s best-selling products. Other products in this category included breakfast cereal pickles ketchup spices and fruit juice. Within the food category Patanjali stated its intention to launch additional dairy products in the future. HealthcareHealthcare products were one of Patanjali’s original competencies. The company’s produced more than 300 healthcare products including digestives Ayurvedic medicines and oils. Patanjali’s medical preparations promised to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions including diabetes anxiety arthritis Parkinson’s disease high blood pressure and even infertility. Patanjali integrated its healthcare product offerings with treatments at the Patanjali Ayurved Hospital and with medical and Ayurvedic research at several centres. The Ayurved Hospital had the capacity to offer free consultations to 6000–10000 patients a day. Patanjali also provided free Ayurvedic consultations at the Patanjali Yogpeeth yoga institute and in Patanjali stores. These steps contributed to Patanjali’s success and also expanded the market for over-the-counter and other Ayurvedic products. Cleaning Products and ToiletriesRamdev’s effective marketing created awareness of Ayurvedic herbal and natural ingredients and opened the door for the company to enter other FMCG segments such as toiletries cosmetics and skin care. Patanjali’s products in the toiletries category included personal-care products such as body oils soaps and cleansers for body face and hands; its cleaning products included detergent powders and dish wash bars. All were based on natural and herbal ingredients. In 2016 Patanjali entered the baby-care market and launched a whole new product range including hair oil massage oil body lotion and body wash gel under a sub-brand called Shishu care. Patanjali sought to increase its presence in the baby and child-care markets. Dental ProductsPatanjali’s toothpaste Dant Kanti (meaning “tooth shine”) contained herbs and some Ayurvedic ingredients and claimed to prevent cavities and bad breath stop bleeding gums and pain and strengthen teeth. Dant Kanti one of Patanjali’s best-selling products forced Colgate the market leader to launch its own natural and herbal line of toothpastes. Balkrishna voiced strong opposition when Colgate named one of its new herbal toothpastes Cibaca Vedshakti saying “We worship and respect Vedas like our gods we don’t use them in our products. This is not a toothpaste but a direct attack on our culture.” Dental care in India had traditionally used herbal and natural materials. For example people in India once chewed plant twigs (neem and miswak) and turned them into brushes to clean teeth. Also salt and coal powder were once used as teeth-whitening agents. These practices receded most notably in urban areas with the advent of toothpaste and savvy marketing by toothpaste manufacturers. Facing competition from Patanjali and similar companies Colgate introduced salt- and coal-infused toothpastes. Ramdev denounced the “lies and deceit of MNCs” by placing an old 1985 ad from Colgate (highlighting the harmful effects of coal and salt on teeth) next to its 2016 ads (underscoring the benefits of coal and salt).The battles in the toothpaste market were expected to continue because the herbal toothpaste market was estimated to account for 13–14 per cent of the total toothpaste market. Patanjali had achieved a 2 per cent share of the oral-care market by the end of the March 2016 and Patanjali’s toothpaste brand generated revenues of $67.4 million in the fiscal year 2015–16 according to Ramdev.Skin and Hair CarePatanjali’s hair-care products included shampoo conditioner hair oil and hair colour. These hair products were mostly based on natural ingredients such as coconut gooseberry and almond and promised to have positive effects on hair health—for example preventing hair loss and stimulating hair growth. Almost all of these products were offered at a lower price than those offered by competitors. Being able to produce a cheaper better-quality product was a good reason for entering a new product category; but that ability alone was not enough. As Balkrishna said “The decision to enter a new category is triggered by a controversy or when Ramdev is approached by people.”Patanjali’s latest product category in the personal-care segment was cosmetics or skin care. Patanjali offered kajal (eyeliner) cooling oil shave cream and shave gel. The company’s makeup products were marketed as being better for the skin than competitors’ products which may contain chemical ingredients. Patanjali’s CompetitionNo player in the Indian market exactly matched Patanjali’s breadth of products and the company confronted different types of competitors across its product range. These competitors included the Indian subsidiaries of such MNCs as Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and India-based companies such as Dabur India Ltd. and Marico Ltd. (see Exhibit 3).  In addition other Indian enterprises associated with Indian spiritual gurus were emerging as potentially significant competitors to Patanjali. (see Exhibit 4).Among this latter group the most notable was Sri Sri Ayurveda started by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar a spiritual leader and founder of The Art of Living Foundation. As India was a diverse country with many different ethnic language and religious groups (see Exhibit 5) the relative strengths of these players differed regionally. Patanjali was strongest in the Hindi-speaking north of India where it was founded and had its principal production facility; however it was less well-established in the south where organizations such as The Art of Living Foundation and Isha Foundation had a more substantial presence. Although some of the other gurus had larger numbers of dedicated followers Patanjali was the first mover of this type and the largest in terms of sales revenues. Patanjali’s AdvantagesPatanjali followed a cost-plus pricing strategy adding a small margin to costs to calculate the price instead of focusing on market-based pricing or profits. Thus Patanjali offered most products at a significant discount compared with its competitors. Balkrishna stated that the low prices would firstly benefit consumers and secondly force MNCs to reduce the prices of their products.One main reason Patanjali was able to offer high-quality products at relatively low prices was its cost-effective business model which differed from that of its multinational competitors. By way of comparison the cost structure of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd. was typical. Its costs and profits as a percentage of revenues included raw materials at 36 per cent labour at 6 per cent depreciation at 2.6 per cent advertising and promotion at 17 per cent general and administrative costs at 17 per cent profits before taxes at 20 per cent and taxes at 6 per cent (about half of after tax profits were paid out as dividends).Patanjali kept its costs low by sourcing products from its own manufacturing park; many raw materials came directly from farmers thus eliminating the involvement and markup of intermediaries. However Patanjali had recently begun using more third-party suppliers for some products. Further its human-resource costs were believed to be low; the company claimed to pay low or no executive compensation and wages for all employees were kept low because the people who worked for Patanjali joined more for the cause than for the monetary compensation. While the private nature of the company meant these assertions could not be verified it was not uncommon for people in India—particularly those following a guru or supporting a movement—to sacrifice personal benefits and comforts. Patanjali kept administrative and overhead costs low by marketing all products under the umbrella Patanjali brand rather than developing multiple brand names for different categories. It also appeared that its marketing expenses were low because it did not conduct any market research for new products. Even before Patanjali was founded Ramdev had millions of followers in India and worldwide through his yoga classes and TV shows. By 2016 Ramdev appeared on five TV channels that aired globally. His social media presence and media exposure meant that Ramdev reached millions of people at no direct cost to Patanjali. This marketing advantage could have been dissipating as Patanjali had recently enlisted other celebrity endorsers: wrestler Sushil Kumar for ghee and actress and Bharatiya Janata Party member of Parliament Hema Malini for biscuits. Patanjali had also started to use conventional marketing channels such as TV advertisements. Market analysts estimated that Patanjali was spending about 10 per cent of its 2016 turnover on advertisements. (This expenditure compared with a 10–15 per cent industry average and a 13 per cent spend by Hindustan Unilever Limited.) However Patanjali claimed that its advertising spend was much lower at only 2–3 per cent. Patanjali’s ads were played an average of 20 hours every day across 161 TV channels predominantly in the news genre making Patanjali one of India’s top 10 advertised brands. Ramdev’s prominence in public life made him popular with politicians. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several chief ministers were among his students and followers. These associations meant that Patanjali did not face some of the costs and delays confronted by typical businesses when for example seeking approvals acquiring land and other assets securing state subsidies or forging relationships with suppliers and distributors. For example many state governments (e.g. Andhra Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Haryana and Rajasthan) courted investments from Patanjali and offered land and other facilities at subsidized rates. Patanjali distributed its products directly through 5000 Patanjali franchise stores and 3000 health centres in India. It also had a presence in 5000 other retail outlets serviced through 80 super-distributors and 700 distributors. Partly as an effort to achieve more nationwide distribution Patanjali had recently established indirect distribution arrangements with several large Indian retail chains including Future Group Reliance and Tesco and it planned to add 20 Walmart wholesale cash-and-carry outlets to this list. Further Patanjali products could be ordered online or through a mobile app with free shipping for orders over ₹499 (about $7). Patanjali’s strategy aligned well with the preferences of many Indian consumers. Ramdev’s followers and many Patanjali customers were health-conscious and practised yoga meditation and natural living. Health consciousness was rising in India as was the demand for natural products. Traditional herbal and natural ingredients were regaining popularity in India and globally. Purchase decisions regarding personal-care products for over half of Indians were influenced by the use of natural and organic ingredients which many considered a safer alternative to products containing chemicals.In addition to Ayurvedic and natural products some Indian consumers also preferred swadeshi products—products made in India. Swadeshi had its origins in the Indian independence movement and India had recently seen a rise in populist patriotism. Sixty-two per cent of Indian consumers preferred to buy Indian rather than foreign products. The nationalistic movement in India was promoted by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who launched the “Make in India” campaign in 2014 to encourage local and international companies to manufacture in India. During October 2016 some politicians supported a social media campaign to boycott goods made in China which coincided with a 10–20 per cent drop in demand for Chinese goods across India; retailers reported that customers were asking for Indian-made products. One survey asking Indian consumers their reasons for purchasing Patanjali products reported the following results: price (65 per cent) health (63 per cent) quality (57 per cent) trustworthiness (20 per cent) and swadeshi (20 per cent).Growth OpportunitiesWhile the Indian market had been Patanjali’s primary focus the company also had a modest international presence exporting to the United Kingdom the United States Canada and Mauritius which were all home to large Indian-origin populations. The company had established three organizations to cater to Canada Nepal and Mauritius (see Exhibit 1). Although non-resident Indian populations and people of Indian origin were spread around the world the developed countries with the largest populations were the United States the United Kingdom and Canada (see Exhibit 6). In addition to Patanjali’s products being attractive to many people of Indian origin Patanjali also found a considerable consumer segment for yoga wellness and natural products in Western countries. These consumers tended to be affluent more educated and open to new products and services. Indeed Ramdev had expressed global aspirations for yoga and perhaps Patanjali. “My vision for the next 50 years is that all [the] world do yoga” he said with a smile and a sweeping flourish of his arms. “I will go everywhere . . . Western country Eastern country Muslim country Christian country. I will do yoga for all!” The Indian government also promoted yoga and related practices both domestically and internationally and had persuaded the United Nations to declare June 2 2015 as the first International Yoga Day. Indeed yoga was growing in developed countries. The number of yoga practitioners in the United States had increased to more than 36 million up from 20.4 million in 2012. Reportedly these practitioners spent $16 billion on yoga classes clothing equipment and accessories. Perhaps with an eye on such potential Patanjali was reportedly in discussions with Amazon to sell its products through Amazon’s e-commerce portal in nine countries including the United States the United Kingdom and Japan which together accounted for 300 million Amazon shoppers.The market in developed countries also included consumers living in poverty who might be a good target for Patanjali’s low-price and high-quality products. The poverty rate in the United States stood at 13.5 per cent in 2015 (i.e. 43.1 million people living in poverty) and income inequality in the United States had been rising for nearly 30 years. Rising income inequalities in developed countries had been noted by many agencies including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the World Bank Group and the World Economic Forum.While these trends appeared to favour Patanjali’s expansion into American or other Western countries these markets differed vastly from India’s markets. Perhaps Patanjali’s strengths were better aligned with the Indian subcontinent. Commenting on Patanjali’s international aspirations Ramdev said “We have already set up our units in Nepal and Bangladesh and our products have reached the Middle East and became popular in some of the countries including Saudi Arabia.”  Reports also indicated that Patanjali was setting up a unit in Jharkhand to export to China Myanmar and Bangladesh. Revealing what could be Patanjali’s strategy for the international market Ramdev said “We should be concentrating in poor countries as the profits from those countries will be utilised for development work there itself.” Swadeshi JeansBy 2016 most of Patanjali’s growth had come from adding more products for the Indian market. Ramdev saw the next step for Patanjali as entering the clothing and textile segment with the introduction of blue jeans. He said “We will make men’s and women’s wear not just traditional Indian clothing but also modern wear like jeans for example. Just because I am a baba does not mean we cannot marry modernity with spirituality we can make let’s say desi jeans.”While details about Patanjali’s swadeshi jeans were still emerging Balkrishna said:Jeans is a western concept and there are two things we can do with western concepts. Either boycott them or adopt them but customise them to suit our traditions. Jeans have become so popular that they cannot be taken away from the Indian society. Swadeshi jeans will be Indianised jeans in style design and fabric. . . . Denim jeans that people wear these days come from abroad or are manufactured here by western companies. They are all based on designs and cultural patterns of foreign countries. These are not suited to Indian culture. Our jeans will be similar to many Indian clothes. This will make Indian women feel comfortable too.Reportedly Patanjali planned to employ a team of designers specializing in Indian wear. Because textile manufacturing was scale-sensitive it was unlikely that Patanjali would fabricate its own denim or contract directly with cotton farmers. Patanjali could fabricate their jeans in-house but had already been approached by several companies interested in manufacturing their swadeshi jeans. Where the jeans would be distributed and sold had not been announced.The retail sales value of the Indian jeans market was growing at over 15 per cent per year and had reached $2.3 billion with projections of $3 billion for 2020. The market for women’s jeans represented 24 per cent of the total market but was growing more rapidly than the market for men’s jeans. Jeans in the super-premium segment and branded jeans were experiencing the fastest growth while sales of cheaper economy jeans had decreased approximately 6 per cent in the five years between 2010 and 2015. The market was highly fragmented with the leading brand Levi’s achieving a share of only 5.8 per cent (see Exhibit 7). Other popular brands included Killer Lee Wrangler Zara and Flying Machine. India was a major producer of cotton and denim and all the major brands were made from Indian denim and fabricated in India. Of the top 10 Indian jean brands four were from MNCs five were from Indian companies and one was from a joint venture between a major Indian company and a foreign corporation.The popularity of yoga pants and leggings was increasing which led to the launch of stretch jeans and jeans that combined high quality or style with comfort. Some of these new jeans gaining in popularity were Shape Keeper by Wrangler with stretch denim; Magma Fusion by Lee which contained volcanic crystals; and classic Slim Fit jeans by Levi’s. Jeans were expected to remain popular in India due to a trend of Westernization among urban youth rising disposable income and growth of the organized retail sector and e-commerce. Blue Jeans and BeyondAccording to Ramdev jeans might only be the start: suits shirts pants and other clothing were also possibilities for Patanjali. If Patanjali could turn blue jeans into swadeshi jeans it might enter other consumer goods businesses such as shoes personal accessories or even the home furnishings and furniture market. It seemed there was no end to the businesses Patanjali might enter in India. In addition it seemed there were many other countries Patanjali might expand to. With little or no effort it had already seen its products reach distant international markets. It might not be far-fetched for it to actively enter those markets and fulfill its global ambitions.Exhibit 1: Patanjali-Affiliated Charities and other OrganizationsNote: Panchagavya referred to five cow products: three directly obtained from cows (i.e. milk dung and urine) and two derived from cow’s milk (i.e. curd and ghee).

It was owned by 3.6 million milk producers. Amul was affected by Patanjali’s rapid expansion into ghee and its plans to add other dairy products. Amul’s wide range of dairy products included ghee—which was priced lower than Patanjali’s product which had a 14 per cent price premium—milk chocolates and desserts. Dabur India Ltd. (Dabur) a publicly traded Indian company with headquarters near New Delhi manufactured Ayurvedic medicine and other products. It competed in multiple markets with Patanjali. Controlling interest of Dabur was acquired by a German company in 2008. In 2016 it realized revenues of ₹84.4 billion and profits of ₹12.5 billion. Dabur was the company most affected by Patanjali’s rapid growth. Dabur produced fruit juices offered at a 14 per cent lower price than Patanjali and honey which was offered at a price 47 per cent lower than Patanjali. Dabur’s long-established leadership in digestives and Ayurvedic medicines and oils was threatened by Patanjali.Britannia Industries was an Indian company headquartered in Kolkata in east India. It was part of an Indian conglomerate with estimated revenues of $1.2 billion in 2016. Britannia was specialized generating about 75 per cent of its revenue from biscuits other bakery products and dairy products including ghee. Britannia was the leader in the biscuit market and had built a solid brand image. Parle Products sold biscuits under its well-known brand Parle-G. The Indian private company was founded in 1929 and became the world’s largest-selling biscuit brand in 2011. Patanjali did not have a major pricing advantage in the biscuits market.Marico was a Mumbai-based company founded in 1991. It manufactured a range of oils including edible oil. Marico had revenues comparable to Patanjali but with more depth in oil products.Emami Limited was founded in 1974 as an Ayurvedic medicine and skin care manufacturer located in West Bengal. Revenues in fiscal year 2015–16 were ₹26.2 billion and profits were ₹3.6 billion. Emami attributed its success to being a “truly Indian company” with niche Ayurveda and herbal-based positioning as well as its strong innovation and new category incubation. It competed with Patanjali primarily in hair oils and face creams.Nestlé S.A. was a food and beverages multinational company headquartered in Switzerland. Nestlé offered dairy products baby food medical food bottled water and frozen food. Nestlé India realized revenues of $1.5 billion in 2016. Nestlé’s Maggi Noodles were the biggest competitor for Patanjali’s Atta Noodles which sold for a lower price.Hindustan Unilever Ltd. based in Mumbai was the Indian subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever. It offered a wide range of products in the consumer goods industry competing with Patanjali in the personal and home-care segments with face washes and creams shampoos and conditioners detergents and soaps as well as a few food products including jam and ketchup.Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd. was a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive Company. A leading provider of dental care products (toothbrushes and toothpaste) in India the company had been significantly affected by Patanjali’s 2010 entry into this segment with Dant Kanti toothpaste. By 2016 Patanjali was estimated to have a 4 per cent market share.Sri Sri Ayurveda (SSA) Trust was the fast-moving consumer goods arm of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s The Art of Living Foundation a humanitarian and educational non-governmental organization founded in 1981 with a presence in 156 countries and more than 370 million followers. The SSA products were made at a world-class manufacturing facility in Bangalore India. The trust’s product portfolio was almost as broad as Patanjali’s but lagged far behind in sales due in large part to SSA’s limited distribution: 600 franchised stores as well as portable shops set up at Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s gatherings. There were plans to expand the number of SSA stores and ongoing discussions with major retailers about distributing SSA products.Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹66.689 on February 28 2017Source: Created by the case authors.

She had just wrapped up her 21st year of teaching college courses within Philadelphia prisons through Inside-Out. Now she needed to prepare for the summer Inside-Out’s busiest season for international instructor training. As Pompa reflected on the past year she knew she needed to raise more funds to support the program’s vital work and hire additional staff. University students and incarcerated students alike regularly referred to the course as having been life-changing. Program participants around the country were so passionate about the experience that even after leaving the program they continued meeting regularly in Inside-Out “Think Tanks” to educate their communities and advocate for prison system reform. Faculty from the Inside-Out Instructor Training Program reported that the training had revived their passion for teaching and prisons participating in Inside-Out noted improvements in the behaviour and mental health of the incarcerated students. Despite the success stories Pompa knew it would take more than anecdotal evidence to gain new funders. Prison education funding was competitive and foundations and individual donors increasingly required tangible impact measurements to demonstrate program efficacy. Gathering that data within the strict boundaries of the prison system would be a challenge and might call into question the efforts and effectiveness of the Inside-Out Network members—hundreds of colleges universities sponsors and instructors. Assessing long-term impacts seemed nearly impossible because it was difficult to keep track of participants as they graduated from the college program or completed their prison sentences and returned to the outside world. Plus as Pompa looked ahead to the upcoming summer she knew any measurement efforts would need to be extremely cost-efficient. Without the funding to hire extra staff she and her existing team were already stretched thin. Creating Inside-OutWhen Pompa joined Temple University’s Criminal Justice Department as teaching faculty in 1992 she made prison visits a regular part of her curriculum. “Part of my personal mission is to get as many people to visit inside prisons and jails as possible” Pompa said. “We as a society are only able to continue to incarcerate 2.2 million people because so many of us don’t know what’s going on. Getting people to visit inside prisons is one of the ways that change is going to happen.”Pompa had spent years working in prisons and becoming familiar with the landscape. Still she found herself surprised by the impact of these prison visits. “One day a few years into teaching I remember taking my students to speak to a panel of men who were serving life sentences in prison.” The discussion quickly moved beyond basic criminology questions. “We talked about crime and justice and race and class and politics and economics—and how it was all interwoven. Up to that point I had never had this powerful of a discussion anywhere.” Following the discussion one of the men from the panel suggested that Pompa teach an entire course within a prison for both incarcerated and university students. Pompa couldn’t get the idea out of her head. She began planning and negotiating with prison and university officials and two years later she offered the first full-semester course at a local jail. Each week 15 university students (“outside” students) came to a jail to meet with 15 incarcerated students (“inside” students). She recalled “At first I was really focused on what we could learn together about crime and justice. What I didn’t expect was the other learning that unfolded before my eyes. People were learning about themselves about communication about conflict and about society and their relationship to society in a totally different way.”One inside student agreed: “I started seeing things I could do. In the eight years I’ve been incarcerated I’ve never felt so strong about wanting to make a change.”Designing a Successful CurriculumEach Inside-Out course involved equal numbers of inside and outside students meeting weekly inside a prison or jail. Students sat in a circle with inside and outside students alternating. “What this circle represents is an opportunity to bring people back into the community” said Pompa. She screened all of the students both inside and outside prior to admission to ensure that they could handle the workload and the unique social demands of the course. “I was so trying to be at ease” said one outside student recalling her first day in the course. “But as soon as [the inside students] entered the classroom you didn’t have to try because everyone was so amiable.” Pompa was clear about the goals of the Inside-Out courses: “We were not going in to study the folks on the inside. We were not going in to help them; nobody asked us for help. We were not advocating for them in any way. . . . It was really studying together.” Pompa stayed in the background as much as possible facilitating conversations between the students to help them learn from each other. The students completed coursework around a central theme such as criminology or sociology but discussions naturally diverged into a wide range of issues including race poverty education and students’ experiences inside and outside of the walls. “They come in seeing us as criminals” one inside student said reflecting on an ethics course he took “and we may see them as people in school or the outside world or whatever . . . but the point of ethics is to see past that and to see the actual person. It fits for the class because there’s two different worlds coming into this class trying to learn the same thing.” Correctional facilities kept a close eye on programs such as Inside-Out that operated within their walls. Prison wardens were highly interconnected and bad news travelled quickly. “I’ve seen really wonderful programs get shut down because people bring in contraband or people fall in love or something occurs” Pompa said. “We cannot afford for that to happen. Period.” To protect these boundaries the only personal information exchanged by students was their first names. Students agreed not to contact one another outside of class even after completing the course. “You go into this class knowing that you can never be in contact with the inside students again” one outside student recalled. “And leaving on the last day was saying goodbye forever. Honestly I think that’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” Thanks to these boundaries Inside-Out had not had any major incidents in its 21-year history but Pompa knew it was an ongoing risk. “If anything bad were to happen—an injury or accident—correctional facilities could get rid of the program in a heartbeat.”Global ExpansionWhen Pompa first began teaching Inside-Out classes the program met in a jail in Philadelphia. Because those in jail had relatively short sentences some of the inside students were released midway through the course each semester which disrupted classes and learning. In 2002 Pompa had the opportunity to move her courses to Graterford Prison a maximum-security prison located an hour’s drive outside of Philadelphia. Due to the longer sentences that people served in prison inside students at Graterford could commit to full-semester courses and the classroom discussions became even richer. When Pompa’s first course at Graterford ended none of her students wanted to stop meeting. They decided to continue coming together weekly and became the “Graterford Think Tank” a critical guiding and advising body for the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program. By 2018 the Graterford Think Tank had been meeting weekly for over 16 years.Following Pompa’s initial success two colleagues from Temple University approached her about teaching their subjects through Inside-Out and expanding the program within Philadelphia. Later the Graterford Think Tank suggested expanding the Inside-Out Program nationally. To coordinate the expansion Pompa founded the Inside-Out Center and became its executive director. In 2003 Pompa received a Soros Justice Senior Fellowship to fund the expansion and in July 2004 the Inside-Out Center offered its first training session for faculty from other universities. “We were afraid that nobody would come because it was too weird an idea” Pompa recalled. “We were hoping for maybe 10 to 12 people. We got 20 people in the first training from all over the country.”Instructor training classes consisted of 15–20 faculty who spent 60 hours over seven days discussing course structure completing team projects and meeting with the Think Tank inside of the prison to talk through curricular and diversity issues. “You cannot go in without preparation” said Pompa. “Instructors must know the language prisons use and what questions to ask.”The instructor training sessions cost $2700 and centred on Inside-Out’s unique dialogue-based approach to education which emphasized learning how to communicate deeply across large social differences. In an Inside-Out learning circle “students on both sides have a voice in the world despite their different opinions” said Interim Executive Director David Krueger “and this method of dialogue is important to creating basic values of civic conversation.”The instructor training proved to be very successful not only for preparing faculty to facilitate Inside-Out classes but also to encourage deeper exploration of what it meant to teach. “It was very experientially oriented” said Wade Deisman a professor from Vancouver reflecting on his week-long experience in 2015. “It renewed my sense of teaching mission at a fundamental bedrock level.” By the end of 2018 925 instructors had been trained to offer Inside-Out programming in 45 US states and 12 countries and about half of these instructors had taught Inside-Out classes.Part of the instructor training was focused on starting new Inside-Out courses which meant creating university–prison partnerships. By the end of 2018 more than 150 partnerships had been formed between correctional facilities and educational institutions as diverse as Ohio State University and Stanford. One Inside-Out program in Mexico was made up of students who had worked in drug cartels while another at the University of Sydney focused on incarcerated women. As the programs grew Think Tanks sprang up organically and by 2018 the Inside-Out Center was coordinating communication between more than 30 of them. In all 35000 inside and outside students had completed coursework in many disciplines such as criminal justice law ethics sociology literature and even yoga. The Inside-Out CenterAs Inside-Out courses spread into new communities the Inside-Out Center expanded to serve as the formal hub of the international network. In addition to coordinating faculty training and overseeing the network of Think Tanks the Inside-Out Center handled media coverage maintained the website tried to connect with alumni and promoted the organization’s vision and values (see Exhibit 1). Including Pompa the Inside-Out Center employed two full-time and five part-time staff. The Inside-Out Center did not have a board but relied instead on three committees of Inside-Out instructors and staff to lead key initiatives. The Executive Committee assisted with major decisions especially at critical decision-making points or as new issues arose. The Network Committee offered direction in building out the teacher trainings and provided ongoing support to the faculty network. The Evaluation and Research Committee assisted groups or individuals who were interested in evaluating the program and also oversaw the ethical considerations that could be raised by research and evaluation efforts. The Think Tanks continued to play a pivotal role in the leadership of the Inside-Out Network. Think Tank members helped plan and conduct training sessions; developed independent projects such as re-entry programs for people who were being released; and led community workshops on racial education justice and civic participation. Indeed as civic dialogue became increasingly polarized Think Tanks began to explore ways to promote dialogue across all kinds of social fault lines. Finally Think Tanks provided continuity and coherence. Because so many of its members were serving life sentences the Graterford Think Tank in particular provided an unusually stable source of guidance thought-leadership and cultural continuity for the Inside-Out Network. “The Think Tanks were generated out of a bonded feeling and deep connection” said Tyrone Werts an Inside-Out veteran who had served 37 years behind bars before joining Pompa as the international Think Tank coordinator. Think Tank participants spoke movingly of the importance of the Think Tank’s work and took satisfaction in affecting the outside world by learning with and helping to educate outside students instructors and community members.The Inside-Out Network was highly decentralized and all of the funding for specific courses came from participating institutions. Tuition dollars from the outside students funded the instructors’ salaries while partnering correctional facilities provided inside students with classroom space and correctional officers. The Inside-Out Center itself was funded primarily through foundation grants donations from individuals and earned revenue from the faculty training sessions. Private funding required long hours of work to obtain and was unpredictable. For example in 2015 The Inside-Out Center applied to renew a $300000 grant through the Ford Foundation but was awarded only $100000 in part because the foundation had changed its remit (see Exhibit 2). Higher Education in PrisonsAs of 2016 70 per cent of all US high-school graduates were enrolling in (although not necessarily finishing) colleges and universities and from 2013 through 2018 the higher education industry grew slowly but steadily at 1.8 per cent annually to become a $497.3 billion portion of the $1.5 trillion education industry. Despite that growth university administrators were increasingly concerned with projected declines in the numbers of high-school graduates rapidly increasing internal costs and growing public criticism about the high cost of college tuition. To remain competitive and engage potential new students universities worked to differentiate their offerings. Online education volunteer programs travel abroad experiences and community engagement programs such as Inside-Out were among the strategies universities employed to help their programs stand out. Prison education was a particularly relevant learning opportunity for students in 2018. The Black Lives Matter movement was raising awareness of racial discrimination in the United States including the disparity in incarceration rates based on race: African Americans were five times more likely than Caucasians to be incarcerated and made up 40 per cent of all people incarcerated in the United States despite representing only 13 per cent of the population. The divisive 2016 presidential election had also drawn attention to the lack of political dialogue about these differences across the country and pointed to the need for civil discourse between people holding differing views. Indeed from a smattering of local university programs started in the 1970s (such as Villanova University’s launched in 1972) prison education had grown into an estimated $62 billion industry. While Inside-Out was unique in its approach it competed with several other innovative programs. The Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform and the Petey Greene Program sent trained volunteers to tutor incarcerated individuals with the dual goals of offering prison education and advocating for structural reforms. The Bard Prison Initiative offered college courses and degrees to people incarcerated in six prisons in New York State and boasted a 2 per cent recidivism rate among graduates. In 2015 prison education efforts received a boost when government-backed Pell grants were made available in a limited way to help fund education for people in prison—although by 2018 the new administration had indicated that it was unlikely to renew the grants. In recent years technology-based prison educational solutions had also become available. Code 7370 was a non-profit computer programming class in San Quentin California that sought to reduce recidivism by helping people in prison prepare for jobs in technology and business following their release. Because students had limited access to technology they completed assignments without Internet access by using special desktop computers with double-monitor configurations that allowed them to receive instruction from remote teachers through an administrator’s computer. American Prison Data Systems Innertainment Delivery Systems and Edovo (Education Over Obstacles) made customized tamper-proof tablets equipped with educational materials available to people in prison for about $2 per hour. JPay another competitor provided in-prison video educational and gaming content and an e-messaging service to help people in prison connect to families “to empower those individuals with access to educational tools and assist in their overall rehabilitation process.” JPay offered jails and prisons approximately $0.05 for every message between people in prison and their families a lucrative extra revenue source for participating facilities.Education’s Effect on People in PrisonEducation played a complex role within prisons. Prisons around the country faced numerous issues including overcrowding understaffing high turnover rates among officers and low funding for employee training and operations. Poor conditions had the potential to increase tensions between prison staff and those incarcerated which could contribute to violence. One review of incidents in Maryland prisons documented $860000 of medical care required as a result of 257 assaults not including the costs associated with five deaths (two officers and three incarcerated individuals) lost work time for officers injured and extra legal costs. These realities made attractive any program that could decrease violent incidents in prisons.Prisons also struggled with budget shortfalls. Indeed many prisons had begun to bill prisoners for essentials such as meals toilet paper clothing and dental care a practice commonly referred to as “pay-for-stay.” “Why should the people of Elko County pay for somebody else’s meals in jail?” asked one commissioner in Elko County Nevada where a pay-for-stay program had been implemented. Others saw these programs as part of the punishment. “If they are violating the law” said one sheriff in Iowa “then they should be the ones to pay for it.” Officials in Riverside County California voted to approve a plan to charge people in prison for their stay and reimburse the county for food clothing and health care stating “You do the crime you will serve the time and now you will also pay the dime.” National studies had demonstrated that prison education led to multiple positive outcomes for incarcerated individuals and for society at large. Completing college courses while in prison improved self-esteem and social competence both during incarceration and following release. It also reduced the experience of violence while inside prison (by about 9 per cent according to one study). Further a careful assessment of 58 studies suggested that any exposure to education while in prison (whether at the high-school or college level and whether or not completed) resulted in a three-year recidivism rate of between 30.1 per cent and 38.6 per cent compared with between 43.3 per cent and 51.8 per cent for those receiving no education while in prison. Estimates of the cost to society of crimes committed varied widely from $2100 per incident for theft to $87000 for assault to $8650000 for murder. Other estimates suggested that over a full career men with bachelor’s degrees averaged $660000 more in median lifetime earnings than did high-school graduates and for women it was $450000 more. For both men and women with some college education the differential was $170000. Funding ChallengesDespite the steady growth of the Inside-Out Network and the passion of the students and instructors involved Pompa worried about the Inside-Out Center’s sustainability. As costs rose universities worried about class size and Inside-Out classes typically had no more than 15 paying (outside) students to cover the cost of faculty time—from $10000 to more than $25000 per course. Prison wardens had more education offerings including technology platforms from which to choose. With the politicization of all discussions concerning prisons and race there was an increased need to engage in public relations on behalf of the Inside-Out Center’s dialogue-based approach. Even Inside-Out’s growth had created challenges as the already busy staff computers systems and travel budgets were stretched almost to the breaking point as they struggled to accommodate the increases in instructors to be trained partners to be managed Think Tanks to be coordinated and alumni to be engaged. Worst of all funding was becoming ever more fickle. The partnership with Temple University had provided core support over the years including access to office space and partial funding of Pompa’s salary but the level of support varied with leadership changes and budgetary constraints and centres including Inside-Out were being increasingly pressured to generate additional funds. Grants and donations were becoming harder to obtain and renew putting more pressure on earned income from training programs to cover expenses. Over the years the Inside-Out Center had secured a few large grants but each lasted for only a limited time often because the foundation priorities changed. Complicating matters foundations (and even individual donors) increasingly asked for rigorous often quantitative measures of impact. In a 2017 survey 98 per cent of funders said that impact was among their top three considerations when awarding grants while 88 per cent of respondents said they prioritized program outcomes in their review of non-profit reports. Finally the Inside-Out Center struggled to secure the resources and staff required to track down and engage its alumni base—a task made all the more difficult by the realities that the alumni were young and/or incarcerated and that they identified with local Inside-Out programs rather than with the international Inside-Out Network.Measuring Inside-Out’s ImpactMeasuring the impact on inside students was a delicate proposition. The Inside-Out program prided itself on treating people in prison as people in contrast to the correctional system which literally referred to incarcerated individuals by their inmate numbers. Historically people in prison had been used in studies without their consent which reinforced the need for the Inside-Out Center to be clear about its methods and goals if it did choose to begin collecting data. Federal regulations and university practices seriously restricted the study of “vulnerable populations” including people in prison. The Inside-Out Center also shied away from measuring recidivism citing the intense pressure people faced upon their release. “I’m not under the illusion that this is a silver bullet” Pompa said. “When somebody gets out of prison there are so many variables hitting them. There is no way that a 15-week class is able to stand up against those variables.”Measuring the impact on outside students was similarly challenging as the Inside-Out courses were but one part of the college experience. And measuring the impact of the Inside-Out Network was harder still with its alumni dispersed across a dozen countries and multiple prison systems.Reflecting these realities many staff and Think Tank members argued passionately that the power of Inside-Out was in the transformation of individual participants both inside and outside and so was best captured in stories not numbers. Further some suggested that trying to capture the experience in numbers might detract from Inside-Out’s mission and culture. When reporting program results Inside-Out had long focused on stories. Students completing surveys at the end of each course regularly reported that the course had changed their lives affected their majors and career choices and impacted their perspectives on criminal justice and themselves. Informally several correctional institutions and Think Tanks had reported improved behaviour and increased leadership internally following Inside-Out courses but there were no systematic records. Further while these stories were inspiring they captured only short-term impacts. Several times Pompa and her team had attempted to follow up with instructors to learn what impacts they had noticed related to their classes. “We really wanted to put a finger on the lasting impact” Krueger said “to see what [the experience] means five years from now.” Unfortunately these attempts to collect impact data were limited due to lack of resources and staff time.Finally questions of ownership and impact emerged from the questions about measurement. Who were the numbers for and how could Inside-Out maintain control over access to and the use and interpretation of the measures? Would funders interpret the measures the same way that Inside-Out did? Would prison officials or governments or competitor programs gain access to the measures? In the highly controlled world of prisons a world in which even small events or missteps could be amplified Inside-Out had been extremely careful to preserve its standards and control its story. Would an attempt to quantify impact in any way distort or distract from the Inside-Out experiences and effects that the measurement was meant to convey?Next StepsAs Pompa prepared for 2019 with 10 training sessions scheduled in several countries a number of new Think Tanks emerging and efforts to connect with alumni expanding she knew something needed to change. The past 21 years had proven that Inside-Out worked—that students prisons and communities benefited from Inside-Out’s unique approach to learning. Yet Pompa also knew that the Inside-Out Center desperately needed to secure a steady stream of funding to support the Inside-Out Network in an increasingly competitive prison education and funding context. Both to raise Inside-Out’s profile and to secure additional resources the Inside-Out Center needed to find a cost-effective and culturally appropriate way to measure and communicate its impact to its many stakeholders. The question was—how?Exhibit 1: Inside-out Mission and Vision statementsThe Inside-Out Prison Exchange ProgramSocial Change through Transformative EducationMission StatementEducation in which we are able to encounter each other especially across profound social barriers is transformative and allows problems to be approached in new and different ways.

For the previous 12 years Midea Refrigerator had been pursuing globalization via direct export but the high cost of exporting products was depleting its profits and undermining its competitiveness in the international market. Therefore a transition from direct exporting to foreign direct investment (FDI) was necessary. However the exact approach to securing FDI was unclear. Securing investments and a domestic environment in either India or Russia would help the company but which one was right for an initial trial? Further once Midea Refrigerator decided on the target nation it would also have to choose the most suitable FDI model: greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture.CHINA’S “GO GLOBAL” STRATEGY AND HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE INDUSTRYBefore the 1980s there were hardly any competitive domestic manufacturers of household appliances in China. The situation changed with China’s economic reform and opening in 1978 as well as the implementation of two strategies: “bring in” and “go global” which referred to the goals of first bringing in foreign companies and technology to develop China and then encouraging Chinese companies to develop their overseas markets. Accordingly China’s household appliance manufacturers started importing equipment and production lines from developed countries learning these new technologies and producing new appliances of their own. In addition foreign manufacturers set up branches in China. By the end of 1994 more than 20 Sino-foreign joint ventures had been established to make household appliances. A number of brands sprang up and waged a nationwide battle of acquisition producing some giants in the field including Midea TCL Gree and Haier. These companies competed against each other and the foreign companies for market share in China. To increase profits they also manufactured electrical components or products for foreign brands acting as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For many household appliance manufacturers in China being an OEM was the first step on the path to go global.In the 21st century even more Chinese enterprises were exporting or operating abroad but foreign household appliance enterprises were pursuing their own strategic shifts after China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Hitachi Toshiba and Matsushita simultaneously set up innovation centres in China. Samsung LG and A.O. Smith greatly increased their numbers of production lines and investments in the Chinese market. To carve out more market share these brands lowered their prices and forced domestic enterprises into a price battle in which the fledgling Chinese companies paid a heavy price. Suffering from decreasing profits in the Chinese market Chinese household electrical appliance manufacturers had to accelerate their overseas market development. In 2013 Chinese companies looking to go global had a historic opportunity. The “One Belt One Road Initiative” proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping provided a new insight into global expansion. “One Belt” and “One Road” referred to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road Economic Zone which connected Asia with Europe via Russia and Southeast Asia respectively. The initiative was proposed to strengthen ties between China and the countries along the “Belt” and “Road.” With national preferential policies reducing transnational operation risks a number of enterprises had already elected to invest in the “Belt nations” and some household appliance manufacturers were preparing their next move with regard to this changing landscape.MIDEA GROUP AND MIDEA REFRIGERATORMidea GroupEstablished in 1968 Midea Group was a publicly listed Fortune 500 company that offered one of the most comprehensive product ranges in the home appliance industry. It produced diverse equipment for lighting floor care and refrigeration as well as laundry machines large cooking appliances small kitchen appliances and water appliances. In 2015 Midea had 260 logistics centres in more than 200 countries and global revenue of US$22.17 billion.Midea RefrigeratorMidea Refrigerator was established in 2001. In 2004 Midea Group acquired Royalstar Company by acquiring 50.5 per cent of its shares as well as Hefei Hualing Co. Ltd a foreign-invested company whose main business was exporting refrigerators. These acquisitions greatly improved the company’s capability for refrigerator manufacturing. By 2017 Midea Refrigerator had three manufacturing bases in Hefei and Guangzhou with more than 6000 employees. Midea Refrigerator produced products under the brand names Midea Royalstar and Hualing. Both Midea and Royalstar were very well-known brands in China—especially Midea whose value exceeded $4.6 billion in 2016. Gradually Midea Refrigerator became one of the largest refrigerator suppliers in China. Further the firm was continually increasing its development earning $5.4 billion in 2015 in the global market.THE PRODUCT “GOES GLOBAL”Unable to compete directly with the largest corporations in the global market (e.g. Siemens LG Electrolux and Panasonic) Midea Refrigerator like many refrigerator manufacturers in the early 21st century opted to pursue the OEM path. With the advantage of low labour and material costs in China Midea Refrigerator could make a profit by manufacturing refrigerators for international brands like Electrolux Sears LEC and Morita; this arrangement resulted in the shipment of Midea products to dozens of countries and regions and the OEM market came to account for half of Midea Refrigerator’s business.However the landscape changed after 2001. China’s development was reducing OEM profit due to the rising cost of production even as competition in the national market was becoming increasingly fierce. The expansion of Midea Refrigerator also called for more capital. The tide of globalization after China’s WTO entry and the requirement to develop drove Midea Refrigerator to choose one of two options: struggle against adversity and attempt to flourish or watch its profits dwindle away. It was high time to make a transformation. Therefore despite all the uncertainties the company’s manager made the bold choice to launch Midea-brand refrigerators in the global market. But the question remained: how should the company implement this launch? THE BRAND “GOES GLOBAL”The Choice of Channel In 2004 there were hardly any household appliance enterprises in China pursuing global expansion. The only significant player in this category was Haier which adopted a “difficulty first” strategy—occupying the market that was hard to enter first before dealing with the easier ones. Established in 1984 Haier imported China’s first foreign refrigerator manufacturing production line from the German firm Liebherr and proposed a brand-building strategy early in 1985. It exported the first shipment of refrigerators to Germany in 1990 making Europe its first step to entering the global market. In 1995 Haier began to establish overseas factories and in 1996 it opened its first international factory Haier Sapporo in Indonesia. In 1997 Haier set up LKG Electrical Co. Ltd in the Philippines and Haier Industrial Co. Ltd in Malaysia. In 1999 the company established its first industrial park in the United States (in South Carolina). In this way Haier had pursued a direct localization path from the outset.Because it was successful for another large Chinese appliance company Haier’s FDI strategy seemed to be feasible for Midea Refrigerator but Midea Refrigerator declined to follow Haier’s example and turned to a safer path instead: direct export first. He Xiangjian the chairman of Midea Group said “For us low velocity was much better than going astray.” Thus 2005 witnessed the beginning of Midea Refrigerator’s direct export for overseas brand building. The daunting task that remained for the company was to find the right channel and market.Overseas Subsidiary and the Commercial Agent ChannelEarly in 2000 Midea Group’s U.S. subsidiary European subsidiary and Japanese subsidiary started operations and its branches in South Korea and Singapore were established in 2001 which laid a solid foundation for Midea Refrigerator’s export business. The subsidiaries were empowered by the headquarters to draw up their own marketing plans to suit the real conditions of the local market. In this respect Midea Refrigerator benefited from the subsidiaries that the headquarters had opened taking advantage of local expertise. In the process the company honed its skills to set the right prices and conduct the appropriate marketing activities to promote overseas sales. To broaden its existing channels Midea Refrigerator had to make a new path for itself. To export to more overseas markets the company had to cooperate with commercial agents in the target markets. Opening the commercial agent channel was not easy because Midea Refrigerator had to decide which country to start with and then find the appropriate agent. The company was primarily operating as an OEM and the United States was the largest market of Midea-manufactured refrigerators but did that make the country a promising prospect for Midea Refrigerator’s exports? A glance at the U.S. market at the time (i.e. 2004) revealed that its refrigerator market was almost totally carved up among several American giants including Whirlpool and General Electric and some time-honoured foreign brands such as LG and Electrolux. These prominent brands not only had high-quality products but also had the greatest brand awareness among North American consumers which was truly indomitable; the same was true in Europe and many other developed nations which left newcomers only a marginal possibility of success. New geographical locations had to be considered. The manager of Midea Refrigerator carefully considered this vital first step and before long he recognized one area that presented great potential: Australia.Australia: A New Prospect? Early in 1978 the Australian government had included China in a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP was a preferential tariff system that provided for a formal system of exemption from the more general rules of the WTO. A low tariff of 5 per cent greatly benefited Chinese firms that exported to Australia. Moreover Australia was different from many developed nations because of its rarity of resources and the fact that most of its industrial products including household electrical appliances were imported. Most importantly there were not many local refrigerator manufacturers there so Midea Refrigerator’s management reasoned that it might be easier to carve out a market in this less competitive environment. The market prospect was also quite positive because Australia as a developed nation had positive economic performance and rising purchasing power in terms of household appliance consumption. In spite of this generally positive environment the path to Australia was not smooth. The first difficulty was to find the right agent. This agent needed to be powerful and have multiple distribution channels. It took months for Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team to search and assess candidates before they finally made the decision to cooperate with “X Agency.” Even more difficult was the choice of retailer and this negotiation consumed even more time. It was hard to persuade retailers to change the current product structure. To establish the partnership Midea Refrigerator’s manager had to make significant compromises including full support in terms of resources personnel and technical training as well as offering an agency commission that was 10 per cent higher than the market price and granting exclusive agent rights for the contract year. Ultimately however the deal was settled. Yet finding a place in the Australian market was still far from easy. Foreign giants that had entered the Australian market early (e.g. Electrolux and LG) were strong. Electrolux and LG had 30 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the Australian refrigerator market so Midea Refrigerator would have to work hard for its own share. To gain this crucial hold the manager and his team used three strategies:First target the “middle-” and “low-end” markets. The high-end market had already been captured by much larger companies. To find out what consumers in the low-end market really needed Midea Refrigerator’s manager and his team conducted market research across the whole Australian refrigerator market. They found that consumers in low-end market attached great importance to the price and energy-conserving qualities of household appliances. In response Midea Refrigerator managed to raise its devices’ energy-conserving abilities and obtained a government certificate for highly energy-efficient products. The company also repeatedly emphasized energy conservation in its marketing while still maintaining a low price point to attract the low-end market. Second make the services localized. In providing services Midea Refrigerator insisted on employing local people to serve the local market especially in positions that involved direct contact with consumers. Third quickly raise brand recognition. Midea Refrigerator held roadshows undertook promotional activities and sponsored popular local events. Most Australian consumers were sports fans and many important sports events were held in Australia making these events ideal national advertising platforms. Midea Group seized the opportunity to become the premier partner sponsor of Melbourne City Football Club so that the brand of Midea Refrigerator could also be widely circulated. The battle for market share in Australia was challenging but opening its first overseas market was highly beneficial for Midea Refrigerator and taught the company many lessons to be used in future expansions as well. By 2015 Midea Refrigerator had entered the U.S. Canadian Malaysian Indonesian Chilean and Vietnamese markets through the company’s subsidiaries and established partnerships with many commercial agents including UE Tech Co. Ltd. in South Korea VSK International Co. Ltd. in Myanmar and Tovarischestvo in Kazakhstan. The growth rate of its direct exports in the global market was buoyant.GLOBAL STRATEGYCompetition in the global market remained fierce. To increase its profits Midea Refrigerator had to lower its costs and make greater breakthroughs in terms of technology. The company was constantly increasing its efforts to achieve these goals.Efficiency ImprovementMidea Refrigerator adopted the “T+3” model to improve efficiency and lower costs. This customer-order model was first developed by the Midea Washing Machine department and was then adopted by the whole company to shorten each cycle (i.e. order receiving material preparation manufacturing and delivery) to less than three days. By adopting the T+3 model the company could quickly respond to orders from anywhere in the world and promptly transport the necessary products or product components to the corresponding market. Technology BreakthroughTo enhance its core competitiveness around the globe Midea Refrigerator continued to strengthen its technology by cooperating with global refrigerator giants like Electrolux and Whirlpool; this cooperation included employing refrigerator experts from Japan and South Korean among other initiatives. Midea Refrigerator received many international certifications including safety certification from US Underwriter Laboratories Inc.—the most authoritative organization in the United States engaging in safety appraisement EU Energy Star certification and TUV quality certification—a widely recognized quality certification in Europe granted by TUV Rheiland. The company also invested more in intelligent refrigerator development. Experts predicted that the intelligent refrigerator was the future of the refrigerator industry around the world and that the global market for intelligent refrigerators would increase at a rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Midea Refrigerator invested in this business niche and was soon a world leader in intelligent refrigerator development. The firm collaborated with Chinese online commerce company Alibaba to formally launch its intelligent refrigerator with the Alibaba Cloud system on September 8 2016. This launch made Midea Refrigerator’s “intelligent system” more localized to consumers in different countries.THE COMPANY “GOES GLOBAL”Despite these efforts Midea Refrigerator’s global market continued to depend solely on direct export which restricted further development and its market share was still limited in some countries. The costs of cross-country transportation and tariffs continued to rise which gave the company little leeway to lower its prices in order to compete with other multinational firms. Twelve years after the decision to launch the brand using direct export Midea Refrigerator opted to take the next strategic step: FDI.Which country should serve as the company’s starting point for FDI? The manager of Midea Refrigerator felt that there were only two clear options: Russia or India. Both countries fit the “One Belt One Road Initiative” which meant that the investment could enjoy favourable national conditions. On the one hand Russia was a large market: 80 per cent of its household electrical appliances were imported from abroad and its consumption rate was increasing by nearly 15 per cent annually. Moreover the country’s refrigerator market comprised 30 per cent of the overall household appliances market. On the other hand India was an emerging economy in Southeast Asia with rising national gross domestic product (GDP) and purchasing power. India’s refrigerator market had significant potential because its climate required the use of refrigeration to keep food fresh. In addition the Indian government had been encouraging FDI in its manufacturing area.Yet another question presented itself to Midea Refrigerator’s manager: which FDI model—greenfield investment acquisition or joint venture—was most suitable for each of the prospective countries? These decisions were key to Midea Refrigerator’s future.

Padmakar was the general manager of human resources (HR) at BPCL—a global Fortune 500 company engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The awards function was the culmination of an internal competition called IDEAS—a competition that sought innovative ideas from employees. In his welcome address Padmakar stated that the purpose of the IDEAS competition was to “nurture promote and recognize ideas” within the company. He observed that over the years the number of participants had increased (see Exhibit 1) that cost-savings estimated by participants were significant (see Exhibit 2) and that BPCL had benefitted from an influx of new thinking and cross-functional collaboration. Although Padmakar acknowledged the successes he was aware of the challenges facing the competition. Participation seemed to be stagnating quality of ideas was a concern and enthusiasm was waning. Additionally many people thought that winning ideas were not being adequately replicated across the company. This meant that BPCL was not reaping the full benefit that was being demonstrated in the competition. Padmakar wondered what might be done to revitalize IDEAS as a platform for innovation.BACKGROUNDBPCL was founded in 1976 by the Indian government after it acquired Burmah Shell Refineries Ltd. in India. In those years the Indian economy was heavily regulated with several restrictions on private enterprise. The Indian petroleum industry in particular was dominated by three state-owned companies including BPCL. Then in the early 1990s the Indian government began to liberalize its economy. To ensure that the company sustained its competitive advantage BPCL’s then chairman Uppiliappan Sundararajan initiated an organizational restructuring exercise. In order to encourage employee involvement in the restructuring he introduced a process called visionary leadership and planning (VLP). The VLP process involved workshops wherein employees across levels participated in creating the vision statement and business plans for BPCL. “The beauty of this process” explained Sundararajan “was that each one felt as if it were his or her own vision statement.” There was palpable excitement in the organization as employees across levels debated brainstormed and found ways to make things happen. For example in 1998 the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh experienced a severe shortage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Workers and management from a plant at Cherlapalli took the initiative to solve the problem. They located a piece of machinery that lay idle at another plant in Tuticorin in the state of Tamil Nadu. They moved the machinery repaired it and started working an additional shift to increase production and supplies of LPG. The following year BPCL achieved 27 per cent sales growth in the area and the Cherlapalli plant became the company’s lowest-cost LPG bottling plant.This new momentum clearly transformed BPCL into a powerhouse of ideas. But then the leadership team faced a dilemma: how could the company store disseminate and replicate these ideas across the organization? BPCL’s information technology (IT) department provided a solution wherein a database was created and employees were encouraged to post and access information. In addition an electronic newsletter was published to acknowledge and recognize innovative employee ideas. However these attempts seemed inadequate to recognize and reward employees for their contributions. Separately the HR team had initiated a suggestion-box scheme. Employees were encouraged to anonymously suggest improvements for the organization. However this scheme did not ensure the implementation of ideas and rewards for suggestions were not seen to be motivating enough. Thus the VLP process the knowledge management technology and the suggestion scheme generated a flood of ideas. The company then needed to channel those ideas while overcoming limitations of earlier efforts. BPCL’s leaders decided to initiate the IDEAS platform as an internal competition with wide-ranging expectations. Sundararajan wanted IDEAS to foster intrinsic motivation provide the freedom to think enable cross-functional interaction generate and implement ideas and ensure adequate rewards for employees. Sumita Bose expected that IDEAS would increase dynamism in the organization and in turn help improve efficiencies and profits. She said “We felt that we need to do something that would shake the company . . . to make an impact . . . [to] add to the bottom line of the company . . . so we thought of IDEAS.”According to George Paul IDEAS helped align BPCL’s brand promise business strategy and organizational culture. BPCL’s brand promise was about “innovation reliability and caring.” Paul believed that IDEAS had the potential to generate “innovative products services business processes and business models” and help BPCL achieve its strategy of differentiation. This view could be supported by an organizational culture where employees not only believed in the brand promise but also practiced it. Paul said “How do you make the beliefs into a habit and the habit into a culture [?] . . . so that [was] the genesis of creating a platform like IDEAS.”For this reason in 2000 BPCL introduced IDEAS with the objective of nurturing promoting and recognizing ideas within the company.THE IDEAS COMPETITION AND PROCESSBeing the brainchild of the company’s chairman IDEAS found easy acceptability within the organization. The HR team was given the responsibility of designing and implementing the IDEAS competition. Emails were crafted and sent to employees details were uploaded on the company’s intranet and posters were displayed in company offices and plants. All these methods of communication were intended to institutionalize IDEAS as a contest and convey its purpose criteria and award information to employees (see Exhibit 3).One of the guiding principles of the competition was that ideas had no meaning unless they were implemented. Therefore the following criteria were laid down for participation:Ideas should have been implemented during the previous financial year.Ideas should be about the development of new or better products processes or services. They could also be about doing things in a more environmentally friendly manner.Ideas should demonstrate financial benefits improvement in processes and reduction in cycle time or waste.In order to maintain consistency across the organization the HR department outlined a process through which entries were received evaluated and rewarded. The process involved the following three stages:Stage 1: Participant submissions had to highlight the significance of the idea the details of the process employed and the financial benefits accrued. The entry could be submitted in English or any of the following Indian languages: Hindi Marathi Gujarati Tamil Malayalam Kannada Bengali Telugu or Oriya. The purpose of allowing entries in regional languages was to encourage employees in BPCL’s non-management cadre who were not so well-versed in English to participate in the competition.Stage 2: Submissions were screened by an internal jury of senior leaders (general managers and executive directors). Evaluations were based on parameters such as degree of creativity feasibility of implementation benefits accrued (financial and non-financial) potential for replicability and overall impact. This screening served as a filter by which ideas would be shortlisted for the final presentation and evaluation.Stage 3: The final round was held in Mumbai and attended by shortlisted employees from all over the country. Participants had to present their ideas before a panel of jury members comprising subject-matter experts academicians and senior leaders. The final round would culminate in the awards celebration which had the glitz and glamour of a mega-event that employees aspired to be part of.Typically 10 awards would be presented at the annual IDEAS awards celebration. The best idea of the year submitted by a team or individual would receive the chairman’s trophy. In addition some deserving ideas would receive a token of appreciation. Also a special booklet would be printed that would showcase all the award-winning ideas and would be circulated across the company. Early Outcomes and Improvements Several entries from the first version of the IDEAS competition received external recognition. Participants won awards for “excellence in creativity and innovation” at India’s national petroleum management program. Internally BPCL’s HR department studied the outcomes of IDEAS 2000. That department found that an overwhelming number of entries—especially award-winning entries—were about technical innovations. For example 11 of 12 awards were flagged as technical entries. The jury seemed to favour submissions that demonstrated tangible benefits. In order to increase participation from support functions and to ensure a greater focus on measurable outcomes the following categories were introduced for IDEAS 2001: technical process and system improvement marketing and sales initiatives and HR.IDEAS 2000 demonstrated that substantial financial savings might be achieved by the organization. Consequently cash awards were introduced to increase employee participation and derive more value from the competition. In 2001 the chairman’s award carried a prize of US$1100 plus a trophy. The first second and third prize winners were awarded about $400 $300 and $200 respectively. Over time BPCL increased the prize monies to reflect the importance accorded to the competition. However the increases were nominal and when the prize was shared between members of a winning team the monies per individual were not substantial.With an 86 per cent increase in the number of entries (from 88 in 2000 to 164 in 2001) the HR department found it difficult to administer the competition in a centralized manner. Further they expected that the number of submissions would continue to rise; consequently shortlisting entries at an early stage seemed like a good idea. To address this need regional rounds were introduced in 2002 making the competition more of a tournament. Entries within each of BPCL’s four regions would be evaluated within the region itself. Each regional adjudication panel consisted of one internal and one external subject-matter expert. These regional rounds resulted in about 30 per cent of local submissions being shortlisted for the final round and enhanced the visibility of IDEAS at local levels. However decentralizing the process increased logistical requirements and raised questions about whether regional panels were applying evaluation criteria uniformly. Consequently BPCL eventually gave up the idea of a multi-stage tournament and reverted to the traditional format of a centralized competition.Due to sustained review and experimentation IDEAS continued to evolve and develop. In 2003 an online portal was introduced to manage greater numbers of entries and serve as an online repository of knowledge. Employees could use the portal to register new ideas view and comment on other entries and access information to replicate past ideas. Thus the IDEAS portal served as a medium for spreading ideas and building a culture of innovation.New Version of IDEASIn many ways IDEAS appeared to be a huge success; however a degree of sluggishness seemed to have set in. Informal conversations and data from past competitions indicated three trends. First some old ideas were being re-submitted by the same or other participants with minor changes in title or technical specifications. Second support functions such as legal finance HR and marketing had increasing difficulty coming up with radically new ideas year after year. Third most submissions were being received just a few days before the deadline indicating perhaps that innovation was topical and had not been sufficiently embedded in the organizational culture.Therefore the HR team wondered if the competition continued to serve its original purpose of nurturing promoting and recognizing new ideas. In particular was the goal of nurturing new ideas being compromised by the criterion that ideas had to be implemented before they could be submitted? As Jayesh Shah remarked “The condition was [that] unless you implement an idea you can’t participate even if you have a great idea . . . then we thought of introducing three new categories.”In 2008 BPCL’s HR team introduced a new version of IDEAS wherein entries could be submitted in three categories:Creative Stroke: This category was for ideas that had been implemented during the year. Entries in this category should have resulted in cost reduction or process improvement.Mind’s Eye: This category was for ideas that had not been implemented but had high potential for adding value to the organization.Echo: This category was created for successful ideas (from past competitions) that were replicated in a location other than that of their origin. Echo was meant to encourage the diffusion of innovative thinking that had already gone through the cycle of trial and experimentation. The objective of introducing these categories was to make the IDEAS platform more vibrant while maximizing participation. The new categories seemed to yield dramatic results for BPCL. Employees began to collaborate across departmental boundaries in their efforts at innovation. For example the following noteworthy entry surfaced in the Creative Stroke category. It had so happened that the Indian army had constructed a strategic advance landing ground (ALG) for helicopter operations in the Khirmu hills of Arunachal Pradesh. This ALG required a safe and reliable refueling system. Given extreme weather and a difficult terrain this was a daunting task. However BPCL’s employees from the engineering and aviation teams worked together to design and construct a pioneering solution.Another example was an entry in the Mind’s Eye category from the Piyala LPG plant located in Uttar Pradesh. The plant had a manual system of painting LPG cylinders. Typically two workers applied primer and paint to the cylinders through a pneumatic hand-operated spray gun. The working conditions were not particularly favourable. Because the workers had to operate in enclosed spaces for an extended period of time they ran the risk of inhaling toxic fumes leading to respiratory illnesses. The idea to solve this problem was to mount paint spray guns on the existing machinery and make minor technical adjustments that created a semi-automatic system at a reasonable cost.Examples such as these indicated that participation in IDEAS resulted in employees feeling increasingly motivated and engaged in the company. One participant remarked: “I started contributing [to IDEAS] from 2008 onwards. . . . What attracts me more than awards is . . . it’s a place where we can showcase our talent and get an opportunity to rub shoulders with top management.”IDEAS SINCE 2010In 2010 IDEAS completed 10 years of its existence. By then its value as an employee-engagement tool was fairly well established in the minds of the company’s leaders and employees. Dipti Sanzgiri BPCL’s then executive director of HR remarked “IDEAS is a unique initiative saluting the innovative spirit of our people of our organization. I’m sure that each year together we will take it to new heights.” However in 2010 participation in IDEAS dropped by about 40 per cent. By this time the members of the HR team that coordinated IDEAS had changed and Sanzgiri and her team considered a range of new questions. Were employees viewing IDEAS as being owned managed and executed by the HR department alone? Were line managers taking enough responsibility to create an environment to nurture and implement ideas? Was participation in IDEAS being seen as just another item on the to-do list? Was the competition genuinely inspiring employees at the grassroots level where innovation really mattered?Exploring the questions above led Sanzgiri and her team to conceptualize and implement what was called the IDEAS station. This station was a physical space accessible to employees in each of BPCL’s locations. The station would have colour-coded sheets on which employees could write their ideas. Colleagues could build and support the ideas. One manager at each location was appointed as a liaison and was asked to facilitate the process at that location. The model of a traffic light was used to track ideas from generation to implementation. Upon successful implementation an idea would be featured on the green sheet. Those that needed further work would appear on the amber sheet and any ideas that did not seem promising would be moved to the red sheet. The IDEAS station was expected to result in three main benefits. First being a physical space in local offices it was more likely that employees would associate IDEAS with being a local everyday feature of working at BPCL. Second the station might make IDEAS an ongoing process rather than a once-a-year event. Third because the station was accessible to all it was hoped that employees would build on each other’s ideas; this in turn would enhance cross-functional collaboration.Though the IDEAS station was launched with much fanfare and promise the expected momentum did not happen. People were hesitant to post ideas publicly and employees seemed concerned about losing credit for an idea that they thought was original to them. Some were reluctant to join teams involving others’ ideas. It was unclear who would be responsible for implementation. Others lost interest as they felt that the manager responsible had pre-judged the ideas as not having sufficient financial benefit. Sanzgiri was disappointed that the IDEAS station had not been successful. She remarked “I should have realized that it involved a big change management process.” Shah added “Things like this should be driven by top management. Secondly communication did not happen adequately; people could not appreciate the value of the whole process or maybe enough effort was not made to make them understand.”Over the years BPCL continued its efforts to improve IDEAS and celebrate its successes. In 2011 the award-winning ideas of former seasons were chronicled in a coffee-table book. The following year IDEAS was expanded to include joint venture partners and a subsidiary company of BPCL. Branding was also recognized as an important pillar of communication and a logo was created for IDEAS. In 2013 a mascot named “Idee” was introduced to give a face and personality to the competition.Yet IDEAS participants judges and BPCL’s leadership raised some concerns. First judges had observed that a few entries of former years were being repeated—either by the same teams after having made minor improvements or by other teams who did not know of earlier submissions. Second judges were somewhat skeptical about the savings claimed by participants. BPCL’s leaders felt that despite the Echo category award-winning ideas were not being adequately diffused in the organization; as a result the full potential of innovation was not being realized. Finally there were questions about the scope of ideas submitted. Were those innovations that were carried out as part of an employee’s routine responsibilities—for which that employee was paid a salary and had a periodical performance appraisal—to be considered valid entries for IDEAS? Should those submissions that were beyond the scope of the employee’s duties not be accorded additional importance?Amid the concerns and efforts to improve the competition IDEAS also yielded unexpected positive outcomes. For example IDEAS participants scored about 5 per cent higher than non-participants during BPCL’s 360-degree feedback (talent management) process in 2012 and 2014. Thus not only had IDEAS survived for 15 years it seemed to impact matters beyond employee engagement and innovation.WHAT NEXT? In July 2014 Padmakar was appointed as head of the HR department at BPCL. The awards night on January 9 2015 was an opportunity for him to reflect on the future of IDEAS in the context of the broader issues facing the petroleum industry. Three dramatic changes had been occurring in the global petroleum industry. First the international price of crude oil had declined 50 per cent since October 2014. By January 2015 crude was available at about $50 per barrel. Second the Indian government had stopped controlling the price of retail fuels. Third the above two situations had resulted in the Indian fuels market becoming attractive to competition. Now state-owned petroleum companies such as BPCL faced the prospect of losing market share to private companies such as Reliance Petroleum Essar Oil and Shell. In this context the need for innovation at BPCL was stronger than ever before. Yet in 2014 IDEAS participation fell by about 20 per cent. That year some roles and members of the HR team also changed. As he took stock of the situation Padmakar was aware that IDEAS was much appreciated in the organization. Winners in particular had been inspired and spoke highly of the impact of the competition. The leader of the team that received the IDEAS Echo award for 2013 had remarked “Those who have gone and experienced IDEAS are now self-propelled and this in turn has a rub-off effect on others. Now people don’t accept the status quo and [instead] try new ways.” One employee who had twice won the chairman’s award was of the view “In research and development each one of us is busy doing our own jobs. Some of our great works go unnoticed. But [due to] this platform one gets recognition and our hard work gets noticed by everyone. It motivates us to think differently and encourages us to put in extra efforts at work.”However BPCL’s leaders looked beyond apparent successes and asked deeper questions. Sanzgiri said “It is a strong engine for reward and recognition but a weaker engine for innovation . . . . it can become stronger if some other alchemy happens in the organization.” Padmakar wondered what that alchemy might be. He wanted hard data to determine the changes that could be made. Earlier he had asked his team to analyze IDEAS’ historical data from a range of perspectives. They had sent him a summary of their findings (see Exhibits 4 to 8). Among other things Padmakar was heartened to observe that by 2014 participation in IDEAS was inversely correlated with employee attrition (see Exhibit 4). Padmakar saw two distinct possibilities to take IDEAS to the next level—focus on the competitive spirit of IDEAS such that employees wanted to participate win and gain recognition or focus on reinforcing a culture of creativity such that employees collaborated shared knowledge and innovated without the expectation of awards.

Ltd. (Balaji Wafers) ranked third among the top manufacturers of potato wafers in India. For the year ended September 2017 Balaji Wafers had a turnover of ₹21.22 billion following the market leader homegrown Haldiram’s Food International Limited (Haldiram) (₹42.24 billion) and global multinational corporation (MNC) PepsiCo India Ltd. (PepsiCo) (₹35.96 billion) (see Exhibit 1). Even though the Balaji brand had sold more than each of PepsiCo’s two brands (Lay’s and Kurkure) making it the second-largest individual brand Balaji Wafers needed to address some concerns. After operating for over three decades Rajkot-based Balaji Wafers was the leading manufacturer of potato wafers in the western state of Gujarat. Balaji Wafers’ 60 per cent market share made it the undisputed market leader in that state having continuously beaten global giant PepsiCo. PepsiCo had made numerous attempts to dislodge Balaji Wafers from its position including proposing a buyout but had failed in all of its efforts. Balaji Wafers had spurned offers for a complete takeover and was seeking investments for expanding operations. Though Balaji Wafers had publicly stated it was considering going national in pursuit of growth it had until then preferred to aggressively pursue high sales by expanding regionally into neighbouring states.Balaji Wafers had two options for growth. It could leverage its competitive advantage by remaining a strong regional player and continue to focus on the factors that had made it successful over the years or it could go national and compete with the likes of Haldiram and PepsiCo. The latter choice would require a robust business strategy marketing acumen and huge investments which could be either raised from external sources or funded by its own cash flows. Would Balaji Wafers be able to sustain its lead over PepsiCo? What should Balaji Wafers do for its pursuit of growth?HISTORYThe story of Balaji Wafers’ humble origins began in the 1970s. Chandubhai Virani and his three brothers Meghjibhai Bhikubhai and Kanubhai had come to Rajkot from Dhundhoraji (a small village in the Jamnagar district in Gujarat) with a dream of building a successful business. They had tried their luck in trading diamonds and agricultural kits but without much success losing the ₹20000 capital their father had given them. Chandubhai and Meghjibhai then took up a job selling refreshments in the Astron Cinema in Rajkot. Thereafter a dispute arose between the cinema’s management and the employees’ union in which the two brothers did not participate (since they were not willing to risk losing their jobs). The theatre owner gained confidence in the two brothers and in 1976 gave them the contract for managing the theatre’s food outlet on a revenue-sharing basis. By 1982 the Viranis had moved into the business of making homemade potato wafers outsourced from different vendors.OPERATIONS AT BALAJI WAFERSAs demand increased the brothers started producing wafers at home and sold these to a few nearby shops. The demand for their wafers soon encouraged the Viranis to gradually increase production. The brothers handled all functions personally since they did not have a team in that early stage. Their daily routine included purchasing 50 kilograms (kg) of potatoes manufacturing the wafers at home manually sprinkling on the spices and then selling the wafers personally to each shop in the local markets. Subsequently in 1989 the brothers set up a 1000-square-metre facility in the nearby industrial area Aji to manufacture 60 kg of wafers a day. In 1993–94 Balaji Wafers installed a semi-automatic plant raising its production capacity to 180 kg of wafers per day. In 2000 it invested an additional ₹50 million in a modern automatic plant with the capacity to manufacture and package 450 kg of wafers an hour. At that time Balaji Wafers produced 9000 kg of banana and potato wafers and 7000 kg of namkeen (a salty snack) per day. To meet the growing demand the Viranis set up three new plants in 1999 2003 and 2008 in Gujarat and by 2013 Balaji Wafers had invested approximately ₹5 billion in operations.By 2013 Balaji Wafers had grown from three employees to 2500 employees; had around 500 suppliers; was present in the states of Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Goa across 17 product categories; and was exporting its products to 35 countries worldwide. Namkeen comprised 60 per cent of the company’s total production while wafers made up the remaining 40 per cent. In 2013 the Valsad (Gujarat) unit produced 2200 kg wafers per hour making it one of the largest units for making potato wafers in Asia. By 2017 Balaji owned four plants in India with a total processing capacity of 650000 kg of potato wafers and 1000000 kg of namkeen per day which included around 30 varieties of salty snacks and savouries in addition to potato wafers achieving a turnover of ₹21.22 billion (see Exhibit 2).THE VIRANI FAMILYThe Virani family was comprised of the four brothers who had founded Balaji Wafers Bhikubhai Chandubhai Kanubhai and Meghjibhai and the next generation sons Keyur and Mihir (Bhikubhai’s sons) and Pranay (Chandubhai’s son). By 2017 the family had divided the roles among them and each family member was handling a specific function (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Bhikubhai was the chairman Chandubhai was the managing director and Kanubhai was the technical director. Chandubhai was also handling production while Bhikubhai and Kanubhai looked after sales and marketing. Mihir was the marketing director Pranay was the events director and Keyur was the research and development director. Chandubhai and Keyur were also the spokespersons for Balaji Wafers. The family was close-knit and often had lunch together at the corporate office just outside Rajkot. The family defined a set of values for the company which they used to drive their decisions. They wanted to build the business on traditional values of trust and quality without any compromise.MARKETING BALAJI WAFERSBalaji Wafers had the advantage of local market knowledge and like other regional players it had inherent strengths—extensive distribution and low overheads—which allowed an aggressive pricing strategy which had resulted in the tough competition the company gave to MNCs. According to a November 2014 report by the Nielsen Company on the snack market in India increased disposable income the need for convenience in a fast-paced lifestyle and cultural traditions of snacking between meals had fuelled explosive growth in the salty and savoury snacks market leading to six-fold sales growth in the category—from ₹80 billion in 2004 to ₹470 billion in 2013. Global researcher Euromonitor International stated in a 2016 study that Balaji Wafers was larger than Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. (Parle) and the Bingo! brand of ITC Limited (ITC) with about 60-per-cent market share in Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan and Goa and 15 per cent in Madhya Pradesh. Between 2013 and 2015 the market share of Lay’s dropped from 51.1 per cent to 49.5 per cent due to the growth of Balaji Wafers which had steadily gained market share annually in a market estimated to be around ₹70 billion to ₹100 billion.By 2017 the savoury snack market was a ₹295.4 billion market growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9 per cent (see Exhibit 5). This category was further broken down into many subcategories of which salty snacks constituted the majority in terms of both sales and growth rates. Potato wafers was grouped with salty snacks within the savoury snacks category and was estimated to be a ₹3–4 billion market. Furthermore salty snacks had a CAGR of 22.8 per cent between 2012 and 2017 and was forecasted to grow at 14.8 per cent for 2017–2022 (see Exhibits 6 and 7). According to Euromonitor International’s 2017 report the year-on-year growth rate of the savoury snack market was 14.9 per cent (see Exhibit 6) with PepsiCo and Balaji Wafers having a CAGR of −1.2 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (see Exhibit 5).Since 2013 packaged namkeen had replaced Western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within the branded salty snacks market. Euromonitor International’s 2017 estimates showed that the industry was expected to grow at a CAGR of 9 per cent to reach ₹446.9 billion in 2022. Balaji Wafers had managed to control the erosion in its market share (as a percentage share of retail value) which had dropped from 8.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 2011–2017 while PepsiCo’s share dropped from 15.9 per cent to 8.1 per cent in a market that had an average growth of 20 per cent (from 2014 to 2017) (see Exhibit 8). Balaji Wafers was very strong in Gujarat and Maharashtra and retained its leadership position by beating PepsiCo’s Lay’s. Nationally it was third after Haldiram and PepsiCo. In terms of brand shares of the savoury snack category (by percentage value) Balaji was ranked second after Haldiram (see Exhibit 9. Balaji Wafers saw a 14 per cent increase in sales growth in 2015–2016. The savoury snacks market had been declining since 2013 with all players facing declining sales but Balaji Wafers was able to continue maintaining its year-on-year growth even when PepsiCo was quickly losing its share (see Exhibit 5). According to Balaji Wafers some of the secrets of its success were the efforts to keep overhead costs low which ensured its products remained affordable along with the introduction of healthier varieties and expanding into the neighbouring states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In 2016 60 per cent of the Indian snack market was dominated by branded Indian salty snacks while the balance consisted of branded Western salty snacks including potato chips. Balaji Wafers attributed its success in the Indian market to the critical factors of quality price last-mile distribution and the right taste. Additionally the contribution of branded Indian salty snacks such as dal chivra bhujia and nuts within the overall snacks market was increasing and the industry players both multinational and domestic were using attractive packaging and pricing to penetrate newer markets in smaller towns.COMPETITORSBalaji’s total turnover was about ₹21 billion by September 2017 (see Exhibit 1). Over the previous five years it had earned a steady net profit at 10–12 per cent of revenue. By 2017 Balaji had garnered 6.85 per cent market share by value in India’s sweet and savoury snacks market and was the third-largest company nationally after Haldiram and PepsiCo (which had multiple brands in its portfolio) (see Exhibits 8 and 9). The market’s continuous growth attracted multiple new players. The salty snacks market was dominated by PepsiCo with Lay’s and Kurkure; ITC with Bingo!; and Haldiram and Parle products along with numerous regional brands. PepsiCo: PepsiCo with its Kurkure and Lay’s brands was the pioneer in the organized snacks market and the category leader. PepsiCo was focusing on the wafers segment and planning to leverage the Kurkure brand to extend into the pricier snacks segment to capture a larger share of the market. Its strategy was to focus on premium offerings and innovation by creating new demand spaces consequently pursuing a premium pricing strategy. For Frito-Lay PepsiCo bet on different pack sizes at different price points to improve penetration. It offered its smaller packs for ₹3 ₹5 and ₹10 and products for in-home consumption and family occasions at higher price points of ₹20 ₹30 ₹60 and ₹99. In 2011 PepsiCo launched a new brand “Lehar” which was 40 per cent cheaper than its flagship Lay’s.ITC: ITC was the largest tobacco manufacturer in India but it had focused on the salty snacks segment after it gained more than 7 per cent market share in 2014. It launched 18 flavours expanded its manufacturing sites to five from the earlier two locations widened its distribution network and revamped its packaging. ITC also introduced innovative formats based on multigrain pulses with distinctively better taste under its umbrella snack brand Bingo! to drive volumes. Parle: Parle owner of the brand Hippo decided to increase its research and development spending by 30 per cent to attract customers. It also started developing innovative products to drive volumes and proposed to roll out new products including potato finger chips called Aloo Lacha. The company had also started promoting namkeen in ₹5 packs and had improved its distribution and infrastructure having separate distributors for towns with populations of about 500000 with the intention to increase its total distribution network by 15 per cent in 2014.Haldiram: Haldiram another family-owned homegrown business was the leading player with an 11.7 per cent share of retail value in 2017. The company offered the largest portfolio of snacks across all retail channels. It had grown from being a brand of north India to becoming a large national player. In September 2017 Haldiram finally overtook PepsiCo to regain the position of India’s top snack company.Prataap Snacks Ltd. (Prataap): Prataap owner of the Yellow Diamond brand saw a 30 per cent increase in retail value sales in 2017. It challenged PepsiCo’s brands through aggressive pricing its distribution strategy and the fact that it had raised pre–initial public offering (IPO) funding of ₹500 million from Malabar Investments in exchange for a 2.5 per cent stake. This was in addition to the ₹2.65 billion in funding invested by Sequoia Capital in 2011 in exchange for a 63.15 per cent stake. Faering Capital invested ₹450 million in June 2016. Prataap’s IPO in September 2017 was oversubscribed 47 times when listed. The company had famous Bollywood actor Salman Khan as its brand ambassador. Prataap had a distribution network of 205 super stockists with over 3400 distributors. It owned and operated three manufacturing facilities—one in Indore and two in Guwahati. It had two contract manufacturing plants in Kolkata and Bengaluru and intended to use the funds to penetrate the existing markets and explore new markets.Local brands: Local snacking companies such as Balaji Wafers Prataap Bikanervala Bikaji Foods and DFM Foods together recorded sales growth of 8–35 per cent in the year ended March 2016 at a time when major international companies like Mondelez International Inc. PepsiCo’s food division and GlaxoSmithKline Plc were struggling to grow their businesses. Together these five local firms had combined sales of nearly ₹37 billion which was higher than Nestlé’s Maggi brand and Kellogg’s in India. With numerous funds investing in Indian players the competition among well-funded competitors was growing fast. Investment firm Lighthouse Funds had invested ₹1.25 billion in Bikaji Foods while Westbridge Capital Ltd. had invested about 25 per cent in DFM Foods. These well-funded new-entrant competitors were potential threats to the existing players.MARKETING COMMUNICATION Balaji Wafers focused on understanding the native tastes of its customers. The potential for traditional snacks was immense and smart companies were gradually converting traditional “eaten-at-home” products to packaged products that could be consumed on the go. Additionally because of the hygiene factor consumers’ preferences were shifting to packaged branded namkeen over unbranded products from local bakeries thus increasing the market shares of local brands. Consumers also perceived traditional Indian snacks to be healthier and preferred brands that contained commonly used ingredients often found in Indian kitchens. Indian consumers had discerning tastes and existing local players like Balaji Wafers experimented with tastes to keep its brands relevant to consumers. This was one of the strengths of regional brands—they understood Indian tastes better and could offer variety at low operating and marketing costs. Furthermore as the organized players increased the affordability and availability of their products they experienced increased sales from consumers who shifted from the unorganized market to these brands. The increased reach and new product launches also contributed to the growth of all local players.It appeared that Balaji Wafers understood the palates of its large regional customer base in India stepping in with products with localized flavours that catered to these tastes. This strategy of balancing price flavour and distribution helped the group capture a 90 per cent share of the Gujarat wafers market and 70 per cent of the namkeen market. In Gujarat the company’s product mix was just right and it catered to the Gujarati sweet tooth by making its products less spicy. The company offered masala wafers to cater to the Gujarati palate chaat masala for the Maharashtrian market and a range of spicy snacks for the Rajasthan market.Balaji Wafers spent negligible amounts on marketing and advertising. PepsiCo’s Lay’s its nearest competitor spent over 7–8 per cent of its snack revenue on advertising including endorsements from Bollywood superstars such as Ranbir Kapoor. Even though Balaji Wafers did not spend much on advertising and communication it had made inroads beyond its stronghold market of Gujarat into states such as Rajasthan Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Goa. It relied more on word of mouth publicity. There were apprehensions about whether such minimal expenditure on marketing would work when Balaji went national as local player ad spends could nearly double compared to those of global players in line with international trends.DISTRIBUTIONChandubhai believed Balaji Wafers had to focus on distribution to achieve growth. By late 2016 it had a network of 10–12 sole distributors and 700 dealers in Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Goa covering over 2000000 retailers and reaching millions of final consumers. Balaji Wafers had a strong hold on the retail channel and could reach the depths of the market. It encouraged its dealers to provide their own fleet of trucks which Balaji compensated for through higher margins. This not only reduced the role of intermediaries but also kept distribution costs low. Balaji Wafers wanted its product to speak for itself and ensured that it was easily available to the customer.According to a 2017 Euromonitor International report grocery store–based retailing constituted 99.9 per cent of the channel distribution for savoury snacks in India. Of this 83.7 per cent were traditional grocery retailers and 16.2 per cent were modern grocery retailers. Of the traditional retailers 70 per cent were independent kirana stores (local mom-and-pop grocery stores). However the traditional independent grocers were declining in number and being replaced by the growing number of modern grocery retailers. The remaining 0.1 per cent of the channel distribution for savoury snacks was made up by Internet sales and non-store retailing which was also a growing segment. Balaji Wafers’ distribution strategy had given it a 70 per cent market share in Gujarat. Balaji Wafers had also displaced PepsiCo’s Lay’s in neighbouring Maharashtra to gain a huge 60 per cent market share in 2014 just five years after entering this market in 2009. External industry experts believed the Balaji brand name was restricted to Gujarat and Maharashtra and virtually unknown outside these two states even though customers were extremely satisfied with Balaji products.PRICINGBhikubhai had stated that Balaji Wafers’ products were so affordable that even a school kid could buy them. He also believed that the products should be filling and their consumption should not cause concern among health-conscious parents. A ₹10 pack of Lay’s or Bingo! contained around 13 grams of chips while a Balaji Wafers’ pack for the same price contained 20 grams of chips. Consequently Balaji Wafers continued to sell its namkeen and wafers for as low as ₹1 and ₹5 per packet respectively.Chandubhai followed pricing for price-conscious buyers an increasing challenge because of rising potato prices. The company used economy pricing coupled with low operations costs and an intensive distribution model. Its low overheads helped in passing on a greater value share to its customers. Erratic potato prices and consumers’ unwillingness to consume more of the product had affected sales of potato wafers. The contribution of potato wafers to Balaji Wafers’ revenues declined from 70 per cent to 40 per cent. Balaji responded by increasing its concentration on snacks which also gave it higher margins compared to wafers.Rolling out nationally would not only increase the company’s overheads it would also lead to additional distribution advertising and marketing costs. If it went national Balaji Wafers would have to consider whether it would be able to use its penetrative pricing strategy which traditionally had given it a competitive advantage in Gujarat and Maharashtra.MANAGING THE FAMILY BUSINESSBalaji Wafers was hesitant to hire professionals and most of its existing employees had been groomed by Chandubhai himself. These employees were loyal unlike professionals who Chandubhai believed would not stick around. His experience had shown him that the people who were trained by him did stay and were loyal to the company. The sole exception was the head of production Nishika Bapat who had formerly been with PepsiCo. The next generation was skeptical of this mindset to avoid hiring professionals which had worked in the past. The new generation wanted to expand the skill base especially with the company planning to grow nationally and even export its products outside India. The next generation was involved in multiple initiatives within the company: Product Innovation: As consumer preferences were moving towards healthier snack options the company invested ₹2.5 billion for new machinery in Rajkot to make baked multi-grain snacks which were healthier. The challenge for Balaji Wafers was that competing products in the same category (PepsiCo’s Aliva and Parle’s Smart Chips) had failed in the past. The Viranis therefore wanted to ensure they could offer health benefits without sacrificing the taste of their snacks. They were also working on their traditional products such as potato wafers and namkeen to reduce the amount of oil used without compromising on taste.Market Expansion: Balaji Wafers invested in scaling up and upgrading the manufacturing unit at Indore to try and capture the northern India markets not only for scaling up investments to build capacity but also for brand building. Strategic Investments: The next generation felt that it needed strategic investments to take the business to the next level. A strategic partnership could get the company access to global best practices and funds for expanding operations.Chandubhai was not very keen on strategic investors stating “Strategic partners would only want profits. They will never grow the business with the same passion as we have done.” THE stake-sale PROCESSWith a growth plan in mind in 2013 Balaji Wafers started talking to private-equity investors such as the Blackstone Group L.P. and Actis Capital to raise US$100–125 million to fund its growth. These plans included investing ₹2 billion towards new manufacturing facilities planned over a three-year period focusing on the northern and southern markets. Until then Balaji Wafers had been a major player in only the western markets. It claimed that better management would be created by the stake sale. Keyur Virani director of Balaji Wafers said “We are now planning to enter [the] North and South India market within [the] next two years and for that we are looking to have strategic partnerships with local players.” Balaji Wafers appointed Ernst & Young to find buyers for the stake sale. By December 2013 the company was in talks with numerous investors including private equity funds and MNCs such as Kellogg’s General Mills Inc. and PepsiCo. Kellogg’s: Kellogg’s the multinational breakfast cereal giant was one of the potential suitors. Kellogg’s was looking for ways to grow as it was unable to establish a strong presence in the local Indian market. This was close on the heels of its recent US$2.7 billion buyout of Pringles which gave it a global presence in the wafer business. Industry sources felt that Kellogg’s taking over Balaji Wafers could help the Pringles brand in Tier 2 cities where the consumption of wafers was rising.Agro Tech Foods Ltd.: After conducting due diligence on all of Balaji Wafers’ brands and meeting the management Agro Tech Foods Ltd. an affiliate of ConAgra Foods Inc. USA concluded that with Balaji Wafers’ operations restricted to a few states it was too regional in nature.PepsiCo: PepsiCo launched its brand Lay’s in India in 1995. It had used Lay’s to spearhead its presence in the Western salty snacks segment and Kurkure for the Indian salty snacks segment. Both were losing market share to Balaji Wafers in the growing snacks market. Around 2009 Pepsi and Haldiram saw that Balaji Wafers was offering tough competition in the Gujarat and western India region. They sent a team of executives to identify ways to respond to Balaji Wafers. The team visited Balaji Wafers’ plant and its potato farms and were impressed by the simplicity and efficiency of Balaji Wafers’ operations. When PepsiCo realized that it was helpless in meeting Balaji Wafers’ challenge it turned around and offered to buy out a 51 per cent stake in Balaji Wafers trying to convince Chandubhai for a sellout. Media reports stated that the Viranis had asked for a valuation of ₹35 billion three and a half times Balaji Wafers’ sales of ₹10 billion (the norm being two to three times the sales in the fast-moving consumer goods sector). Prospective buyers found the valuation too high given that Balaji Wafers’ reach was restricted to a few states. One private-equity fund stated that since Balaji Wafers had a strong balance sheet and was internally funded it was not in need of funds and hence could ask for a higher valuation.Balaji Wafers had stated that it was not open to selling large stakes to the private equity funds which would loosen the family’s control over the company. The family maintained that the stake sale was intended to create better management for Balaji Wafers. Finally in June 2014 Balaji Wafers on finding that the valuations offered by the private-equity players were lower than expected gave up its plans of a stake sale or an IPO that year. Chandubhai commented on this stating “MNCs do not have the experience in the snacks category in India but we did not need the money. Now the matter is closed.” IPO PlansIn late 2015 Balaji Wafers again decided to sell 10 per cent though an IPO from which it expected to raise ₹3 billion valuing the company at ₹30 billion. The company needed the funds to expand into new markets in central and north India branching out from its traditional limited stronghold areas of Gujarat Goa Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Maharashtra. However Balaji Wafers subsequently delayed this by about a year because it wanted to focus on setting up its new plants in Indore.INDORE PLANTIn March 2015 Balaji Wafers announced a ₹4 billion investment in Indore Madhya Pradesh to tap into the north Indian market. Balaji Wafers had acquired land earlier and construction had already started on a new production facility which was expected to be completed in the next 18 months. This new factory was initially installed for the production of 1500 kg of wafers and other salty snacks per hour. The output could be gradually doubled based on requirements. The factory was intended to manufacture all the products of Balaji Wafers and to cater to Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Delhi and surrounding areas in north India. Under the first phase of the project the company invested ₹2 billion in the plant with the balance of ₹2 billion to be spent in the second phase on other requirements. The plant was finally commissioned on October 11 2016 increasing the company’s total capacity to 86.4 tonnes per day from 62.4 tonnes earlier.Financing by LoansThe company had raised a loan of ₹1 billion in late 2015 from creditors and banks to fund its expansion. It expected its financial requirements for 2017 to be about ₹2.25 billion part of which it expected to fund from internal accruals. Balaji Wafers at the end of 2017 had three plants—in Rajkot Valsad and Indore. It had invested ₹7 billion in these plants by funding them through bank loans. Chandubhai was quoted as saying “As long as banks are willing to lend there is no need to go public. There is no IPO this year although we have been thinking about it in the past.”BALAJI wafers’ EXPANSIONIn 2014 Balaji Wafers had 70 per cent market share in western India with a presence in the states of Gujarat Maharashtra Goa Rajasthan and some parts of Madhya Pradesh. Management claimed that the company had over 85–90 per cent market share of the potato wafer market in Gujarat. With the intention to expand beyond western India in the future Balaji had invested ₹500 million in doubling its production capacity in Valsad South Gujarat raising its hourly production of potato wafers to 1200 kg in Rajkot and 2500 kg in Valsad.PRODUCT Diversification In December 2014 Balaji Wafers announced that it would start manufacturing potato french fries by May 2015 taking on the largest seller of french fries in India McCain Foods India. This project costing ₹500 million was to be set up through Iscon Balaji Foods Pvt. Ltd. who at that time manufactured ready-to-cook potato flakes. Chandubhai visited German machinery manufacturers for sourcing machines in late 2014. McCain Foods India was the market leader in the frozen potato specialty market with products like french fries Aloo Tikki McCain Smiles and McCain Potato Cheese Shotz. The firm had a strong back end for sourcing potatoes and planned to start with french fries at its Ahmedabad plant before launching other products. The products would be sold directly to consumers at organized retail stores and would be made available for quick-service restaurants and institutional buyers.THE WAY AHEADIn 2017 Balaji Wafers had continued to make money and its turnover was continuously increasing compared to its competitors (see Exhibit 8). Chandubhai stated that his future plans were to go national and then even global. The company was planning a ₹1 billion potato wafers unit in London England and was considering setting up a unit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He wanted to grow the brand to double its current size in the global markets. Chandubhai also wanted to sell Balaji Wafers’ goods internationally under its own label and had rejected offers from superstores based in the United Kingdom and the Middle East that wanted him to co-brand his products for the large Gujarati diaspora there. Balaji Wafers also aspired to enter the fast-food restaurant business by setting up a chain starting from Gujarat and then launching it nationally. The concern however was about the future of the Balaji brand. Balaji Wafers had been a strong regional player that had defeated an MNC giant PepsiCo on its home turf and had spurned offers from General Mills and Kellogg’s its potential competitors in the national market. Additionally it had also faced the onslaught of local players like Haldiram which had grown from being a regional brand to becoming the leading national brand. Other regional brands like Yellow Diamond were also experiencing robust growth in their respective regions. The question before the Virani family was whether they should expand the Balaji brand nationally or stay regional and strengthen it further in Gujarat and Maharashtra.EXHIBIT 1: BRAND SHARE SALESSales for the year ended September (₹ billion)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹63.8838 on September 1 2017.Source: Created by the authors based on data from Sagar Malviya “Haldiram Topples PepsiCo; Regains Top Spot as Country’s Largest Snack Company” Economic Times December 21 2017 accessed March 19 2018 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/haldiram-topples-pepsico-regains-top-spot-as-countrys-largest-snack-company/articleshow/62185925.cms.

Pandor�s entrepreneurial journey with SweepSouth had required her to relocate to scenic Cape Town in 2014. While enjoying the views of the ocean and surrounding majestic mountains she thought of the last four years. Pandor and her husband and co-founder Alen Ribic had grown SweepSouth from a promising idea generated at their dining-room table to a socially conscious company that employed more than 40 staff members in two regional offices. It was a platform that connected almost 9000 previously unemployed domestic workers with clients looking for home cleaning services. Pandor thought of the 80000 applicants who had applied and were waiting desperate to join the platform. The start-up had achieved impressive growth since its inception and was already helping thousands of women secure regular work but Pandor understood the depth of the unemployment problem in South Africa and its far-reaching effects upon the domestic-work industry. For these women becoming a domestic worker was their only hope for employment. How could she expand her business operations to have an even greater social impact and help lift more women and their families out of poverty?a new broom sweeps cleanThe idea for SweepSouth was borne out of personal frustration Pandor experienced when searching for a domestic worker to help her at home over the summer vacation period of December 2013. Exasperated by the piles of laundry dirty dishes and a never-ending list of domestic chores to be completed during the holidays she asked friends and family for leads. She posted a notice on social media asking her extended network if anyone could recommend available help. However domestic helpers normally travelled to their familial homes for the holiday period and her own regular helper was on annual leave which left Pandor looking for help. But all attempts to find a temporary helper came up short. Having exhausted all contacts Pandor and Ribic approached placement agencies for domestic workers but the experience left a deeply negative impression on them. The women sent by the agencies were poorly paid listless and seemingly disinterested in potential work. Pandor and Ribic also found the agencies� fee structures confusing leaving them discouraged by the lack of guarantees the companies offered.Pandor was critically aware that the unemployment rate in South Africa in 2013 was a staggering 24.1 per cent and that thousands of unemployed women would have been incredibly grateful for the opportunity to earn an income to help feed their families. The situation got the couple thinking. Over the next major holiday period in December most middle-class South African households accustomed to having their domestic chores taken care of throughout the year would again be burdened with chores. They would probably experience similar frustration in struggling � and usually failing � to find suitable help. Pandor and Ribic emailed a survey to a group of friends to determine if others were experiencing the same issues they had. The response was overwhelming. Feeling discouraged with their situation but fuelled with the confirmation of how widespread their problem was Pandor and Ribic felt the spark of an entrepreneurial opportunity. An added frustration for the couple was the discontent they both felt with their employment in the corporate sector. Pandor a Ph.D. graduate had been working as a management consultant; Ribic a software developer had worked for several software companies. They felt ready and excited to take on an entrepreneurial venture when the idea for SweepSouth was born. Their corporate experience would prove incredibly valuable in setting up their business notwithstanding the inevitable challenges that came with being entrepreneurs. Drawing on the vastly successful U.S. Uber model in which drivers were connected to riders via an online platform they began to devise a plan for a platform that connected unemployed or underemployed women who were looking for work as domestic workers with people looking for such services. Thus SweepSouth was born. Ribic developed the technology from the very first line of code. As chief technology officer of the start-up he took responsibility for the development of the platform from its initial offering as a website through the development of an application (app) for smart phones. New iterations were regularly required as more features were added to the platform offering improved services for the domestic workers (referred to as �SweepStars� by the company) and for clients. �SweepSouth was founded on the belief that the home cleaning industry needed modernisation through technology as well as a change in mind-set towards the belief that everyone deserves access to dignified work at decent pay� said Pandor.By November 2014 Pandor and Ribic had resigned from their jobs committed themselves to SweepSouth full-time cashed in their pension and sold their house and car to provide seed funding for the business. They kept one small fuel-efficient car which enabled them to do the necessary travel to get the business off the ground. With a four-year-old daughter to support Pandor reflected on the risky decision they had made to become entrepreneurs. In hindsight she had to laugh at what later seemed like an irresponsible decision to have taken on such risk as a young couple with a child. Given their education and experience however they felt that the level of risk was somewhat mitigated by the knowledge that they would have been able to return to full-time employment in corporate jobs if they needed to. But they did not want it to ever come to that. �We saw an industry that was broken and living in the past� said Pandor. They wanted to be a part of fixing it.The idea for SweepSouth was sparked from the realization that ad hoc domestic help was difficult to source. Pandor who also had a business qualification from the University of Cape Town quickly realized that a segment of the market was under-served. Traditional placement agencies focused on permanent placement of domestic workers and nannies. Many middle-class South African households had full-time five-days-a-week (often live-in) domestic workers. SweepSouth�s focus was not on permanent placement or full-time employment within a single home. The business model was based on plugging the gap for those households looking for reliable ad hoc domestic help � once or twice a week or even on a less frequent basis such as once a month. This served a segment of the population that was traditionally not catered to. It also allowed domestic workers the opportunity to secure work every day of the week by working at different homes each day. Without SweepSouth domestic workers had to rely on their employers to attempt to find them regular employment on other days of the week which was not usually feasible.  �SWEEP� + �SOUTH� = more than just a name The symbolic name Pandor and Ribic chose for their company referenced their social mission. The term �sweep� made obvious reference to cleaning but it was also a more nuanced reference to sweeping a new mind-set into an industry. The term �south� was a reference both to South Africa and more generally to the proverbial south or the southern hemisphere�s developing world on which they hoped to have an impact. Pandor and Ribic started operations in Johannesburg in 2014. However they soon realized that the initial uptake of the service was better in Cape Town. The strongest resum�s in response to their job placement advertising were submitted from the Cape Town area. Therefore Pandor and Ribic decided to relocate their business to the scenic city. The platform was launched in July 2014. By mid-2018 SweepSouth expanded to offer domestic cleaning services in four South African cities � Cape Town Johannesburg Pretoria and Durban � facilitating regular employment for almost 9000 domestic workers. Social and economic inequality in South Africa was among the worst in the world with a Gini coefficient of 65 (where perfect equality was 0 and the highest level of inequality was 100). Domestic workers with regular employment were therefore considered breadwinners and they typically supported at least four people in the household. Chronic joblessness fed a cycle of poverty that was hard to escape. However SweepSouth was providing this escape to thousands of women. Getting a good job was the single most promising means for individuals to escape poverty and for reducing inequalities at the collective level. The social mission of the company was centred on poverty alleviation through the creation of employment opportunities.cleaning up a broken industrySouth Africa had an oversupply of low-skilled labour due historically to the apartheid context that prevented masses of black people from accessing quality education. Women who typically worked as domestic workers were triply vulnerable: on account of their race gender and the precarity of low-skilled labour market. Domestic workers were often poorly remunerated and exploited in their working environments because the relationship between domestic workers and their employers was characteristically much more personal than other work relationships. As a result they were more vulnerable to exploitation than women working in formal settings such as in a factory or office. Women who worked as domestic workers were unlikely to find alternative employment opportunities. South Africa�s socio-economic landscape had not recovered from the legislated policies of race-based segregation which resulted in stark divisions along lines of race social class and income. Added to this issue was the legacy of apartheid geographical division which meant that domestic workers often lived very far from their place of employment and a high proportion of their earnings was spent on transport. Compared with counterparts in other low-skilled occupations paid domestic workers were expected to work longer hours and were often underpaid. The SweepSouth platform controlled this factor by allowing customers to book one of the SweepStars for a set number of hours and pay for the time booked. SweepSouth provided a platform to connect SweepStars to customers; it did not employ the workers directly. SweepSouth management had made a decision around whether to upskill their SweepStars: �We don�t do upskilling ourselves we have chosen not to because we have to balance the line between being an employer versus being a platform that is connecting two sides together.� Instead the company chose to partner with providers of content and benefits for the workers via the SweepSouth platform.Dignity is no longer swept under the carpetRestoring dignity to women whose only option for employment was domestic work was one of SweepSouth�s central driving forces. Domestic workers in South Africa were among the most vulnerable people in society. To create a dignified employment environment for these women several measures were implemented. First the derogatory terms �maid� �char� and �girl� were banished from the SweepSouth lexicon. The women on the SweepSouth platform were referred to as SweepStars a fresh term to mirror the re-invention of the industry by the tech start-up. Secondly SweepStars were paid almost double the minimum wage for domestic workers and paid fairly for the amount of time they spent working. The national minimum wage rate which Pandor lamented was a �terrible benchmark� was R20 per hour or R3 500 per month. For domestic workers the rate was 25 per cent lower at R15 per hour or R2 625 per month. The average SweepStar earned between R3 000 and R4 000 per month. SweepStars earned up to 80 per cent of the fee charged to customers. They were paid weekly into a nominated bank account and could view their weekly earnings (plus tips) on the SweepSouth app. The SweepSouth plan allowed them flexibility to determine their working hours and still earn a decent living. A five-star rated SweepStar named Thabisa found the plan favourable: �I like the flexibility� she said. �I choose where and when I want to work which is very good as I have a family. I choose on which days I work and in which areas. I can calculate where and when is the best time for me to work and plan my schedule according to my needs.� Using the platform also allowed women like Thabisa the opportunity to strike the critical balance faced by many working women. �With the hourly rate I am getting I can work less hours and still can spend time with my family� added Thabisa. This was a critical factor for the SweepStars many of whom were single mothers and breadwinners solely responsible for the financial well-being of their households. As noted earlier SweepStars supported an average household of four people so the social impact of helping a single woman to achieve regular employment through the platform was magnified five-fold in the community she lived in.Women on the platform were further empowered by the two-way rating system. SweepStars were rated by clients after each booking and clients were rated by the SweepStars (see Exhibit 1). By rating a client a SweepStar effectively decided whether she wanted to continue the relationship with them and vice versa. Successful SweepStars recognized that the relationship between them and their clients was predicated upon trust. �Within a few weeks I had repeat customers� Thabisa reported delighted. �They kept asking for me to clean their place because they trusted me and the quality of my cleaning and because I knew how to find their place and how they liked things done.�SweepSouth offered support to the SweepStars a service that provided them with a sense of safety and assurance that was traditionally missing for paid domestic workers. The support team was available to provide assistance for any struggle encountered by the SweepStars including taxi breakdowns on the way to a booking clients making racist comments or even situations in which domestic violence prevented women from honouring their bookings. SweepStars sent a direct message to the support team who attempted to manage the situation. This support was one primary reason why the women remained on the platform. It differentiated SweepSouth from traditional placement agencies and provided support that women would otherwise not have when working directly for an employer. �The company assists me with any questions I have and always knows where I am in case something happens to me so I am better protected physically and financially� reported Thabisa.As noted earlier the SweepStars on the platform typically provided financial support to a household of four or more people and 83 per cent of them were primary breadwinners. Given those facts it was shocking that only 22 per cent of these women had a pension plan or any form of savings. If anything happened to one of these women their family would be left destitute. Mindful of the needs of the women on the platform and the dependents they supported the SweepSouth team negotiated free life insurance coverage for a value of R400 000 and disability coverage of R200 000 for the SweepStars.Assistance was also provided for the SweepStars to open low-cost bank accounts to receive payment for their services which was channelled through the platform in a cashless system. The benefit to SweepStars was twofold. First the immediate vulnerability associated with being paid in cash was eliminated. Incidents of theft on public transport were very common so it was far safer not to travel with cash. Second having an active bank account allowed SweepStars to build up a credit record enabling them to access credit in the form of a loan if the need ever arose.of cats and correlationsLuke Kannemeyer head of data at SweepSouth took pride in the fact that the functioning of all departments was data driven but sagely recognized that data alone did not paint a full picture. �Data doesn�t lie but it needs to be interpreted and sometimes especially when you want to move fast initially you need to trust your gut.� SweepSouth made use of machine learning as an algorithmic system that enhanced each aspect of the business. Data was collected when clients made bookings on the platform during the onboarding process for SweepStars and at every step of the process (see Exhibit 2). The data was used to make all processes more efficient.Analyzing the data from the SweepStars onboarding process Kannemeyer and his team noticed an interesting correlation: �We found out that some cleaners were afraid of cats and that is one of the greatest predictors of whether they will be successful at SweepSouth.� Women who revealed during their interview that they were afraid of cats had positive correlations with excellent review scores after bookings. The causation was less important than the strength of the correlation. Such relationships in the data were what allowed SweepSouth to offer an outstanding quality of service to their clients and help SweepStars reach their full earning potential. Using an advanced matching system clients who specified during the booking process that they needed ironing to be done would be paired with SweepStars whose ratings for ironing were good. In similar ways data was used to support processes at each phase of involvement with the platform. The use of constantly evolving technology and data analytics to drive the business forward was what allowed SweepSouth to offer both domestic workers and customers a better experience in an industry that had long been beset with indignity lack of transformation and lack of technological advancement. Placement agencies SweepSouth�s primary competitors typically paid their domestic workers for a full-day�s work the equivalent of what SweepSouth paid for three hours� work. This was because agencies didn�t have technology driving efficient systems. The inefficiencies resulted in having to charge higher rates to squeeze out a margin for the agency. At the end of the process domestic workers were paid very low rates for the work they did. Considering the discrimination that had characterized South Africa�s history and the power dynamics at play in the industry these women had no power to negotiate higher rates for their work. In March 2018 South Africa was in a technical recession. The economy had contracted by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 and 0.7 per cent in the second quarter. For many South African businesses this was unwelcome news but the SweepSouth team saw it as an opportunity. As Kannemeyer explained �instead of seeing the more price sensitive segment dropping out of your market you actually now see that there is potential � now people are moving into your addressable market because they are downscaling on some of the services they need.� The technology enabled SweepSouth to grow at an incredible rate both in terms of number of bookings and number of SweepStars onboarded (see Exhibit 3). Kannemeyer thought back to his first day working at SweepSouth early in 2015 and the growth that he had helped facilitate during his time with the company. The growth was evident in the number of bookings they confirmed on a daily basis. �Just to give you an idea there were probably fewer than 20 bookings on my first day and now there are over 1 000� reported Kannemeyer. Besides enabling phenomenal growth use of technology also resulted in clients getting the quality of service they wanted. Domestic workers were operating in a dignified and flexible working environment. The agency chose their working hours their clients and thereby determined their income sources. a leader who wasn�t afraid to get her hands dirty�It is important that we have a black woman as our leader� stated Kannemeyer. Issues around transformation were central to the social mission of a country that was still rebuilding after centuries of structural race-based inequality and discrimination including most recently the system of apartheid which had only been abolished in the early 1990s. He further described Pandor as �extremely motivated relentless in her hard work and very empowering.� He felt passionate about the social impact the business was having in the lives of domestic workers and described himself as �someone who wants to be part of a better South Africa.� This made working under the exemplary leadership of Pandor especially rewarding. He believed that she was an example of excellence and commitment to the cause of transforming the industry and building a successful business.In December 2016 the SweepSouth team had been experiencing serious growing pains. As usual the holiday period presented an influx of new customers looking for cleaning services as people�s regular domestic workers generally took annual leave over this time. Unprepared for the greatly increased demand the stress on supply of SweepStars often led to one of two undesirable outcomes during that period: disgruntled customers because they could not get bookings when they wanted them or poor-quality work when customers managed to confirm a booking. Pandor and her team had worked hard to grow the business and the positive impact on SweepStars and their families had been enormous. She could not allow this challenge to derail those achievements. Pandor thought back to the many occasions early in the business when she stood in for SweepStars who had taken ill or were otherwise unable to honour a booking. To avoid client dissatisfaction she had personally arrived to clean clients� homes. She was grateful for the experience of performing the tasks that her SweepStars undertook on a daily basis including cleaning people�s dirty laundry grimy bathrooms and messy kitchens. Her respect and appreciation for her SweepStars had increased exponentially and resolved her opinion that all work was dignified work. Her drive to help more SweepStars support their families was strengthened; she had to find a way to ensure that clients kept booking and the business kept growing. The SweepSouth team worked relentlessly to manage the incredibly busy December period. Just before the start of the busy season Pandor had given birth to her second daughter but sacrificed maternity leave for the sake of the business. �I don�t think I took a day off after she was born� recalled Pandor. The SweepSouth brand was getting noticed. Pandor had become accustomed to media interviews (see Exhibit 4) marketing SweepSouth by sharing the story on television and radio interviews magazine features and guest speaker appearances. Year on year the awards kept coming in. In 2017 Pandor was recognized as one of six Africa Breakthrough Female Tech Entrepreneurs by the World Economic Forum and received the Glamour Woman of the Year (Business) Award. In 2016 Forbes Africa featured her as a top African Millennial and she won the PriceCheck Best Female Tech/E-commerce Entrepreneur of the Year award and Best Black Tech-E-commerce Entrepreneur of the Year. Earlier she had won the South African Women in Science Award (2012) and was included in the prestigious 200 Top 200 Young South Africans by the Mail & Guardian (2012).Personal accolades aside Pandor was proud of the awards and the recognition SweepSouth had earned. In October 2014 working with nine other start-ups at a SiMODiSA StartupSA conference the company won the conference�s Get-Up Start-Up award. The prize was partial sponsorship for a trip to Silicon Valley. Months later SweepSouth was accepted in the four-month long accelerator programme with 500 Startups in Silicon Valley one of the most prestigious early stage tech investors in the world. The prize money went toward flights to San Francisco. During the program Pandor and Ribic had the opportunity to network with industry experts and develop relationships with mentors. �We were meeting some of the smartest people in the industry who understood and had experience in taking a company like SweepSouth from thousands of transactions a month to hundreds of thousands� said Ribic at the time. Their pitch at the SiMODiSA conference had also piqued the interest of one of the judges Vinny Lingham whose firm Newtown Partners became SweepSouth�s first investor. Having raised an angel investment and then participated in the 500 Startups program SweepSouth then secured an investment of R10 million from the Vumela Enterprise Fund sponsored by FNB South Africa�s oldest bank. The funding was a welcome cash injection that allowed them some breathing space to help the business scale up. Pandor was delighted. �[They are] an experienced and respected investor [that] shares our passion for job creation and social transformation. We�ve loved interacting with their team and are excited about utilising this investment to continue our rapid growth and create sustainable work for thousands of cleaners in the next year.� The investors were impressed by the creative concept centred around on-demand service noting that �the on-demand economy is a huge growth area because a lot of consumers� needs can be far better served with tech-enabled on-demand services.� Swept away with possibilities Pandor felt familiar pangs of disquiet return to her as she arrived at the Cape Town SweepSouth office on that March morning in 2018. There was more work to be done � a broken industry to fix thousands of lives that stood to benefit from having more SweepStars on the platform and of course a profit to turn. She thought again of the need that her business addressed � the unemployment rate had worsened to 27.5 per cent by 2018. The need to create employment opportunities was constantly growing. She drew strength from the thousands of women who supported families and built communities doing the least desirable work available � cleaning other people�s messy and dirty homes � to put food on the table for their own families. Being an entrepreneur was challenging but it was definitely worth the challenge when she considered how SweepSouth empowered women to earn decent pay and introduced a fresh technological approach to an industry that was in dire need of transformation. She had experienced the challenges that came with scaling a business but there were 80000 unemployed or under-employed women desperate to join the platform. Many of them saw it as their only opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of the vicious cycle of poverty that plagued too many South African households. She considered the options for scaling the business. Similar issues affected many African countries. Was it time to begin expansion into other countries? On the other hand there was still so much work to be done within the South African context and many possibilities to expand the service offering. Should the company consider cleaning office spaces or focus instead on homes bolstering offerings by giving clients the option to order cleaning products through the app when making a booking? Surely there was also a need for other services such as plumbers electricians and gardeners.

(Kroeker) was meeting with staff to review the past season and prepare a capital budget proposal for the year ahead. Peters had worked at Kroeker for three seasons overseeing all non-vegetable crops with a primary focus on the farm�s certified organic acreage. Kroeker had 500 acres of organic hemp in 2016 and planned to expand to 1100 acres in 2017. Peters knew that the existing equipment used in hemp production was at capacity so further investment in equipment was a necessity. However he had to decide whether to simply buy larger field crop equipment or invest in newer technology. The new technology option would require equipment to be imported from Europe so timing was critical. KROEKER FARMSHistoryKroeker dated back to 1928 when Abram Kroeker a second-generation immigrant and his wife Elizabeth sold their share in a family-run general store to begin a farm in Winkler Manitoba. Initially the farm consisted of 280 acres of cultivated land and 80 acres of pasture and poplar bush and specialized in producing Yorkshire pigs and Latham raspberries. In response to the significant price the weather and the pest adversity he faced in his early years of farming Abram Kroeker introduced corn production to the prairies producing seed corn and constructing the first corn-drying kiln in Canada in 1936. The farm continued to grow rapidly and evolve over time. In 1942 potatoes became a main emphasis of production and in 1955 the farm was incorporated with Abram Kroeker and his nine children as shareholders. As potatoes and other vegetables were typically grown in one year of a three-year crop rotation Kroeker worked co-operatively with other farmers�renting land from other farmers in the �vegetable year� of their rotation and renting out land owned by Kroeker in �non-vegetable years� of the rotation. In 2000 Kroeker experimented with its first organic crop�30 acres of potatoes�motivated by the personal interests of both the farm manager and shareholders. Kroeker did not have partners to share the rotation schedule of its certified organic land as it did with its conventional (i.e. not certified organic) production. As such Kroeker maintained use of its certified organic land throughout its full crop rotation which had evolved to be potato (or other vegetable) hemp and green manure. Current OperationsKroeker had established itself as one of Canada�s leading potato growers and Manitoba�s largest grower of organic potatoes. The farm owned 11000 acres of land throughout the Red River Valley. Of this land 4000 acres were certified organic�a significant increase from the 2700 acres that were organic in 2015. Kroeker also had access to up to 9000 additional acres through rental arrangements for conventional production. Although the farm had experimented with various crops over the years the mainstay continued to be potatoes along with some onions and specialty vegetables (carrots broccoli cauliflower cabbage and squash). Production of hemp grains and green manure rounded out the crop rotation on the organic land. Almost all of Kroeker�s 4000 acres of potato production (800 acres organic and 3200 acres conventional) was for table potatoes (versus processing potatoes) sold through Peak of the Market a not-for-profit marketing organization under a number of different trade brands. Approximately 100 acres of organic onions was also sold through Peak of the Market each season. Extensive post-harvest potato and vegetable handling (including washing sorting storing grading and packing) was done by Kroeker. An additional 1000 acres of seed potatoes was grown each year and sold directly to other growers. Marketing of all grain and hemp crops was also done in-house by Kroeker staff.Kroeker continued to be headquartered in Winkler where its facilities included potato storage bins; a potato washing and packing facility; an onion grading and storing facility; a repair shop; and a local food retail shop The Potato Store. Given the geography of Kroeker�s farm land some other areas had satellite locations with crop storage equipment repair shops and offices. Across all operations Kroeker employed between 300 and 400 staff depending on the time of year. Members of the Kroeker family no longer worked in the business but they maintained a majority ownership stake. The farm�s shareholders and senior managers were looking for sound investment opportunities to improve the overall performance of the farm. They also had a keen interest in being on the leading edge of technology having a tendency toward a why-not-try-it attitude with respect to the adoption of new technologies. Both shareholders and staff maintained a commitment to strong values related to tillage land stewardship innovation and quality.INDUSTRY INFORMATIONPotato Industry In 2016 Manitoba was home to 19.6 per cent (67673 acres) of Canada�s potato production second only to Prince Edward Island. The average size of a potato farm in Manitoba was 415 acres higher than in any other province and well above the national average of 110 acres. The majority of Manitoba�s potato production was for processing (86 per cent) with the remainder for the fresh table market (7 per cent) and seed (7 per cent). The Keystone Potato Producers Association (KPPA) was the processing potato producer organization for Manitoba while table potatoes were all contracted by Peak of the Market a grower-owned not-for-profit vegetable supplier operating in Manitoba under the Farm Products Marketing Act.Organic Crop ProductionThe Canadian organic market had experienced rapid growth quadrupling in less than 10 years to reach total sales of CA$4 billion. Under organic crop production no synthetic fertilizers synthetic pesticides or genetically modified organisms were permitted. Without the option of synthetic pesticides mechanical tillage was used extensively for weed control and the windows of opportunity for weed control intervention were typically smaller than in conventional production. To become certified organic farms had to meet all requirements set out in the Canadian Organic Standards and be inspected by an independent third-party verifier accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). In order to convert conventional farmland to certified organic farmland a producer had to accommodate a 36-month transition period during which crops had to be grown under organic standards but could not yet be sold as certified organic. Hemp IndustryIndustrial hemp production had deep roots in Canada; it was one of the first crops that Samuel Champlain planted in Port Royal and ultimately Quebec. As a result of the anti-marijuana movement across North America Canada introduced the Opium and Narcotics Control Act in 1938 banning the production of hemp. Hemp varieties with low levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were later developed and the ban was lifted in 1998 permitting the production of hemp under license with Health Canada.Industrial hemp was viewed as a new alternative crop that complemented prairie crop rotations as it broke the traditional crop disease cycles affecting cereals and offered enhanced cropping profits. Hemp was also an adaptable crop that could be grown in a variety of climates and soil types. The land licensed for hemp production in Canada increased from 3250 acres in 2001 to 66700 in 2013; 22 per cent of this land was in Manitoba.Industrial hemp was a versatile crop with both grain and fibre uses even though the market opportunities for grain were the main driving force behind the acreage in Canada. In Manitoba a number of companies had contracted hemp seed production for use in a range of food products (e.g. oil dehulled hemp seeds or nuts milk flour toasted hemp seeds coffee butter and protein powder) and body care products (e.g. shampoo conditioner hand lotion and lip balm). Hemp fibre was well-suited as a substitute for non-renewable sources of fibre and could be used in products such as paper insulation or bio-composites.ORGANIC HEMP EXPANSION OPPORTUNITYDuring the 2016 season Kroeker had produced organic hemp on 500 acres as part of its three-year organic potato rotation. This production was all done with 12-row row-cropping equipment (typically used for corn wheat or edible beans) which planted on 22-inch row spacing. Row-cropping cultivators were taken through the fields an average of two and one-half to four times between planting and the crop having canopy closure. Although this production approach had worked in the past the existing equipment was at maximum capacity with 500 acres. In 2017 Kroeker planned to more than double its hemp acreage to 1100 acres. As such Peters was exploring two different capital investment options for the year ahead.Regardless of which equipment investment was made Peters anticipated that the 600 additional acres of hemp would bring in $1 million in additional revenue annually beginning in 2017. The operating costs associated with soil fertility ($125 per acre) and with harvesting drying hauling storing and working the field before and after the crop ($230 per acre) would be the same under both options. Since these revenues and costs would be the same regardless of the equipment investment made Peters decided to exclude these values from his analysis. Option 1: Camera Cultivator and Air SeederPeters had first seen a camera cultivator in action at another Manitoba farm in 2015 and was intrigued about its potential uses at Kroeker. Camera cultivators operated by using a camera to �see� the contrast between the green row of a newly germinated crop and the dark soil. The contrast was used to guide the cultivator shovels using a moving hitch to stay between the crop rows. This precision enabled the cultivator to be used on more narrowly seeded or solid-seeded crops.After researching different options Peters settled on the Austrian-manufactured 2016 Einb�ck Chopstar which was 43.5 feet wide covered 52 rows with 10-inch spacing and cost $128000. Peters was excited about the possibility of adopting this cutting-edge technology particularly for its potential weed-control benefits. If he planted on 10-inch rows instead of 22-inch rows he estimated that the crop would reach full canopy stage much more quickly. This technology would also reduce the number of cultivator passes to two per growing season and reduce overall weed pressure in the hemp and in the green manure and vegetable crops grown on that land in other years of the rotation. This factor was particularly important in vegetable crops such as onions as much of the weeding was done with human labour. Peter had a gut feeling that the reduced weed pressure from using the camera cultivator could result in annual labour savings across the farm of $20000 beginning in the third growing season (when contrasted with using row-cropping equipment). However many other factors could affect overall weed pressure so he was not overly confident in this estimate. As with any change involving new technology Peters had some reservations. First and foremost the camera cultivator had been used commercially in grain crops before but never in hemp. He wondered how a poorer hemp crop with some gaps in the rows might affect the camera�s ability to operate. If Peters planted hemp on 10-inch rows and the camera cultivator was not effective he would have no other option for mechanical tillage for weed control in the crop. In this instance Peters could run the risk of losing up to 50 per cent of the hemp crop and be faced with major weed pressure headaches in future growing seasons. There were further unknowns: for example he did not know how fast the cultivator could be used in hemp and thus the acreage capacity of the equipment. Solid-seeded hemp meant there was a shorter window of time for weeds to thrive before full canopy was reached but it also meant a shorter window of time to cultivate for weed management. Missing these opportunities due to capacity constraints would negate all potential weed control benefits of the camera cultivator. Conversely excess capacity would allow Kroeker to capitalize on the cultivator�s versatility by using it in other solid-seeded crops including grains and green manure. Peters had some hesitations around contingency planning as well. The closest dealer for the camera cultivator was located in Ontario and he wondered about access to technical support and repair parts.  Due to its high level of precision the camera cultivator had to be calibrated directly with a specific air seeder and Kroeker�s existing air seeder was too small and outdated to meet this need. As a result Peters selected a new air seeder a 2013 John Deere 1895 which cost $200000 and would plant 52 rows on 10-inch spacing. As an added benefit this air seeder had the capacity to plant in a wider range of conditions than Kroeker�s existing air seeder. Both the camera cultivator and air seeder could be used with an existing tractor in Peters�s division of the farm. Although staff were keen to use new technology he wondered about potential staff frustrations related to training new processes and learning to use new equipment.Based on using an air seeder on 10-inch rows Peters estimated that seed cost would be $60 per acre. He knew that the cost to operate the air seeder and existing tractor was $3.50 per acre for the season including the cost of fuel tractor operator and repairs. Similarly the cost to operate the camera cultivator and existing tractor was $1.50 per acre per pass through the field. He expected that replacement of cultivator shovels would be the primary maintenance cost. Kroeker tended to turn over its tractors frequently and typically while still under warranty so the main costs were regular maintenance such as oil changes. Peters knew that the seeder would hold its value estimating a re-sale value of $150000 after the end of five seasons. In contrast the degree of specialization of the camera cultivator would mean quite a limited pool of prospective buyers. Peters estimated a potential re-sale value of $40000 at the end of five seasons.Option 2: New Planter and CultivatorThe second option that Peters considered was investing in 24-row row-cropping equipment (versus the current 12-row equipment) in order to accommodate the new acreage. With its larger capacity this equipment was the best choice because Peters had been using the same production practices on the existing hemp. He settled on the John Deere DB44 24-row planter which cost $130000 and used central seed delivery on 22-inch spacing between rows. For a cultivator Peters selected the Elmers 24-22 costing $80000. Having used similar equipment previously Peters knew these two pieces of equipment would have the capacity to service the new expanded hemp area. This equipment would have limited use beyond hemp as all other crops that Peters oversaw were solid-seeded.Planting hemp on wider rows and delaying canopy cover would mean the management required for weed control would be heightened. Based on past experience a row cultivator would typically be taken through a field two and one-half to four times on average per season before canopy was reached. Weeds could possibly overtake a hemp crop particularly if a shorter hemp variety were being grown. If this were the case yield reductions could be about 20 per cent.Additionally this equipment required a larger tractor than Peters currently owned within his division. A tractor could be borrowed from another division of the farm but Peters was not confident that one would be available during the periods of the season that he needed it. Particularly for cultivating the window of opportunity was often quite small so Peters risked not having full control over when this could be done. A second option was to rent a tractor from a local equipment supplier. Peters estimated that this would cost $2 per acre for planting and $2 per acre for each cultivator pass. Peters did not consider purchasing a new tractor specifically for this purpose.Peters estimated that seed cost with row seeding would be one-third less than with solid seeding at $40 per acre. He calculated that the cost to operate the row planter and the larger tractor would be $2 per acre for the season including the cost of fuel tractor operator and repairs. The cost to operate the row cultivator and tractor was $1.50 per acre per pass through the field. Peters knew that the seeder would hold its value fairly well estimating a re-sale value of $80000 after the end of five seasons. In contrast the re-sale market for these types of cultivators had deteriorated in recent years due to changes in the sugar beet industry. He estimated a potential re-sale value of $20000 at the end of five seasons. Peters recognized that each of these new machinery purchases would qualify for a capital cost allowance of 30 per cent per year. Kroeker depreciated all equipment on a 20 per cent declining balance basis but Peters expected that all equipment under consideration would still be in use on the farm in 15 years. Kroeker�s tax rate was 21 per cent and for the most part its capital investments were financed internally and paid with cash. On the other hand Peters knew that Kroeker�s shareholders were typically looking for returns of 10 per cent.FINAL DECISIONPeters had to figure out the costs for these two equipment options but he knew that financials were only part of the story. He had to consider other factors such as the risk of investing in new technology versus investing in larger row-cropping equipment that had worked in the past for hemp on the farm but that was at its maximum capacity. Kroeker�s farm manager was ultimately responsible for approving capital investment decisions considering the overall farm budget return on investment and areas of highest need across the entire farm business. Peters knew that he would need to consider the manager�s perspective in order to build a convincing case for whichever option he recommended.

He had started his career in 1995 at the Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) which was widely credited with bringing marketing research into China. In 2002 Jianming had left P&G and founded his own consulting business in brand management. A successful 17-year veteran in marketing Jianming had found that marketing research as he knew it back then was not necessarily going to sustain the radical changes happening in the Chinese market and this prompted him to found Shanghai MarcPoint Information Technology Co. Ltd. (MarcPoint) a marketing research company that focused on analyzing user-generated content (UGC) with big-data technologies. By 2018 MarcPoint had become a leader in big-data marketing research in China. Yet Jianming found himself once again facing a changing market—except this time the changes appeared even broader and more dramatic. As he reflected on the success MarcPoint had achieved in the five short years since its inception he asked himself what he thought the next five years should be.The Chinese Market in 2012The Chinese market in 2012 was surely different than in 1995: it was highlighted by the growth of e-commerce the decline of traditional marketing channels and the burst of social media usage. While the overall economy of that year measured by the gross domestic product grew by only 7.8 per cent over the previous year—a moderate number at that time by Chinese standards—the growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods was much stronger at 14.3 per cent or 12.1 per cent after adjusting for inflation. The e-commerce market however exploded with an increase of 66.5 per cent over 2011 growing to ¥1.3 trillion (about US$205 billion) and accounting for 6.1 per cent of the total retail sales of consumer goods. By the end of 2012 242 million Internet users in China had shopped online. Looking back Jianming believed that 2012 was the year that confirmed the decline of traditional media marketing and marked the final arrival of online marketing in China. According to the CTR research in 2012 the traditional media advertising market in China had grown by only 4.5 per cent over 2011—a fall-off from the previous year’s growth rate of 13 per cent. In comparison the new media market had increased by more than 50 per cent over the previous year and grown to ¥77 billion. Fast growth of social media marketing and its effectiveness was witnessed in 2012. The 2012 research report on the Chinese online shopping market from the influential China Internet Network Information Center examined for the first time how social networking services (SNS) affected online shopping. According to the report 28.4 per cent of online shoppers had used a social networking service in the past six months. Among these shoppers 52.8 per cent browsed or followed shopping-related information through SNS and 41.8 per cent eventually bought a product after seeing the product information shared through SNS. These numbers were not surprising considering that SNS had become popular among Chinese Internet users by 2012. It was reported that 275 million Internet users or nearly half of all Internet users in China (48.8 per cent) used SNS by the end of 2012. The huge number of Internet users the growing e-commerce market and the expanding usage of SNS in China collectively made the Chinese market decidedly different from what it was before.Challenges to Traditional Marketing ResearchTo Jianming one of the biggest differences was the sudden availability of huge amounts of data that fundamentally challenged the traditional way in which marketing research was done. He sensed that at least theoretically the large amount of transaction data available through the e-commerce market and the UGC on social media magnified by the huge number of social media users presented an opportunity to do marketing research in a radically different way. Traditionally marketing research had primarily used data collected from surveys and focus groups. Comparatively UGC enjoyed quite a few advantages. First UGC tended to be more candid truthful and reliable. In 2009 Jianming started using Sina Weibo (Weibo) a Chinese microblogging service that was similar to Twitter in the United States in both popularity and functionality and found that consumers were surprisingly candid on Weibo. He quickly realized that he might not need to use surveys to ask consumer questions for marketing research any more. He explained:Often we need to do consumer profiling for our marketing research. So what are white-collar workers like? Confident right? Loving. Proactive. They must love reading books watching movies and traveling right? But Weibo greatly changed my thoughts. In fact I found that many white-collar workers are lazy no dreams no ideas just like to stay at home. They claim they like reading but they never mentioned anything related to books in their Weibo messages. I suddenly realized how wrong the survey-based research we did before could be simply because if I ask people about their hobbies few people would reply “I like sleeping late.” Nobody would answer that way. Second with UGC a large number of consumers were telling stories from their own perspectives without any preset limitations. Thus UGC presented not only detailed but also diversified information on how consumers use a product and what they think of it—which was a stark contrast to data collected by traditional means. Traditional marketing research employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods like focus groups often involved a few dozen participants across five or six markets. Survey questionnaires were then built—often informed by the results of qualitative studies—and distributed to a few hundred or thousand consumers to be filled. The representativeness of data collected from such studies was simply no match for UGC contributed by hundreds of thousands of Internet users. As Jie Li Jianming’s former mentor at P&G and current MarcPoint colleague explainedTraditionally if you want to understand the market and what the consumers think you do it with a survey. A survey can take at most one and a half hours. Otherwise the consumer will lose patience and mess with the answers. A one-and-a-half-hour survey can involve not much more than the products how they are used and the consumers’ attitudes toward them. It is impossible to include questions on the context in which the products are used the mental status with which the products are used and the many other life details with which the products are used. You just can’t fit all these in a survey.Moreover traditional marketing research was limited by the experience of the researchers who conducted the research. For example surveys were built by marketing researchers who hopefully had experience with the product or the industry. However no matter how experienced the researchers were they simply could not accommodate the viewpoints of tens of thousands of consumers. As a result the questions included in a survey or focus group might miss some product features that were important to consumers but not known to the researchers thus limiting the effectiveness of such research. Jianming relayed an example from his early experience with UGC:One of our earliest examples is a project related to Yixing Zhang in 2013. Yixing Zhang was a K-pop star from China. When we were working for Lay’s potato chips we found from data that consumers always related Lay’s chips to Yixing Zhang and we wonder[] why? We asked our contacts from Lay’s “Do you know Yixing Zhang?” Few people did. “Do you know if Yixing Zhang had anything to do with Lay’s potato chips?” Everybody was at a loss “Why? Yixing Zhang had nothing to do with our potato chips!” But data told us there indeed was. It turned out that Yixing’s English name was Lay. He had said in public that he liked eating Lay’s chips and Yixing’s fans even called him “chip bro.” . . . Nobody from Lay’s knew it and they just signed another star (who was totally different from Yixing) to speak for Lay’s chips . . . So here you see the power of data: When you do a survey research you always bring with you some assumptions. Yixing Zhang won’t appear in your questionnaire because you just don’t know him and you have no idea he has an English name called Lay. Finally the focus of traditional marketing research tended to be narrow. When a company commissioned a study it usually focused on its own product and consumers’ knowledge of and attitude toward it. In comparison UGC from multiple SNS websites could collectively paint a much more holistic picture of the consumers which could lead to a much better idea of who the consumers were and what they were truly interested in. Jianming argued:Suppose we are doing a marketing research on diapers. We use a questionnaire. Of course all questions are about diapers which makes this survey one-sided. A real mom cares about diapers. She also cares about formula. She cares about many other things. Therefore what we learned from the survey is incomplete. Testing with WeiboConvinced of the opportunities offered by UGC Jianming started to look for technologies to deal with them. To him there were two obstacles he needed to overcome to make use of UGC:[We knew then that we could do marketing research with Weibo.] But we had two problems. First there are so many Weibo messages. How can we deal with the volume? Second Weibo messages are texts. They don’t have a structure. They are all so-called unstructured content. How do we deal with them?Fortunately Weibo was a great place for learning too. Jianming looked for people on Weibo who seemed to know the technologies and he interacted with them non-stop. He began to know more and more people in this field and learned that the technology was called natural language processing. Eventually he got in touch with Jun Yang. At that time Jun was still a student pursuing a master’s degree in computer science at Nanjing University; he later became one of MarcPoint’s first employees. In late 2012 Jun began to help Jianming run a few explorations with Weibo messages. When Jianming presented the results to his clients—Lay’s chips was one of the examples—they were all amazed.Jun’s analyses easily synthesized hundreds of thousands of Weibo messages which was an unprecedented approach to marketing research in China. Back then the idea of big data was still in its nascence. Inspired by the famous 2011 McKinsey report on big data and encouraged by the early successes with Weibo messages Jianming started his own journey of using big data such as UGC to transform marketing research founding MarcPoint in 2013. Jie who had been a marketing executive in several multinational companies in both China and Europe became involved in MarcPoint as a consultant at the end of 2014. In 2015 the company acquired an angel fund and Jie officially joined the company as a co-founder.Collaboration with AlibabaMarcPoint started by working with Taobao the consumer arm of Alibaba the Chinese e-commerce giant. In September 2012 Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba made data the ultimate foothold of Alibaba’s growth strategy. With its dominance in both big-data technologies and the e-commerce market Alibaba was a trendsetter in the emergence of big data in China and the partner that all data companies dreamed of working with.In early 2014 Jianming attended a big-data summit hosted by Alibaba. He was excited by the speeches and motivated by Alibaba’s apparent commitment to becoming an open platform for big data. However only one talk which discussed how Alibaba used big data for microfinancing truly resonated with him. Jianming felt that most of the other talks were more conceptual than practical consisting more of ideas than of actual applications. He was disappointed that he could not see much business value in what was being advocated in the presentations. In 2013 Alibaba started a product called Yushanfang which Alibaba intended as its big-data platform. Through Yushanfang independent software vendors Taobao storekeepers and other users not necessarily tied to e-commerce could have access to the data accumulated through Taobao. More importantly Yushanfang also provided its clients with big-data processing tools algorithms services and products. In this sense Yushanfang was a cloud-based platform-as-a-service provider that offered a data platform data warehousing and a data centre as services. MarcPoint became involved with Yushanfang early during its pilot stage. As Jianming recalledWhen we first met the Yushanfang people I felt everyone was positively strongly and enthusiastically enamored [by big data]. The future of big data had arrived! But what exactly could Yushanfang do? The Yushanfang people didn’t know. We didn’t either . . . We started playing with Yushanfang in March [2014] and by July we . . . [began] working with it regularly. We participated in an algorithm competition and made a breakthrough at the end of 2014. It was then that we realized that we finally knew how to use data from Alibaba! We implemented our ideas: Finding data from Alibaba gaining insights identifying [our] target audience and pitching promotions!In 2015 Yushanfang was officially announced. MarcPoint received one of the first licences and immediately started acquiring clients. In a few short months MarcPoint became Yushanfang’s leading marketing service provider and MarcPoint’s business grew steadily on the Yushanfang platform. After that time however Yushanfang went through quite a few changes and the collaboration with Alibaba did not stay a perfect partnership for long. In mid-2016 MarcPoint started to shift away from Yushanfang and Alibaba. In spring 2018 Alibaba stopped updating Yushanfang products. Although MarcPoint still collaborated with Alibaba it did not rely on it as much as it used to. The Core Competency Nevertheless working with Yushanfang turned out to be a critical stage in the growth of MarcPoint as it was during that time that MarcPoint verified and polished its core competencies and business model. Noted for its work with Yushanfang MarcPoint was invited to give a talk at an August 2015 ESOMAR event. The talk was titled “From Consumer Insight to Actions” and Jianming believed that this title best summarized MarcPoint’s business.Jianming started MarcPoint by first recruiting the technical team. Over time the technical team grew to include three groups: data programming and algorithm. The data group was in charge of data acquisition cleansing and management. The algorithm group was research-oriented and mostly concerned with how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the big-data algorithms MarcPoint used. The programming group did the actual coding. MarcPoint invested heavily in its technical team which made up about half of its employees. The company supported an employee’s pursuit of a doctoral degree in data science after financing her master’s degree in the United States. Jun even had a paper published that was based on one of his projects and that he presented at a leading conference. These were rare occurrences for a company of MarcPoint’s size and resources. Yet neither Jianming nor Jie thought MarcPoint’s strength in technology alone was responsible for its success. They both believed that it took much more for MarcPoint to be able to generate value for clients through big data. According to Jie MarcPoint’s core competency was its ability to integrate data technology and industry experience:We [and our competitors] all compete on one competency that is how to get more data with more dimensions and how to connect the isolated data silos . . . But I believe many of our competitors started on the wrong foot because they care too much about the big-ness and all-inclusiveness [of the data]. An over-emphasis on the big-ness and all-inclusiveness leads to the over-emphasis on data and technology. However the nature of all businesses requires some subject domain knowledge in the particular industry. You need such knowledge to put everything in perspective. So we took a different approach. We started with deep subject domain knowledge. We tried to understand what’s going on by integrating subject domain knowledge with data and technology. MarcPoint’s emphasis on subject-domain knowledge while different from many other technology-oriented big-data companies was not surprising given that both co-founders were marketing veterans and had between them nearly 50 years’ worth of experience in marketing research. To Jianming big data was like a great hammer; but when everybody has a hammer the question becomes how to find the right nails:Many technology-oriented startups have disappeared. They attracted a lot of VC [venture capital] money but they had no idea what to do with it . . . One company was trying to collaborate with us. They coded a lot of tools and acquired a lot of data. After some time I asked them to just give us the data and let us deal with them with Excel . . . Their tools were useless because they created a system along the analytic dimensions they imagined. But that’s not how we marketing people do it. We would like to solve problem A but they were trying to convince us to use this tool to solve a problem which is totally different . . . We may not have those fancy technologies but we can solve our clients’ problems! . . . I finally realized big data is like a hammer. Now everybody says [“]I have a great hammer[”] but the question is “where are the nails”? We are the ones who find the nails!Yet finding the nails was not always easy. It took a great deal of orchestration to integrate data technology and subject-domain knowledge. First of all the subject-domain knowledge had to be encoded into their big-data processing system for it to work which required expertise patience and effort. In order to accurately process the textual data collected from various online sources MarcPoint started with building a lexicon and then used the lexicon to build knowledge graphs that could be used in turn to break the isolations between various data sources. To do so effectively often entailed hiring external experts or acquiring external knowledge. One industry that MarcPoint particularly focused on was baby care. To build the lexicon MarcPoint had to hire gynecologists and rely on their expertise. As Jianming explained For expecting mothers the phrase “create a card” carries a special meaning. But to us we had no idea what it is. The gynecologists would tell us that this phrase means the mother has made a decision on the hospital where she is going to give birth which is a very big deal.Jianming also emphasized the importance of learning from clients:We spend most of our time with our clients which is how we differ from most technology-focused companies. For example at the end of a year many technology-focused companies were busy attending award ceremonies. We don’t get any awards anyway. We run from one client to another. We spend most of our time with our clients . . . Very often the clients are extremely knowledgeable. Like yesterday I was with [a client] and spent time with two of their marketing people. They explained what they did in the baby care industry. They were deeply deeply knowledgeable in this industry.Additionally Jie explained three keys to achieving such integration:First you must be guided by the results pursued by the client’s industry and then figure out how your data and technologies can support [the results]. This is the first integration. The second integration is that of talents. That is you start with talents specializing in marketing in technologies in data. Now you have to make sure they understand other areas [than their own specialization] . . . The third integration is that of cultures. The three kinds of people have different cultures. The marketing people think divergently. The technology people are more likely to be focused. The data people probably are something still different. In [a] certain sense we need the marketing people to get down to earth more and the technology people to become a little bit more romantic. So it is very important for us to build a culture and environment in the middle ground. The Current BusinessIn 2018 MarcPoint was already in its fifth year and its business model had evolved into providing total marketing solutions supported by big data (see Exhibit 1). Consumer Big DataAfter five years of hard work MarcPoint became keenly aware of the importance not only of data but also of having access to and control of data. MarcPoint carefully chose which industries to enter and the availability and quality of data were important considerations that factored into their decision. For the baby care industry where MarcPoint excelled it captured publicly available data from dozens of online baby care communities and health care platforms that were highly active and thus offered rich and valuable data. Jianming explained:The baby care industry is big (the market scale is hundreds of billions of RMB yuan). The consumers care about the industry very much. Moms are engaged in online discussions and the discussions are in depth and of high quality. Moreover giving birth to and caring for babies are uniquely important stage[s] of Moms’ lives. They prefer to discuss on specialized baby care platforms [rather than generic online communities]. Finally [the] baby care industry has some legal and professional barriers. It is not an industry that anybody can get involved [in].The online baby care communities MarcPoint worked with had a total of more than 70 million mothers and 3.4 billion messages. The online health care platforms involved more than half a million doctors and 1.3 billion interactions between doctors and patients. These data were further enhanced with those from other public sources such as e-commerce websites Weibo messages and WeChat subscription accounts. In total MarcPoint stored nine billion messages from more than 300 million users across sources. More than three million messages were added to storage every day. Additionally MarcPoint acquired access to proprietary data owned by private sources partner platforms and other companies. From Data to InsightsThe fast-growing genuine and valuable data MarcPoint acquired from various sources in huge volume provided it with a solid foundation upon which to build its business model. To turn data into insights MarcPoint greatly relied on its deep understanding of the industry its clients competed in its own marketing expertise the integration between data and subject-domain knowledge and its superior algorithms. For the past five years MarcPoint had focused on and invested in the baby care industry. The investment had led to not only the best big-data set in the industry but also a lexicon tagged along the most dimensions and the most comprehensive knowledge graph. The machine learning algorithm used for processing the messages were developed in-house adjusted for the baby care industry and repeatedly used and verified. Jun believed that MarcPoint enjoyed a few advantages over its competitors:Computing-wise we already built a local hadoop cluster of 10 servers and deployed a cluster of 200 servers on the cloud. We built this hybrid-cloud-based architecture for big data storage processing mining and maintenance. It can support multi-users multi-tasks [and] offline and real-time computing. It also offers a deep-learning framework that coordinates computing resources among CPUs and GPUs. All these efforts provide MarcPoint with the technical foundation on which its products and services are built. Specifically in the artificial intelligence [AI] area we built an AI computing suite focusing on natural language processing [NLP] knowledge graph and deep learning. My paper on NLP was accepted by [the] AAAI [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence] the top AI conference in 2018. The paper highlighted MarcPoint’s accumulated efforts in NLP data in the baby care industry and algorithms.Guided by its deep understanding of the client industry and the problems its clients were facing and supported by its big-data set comprehensive knowledge graph and superior algorithms MarcPoint was able to generate consumer insights that catered to its clients’ needs. These insights had typically allowed MarcPoint to help clients with a) identifying category users and potential users; b) identifying brand users and potential users; c) discovering consumer demands consumer context and topics for paid review; and d) discovering consumer journey and customer touchpoints.From Insights to Actions Armed with consumer insights generated from the big data MarcPoint further offered its clients comprehensive solutions that included promotion actions targeting their customers. Jianming explainedOn the Alibaba’s platform things are easier because Alibaba offers a great advertising platform. We can help with both strategic advertising and tactic advertising . . . On some other platforms we need to collaborate with the platforms . . . We collaborate with them on advertising content and key opinion leaders . . . In other words we tell our clients who your consumers are where you can interact with them and with what messages you can interact with them . . . Not only do we tell them we can also actually do it for them . . . This is what we mean by “. . . from insights to actions.”Results AnalysisThere was a famous saying among marketing professionals: “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” As Jie explained the emergence of big data offered an opportunity to better understand:Why don’t you know which half? The answer is simple: because you don’t know what happened in between. You don’t have the data to understand what led to the results . . . But when you have data once you have the promotion strategy and have it implemented you can monitor the results . . . [It is not necessarily 50 per cent versus 50 per cent.] You can actually tell whether it is 20 per cent or 80 per cent that works right? When we plan our promotion goals and strategies we create a few key performance indexes[] such as how many new users we need to generate or how much more usage my existing customers need to make . . .  [With big data] we know which consumers we try to target. We also know how many of them changed behavior. All those are in your plan. Once it is implemented you can certainly see the before-after changes [from the big data] . . . In this sense big data let[s] you know exactly which creative idea can activate the consumers. The FutureBy early 2018 MarcPoint had firmly established itself as a leading big-data marketing service provider in China. In the immediate future MarcPoint planned to expand its businesses both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally Jianming and Jie wanted to expand MarcPoint’s success in the baby care industry to the health care industry. Jie noted the similarity and connectivity between the two industries:Both markets are sufficiently big worth more than a trillion yuan. Additionally both markets are data rich. Compared with larger industries[] such as fast-moving consumer goods and automobile the dimensionalities and volume of the data in both markets are big enough. The two markets are connected too. You have data of the whole chain from online baby care communities such as babytree.com and mamacn.com to online diagnosis platforms to e-commerce websites. From the perspective of marketing you have data of all categories and the complete chain [in both markets].Vertically MarcPoint insisted on being the full-service provider that focused on creating value for customers. Jianming explained:There will certainly be distractions. For example while the consumer insights we generate for our customers is arguably the most valuable the action stage is the easiest stage for us to make a profit because usually the customers spend the most in actual advertising . . . If you spend 100 million in advertising and my agent fee is 2 per cent I will earn 2 million which is good enough and easy enough. However it is much more difficult to provide full service (from data to insight to action to results). Many companies simply won’t do this . . . Yet you can only maximize the value for your customers with the full service. Additionally MarcPoint was exploring offering their data algorithms and knowledge graphs as products to customers. Jianming referred to the synergy of the three as the “intelligent engine” and he considered this engine the “propeller” that drove marketing:What is an intelligent engine? It is the source of the propulsion that drives marketing . . . The engine integrates data knowledge graphs and algorithms. You can only discover the value of the data with the three . . . We turn the engine into a technical product . . . that can be used by not only us but also platforms other service providers and possibly companies. This idea is a natural evolution of our business. We already know how to provide our customers with full services. We’ve figured it out. Now we consolidate the services into quite a few concrete products and connect them into a system and make it accessible to others. Having embraced the changes brought by the Internet and big data he believed that more changes—and more dramatic changes—were still on the way:This is an era for reconstruction. The Internet big data and machine learning changed consumers and brought changes to many industries. In the marketing industry that we were familiar with the business models the value chain and those who are involved have all changed. More importantly the real changes might just get started . . . From the legal and policy perspective a series of problems caused by the Internet and big data—for example privacy protection data ownership and data asset pricing—have emerged and are waiting to be solved. From a more macro perspective China the United States and Europe are all undergoing changes that we don’t fully understand yet. All these changes are more likely to occur in the next 3 to 5 years than in 8 or 10 years.As MarcPoint celebrated its fifth anniversary Jianming was quite pleased by what MarcPoint had achieved. However with his ambition and vision he wondered what MarcPoint’s next steps should be. What technologies should it pursue? Which markets could it target for growth in the next five years? Should he try to transport MarcPoint’s success to overseas markets? All in all what did Jianming need to do to sustain MarcPoint’s growth and maintain its leading position in the turbulent technical and business environment? He could not help but begin to wonder about the next phase of MarcPoint and the future of big-data-driven marketing—not only in China but also in the rest of the world.exhibit 1: MarcPoint’s competitive advantageSource: Company documents.

That morning Niehaus had landed in Germany after an exhausting overnight flight from South Africa. She appeared pensive in the window’s reflection as she contemplated the previous day’s eventful TSSA board meeting. Niehaus had been the CEO of TSSA between 2005 and 2012 after which she became chairperson of the board of the same company. In 2016 from her position as chairperson she was considering the recommendations she would offer Gert Schoonbee to sustain TSSA’s culture transformation. Schoonbee had become the CEO of TSSA in 2012. Niehaus was mindful of not interfering with Schoonbee’s management of the company but wanted to direct some of the company’s approaches. She had been promoted to the position of senior vice-president Middle East and Africa for T-Systems International which required her to move to Bonn Germany the location of the head office of TSSA’s parent company Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom). Her challenging role required intense focus; therefore she purposefully needed to limit her involvement in the South African operations.Company background When Niehaus took over TSSA as acting CEO in 2005 the company’s revenue was declining 14 per cent year-on-year and she needed to turn the company around. Niehaus was often asked how she had been able to turn the organization around from being number 12 in the market to number one. In four and a half years TSSA had grown its headcount from 600 people to 2500 people and its revenue from R600 million to R3 billion.Niehaus recognized that the turnaround occurred because TSSA was able to execute what it had promised. The strategy and the story on paper were not extraordinary. Most of TSSA’s competitors had similar strategies; however the difference was in the implementation.Deutsche Telekom offered fixed-network and mobile services Internet and television (TV) services for consumers; and communication and technology solutions for multinational corporations. Deutsche Telekom operated in 50 countries across the world and employed more than 300000 people. The company recorded revenues of €62658 million (US$83241.2 million) during the financial year ended December 2014. The operating profit of the company was €7247 million (US$9627.6 million) in 2014 an increase of 47 per cent from 2013. The net profit was €2924 million (US$3884.5 million) in 2014. In the United States Deutsche Telekom had 55 million mobile customers at the end of 2014. In Germany Deutsche Telekom catered to 20.7 million fixed line customers 2.4 million pay TV subscribers 12.4 million broadband customers and 39 million mobile customers at the end of 2014.With a footprint in more than 20 countries 46000 employees and external revenue of €8.2 billion in 2015 T-Systems International of which TSSA was a part  had a global influence on the telecommunications industry. T-Systems International had partnered with 90 other companies including Avaya Cisco Systems Inc. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Informatica Microsoft Corporation Salesforce.com Inc. and VMware Inc. to offer business customers various cloud models from tailored private clouds and low-cost public cloud services to hybrid clouds. Information technology outsourcing (ITO) was growing at a rapid pace and Statista reported that in 2015 the total contract value of the worldwide ITO market was US$88.9 billion.Niehaus’s backgroundNiehaus was a clinical psychologist who started her career at Anglo American plc’s Maccauvlei Learning Academy in Vereeniging South Africa. She was trained as an assessment centre assessor then later moved to M-Net a South African subscription-funded TV channel in a training and development practitioner role. At age 27 Niehaus was a general manager on the executive committee of M-Net and managed human resources at MultiChoice a South African video entertainment company. She then became the human resources director at Debis Systemhaus GmbH (Debis) an outsourced technology company (then Daimler Chrysler). Deutsche Telekom acquired Debis in 2000 and restructured the company as TSSA. When Nieuhaus went on maternity leave with her third child TSSA’s revenue was declining. The struggling company was not acquiring new customers and decided to reorganize and downsize 20 per cent of the workforce. On Niehaus’s return from maternity leave the CEO offered Niehaus the role of head of sales. The CEO gave her a week or so to decide and advised her that in the meantime while they took over sales Niehaus also needed to become deputy CEO. Since no deputy role existed then this appointment caused conflict with the German parent company. TSSA’s CEO explained that in the South African development environment such a role was important to grow people into positions. After about a week Niehaus accepted the position.TSSA needed to conduct a massive transformation because it now had only 600 employees was number 12 in the market and was not a clear player in the South African information and communications technology (ICT) market. At the time TSSA was one of the smaller players a small multinational company that was not successfully securing any of the big deals that were being acquired by its competitors such as Dimension Data Business Connexion Group (BCX) EOH Holdings (Pty) Ltd. and Gijima Group Ltd. Within three months of Niehaus’s appointment as deputy CEO TSSA’s CEO had a disagreement with the shareholders and left the organization. Niehaus became the acting CEO and remained in that role for nearly a year. It was an interesting gender dynamic since according to Niehaus men would never have remained in an acting role for a full year; instead after three months most men would have expressed their frustration and delivered an ultimatum. In 2005 the leadership at Deutsche Telekom changed and the company underwent intense discussions about its investment in South Africa. On Niehaus’s return from a conference in Germany after the new T-Systems International CEO had been appointed Niehaus called a meeting and announced that the company had one of two choices. TSSA could either close down because it would not receive any support to grow inorganically and the parent company was considering divesting its business in South Africa or it needed to grow itself out of the problem. If the latter TSSA needed to create its own organic growth and scale up operations since ICT and especially outsourcing was all about scale. TSSA urgently needed to develop a strategy for increasing its size to become a larger player in the market. It was a highly uncertain time at the organization and several good employees left; they could see the ominous warning signs as revenues declined. TSSA was still profitable because it had reduced costs and restructured six months earlier. If left as it was TSSA would become totally insignificant but if successfully restructured the company could be a serious competitor. Leading the turnaroundNiehaus needed to put a team together to lead the turnaround. However members of the board and the executive committee resisted her role as acting CEO. Their concern was that Niehaus was a clinical psychologist had limited ICT knowledge and skills and was a woman with three young children. Niehaus did not consider herself a technology expert; it was not what motivated her. Niehaus was aware that others in the industry thought that it was the beginning of the end for TSSA. Deutsche Telekom conducted a worldwide search to find a suitable candidate to be TSSA’s new CEO.Niehaus decided that she needed to make changes. Some people on the executive committee were uncomfortable staying and resigned to pursue other opportunities. Niehaus had to ask a brilliant senior manager who was unable to make the necessary changes to leave the organization. One of the trusted team members was Schoonbee an engineer who was the strategist. Schoonbee supported Niehaus and together they made an excellent team. It was as if they were performing a dual CEO role making decisions jointly with the involvement of the other executive members. Schoonbee and Niehaus had lively discussions and regularly engaged in constructive conflict about decisions. Their combination of skills made a difference to the strategic direction of the organization. For example where Schoonbee as chief operating officer would consider strategic direction and task-related matters Niehaus had well-developed skills to influence people’s mindsets and solicit their support of the strategies. It was a kind of tandem leadership since the complexity of the work called for a range of skills that were not often found in one person. Employees believed in the dreamEverybody believed in the dream and that was the first step. Everyone was exposed to all of the information. The second step was to build an environment that created hope. In addition to the dream the introduction of hope created the view or the belief that it was possible to be successful at implementing the company’s strategy. This hope linked everything that employees did to the success of the strategy. The dream was translated into clear achievable daily tasks and the achievement of those tasks was monitored and measured. Niehaus and her executive team provided employees with regular feedback about their progress. The executive team also needed to change direction when necessary. For example when they realized the strategy was not yielding the desired results they came together and discussed what was not working and made decisions about what to do differently. It was not complex decision-making but the strategy was consistent and ensured that every single practice tied into the story. Nothing was done on the side; everything was seen as part of the story and the implementation needed to achieve the end result.Niehaus brought a softer angle by focusing on bringing people together on the vision the customers and the parent company. Schoonbee focused on actively driving the translation of those dreams and stories into real action. Their partnership was part of the success of the turnaround. Sanlam a South African financial services group was an important TSSA client as was Daimler AG the multinational car manufacturer; however for years TSSA had been unable to add any new contracts. TSSA thus needed to make a change and from a sales perspective the company was ruthless in its focus. TSSA had lost many employees and being cost-conscious it lacked the funds to acquire a notable headline name in the industry. At that stage TSSA was perceived as a declining company so it could not attract the best talent. TSSA needed to take what it had and make the best of it. TSSA needed to create something extraordinary with ordinary people—an expression that some people objected to as not sounding like a compliment. However the approach did not mean that ordinary people were not good. Niehaus also described herself as an ordinary human being with some brilliant and some not so brilliant characteristics that needed to be developed. Niehaus worked with a range of people who had varying competencies and turned those people and their various competencies into a ruthless sales team.In September 2006 after a year of acting in the role that Deutsche Telekom permanently appointed Niehaus in the role as CEO—and she had to prompt them to make the decision. The world was running up to the financial crisis of 2008 and TSSA’s biggest growth took place exactly in that time. The board and the executive team held a fundamental belief that TSSA’s leadership should not cut the important things. For example TSSA continued the activities that would make it sustainable through the bad times but it did not reduce any people practices. The tougher the challenge became the more time Niehaus spent talking to people. She made a commitment that she would personally visit every single office in the company four times a year. When she met employees she told the story about what TSSA was doing.People quickly began to see results indicating that things were going in the right direction. During this time Niehaus was adamant that TSSA would not stop providing coffee to employees. The company executives were very careful with their travel but they did not cut the activities that Niehaus believed were necessary for sustainability including training and spending time with people to ensure that they understood what was meant by the dream of creating an ICT company that had a soul. It was not easy to explain what that meant; nonetheless people felt that the dream was becoming tangible and understood that “an ICT company with a soul” meant capitalism with a conscience. TSSA’s management realized that the company needed to be financially sound to provide opportunities and training and there was no shortcut. Niehaus would however never ask anyone to do anything that they might not feel comfortable with; nor would she give in to unreasonable pressure for certain things. The leadership team purposefully created a company where people were more than just a number—a place where they had a real voice and a chance to make a real contribution. The leadership team wanted to become the number one company in ICT.Winning the big dealAt the beginning of 2008 TSSA won its first big deal which was with Old Mutual Limited (Old Mutual) a South African-based financial services group. TSSA asked a manager at Old Mutual why the company had chosen TSSA. The manager a particularly difficult person recalled his experience when Old Mutual had been conducting site visits. TSSA had a hundred employees busy preparing for this visit because Old Mutual was on the short list of two companies and TSSA needed this deal. The employees realized that they needed to win this deal because the company had identified three big deals and had said no to one and lost another. Thus the Old Mutual deal was the only one that could enable TSSA’s much needed growth. At the time Old Mutual was offering the biggest telecommunications outsourcing deal in the country. Outsourcing deals were worth R1 billion at that stage and the press coverage around the deal had been extensive. The deal would require an increase of more than 600 people so TSSA’s staff component would suddenly grow substantially—doubling to 1200 people. On the day of the site visit TSSA felt the pressure because nothing was assured. TSSA’s leadership had prepared the employees well for the visit and chose a young team leader whom they believed could do a good job. The leadership team briefed the team leader on how and what he should say when speaking with the potential customer. However when the Old Mutual entourage entered the centre with the particularly difficult manager and the TSSA executive introduced the team leader the difficult manager said that TSSA’s team should wait. The manager suspected that the team leader had been briefed so he chose to speak to another person on the floor. He chose to speak with a young woman who had probably worked at TSSA for only a year and a half. This young woman stood up and spoke about what she did and what the company was doing its purpose who they were and why they were doing it. She did it so well that it appeared to be scripted. When Niehaus conducted a debrief the Old Mutual manager admitted that up to that point he had thought that they were brilliant salespeople. Niehaus knew that the woman he spoke to was a very good salesperson; she had to play a key role in sales as a CEO of an outsourcing company. The Old Mutual manager said when the young woman spoke so authentically from the heart so passionately he saw and felt everything Niehaus spoke about including TSSA’s culture of ICT with soul. Recovering TSSA through a sense of purposeThe recovery of TSSA was enabled through a sense of purpose. TSSA’s leadership shared with people the story and the way in which they would like to work; these leaders engaged people and modelled their expectations by the way they interacted and answered people’s questions even very difficult questions. This approach led to the trust that people started to develop in the leadership and in the organization. It transcended and became a visible manifestation of the dream that people started to feel. People outside TSSA—even potential customers—started to feel the change.Niehaus realized that what made a company magic was a fundamental truth of people who wanted to feel a sense of purpose. People also wanted to feel acknowledged and heard in that purpose and in the execution; they wanted to share in the success of that business. Niehaus ensured that employees felt recognized through benefits or any of a wide variety of activities such as being rewarded as employee of year or having excellent training. Niehaus believed that what had initially driven her and the team in creating the magic had not changed but what they created had changed the company.  Looking aheadNiehaus believed that whether TSSA should change or sustain its culture it was up to every single management team to take notice of their current reality and capture some of its strengths. For Niehaus the truth that remained was that people wanted to feel a purpose do something worthwhile and be recognized for that; they wanted to be heard seen and feel important. For its message to remain current they might need to change aspects of its culture to fit its evolving reality. However Niehaus thought that it was not a totally new approach that was needed.Niehaus handed over the company to her successor Schoonbee in 2012 when she became a member of the TSSA board. She insisted that Schoonbee should be appointed because she was convinced of his strategic skills and acknowledged that she would not have been able to turn the company around without his support. She wondered what difference she could now make on the TSSA board.

H. Rao president of the Engineering and Research and Development Services (ERS) division and senior corporate vice president at HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCL) had every reason to be proud as he congratulated The Boeing Company (Boeing) on the maiden flight of its 787 Dreamliner jet airliner (Dreamliner) on December 15 2009. Out of the many companies working on the 787 Dreamliner project HCL was the only Indian information technology (IT) services firm to be selected for the project. As part of the project HCL worked closely with Boeing and some of Boeingâs tier-one suppliers in developing various onboard mission-critical software systems such as the electrical power generation and distribution system and the pilot controls. The multi-million dollar deal between HCL and Boeing valued at approximately US$110 million marked a significant point in HCLâs corporate history in that it had important implications for HCL and its future in the $644.3 billion aerospace and defence (A&D) industry.After 4 million hours of engineering services that culminated in the successful fulfillment of the requirements of the Dreamliner project the time was ripe for Rao to make a crucial strategic choice. HCL ERS could choose to continue to excel in offering great value to its customers by helping them optimize costs and improve delivery time or it could move up the value chain by investing more in research and development (R&D) capabilities thereby emerging as a leader rather than a follower in the highly complex and technology-driven A&D industry. BACKGROUND AND COMPANY PROFILEHCL was a large Indian multi-national IT services and product engineering solutions provider headquartered in Noida India. The firm was a subsidiary of the $5 billion HCL Enterprise with $2.3 billion in consolidated revenues as of September 30 2009 (trailing 12 months; see Exhibit 1). Though HCL was primarily an engineering services outsourcing company it positioned itself as a technology enabler and brought the end-customerâs experience to the forefront of its business. In 2009 HCL employed 54443 individuals and offered an integrated portfolio of services comprising software-led IT solutions remote infrastructure management engineering and R&D services and business process outsourcing across five industry verticals: manufacturing financial services health care public services and consumer services. The firm earned almost 21 per cent of its revenues from engineering and R&D services. HCL was successful in establishing its reputation as a trusted partner that could manage important research and development projects. When Boeing chose HCL to participate in the Dreamliner project this choice not only reinforced HCLâs reputation for reliability but also increased credibility about its overall competence. In line with the entrepreneurial spirit that HCL strived to inculcate among its employees the company referred to its engineers as âideapreneurs.â Over the years HCL was able to develop and establish an ecosystem and a corporate culture that allowed these employees to freely ideate and innovate. On average HCLâs employees were older than those of competitors like Infosys Limited due to HCLâs policy of hiring mostly experienced engineers versus fresh engineering school graduates. Analysts estimated that almost 65 per cent of HCLâs total workforce consisted of experienced professionals. Employees received an average salary that was approximately 20 per cent higher than that offered by competitors. HCLâs global workforce mostly comprised Indian nationals but the company expected to change this in the future by hiring more American citizens in order to allay fears of job migration and job loss among a section of the American public. In this regard HCL demonstrated its commitment to the plan by opening a development and service centre in Raleigh North Carolina in 2008. The company planned to staff its Raleigh centre mainly with fresh graduates from American engineering schools. However by the end of 2009 HCL still had not fully staffed the centre. Meanwhile HCL continued to deliver its services to its customers through a network of offices in 26 countries across the world with a strong presence in the United States Western Europe and Asia.ENGINEERING AND R&D SERVICES DIVISIONThe ERS division formed the core of R&D at HCL. The division offered engineering and research and development services to its customers and remained unfailingly focused on the end-consumerâs product or service experience. Typical projects included complete reengineering of complex legacy flight test systems reducing costs for tier-one automotive component suppliers creating and maintaining customer-facing software platforms for customers across a wide range of high-tech industries and reducing the time to market for various industrial product manufacturers thereby enabling these original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to deliver a superior end-customer experience. The ERS division endeavoured to deliver this experience through a mix of three ingredients: faster delivery (acceleration) superior value creation (by striking the right balance between costs and benefits) and access to advanced technology based on research and development.HCL ERS served 10 industry verticals including aerospace and offered six horizontal engineering solutions across these verticals (see Exhibit 2). In 2008 HCL earned $1.9 billion from services. Out of this figure almost 25.2 per cent was earned by HCL ERS. The greatest share of revenues came from the telecommunications and networking sector (38 per cent) followed by the A&D sector (20 per cent). Medical equipment accounted for 12 per cent of revenue; computing hardware and software storage and office automation accounted for 10 per cent; consumer electronics accounted for 7 per cent; automotive accounted for 5 per cent; and the remaining 8 per cent of revenue was earned from other sectors. HCLâs annual investment in R&Dâincluding infrastructure product development and intellectual propertyâhad remained at $15 million since 2007.âEngineering Out of the BoxâSenior executives at HCL including Rao acknowledged the need for HCL to move up the value chain while creating greater value for end-consumers their partners and themselves. With this goal in mind HCL ERS initiated its âengineering out of the boxâ (EOOTB) philosophy and method of service delivery in 2009. EOOTB involved looking at products and services as enablers or as means to an end as opposed to ends in themselves. EOOTB encompassed a collection of offerings termed âproductized solutionsâ that were almost ready to be deployed. These solutions were subsequently customized to form a completely finished end product depending on specific customer requirements. Productized solutions were designed for efficiency as well as customizability.Apart from assisting HCL customers in reducing their time to market EOOTB provided a platform for creating meaningful differentiation. This philosophy of value creation and delivery was ultimately driven by the increasing complexity and sophistication of the end-consumerâs needs. At times technological innovations opened up the possibility of creating and delivering value in ways that had been previously unimaginable. For instance advancements in telematics made it possible for next-generation automobiles to communicate directly with consumersâ kitchen appliances allowing customers to heat dinner during their drive home from work.Further as core products became increasingly commoditized and the technology matured an ecosystem perspective of products allowed firms to create value by looking at how individual products functioned in conjunction with other products or services over and above their standalone functionalities. Consequently how consumers used products in combination or the overall end-consumer experience started to emerge as the most important factor in value creation. With EOOTB as its guiding principle HCL considered the end-customer as part of a larger ecosystem that included various products and services wherein the overall customer experience became central to designing solutions. Though the possibilities were immense the key question remained whether HCL was ready for the challenge.BOEING AND THE DREAMLINER PROJECTThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner reflected a paradigm shift in the way Boeing manufactured aircrafts. Deviating significantly from its traditional approach of developing most of the components and subassemblies Boeing outsourced almost 70 per cent of its aircraft production across 50 tier-one suppliers. These primary suppliers were in turn expected to integrate subsystems and subassemblies manufactured by tier-two and tier-three suppliers. Boeing restructured its role as the primary systems integrator. This arrangement resulted in aircraft components being sourced from more than 100 suppliers spread across 12 countries. The extent of outsourcing was not only unprecedented in the history of Boeing but also unheard of in the entire civil aviation industry. While Boeing claimed to have purchased 65 per cent of the Dreamlinerâs airframe from outside suppliers Boeingâs major competitor Airbus SAS remained conservative purchasing only 52 per cent of the airframe from outside vendors. Reductions in production costs and delivery times were the most important factors that motivated outsourcing at Boeing. Other factors included expanding its global footprint in manufacturing and mitigating financial risk by tying supplier payments to aircraft sales. While leveraging a global supply chain and offshoring engineering services had its benefits it posed significant challenges especially for projects involving multi-tier suppliers. With multiple layers of contracting it was easy for OEMs like Boeing to lose visibility of the supply chain resulting in unprecedented delays cost overruns and quality problems. Though it was hailed as a revolutionary approach towards aircraft manufacturing the Dreamliner project cost Boeing $32 billionâa figure that was grossly over the initially planned budget of $6 billion. Moreover the first test flight took off two years behind schedule following six delay announcements. The production process aside the Dreamliner itself reflected major changes in its design and use of materials. For instance aluminum the material typically used to construct parts of the fuselage (skin and airframe) was replaced by much lighter and stronger composites which not only reduced structure fatigue and consequently maintenance cost but also fuel consumption. Another key way Boeing reduced the Dreamlinerâs fuel consumption was by replacing the mechanical systems on board the Dreamliner with electrical and electronic systems; this made the aircraft lighter by almost 907 kilograms (2000 pounds). Boeingâs ultimate goal was to reduce the fuel consumption of the Dreamliner by as much as 20 per cent versus other aircrafts in the same category. This reduction was significant given the higher cruising speed that the Dreamliner was capable of flying at (Mach 0.85 and a top speed of Mach 0.98) compared to other similar aircrafts. These speeds were close not only to those of the Dreamlinerâs predecessor the Boeing 767 and the directly comparable Airbus A300 but also to those of larger aircrafts. Further the new design improved passenger comfort by allowing better climate control and lowering cabin noise. The lighter weight also increased the operating range of the Dreamliner thereby reducing layovers and improving passenger convenience. The Dreamliner had a range of approximately 15279 kilometres.Boeing was already thinking beyond the Dreamlinerâs dimmable windows and its starry ceilings in terms of improving passengersâ flying experience. Both Boeing and Airbus were experimenting and developing ideas involving radical shifts in structural design aircraft navigation and control and avionicsâall with the ultimate aims of improving operational efficiency augmenting the flying experience and increasing passenger safety. One of these concepts for example included windowless fuselages with liquid-crystal display panels replacing the traditional smaller aircraft windows in order to present passengers with an interactive augmented reality experience. Boeing and Airbus were well on their way toward patenting some of these innovations. HCL ROCKWELL COLLINS INC. AND BOEINGHCL was introduced to Boeing by Rockwell Collins Inc. (Rockwell) an American corporation based out of Cedar Rapids Iowa. Rockwell which was a supplier of avionics and communications systems to the A&D sector was a tier-one supplier to Boeing and had approximately $4.4 billion in turnover in 2009. Rockwell specialized in flight deck avionics cabin electronics mission communications simulation and training and information management. HCLâs association with Rockwell had begun in 2000 with a much smaller verification and validation project not specific to avionics. Since this partnership HCLâs relationship with Rockwell had evolved and the two companies partnered in executing more complex and higher-valued projects. In 2007 HCL and Rockwell set up two offshore design development and verification centres in the Indian cities of Bangalore and Chennaiâone in each cityâwith the aim of developing high-value software and hardware design and verification services for the aerospace industry. The centres employed a dedicated team of HCL engineers who worked closely with their Rockwell counterparts.Rockwell served as the systems integrator for the Dreamlinerâs flight deck displays crew-alerting system and the more critical pilot controls communication and surveillance systems and common data network for the common core system. The integrated surveillance system which included critical functions like hazard detection traffic alerts collision avoidance Mode S surveillance and terrain avoidance and warning competencies was certified for the first time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the U.S. regulator and its European counterpart the European Aviation Safety Agency. A company spokesperson from Rockwell highlighted the importance of the companyâs association with Boeing as part of the Dreamliner project; she emphasized that the project was considered to be a landmark given that none of Rockwellâs customers had previously entrusted the company with a project of such scale and scope. The project was commissioned in 2004 and valued at $3.5 billion over its lifetime. Rockwell subcontracted a part of the project involving verification design and development to HCL following Boeingâs approval in 2004. Specifically HCL was entrusted with developing the cabin software for the Dreamliner. This association with Rockwell represented HCLâs first aerospace engagement a fact that underscored the strategic importance of the project. Rockwellâs decision to subcontract was primarily driven by cost considerations. Other strategic and operational concerns involved access to good engineering talent and Rockwellâs motivation to expand its global footprint. Apart from HCL Rockwell partnered with firms like the Aeronautical Computing Technique Research Institute from Xiâan China and the China Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute Company in Shanghai. Rockwell outsourced project components mainly to India and China. Rockwellâs principal engineering manager for Commercial Systems Engineering (Design Support) Roger French explained:Our overall strategy is to increase our customer value. For instance our systems engineering and development skills are highly valued by our customers but there are other things that we donât necessarily have to do in-house and those are the things weâre asking our subcontractors to assist us with.Similarly the vice president of Commercial Systems Engineering at Rockwell Steve Nieuwsma also emphasized the benefits of outsourcing: We save about 50 cents on the dollar when we ship something offshore and have it done in India. Last year we saved $17 million and we put that back into our organization which enabled us to chase new programs. Doing so ultimately leads to increased sales and revenues. Itâs really a self-feeding economic engine for us. In 2008 Rockwell awarded its version of top performing supplier award to HCL in recognition of the services HCL had provided as part of the Dreamliner project. Moreover in February 2009 HCL was awarded the gold standard (the highest level) Boeing âPerformance Excellenceâ award for exceptional services rendered to Boeing for the Dreamliner project. HCL was the only company to receive this award from among the 86 suppliers that were recognized by Boeing. HCL achieved this standard by maintaining a gold-level performance composite rating for each 12-month performance monitoring and measurement period starting from October 1 2007. Ultimately HCL went on to become the first Indian company to acquire the stringent industry-specific AS9100 quality standard certification awarded by the U.S.-based standards-developing organization SAE International. HCL HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND BOEINGApart from Rockwell HCL had close ties with Hamilton Sundstrand (Hamilton) a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) with headquarters in Windsor Locks Connecticut.  HCL had collaborated with Hamilton since 2002. Hamilton was a major contractor to the commercial aviation industry as well as the defence and space sectors. The firm supplied electrical power generation and distribution systems engine accessories and control systems flight control systems and pilot controls and auxiliary power units (among other important systems) to OEMs like Boeing and Airbus. Further Hamilton had a history of successful engagements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spanning the preceding five decades. In 2005 HCL strengthened its relationship with Hamilton by establishing a dedicated design centre in Bangalore India with the aim of supporting Hamilton in its civil aviation projects by providing high-quality product engineering services. The leadership of both the companies duly acknowledged this development and the news was carried in most of the major national newspapers in India. In 2009 Hamilton had a total turnover of $6.5 billion while UTCâs was $52.9 billion. Hamilton employed a total of 16469 individuals and earned an operating profit of $857 million in 2009. As a tier-one supplier Hamilton supplied nine major systemsâincluding the crucial onboard electrical system (ES)âto Boeing as part of the Dreamliner project. Hamilton subcontracted a part of the software development work pertaining to the ES to HCL. The main functionality of the ES involved distributing power to all other systems and components running on electricity onboard the Dreamliner. The ES was a vital component for the Dreamliner given that the Dreamliner represented a major change in aeronautical design wherein the legacy pneumatic systems that were powered by compressed air from the aircraftâs jet engines (also known as âbleed airâ in aerospace parlance) were replaced by electrical systems guided by the overarching objectives of reducing fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency. This no-bleed ES architecture resulted in almost 3 per cent savings in fuel consumption efficient power distribution significant reduction in maintenance costs improved system reliability and thus greater operational efficacy and passenger safety. Due to its importance the ES was designated as a âLevel Aâ system a system mandated for stringent testing before certification by the FAA. However in 2008 problems with the ES were reported: the FAA refused to certify the ES and instructed Hamilton to rewrite the software code relating to it. HCLâs role in developing the ES was also unfavourably highlighted in this context. Nevertheless Boeing refuted claims of any such major issues with the Dreamlinerâs ES at that time. Later in 2008 at Boeingâs Everett facilities Hamilton announced the successful start-up of its APS 5000 the auxiliary power unit system (a major component of the ES) onboard the Boeing ZA001 a prototype of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.BUILDING TRUST AMONG PARTNERS AND MITIGATING RISK AT HCL Trust constituted the essential basis of long-term partnerships especially in the A&D industry given the complexity scale and scope and duration of projects typical of the industry. As compared to its closest competitors (e.g. Infosys Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro) HCL laid greater emphasis on forging deep long-term relationships with its partners; the company did this by looking beyond individual projects and consistently participating in larger projects that provided the scope for establishing long-term engagements. Though this practice carried greater risk it also increased the chances for securing repeat business. Investments in building trust remained a continuous endeavour for vendors like HCL given the inherent apprehension among tier-one suppliers about outsourcing larger and more complex work to their outsourcing partners. The suppliersâ concerns were mainly driven by quality concerns and the increased difficulty in monitoring outsourced projects. In order to alleviate these particular concerns HCL came up with a pricing and joint investment model: the Global Risk and Reward Partnership model (GRRP). As part of this initiative HCL agreed to share the financial risk associated with a given project by developing solutions on its balance sheet without having its customers pay anything upfront. Further HCL agreed to link its rewards to the final sales of products and services thereby sharing the demand-side risk with its customers as well. For OEMs GRRP presented additional benefits over and above risk mitigation and confidence buildingâthe model enabled them to substantially reduce or even avoid the fixed and sunk costs associated with design and development. Avoiding these costs in turn allowed the OEMs to allocate their financial and managerial resources towards strengthening their core competencies. At the same time deciding what part of the development effort to outsource was not a trivial decision for the OEMs; such decisions were often a matter of extensive deliberations requiring foresight and a deep understanding of the OEMâs specific business. In such circumstances protection of intellectual property became a major concern for these companies. Unless otherwise stated the clients owned the intellectual property pertaining to any project thus commissioned; the vendors were bound by tight non-disclosure agreements. HCL was not an exception in this regard.THE GLOBAL ENGINEERING SERVICES OUTSOURCING INDUSTRYThe global engineering services outsourcing (ESO) industry was valued at approximately $1.8 billion in 2009 and was expected to grow to about $50 billion by 2020. Global engineering R&D spending grew from $980 billion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion in 2009 and was expected to reach approximately $1.4 trillion by 2020.There was a steady change in the portfolio of services and processes being outsourced: while in 2006 simpler and standardized services constituted almost 70 per cent of the portfolio of business for companies like HCL the share of such services dropped to 50 per cent in 2009. This share was expected to drop even further to 40 per cent by 2020. Specifically the commercial aviation industry witnessed a slow but steady value migration from OEMs like Boeing and Airbus to their suppliers (see Exhibit 3).In 2009 HCL was second only to Wipro but ahead of TCS and Infosys in terms of revenues. In the last quarter of 2009 HCL ERS had a turnover of approximately $121 million while Wipro achieved revenue of $163 million from its ESO business; during the same period the corresponding figures for TCS and Infosys were $76 million and $25 million respectively. Wipro and HCL dominated the ESO market with 72 per cent market share between them (Wipro: 42 per cent; HCL: 30 per cent); TCS and Infosys retained a market share of 20 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. While the ESO market grew by a compound annual growth rate of 10.7 per cent from 2007 to 2009 HCL ERS grew by approximately 14 per cent year-over-year since 2007. Though affected by the 2008 financial crisis the global ESO industry was expected to revive in the near future according to NASSCOM the trade association representing the Indian IT and business process outsourcing industries.THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRYThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner was the fastest-selling aircraft in the history of civil aviation. With a list price of $162 million per aircraft and the number of orders on book at 671 aircrafts Boeing had almost $109 billion worth of business in the pipeline in 2009. However sluggish market conditions in 2008 and 2009 saw net orders of aircraft dipping sharply from the pre-crisis level due to cancellations or deferrals (see Exhibits 4A and 4B). In addition the economic crisis resulted in a dramatic decline in industry profitability and put increased pressure on manufacturers as well as airliners to optimize costs and focus on higher-growth emerging markets (see Exhibit 5). The industry also witnessed concomitant decline in air travel during the same period though the long-term projections were positive (see Exhibit 5). Production of aircraft was relatively unaffected given the characteristically long lead times in this industry (see Exhibit 4A). Overall analysts remained positive about a quick recovery given the industryâs historical resilience against economic crises.Further labour cost as a percentage of the total operating cost of an aircraft continued to decline and fuel costs as a percentage of the same continued to increase (see Exhibit 6). At the 2008 average price level of crude oil in the international market fuel expenses represented almost 34.2 per cent of the total operating cost of a passenger airline. In comparison labour costs represented 21.5 per cent of the same. On the one hand industry profitability was highly sensitive to fuel costs and airlines tried to actively hedge against the risk of fluctuating international crude prices (see Exhibit 7). After the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 2001 crude price volatility increased manifold due to subsequent geopolitical developments. On the other hand climate change activism spearheaded by notable personalities like Al Gore continued to put significant pressure on airliners and manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprints. Partly because of this environmental pressure aircraft manufacturers began to gravitate towards cleaner and efficient propulsion technologies as well as electrification of flight control systems and actuators. Overall R&D spending by major A&D contractors was expected to rise despite a decline of 3.7 per cent in 2009. This decrement was supplemented by a sharp increase in investments in manufacturing in 2009 (see Exhibit 8). Boeing continued to make technological advancements with the Dreamliner and other next-generation aircraft as part of its ambitious âYellowstoneâ project which was aimed at replacing all Boeing commercial aircraft with technologically advanced fuel-efficient next-generation ones over time. Public investment in R&D played a crucial role in achieving technological advancement and leadership in this industry. While the Government of India planned to invest heavily in upgrading and developing infrastructure pertaining to the A&D sector public spending in R&D in science and technology continued to dwindle below 1 per cent of the national gross domestic product. Naturally this was a matter of concern for both scientists as well as industry veterans like Rao. FIRST FLIGHT INTO THE FUTUREIn the technology-intensive engineering R&D services industry change represented both opportunity and risk and there remained a high premium on preparedness and quick response. Rao and his ERS division had been tasked with navigating HCL through some difficult and important decisions. Was HCL prepared for what lay ahead? Following the Dreamliner project what should HCL ERSâs next steps be? What implications could these steps have for the long-term profitability of the firm? More specifically should HCL continue to improve upon its existing capabilities or should it venture into building stronger R&D capabilities? The answers to these questions could determine the companyâs future.EXHIBIT 1: HCL TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Montague was the managing director of the U.K. subsidiary of a parent company Molto Delizioso SRL an Italian maker of coffee machines. Molto Delizioso coffee machines carried a cachet that coffee enthusiasts in London and other major British cities were willing to pay �200 for. Molto Delizioso faced fierce competition from other coffee makers such as those produced by De�Longhi Cuisinart Philips and Fracino and Montague was concerned about the price sensitivity of consumers in the U.K. market. However while the exchange rate favoured the pound over the euro Montague was content to see his U.K. subsidiary reporting good-enough profits to the Milan headquarters of Molto Delizioso (see Exhibit 1).Montague�s contact in the Conservative (Tory) Party had assured him that the upcoming referendum on the United Kingdom�s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) or Brexit would surely result in a vote to remain. By early June 2016 however Montague�s earlier confidence had evaporated and he had become anxious. What if the Brexit vote resulted in a decision for the United Kingdom to leave and the pound were devalued? �We have to pay for the machines in euros� he told himself �but sell in the U.K. market in pounds.�The ContextMany items sold in the U.K. market such as the Molto Delizioso coffee machines were imported and paid for in euros but when these items were sold by the U.K. subsidiary the revenue earned was in pounds. Foreign subsidiaries of multinational firms often purchased products or components from their parent companies and paid for the imports in the parent�s currency but then sold the items in the subsidiaries� local currencies. Such intrafirm trade was very common. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development a multinational company was involved as either the importer or the exporter in 80 per cent of world trade. In general when costs were in one currency but revenues were in another any change in the exchange rate could affect both parties and therefore alter the profit of the operation. This situation was faced by hundreds of thousands of firms worldwide.June 2016: Brexit and Devaluation of the Pound sterlingThe June 23 2016 referendum and the decision of U.K. voters to leave the European Union precipitated a devaluation of the pound sterling. On June 24 the day after the Brexit vote the pound fell by almost 8 per cent and by July 6 it had dropped further to �1.16. That afternoon Montague received a frantic phone call from Umberto Galeazzi in Molto Delizioso�s Milan headquarters: �Nigel what are you going to do about our declining profits from your U.K. subsidiary? We need a strong answer with your plans by the beginning of the next fiscal quarter!� Dabbing his forehead Montague could offer only a weak promise to commission additional market research over the next two months and get an answer to his Italian headquarters by September 2016.After the post-Brexit devaluation of the pound one option for British importers was to leave the local selling price in pounds unchanged; however that decision would reduce profits because the import costs in pounds were going up. An alternative strategy used by many major importers was to increase prices in pounds per unit in the U.K. market to make up for the higher post-devaluation costs. This alternative strategy could be better for profits or not depending on the reaction of U.K. customers to price increases�or their price elasticity of demand. This reaction in turn depended on the intensity of competition in the market for similar products. Turning to his spreadsheets Montague saw what the numbers had looked like in happier days (see Exhibit 1). Montague�s Dilemma: Keep Price Per Coffee Machine the Same or Increase It?Montague learned from fellow members at his Argyll & Cummerbund Club who faced a similar import situation that their post-Brexit numbers ranged somewhere between sobering and horrifying. �It all depends on how the damned buyer reacts� opined Sir Colin Chelmsford who headed a U.K. company that imported German wines. �If I keep my price per bottle the same in pounds while my costs go up because the pound has been devalued against the euro my profits shrink. But if I raise my price volume will suffer.� Chelmsford then quickly added �But who knows? Raising prices may improve profits over keeping prices the same.� �In my situation� Montague interjected �there is an added complication. The pound sterling profits of my subsidiary have to then be converted back into euros and that�s the picture that Milan headquarters really cares about.� On his way home from a sombre dinner at the club Montague reviewed his options. Should he keep the price per coffee machine the same or should he increase it? �I had better commission a quick market study and get a report from a marketing consultancy� he decided.The Consultant�s Report: Two Months LaterMontague saw that he might be forced to raise prices for the coffee machines in the U.K. market. He decided to try increasing the price from the current �200 to �235 per unit. This change would be a 17.5 per cent increase�roughly the same percentage as the pound�s devaluation against the euro. �It�s not very scientific� Montague thought to himself �but at least it will show Milan headquarters that I am taking some action.� In late September 2016 the consultants at Veraccurate Research Associates (VRA) Pvt. Ltd. submitted their opinion to Montague saying �We find that your profit picture varies significantly depending on the price elasticity of your customers.� Grumbling under his breath Montague told himself he knew that already but then he replied: �All right. What does your market survey say about customers� elasticity?� The VRA consultant explained in reply:The elasticity number is only 0.8 if we assume that all importers of Continental Europe-made coffee machines will also raise their prices. But if we assume that some importers will not raise their unit price in pounds�and this may also be true of Fracino a U.K. producer despite its Italian-sounding name�then our research suggests that the elasticity number would be 1.1 for your machines.As a reminder the VRA consultant displayed on his screen the simple formula for price elasticity that had been used in recalculating the income statement:Montague and the consultant then reviewed spreadsheets showing the income statements of Molto Delizioso (U.K.) under three alternative assumptions:Keep the price the same: �200Increase the price to �235 assuming price elasticity _ = 0.8Increase the price to �235 assuming price elasticity _ = 1.1Squinting at the screen Montague anxiously awaited the results for his subsidiary�s profits under the three alternate assumptions the consultants had come up with.EXHIBIT 1: Pre-Brexit Income Statement (Annualized) Assuming �1.00 = �1.36Source: Company documents.

The company had made sound investment decisions in a growing industry but the industry was nearing saturation and a billion-dollar company had recently opened its doors in the city. Katz was feeling pressure. Fleetway had a great deal of land and building assets and the question was how to put these to better use. The board preferred to have an expansion plan operational by the summer when the company could capitalize on the surplus leisure time of students and families. Katz needed to have his proposal ready for the next board meeting in just a few days.FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT CENTRESAn FEC was a small-scale amusement facility usually marketed toward families with children or teenagers. Having multiple anchor attractions differentiated FECs from single-anchored leisure attractions such as bowling skating laser tag miniature golf or arcades. Demographic studies had revealed a direct relationship between the number of amenities offered and the happiness of consumers. Multiple attractions created an FEC’s identity and reputation leading to its appeal and popularity. FECs were known to have long wait-times during peak season but consumers did not mind because they could enjoy other activities or food and beverages while they waited. Offering food and beverages did not yield high margins but helped bring consumers through the door to play the higher-margined recreational games.The FEC businesses in Canada were small and under-developed compared to the international FEC industry. Canadian businesses would often look to the American industry for resources and direction. Not-for-profit organizations like the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions as well as the Bowling Proprietors’ Association of America hosted trade shows that offered consulting sessions half-day symposiums and networking receptions. These events helped attendees improve their efficiency marketing safety and profitability while providing them with an opportunity to stay ahead of their competitors. Active management was an important quality for any FEC especially in regions with a higher concentration of competition.The Canadian industry was highly fragmented composed of many small establishments that operated a single location and catered to a market niche of local consumers. In 2017 the largest industry operators accounted for less than 5 per cent of industry revenue. Of the more than 20000 establishments in Canada an estimated 99.2 per cent had fewer than 100 employees. However with the expanding presence of U.S.-based companies in Canada market share was expected to become more concentrated over the next five years. The number of new enterprises had increased 4.5 per cent annually due to growing demand and relatively low barriers to entry. The Canadian FEC industry saw revenues of CA$1.5 billion in 2017 and at an average rate of 4.5 per cent between 2012 and 2017 was growing faster than the gross domestic product. Continued growth of 2.3 per cent annually was projected (see Exhibit 1). Per-capita expenditure was between $10 and $17 for a typical visit where the average length of stay was two to two-and-a-half hours. Most FECs were subject to seasonality and fluctuation in revenue was dependent on weather location and product mix. Competing factors differentiating FECs were the type of facility level of technology location customer service and price offerings. Investing in innovative equipment and hiring technical expertise were key advantages to ensure customer safety and to extend the life-span of equipment. In turn this helped reduce operating costs increase profits and improve customer service and loyalty.The industry was expected to cope with many consumers being time-strapped over the next few years as per capita leisure time remained at 5.4 hours per day. Nevertheless health-conscious consumers and households who valued spending their limited leisure time with family preferred to fill their spare time with physical activities rather than watching television or participating in other sedentary activities. Furthermore the number of children under 19 and the amount of disposable household income were both expected to increase.REGULATION AND POLICYIndustry operators had difficulty developing brand awareness beyond their local community. Securing a large amount of space required to build an FEC was challenging because many Canadian municipalities allocated urban land for industrial and office use rather than for retail areas or establishments like FECs. This limited the opportunity for an FEC to expand its operations or to relocate close to large retailers such as shopping malls which would drive customer traffic. Furthermore FECs were required to comply with regulations related to the Amusement Devices Act. For example offering high-adrenaline activities such as a trampoline park or go-karts required taking steps to obtain a licence and complete a government mandated inspection. Small businesses in Ontario were facing increased rates for a few of their main expenses due to recent government legislation. Most notably in January 2018 the minimum wage increased by 22 per cent to $14 per hour and was set to rise again in 2019. Most FECs hired at minimum wage. The prices for hydro and utilities another substantial cost for FECs were also expected to increase. The government planned to institute a 2 per cent annual increase until the year 2022. Between 2022 and 2027 hydro and utilities were projected to grow 6.5 per cent annually followed by a significant 10.5 per cent increase in 2028. In 2017 rent and utilities and wages accounted for 8.9 per cent and 32.9 per cent of industry revenue respectively. To combat obesity among the general population particularly in younger individuals many provinces and territories had planned to invest in campaigns that raise awareness of health ailments related to obesity. FECs were increasingly incorporating physical activity into their offerings to attract health-conscious individuals.CUSTOMERSThe majority of FECs targeted families as their primary customers. London was the 11th-largest city in Canada and had over 100000 families up 3.5 per cent over the previous decade. However London was experiencing an increased number of households without children. The average after-tax income was $70000 for families without children and $90000 for those with children. The north and west regions of London were host to the majority of high-income earners. Families were not willing to travel more than 15 to 20 minutes per visit. In addition to proximity families valued price safety and a multitude of amenities for the whole family to enjoy. During the summer months they preferred to engage in outdoor activities and summer programs—something to keep the kids busy during their time out of school. Families were also known to choose an FEC to host their children’s birthday parties. They preferred an FEC that had party rooms and catered food and beverages. In addition where bowling was offered families with young children preferred five-pin bowling over the standard 10-pin bowling.Besides families FECs attracted young individuals recreational groups and local businesses. University and college students often visited because it was a fun date location or because it was a good way to decompress from their studies. They would grab drinks and go for a few rounds of bowling billiards or miniature golf. Typically they visited later in the evening when families had gone home. Students valued price and promotions as well as location—close to where they lived. Another type of consumer was the regular who thoroughly enjoyed a particular activity and visited weekly for recreational purposes. The most common recreational programs were bowling leagues that mainly engaged an older retired consumer who had a great deal of free time. Lastly FECs located at an upscale location hosted corporate events which made consumers out of a wide array of local businesses. Businesses looking to conduct team-building exercises or host holiday events would choose an FEC for their private rooms and amenities. They were not price-conscious but they did place a high value on service and reputation. Location was not a top priority; they valued the atmosphere as well as the food and beverage options.COMPETITORSPalasad: Thrilling Food and FunPalasad was a leading entertainment venue operator with two locations in London (see Exhibit 2) priding itself on a thrilling experience for both its guests and its employees. The founder Rob Szabo started Palasad with the conviction that bowling and billiards should be comfortable cool and accompanied by great food and drink. Szabo managed his family’s fitness club after getting a degree in economics and an MBA from Ivey at Western University (Western). Palasad opened its doors in the mid-1990s after Szabo capitalized on the closure of a rundown bowling alley in the same building as the fitness club. After a few years of success Palasad expanded to another location in south London. Palasad North was at the corner of a busy intersection a few blocks away from London’s downtown core. This location attracted many private events especially over the three-month span leading up to the holiday season. Revenues from this consumer segment represented roughly 35 per cent of the company’s total revenues. However this location was too far away from downtown to benefit from the high traffic during the summer months. In addition to competing with the nearby patios and festivals that graced London’s Richmond Row Palasad North was negatively affected by the departure of university and college students. Seasonality was not as prominent at the south location where the focus was more on families. Palasad’s upscale lounge and dining experience was the main attraction. Food and beverage accounted for over 50 per cent of revenues with the big draw coming from its wood oven cuisine. The strategy was to attract parents with the dining experience and have them bring their kids for the games. Palasad North occupied a 20000-square-foot (1800-square-metre) facility which offered 10-pin bowling (10 lanes) billiards and an arcade. Their long-standing liquor licence set them apart in the industry and their policy of no minors after 9 p.m. was attractive for millennials. The south location was a beautiful 40000-square-foot (3700-square-metre) facility that saw recent renovations worth over $1 million. In addition to the premier dining experience the location offered 10-pin bowling (20 lanes) billiards arcade games laser tag karaoke and ping pong. Palasad had maintained a high customer service standard over the years. However questions arose on how this standard would be maintained in the face of rising wages. Palasad’s emphasis on food and beverages meant it employed more workers than the industry average. The Rec Room: Canada’s Premier Eats and EntertainmentThe Rec Room (RR) would be the newest entrant in London’s family entertainment scene opening its north London location in April 30 2018. In 2016 Cineplex Entertainment Company (Cineplex) known for its movie theatres opened the first RR location in Edmonton followed by a second location in Toronto in 2017. Developing and scaling gaming-related amusement and leisure concepts including RR was one of Cineplex’s key strategic points of focus for future growth. Cineplex welcomed 75 million guests annually through its network of 164 theatres across Canada. Additionally Cineplex was a joint venture partner in SCENE which was Canada’s largest entertainment loyalty program. Membership in the program had surpassed eight million Canadians in 2017.RR was a premium FEC offering a wide range of entertainment options including simulation arcade recreational gaming and an auditorium-style live entertainment venue for watching a wide range of entertainment programming. The typical FEC activities such as bowling and billiards were complemented by exclusive experiences like virtual reality gaming axe throwing and next-generation racing simulators.The entertainment options were paired with an upscale casual dining environment featuring one of the largest wood-fired grills in Canada. The open kitchen design centre bar with a wide range of digital monitors and a large screen above the bar allowed customers to watch sporting and other major events. RR also offered exclusive use of the building and designated space for private meetings large groups luncheons team building and seminars. The premium products and services targeted families high- income earning adults or anyone looking for an alternative entertainment experience. The effect of RR’s opening on the industry and the other players in London has yet to be seen.East Park: London’s Place to PlayEstablished in 1963 East Park (EP) had grown to be one of the most popular summer destinations in London. EP was an entrenched institution and facility in the city. It was founded by a group of 10 prominent London families who had given much to the community providing jobs and contributing millions to various local not-for-profit initiatives. It was rare to have grown up in London and not to have had memories of going to EP as a child. EP’s general manager was well known within London. He was passionate about people and about his job. He received an honours bachelor degree in urban development from Western.EP was located on over 100 acres of parkland near the eastern boundaries of the city. Its combination of indoor and outdoor activities served all ages and attracted over 75000 annual visitors (in summers only). At its inception the park employed 20 people and offered just a few golfing related activities. It had since grown to employ 250 people and offered an 18-hole golf course driving range two miniature golf courses batting cages a go-kart track seven water slides a splash pad with a waterclimber a rock climbing wall bumper cars jungle gym a video arcade and two on-site indoor café and bar areas. Many recreational programs were offered over the years including Summer Junior Day Camp which ranged from golf and rock climbing to fun camps with over 700 campers each season. Other innovative programs included the East Park Corporate Challenge various team building events and most recently the East Park Amazing Race. The FactoryThe Factory was set to open its doors in London’s old east core in spring 2018. Located in the old Kellogg cereal plant that opened in 1913 the future FEC was projected to be the largest in London at 160000 square feet (15000 square metres). Dan Cassidy part-owner and prospective general manager had no previous experience in the FEC industry. He graduated from Mohawk College and had experience in supply chain management in the home improvement industry. The Factory had been under development since January 2017. Cassidy’s vision was to fill every last inch of space with endless fun catered to all ages. The FEC was expected to offer high ropes zip-lines a trampoline park an ultimate warrior course an arcade a kid’s jungle gym laser tag virtual reality escape rooms and a restaurant and lounge area with Wi-Fi. Cassidy and his financial partners believed that the London market was ready for a big recreational attraction.FLEETWAYFleetway was owned and managed by its parent company Esam Group which had its head office at the back of Fleetway’s facility. Sam Katz the co-founder was known as “the mayor of Cherryhill” having built what is known as the Cherryhill region of London on Oxford Street West (see Exhibit 2). After surviving six years in a Nazi concentration camp Katz came to Canada in 1949 and met German immigrant Ewald Bierbaum while standing in an unemployment line. In 1955 the new business partners combined their first names to form Esam Construction Ltd. Katz would eventually buy out his partner and take full control of the company. Katz was prominent and beloved among Londoners; he was named to the mayor’s first seniors’ honour list. Katz died in 2001—the father of high-rise living in London. The business had since been passed on to his two sons Howard and Harvey who earned degrees at Western in engineering and commerce respectively. Perhaps out of necessity running Fleetway had become a team effort where extended family filled up Esam’s offices to support the Katz sons who were also pastors at a local congregation of around 500 people. Esam had recently completed one of the biggest real estate deals in Canada selling off a portion of its apartment assets for over $200 million.Fleetway began in the 1960s as a bowling centre called Fleetway 40 (having 40 lanes) and since its inception had gone through many changes offering everything from rock climbing to a high ropes course. However Fleetway’s current operations included six business segments: 10-pin bowling (24 lanes) and five-pin bowling (20 lanes) billiards (14 tables) glow miniature-golf (18 holes) Fleetplay (a children’s jungle gym) arcade games and revenues from leased space to Dairy Queen and Pizza Projekt (see Exhibit 3). Fleetway also offered event rooms primarily used for children’s birthday parties (revenues from this segment were negligible). Dairy Queen had been in a lease agreement with Fleetway for 20 years and just recently teamed up with a local restaurant owner to open a new restaurant in the complex. This was Fleetway’s first venture into offering food beyond what was served at Dairy Queen. Pizza Projekt was a full-service restaurant that offered gourmet pizza using high quality ingredients. Additionally Pizza Projekt offered alcoholic beverages appetizers and fresh salads. Because of Pizza Projekt’s alcoholic beverage offerings Fleetway had licensed the whole complex for alcohol to be served at the bowling lanes and the pool tables. “Food on the floor” was a new service of which customers had yet to take full advantage. Fleetway appealed mostly to the family market (parents with children) because it was a clean safe and spacious entertainment facility. Its secondary market was students from Western and Fanshawe College and seniors who resided in the nearby apartment buildings. League bowling was popular among seniors which accounted for approximately 35 per cent of bowling revenues. The bowling industry had experienced negative growth forcing many bowling centres out of business. Fleetway had become the only bowling alley in London that offered five-pin league bowling and standard lane sizes. FLEETWAY FINANCIALSKatz wanted to make sure he had a strong understanding of Fleetway’s financial position before preparing his proposal for the board of directors (see Exhibits 4 and 5). He considered investigating the company's cash position as well as reviewing some relevant financial ratios (see Exhibit 6). Katz also wanted to evaluate the performance of Fleetway’s individual business segments (see Exhibit 7). The total revenue for all six segments was $2833274 in fiscal year (FY) 2018 (see Exhibit 8). To allocate FY 2018 expenses across the individual segments Katz needed to make a few assumptions. He thought expenses that were not easily traceable to individual business streams should be divided evenly between segments. He determined that staff wages should be allocated based on the percentage of sales each segment earned excluding the leased space. Moreover Katz thought it would be best to divide utilities and property taxes based on the measured area of each segment (see Exhibit 9). The depreciation for building computer and furnishings could also be allocated using measured area; however the remaining depreciation was attributable to each segment based on its respective assets. Finally 70 per cent of the advertising and promotion expenses would be split evenly between Fleetplay and bowling where the remaining 30 per cent was divided evenly between the arcade billiards and miniature golf.FLEETWAY’S FUTURE FOCUSAs London’s FEC industry grew crowded Fleetway’s management wanted to re-establish its identity in the market. Fleetway had three strategic options: position itself as a premium experience focus on providing the best experience for families or become all things to all people. As Katz weighed the long-term implications of such a positioning decision he wanted to evaluate the feasibility of a few different expansion options. Fleetway’s management agreed to consider the possibility of expanding the company’s service mix to offer an adventurous go-kart track state-of-the-art escape rooms or both.Go-Kart: Driving the Fun ForwardBehind Fleetway’s facility was an empty 13000-square-foot (1200 square-metre) warehouse that belonged to Esam and was available to Fleetway if Katz could convince Esam’s management that an expansion would be profitable. The closure of a few go-karting tracks left a single competitor in the market EP who was open for only half the year. Fleetway considered filling a need in the market by offering go-karting year-round rain or shine by building a go-karting arena in the warehouse. Such a transformation would require a significant investment. Katz wondered if this decision was worth all the effort and if there was room for another go-karting business in London. Fleetway considered choosing electric go-karts over gas-powered models to set itself apart. Electric go-karts were faster cleaner safer and easier to maintain.Fleetway would save $100000 by not having to build a structure for go-karting; however other significant investments were needed before business could begin. The major start-up costs included all new go-karting equipment the cost to build a track getting the warehouse up to code and building a corridor that connected the warehouse to Fleetway’s existing facility (see Exhibit 10). Furthermore $10000 was needed to cover an initial grand opening event; the cost was expected to be covered by re-allocating Fleetway’s existing advertising and promotion budget. Katz expected operating costs to include utilities insurance maintenance on the go-karts and supplies. Utilities would be a minimum of $4000 per month plus 1 per cent of the overall sales taking into account the electrical charging of the go-karts. Insurance and maintenance costs would be $2000 per month and 5 per cent of sales respectively. Supplies related to go-karting were projected to be 3 per cent of sales. Fleetway would hire a track manager at $17 per hour and a technician at $15 per hour; both would work 40 hours per week for 50 weeks per year. Three additional part-time employees would also be required and would work 20 hours per week. Part-time employees would be paid minimum wage and would require five hours of paid training before they began their job.The indoor facility would allow Fleetway to operate go-karting year-round. Daily hours of operation for go-karting would be between 12 p.m. and 10 p.m. daily. Fleetway’s pricing strategy was to charge the same amount as East Park—$8 per ride. At full capacity Fleetway expected to utilize all go-karts for each cycle. Interest in go-karting in London was relatively small and appealed mainly to thrill seekers. On average Fleetway expected to run at 13 per cent capacity for half the year and at 10 per cent capacity the other half of the year when EP was open.Katz expected the construction of the facility to be completed after two months with the licensing and government approval taking an additional one to three months. Because go-karting was different from the rest of Fleetway’s offerings Katz did not expect any cannibalization. However he wanted to be conservative in his estimates and analyze the feasibility of the venture with only half of the projected revenues being earned.Escape Rooms: A Suspenseful OpportunityAn escape room was a challenging group activity that took place inside a themed game-room. The objective was to discover clues solve puzzles and open locks that eventually led to escaping the room. Escape rooms were considered a premium form of entertainment due to their significantly higher price point which was between $25 and $30 on average. Escape rooms attracted an older and wealthier demographic while family groups accounted for just 14 per cent of total client groups (see Exhibit 11). The North American escape room industry had grown 300 per cent annually since its inception. However Katz wondered if the London market had reached saturation. The city already had five escape rooms—the majority concentrated in London’s downtown core. Still Fleetway’s management was intrigued by the idea of opening its own escape room to capitalize on a growing industry while diversifying its consumer base. Furthermore the decision would be independent from the go-karting opportunity. If Fleetway went forward with an escape room it would have to build a 7000-square-foot (650-square-metre) extension to the facility. The construction costs would average $125 per square foot ($1300 per square metre) and an additional $20000 would be needed to finish and furnish the welcome desk and lobby area. A brand new state-of-the-art facility was thought to be a potential competitive advantage; most escape rooms were not aesthetically welcoming. The design and layout of the rooms would be decided one of two ways: Fleetway would outsource it to an escape room in Toronto or they would hire a “puzzle master” to work in-house. Either option would cost about $70000 per year which covered the cost of the props and either the licensing fees or the manager’s salary. Both scenarios had their merits. Outsourcing would bring an instantaneous reputation for premium puzzles and would allow operations to commence almost immediately. The in-house option allowed for more control and the opportunity to earn money in the future from outsourcing the puzzle designs created by the puzzle master.Fleetway would need to hire a manager and four part-time employees to run the escape rooms. They would be paid the same rates as those listed in the go-karting opportunity. Annual maintenance utilities and insurance would cost $15000 $14000 and $12000 respectively. The escape rooms would be open between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays and between 12 p.m. and 11 p.m. on weekends. The weekend rate would be $28 per person up from the $25 weekday price. Like any other Fleetway activity customers would pay with cash or credit except for corporate clients who were all expected to exercise extended credit terms of net 30 days. Katz predicted that the escape rooms would operate at a capacity of between 5 and 10 per cent during the week and between 20 and 30 per cent on the weekend. Lastly 20 per cent of Fleetway’s existing advertising and promotional budget would be re-allocated to promote the escape rooms.CONCLUSIONAs Katz watched his grandson climb to the top of Fleetplay’s jungle gym he wondered what it would take to become the leading FEC in the city. Which option would help Fleetway better establish itself: offering escape rooms creating a go-kart complex or both? Fleetway had an internal target of between 20 and 25 per cent return on investment or an approximate five-year payback period. Katz did not believe it was necessary to project financial statements because Fleetway’s financials were seldom analyzed apart from the financials of the parent company Esam Group. The upcoming opening of RR and the future opening of The Factory had forced many industry incumbents to re-consider their strategy; Fleetway was no different. Katz wondered which would be better—continuing to position Fleetway as a fun-first location or operating more as a premium FEC? While Katz had a lot to consider he also wanted to maintain a faithful commitment to his congregation and grow the family legacy that his father had passed on to the next generation. He waved to his grandson as he pondered the company’s future strategy.EXHIBIT 1: INDUSTRY REVENUE GROWTHSource: “Solutions: Industry Research Reports” IBIS World: Where Knowledge Is Power accessed February 18 2018 https://www.ibisworld.ca/.EXHIBIT 2: MAP OF LONDON AND FEC LOCATIONSSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: SERVICES OFFERED BY FLEETWAYSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: STATEMENT OF EARNINGS For the Years Ending February 28 (in CA$)Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF FEBRUARY 28 (in CA$)Note: A/D = accumulated depreciation; *Accounts receivable are from bowling leagues; **Fleetplay was purchased March 1 2017 to replace the rock climbing wall; †Fleetway used accounts payable to make all purchases of supplies inventory Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 6: SELECTed Family Entertainment Centre RATIOS FOR 2018 Note: A/R = accounts receivable; A/P = accounts payable; ROA = return on assets; ROE = return on equitySource: Company files.

According to a March 2015 report sales of BYDâs Qin a new energy vehicle (NEV) reached 1932 unitsâor 32 per cent of total NEV sales in Chinaâin February of that year. The Qin had been selling extremely well since its launch: total sales in 2014 hit 14747 units or 27 per cent of Chinaâs total production of passenger NEVs and 88 per cent of plug-in hybrid passenger EVs. By January 2015 the Qin had a backlog of orders for more than 8000 units.In 2014 sales income from the Qin and BYDâs other NEVs amounted to Â¥7.328 billion (an increase of six times from the previous year) and accounted for 27.05 per cent of BYDâs total income from auto sales. In the same year BYD was ranked 15th among Chinaâs passenger vehicle companies with sales of nearly 440000 units. How could BYD succeed in jumping from number 15 to number one as Wang projected? Should BYD rebuild its brand and maintain its low-cost competitiveness in the NEV market? COMPANY BACKGROUNDBYD was founded in Shenzhen China in 1995. With borrowed registered capital of Â¥2.5 million Wang initially established the company in the battery business. On July 31 2002 BYD was listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx). The following year the company made its first move into the automotive market and on December 20 2007 its cellphone components and modules division spun off and was listed on the HKEx. In 2008 BYD expanded its business to the NEV market especially the EV segment. On June 30 2011 BYD was publicly traded as an A-shares company in the Chinese mainland.According to BYDâs 2014 annual report it had three major businesses at that time: automobiles and automotive products; cellphone components and cellphone assembly; and secondary batteries and photovoltaics with Â¥94.058 billion in total assets. In 2014 BYD pulled in Â¥58.196 billion in revenue with a net profit of Â¥434 million. Sales from its auto cellphone and battery businesses totalled Â¥27.834 billion (47.8 per cent) Â¥24.48 billion (42.06 per cent) and Â¥5.339 billion (9.17 per cent) respectively.The BatteryWang had concentrated primarily on batteries during his undergraduate and graduate education and they continued to be his main research interest after graduation. When the first generation of cellphones appeared in Shenzhen Wang became keenly aware of the huge potential demand for batteries as the devices caught on and he established BYD to capitalize on this demand.Market BackgroundSince 1990 the rechargeable battery had been adopted worldwide; however initially Japanese companies such as Sanyo and Toshiba kept a tight grip on the technology setting a high barrier for Chinese producers. Then in 1993 the Japanese government called a halt to the production of nickelâcadmium (NiCd) batteries in Japan due to environmental concerns.The termination of NiCd battery production in Japan presented a rare opportunity for Chinese battery companies. In Wangâs opinion Japanâs halting production did not signal the end of the NiCd battery worldwide; rather he believed demand would remain as strong as ever because the product was durable and economical. Any company that stepped in to take the business from the Japanese companies could become a huge success overnight but a fully automatic production line for NiCd batteries would cost tens of millions of yuan which Wang could not afford at that time.Lower Manufacturing CostsDue to cost constraints instead of replicating the Japanese system Wang created a new production mode by delving into the Japanese model step by step and dividing the manufacturing process into a semi-automatic model that combined manual operations and necessary machinery. With an investment of only Â¥1 million Wang created a NiCd battery production line with a daily output of 4000 units. The BYD facility which cost nearly 40 per cent less than its Japanese counterparts was granted ISO 9000 Certification in 1996 ISO 9001 Certification in 1998 and QS 9000 Certification in 2000. Three years after its founding BYD outdid its rivals in the global NiCd battery market taking a 40 per cent share.At the end of 1997 Wang sought to make a quick push into the lithium-ion battery (LIB) market by buying equipment from Japan. Lithium a highly active metal required a special dry environment for processing and storage. At that time a fully automatic dry production facility cost billions of dollars and the technology was controlled by Japanese firms. Visiting an equipment provider in Japan with Â¥2 million in hand Wang discovered that the least expensive set cost Â¥4.14 billion. Even worse the companyâs executives turned him down coldly stating that they would not sell any equipment to a Chinese company. Wangâs appeals to other Japanese equipment suppliers received similar rebuffs.Wang realized he would have to create a facility himself. A water-absorbent material was added to the desiccant to dry the environment and simulate a drying chamber. These alternative measures later helped to address the publicâs doubts about BYDâs technological capabilities. In 2002 as BYD pursued an initial public offering an American investor asked Wang whether BYD had plagiarized the technology. He replied âOur technology and equipment are totally different from [that of our] Japanese counterparts.â This unique production mode though created out of expediency ultimately enabled BYD to outperform other LIB producers thanks to its lower cost. In 2003 BYD became the second-largest rechargeable battery manufacturer in the world and it gained the majority share of the global LIB market in 2009.The Secret of BYDâs Low Costs: Research and DevelopmentBYDâs low manufacturing costs could be partially attributed to its research and development (R&D) on the companyâs manufacturing mode. For example the production of NiCd batteries necessitated a large amount of corrosion-resistant nickel sheets which cost Â¥140000 per ton. Nickel-plated sheets which cost only Â¥10000 per ton were prone to corrosion which impaired the batteriesâ quality. Therefore BYD changed the chemical composition of the battery to reduce corrosion on nickel-plated sheets; this change reduced the companyâs monthly expenditures for nickel from Â¥5â6 million to less than Â¥1 million.Since 1999 BYD had posted an average annual growth rate of 19 per cent in overseas patent applications. Each year the company had invested Â¥50 million in patent maintenance and offered an average award of Â¥10000 to any employee who obtained a patent. By 2003 BYD had secured a pool of 2099 effective patents making it one of the top 10 Chinese companies in terms of patent numbers (see Exhibit 1). In addition the R&D team had expanded from just over 100 employees in 2003 to 15000 in 2014.BYD AutoReverse EngineeringBYDâs patent strategy based on a commitment to patent application and protection had not only safeguarded its battery business but also strengthened its development in the automotive industry as Wang explained: âIn fact a new car is a combination of elements 60 per cent of which come from open literature 30 per cent from samples 5 per cent from raw materials and only 5 per cent from R&D.â In January 2003 BYD rushed into the auto manufacturing industry by purchasing Xiâan Tsinchuan Auto Co. Ltd. for Â¥270 million a transaction that allowed BYD to obtain the production permit needed to enter the auto industry. When BYD set out to develop its first car the F3 reverse engineering was the companyâs first choice for R&D. The contour and interior design of the F3 were similar to those of the Toyota Corolla. Yet when asked about possible patent issues with the F3 Wang answered âWe have applied alternative technology to stay clear of any possible patent problem. Although we have drawn on many non-patented technologies we have made innovations by integrating them to form new combinations.â He gave an example: the F3âs front and tail lamps were BYDâs original designs so he was confident that âpatent is not an issue.â In 2005 the F3 was launched in the market at the relatively low price of Â¥73800 (compared with Â¥150000 for the Corolla). At its release the F3âs strong similarity to the Corolla and the wide price gap between the two cars were the F3âs key selling points. Some BYD dealers in Zhengzhou Henan Province even offered to replace the carâs logo with a Toyota logo for less than an extra Â¥1000. In 2009 the F3 was the best-selling vehicle model in China and BYD reaped sales of 300000 units. In 2012 total sales of the F3 exceeded 1 million units which meant it had passed that milestone in the shortest time of any Chinese vehicle model. From then on reverse engineering was applied to almost every new BYD vehicle model: the F0 (which was based on the Toyota Aygo) the F6 (based on the Toyota Camry) and the F8 (later renamed the S8 and based on the Mercedes-Benz CLK) (see Exhibit 2). However each of these BYD vehicles was priced around half that of the comparable branded car.Vertical IntegrationThrough the use of reverse engineering BYD had not only rolled out new car models one by one but also acquired the know-how for automotive components gradually. Because BYD had set about manufacturing components on its own the company accomplished vertical integration of the whole auto industry chain. For example BYDâs 1.5-litre turbo-charged gasoline direct injection engine was based on Volkswagenâs 1.4-litre twin-charger stratified injection engine in structure and layout but BYD used an aluminum-alloy die-cast engine block for lighter weight and higher thermal efficiency.By 2012 except for a few standard components such as tires and glass BYD had been able to manufacture nearly all components partly or entirely on its own including the engines gear boxes dampers seats lamps and windshield wipers. A set of BYD F6 moulds consisted of over 1800 parts. BYD took eight months and spent between Â¥70 million and Â¥80 million to design and manufacture the moulds internally while outsourcing would have taken one to two years and cost between Â¥150 million and Â¥200 million.As with its battery manufacturing BYD applied a semi-automatic manufacturing model in its production using a combination of skilled workers and necessary machinery (the workerâmachine manufacturing model) although automatic manufacturing had moved into the mainstream in the auto industry. âWe wonât buy automatic production lines. Theyâre too expensiveâ said Wang. âWe have managed to split the manufacturing process into separate procedures which our capable workers can perform according to the programs designed by our engineers. Thatâs why we can keep our manufacturing costs so low.âBYDâs ELECTRIC VEHICLEsProduction of gasoline-fuelled vehicles turned out to be merely a springboard for BYD. Wang declared that EVs were the companyâs objective for entering the automobile industry. He believed that Chinaâs auto industry had no choice but to develop EVs. The EV MarketThree Technological Approaches to NEVsNEVs which began to be developed in 1992 fell into the categories of EVs hybrid vehicles and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Launched in 1997 the worldâs first mass-produced hybrid vehicle Toyotaâs Prius reached global cumulative sales of one million units in 2008. Also in the late 1990s General Motors launched the worldâs first mass-produced electric vehicle the EV1 but after turning out over 2000 units the company ceased production of the EV1 in 2002 because of a low cost-to-income ratio. FCVs were regarded as the toughest approach to NEVs. In 1992 Toyota began parallel R&D of hydrogen FCVs and hybrid vehicles but Toyotaâs first hydrogen FCV did not make its debut until December 2014.The EV market picked up in 2008 when Tesla Motors a U.S. automotive company launched its pure electric vehicle (PEV) the Roadster. Seeing the market gain momentum again General Motors realized that the commercialization of LIBs would grow and thus shifted its focus from FCVs to PEVs with the launch of the Chevrolet Spark EV and the Chevrolet Volt (an extended-range electric vehicle). Meanwhile BMW rolled out its i3 PEV and Volkswagen debuted its Golf PEV. Major Players in Chinaâs EV MarketThere were over 300 models of EVs in the Chinese market. Most pioneers in EV R&D were Chinese-branded manufacturers such as BYD Chery Changan and SAIC Motor. In 2014 Chinaâs NEV industry had a total of 78500 units in output and 74800 units in salesâup by 3.5 times and 3.2 times respectively from the previous year. PEV production increased by 2.4 times from 2013 to 2014 and sales by 3.2 times. For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) output and sales grew by 8.1 times and 8.8 times respectively. The growth of the market was due to the contributions of its major players (see Exhibit 3). Government PoliciesIn addition to the forward-looking strategies among automakers government support could also be credited with the rise of NEVs. The Chinese government began a push for NEVs in 2001. R&D on hybrid vehicles PEVs and FCVs was incorporated into the EV project under the 863 Program a high-tech development program funded by the government to boost basic research in certain spheres. In July 2012 the State Council issued the New Energy Automobile Industry Development Plan (2012â2020) which committed the government to facilitate the development of PEVs and the industrialization of PEVs and PHEVs. On the consumption side the Chinese government issued a subsidy policy to encourage private purchases and the use of NEVs in June 2010. For each NEV produced the manufacturer would be granted a subsidy of Â¥3000 per kilowatt-hour up to Â¥50000 per unit for PHEVs Â¥60000 per unit for PEVs and Â¥3000 per unit for energy-saving vehicles with a swept volume of 1.6 litres or less. In September 2013 the Chinese government increased subsidies for NEVs. The subsidy system remained effective until the end of 2015. In response to the central government policies five cities also granted their own subsidies and lifted the restrictions on licences for NEVs. Further PEVs PHEVs and FCVs would be exempted from the vehicle purchase tax from September 1 2014 to December 31 2017.BYDâs Approaches to ELECTRIC VEHICLESBYDâs Dual-Mode EVsIn December 2008 BYD launched its first EV the F3 Dual Mode (DM) which was based on the F3. According to BYD dual-mode EVs were vehicles that could switch between the pure electric modes and hybrid modes. BYDâs DM vehicles unlike other hybrids had high-capacity plug-in battery packs. For example when fully charged BYDâs F6DM could travel a maximum range of 430 kilometres (km) including 100 km in the electric mode and 330 km in the hybrid mode. The car was equipped with a one-litre gasoline engine and a 15-litre tank for long-distance trips when recharging was inconvenient. With such a gasoline engine the fully charged car could travel around the city for one to two days. Battery packs in other hybrid EVs such as the Toyota Prius and the Lexus LS600HL had much lower capacities because they were aimed at keeping the gasoline engine working in the most fuel-efficient manner for as long as possible rather than at powering the vehicle in electric mode for long-distance travel like BYDâs offering.BYDâs first EV was dual mode rather than pure electric because of limited auxiliary charging facilities. However in its 2014 annual report BYD reemphasized that it would continue to give priority to PHEVs that could run in electric-only mode for short trips and in hybrid mode for longer distances. Due to the inadequacy of auxiliary facilities like charging stations in the long run the company believed that PHEVs were the most suitable NEVs for China and that they would dominate the private market.Entering the Government and Company Segments FirstInstead of targeting private buyers (as was typical for gasoline-fuelled cars) BYD first promoted the F3DM to group customers like governments and businesses. It was initially sold only in Shenzhen where BYDâs headquarters were located. The carâs principal customers included organizations like the Shenzhen municipal government and China Construction Bank. BYD later confirmed that aside from the shortage of auxiliary facilities the marketing strategy for the F3DM was also based on the fact that individual consumers valued a strong user experience. If the F3DM failed to make consumersâ lives easier they would respond negatively to the car and maybe to BYD in general. Moreover the NEVs were priced twice as high as their gasoline-fuelled counterparts which might further deter individual consumers. With group customers however the user environment was standardized or easier to control. Governments or businesses could build new parking lots for NEVs or add charging poles to existing facilities while these measures were beyond the capacity of most private buyers. Furthermore BYD could provide after-sales service more easily for group customers ensuring a better user experience and a greater brand reputation for the F3DM.The company later extended its marketing strategy for the F3DM to PEVs as well. In 2011 BYD electrified buses and taxis and then spread the PEV concept to the public. Together with the China Development Bank BYD initiated a solution to electric buses and taxis in cities in 2012. With the promise of âzero payment zero cost and zero emissionsâ the project offered such financing as financial leasing operating leasing and buyerâs credit to enable public transport service providers to access EVs at no (initial) cost. For example with financial leasing a financial company could purchase BYD electric cars and lease them to a taxi company which would pay rents by installments and could assume ownership after the lease expired.However BYDâs attempt to enter other local EV markets for public transport across the country suffered from local protectionism. Because EVs were entitled to national and local government subsidies many local governments would siphon these subsidies to their local NEV manufacturers and remove any EVs produced by non-local companies from their EV catalogues. Therefore BYD would seek to become a local manufacturer by building factories in the local market to boost local growth of gross domestic product.BYD extended this marketing strategy for public transport to such overseas markets as Europe South America and Singapore. It entered the taxi market by establishing partnerships with local governments and companies. In March 2015 BYD signed a deal with Uber a U.S.-based ride-sharing service provider for trial operations of electric cars; 25 BYD EVs were subsequently put to the test in Chicago.BYDâs AdvantagesWang regarded BYDâs battery technology as the backbone of the companyâs EV development and an advantage against its competitors. He believed that the LIB was the future for EVs.  On the strength of its LIB technology BYD kicked off its EV battery program in August 2002. In November 2006 the company showcased its ferrous battery-powered concept car at the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition. In October 2007 BYD succeeded in producing rechargeable ferrous EV batteries ahead of its Chinese competitors and launched the F6DM as its first hybrid EV powered by ferrous batteries.A lithium iron phosphate battery was a patented ferrous battery; however BYD maintained that the patent simply meant that lithium iron phosphate materials could be used to make batteries and thus it filed a utility patent. In early 2010 BYD began to mass produce ferrous batteries. In October of the same year BYD and Tibet Jinhao Investment Company Ltd. jointly acquired a 22 per cent stake in Tibet Shigatse Zhabuye Lithium High-Tech Co. Ltd. for lithium mineral exploration and refinement so as to secure the supply of raw materials.BYD embarked upon R&D on EVs in 2002 developing not only batteries but also motors and electronic control units in place of combustion engines and the peripheral technology used for gasoline-fuelled cars. In 2003 BYD and Tesla set about producing EVs at the same time although BYD sought to produce EVs to meet public needs while Teslaâs position was in a much smaller high-end segment. In February 2008 Tesla integrated external resources to launch the Roadster as its first EV; in December BYD delivered the F3DM to the market. BYDâs first DM vehicle was the F6DM but the F3DM reached the market first. Among the companyâs gasoline-fuelled vehicles the F6 was positioned higher than the F3.By applying its vertical integration model to EV development BYD tried to secure the supply of both raw materials and technology in the upstream sector. Consequently BYD acquired Sino MOS Semiconductor (Ningbo) Inc. for Â¥200 million in October 2008 for the R&D and production of EV motors. The company also established a horizontal integrated chain with its strong presence in photovoltaics light-emitting diodes and energy storage stations thus making an efficient two-direction supply between NEVs energy storage stations and solar energy plants. Further BYDâs organizational culture found expression in EV manufacturing and marketing as well. The company stuck to its workerâmachine manufacturing mode and sold EVs in its dealer stores as it had with its gasoline-fuelled cars.Development and ChallengesPartnerships with Warren Buffett and Daimler AGIn September 2008 investment guru Warren Buffett announced he had acquired 10 per cent of BYDâs stock at HK$8.00 per share. Less than two years after the acquisition the price of BYDâs H-shares skyrocketed by a factor of 13.73 to HK$88.40. Since then Buffett and his partner Thomas Munger had supported BYD. In January 2009 Buffett appeared at the BYD stand at the Detroit Auto Show wearing BYDâs logo. In September 2010 when BYDâs auto sales had been declining for five consecutive months and dealers had backed out both Buffett and Munger attended the companyâs town hall meeting in Shenzhen and Buffett offered a free dinner to thousands of BYD dealers. On the first day of Buffettâs arrival in Shenzhen BYDâs H-shares rose 4.25 per cent closing at HK$57.65 and Morgan Stanley raised the companyâs stock rating from âneutralâ to âoverweight.â In addition to Warren Buffett BYDâs new energy business had attracted Daimler AG the German auto giant. In July 2010 BYD and Daimler AG founded a 50â50 joint venture with total registered capital of Â¥600 million. The new venture would focus on Chinaâs EV market and would operate on the basis of BYDâs battery and drive technology and Daimler AGâs leading whole-vehicle technology. In March 2012 the joint venture launched its NEV brand DENZA positioned as a premium brand. Since September 2014 DENZA PEVs had entered the markets in Shanghai Beijing and Shenzhen with a goal of selling 5000 units in 2015.ChallengesDespite an impressive performance in the EV market BYD found its profitability slightly disappointing. Net profit had decreased dramatically from 2010 to 2014 with 2013 being the only exception (in that year BYDâs year-on-year growth rate was 579.63 per cent) (see Exhibit 4). One reason for this exception was that the battery cellphone and regular auto businesses posted gross margin growth of 4.53 per cent 1.63 per cent and 0.07 per cent respectively in 2013; another reason lay in the government subsidies for NEVs which totalled Â¥677 million. Finally net profits in all BYDâs businesses fell to an all-time low in 2012 which made growth in 2013 even more prominent. The poor profitability raised BYDâs expectations for an explosion in market demand for NEVs.How to Maintain Cost Advantage on the Battery Side?The battery made up 40 per cent of the cost of an EV; therefore a low-cost battery could give a vehicle a significant competitive edge in the market. BYDâs ferrous battery cost less than other EV batteries in both China and Japan but paled in comparison to Teslaâs battery. Teslaâs ternary EV battery cost US$416 per kWh (Â¥2554 per kWh) while BYDâs ferrous battery cost US$435 per kWh (Â¥2671 per kWh) in 2014. Moreover Teslaâs battery cost could be expected to drop by 30 per cent once annual production reached 500000 units. When a large number of companies took interest in Teslaâs ternary EV battery in 2014 Tesla opened up all its related patents to EV manufacturers around the world. Naturally most Chinese NEV makers (including JAC Chery BAIC and Zotye) declared that they would use Teslaâs ternary battery rather than BYDâs ferrous battery further trimming Teslaâs battery costs. How to Win in the Private Vehicle Market?BYDâs Qin was a leading PHEV in the private vehicle market. With subsidies of Â¥70000 from the central and local governments the vehicleâs lowest sale price was Â¥119800. Around 70 per cent of the Qinâs sales came from Shanghai in 2014 where the Qin was among the NEVs entitled to financial subsidies and other incentives from the Shanghai government. In addition Shanghai offered the bonus of a free licence plate for NEVs. Since the vehicle licence auction policy was implemented in Shanghai in 1994 car buyers had faced increasing difficulties in affording licence plates. In July 2014 the hammer price of a licence plate in Shanghai hit Â¥74000 with a success rate of no more than 5.44 per cent. Some buyers bought the Qin simply to obtain the free licence plate but most bought the car to use as a traditional vehicle. Contrary to its popularity in Shanghai the Qin was greeted with a cold response in Beijing because it was not on Beijingâs list of NEVs eligible for government subsidies. Without those subsidies or incentives (particularly the free licence plate) how could the Qin sustain its popularity? How to Shift from DM EVs to PEVs?BYD had stated that DM PHEVs only provided a springboard for PEVs. However in shifting from DM to purely electric vehicles BYD would face considerable challenges not only in the availability of charging facilities but also in terms of battery range.

(Atrae) was at a sushi restaurant in the Shirokane district of Tokyo. With him were Toshiyuki Oka Atrae�s chief technology officer and Koichi Morita the product manager of Green Atrae�s online recruitment platform and most successful product line. Both Oka and Morita were stalwarts of Atrae who had joined the firm in the early days of its founding.It was around midnight and well past the restaurant�s closing time but the three men hardly noticed the time; they were deeply engrossed in their discussion. The topic of discussion that evening was whether or not they should take Atrae public and pursue a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Arai was keen to do so as he felt that it was a timely opportunity for the firm to raise funds and expand its Japanese operations overseas. Morita however was morose about the prospects of an initial public offering (IPO) remarking �It doesn�t make sense for Atrae to go public right now. Doing so would risk upheaving the culture that we have spent so much effort cultivating in Atrae over all these years.�Unlike many Japanese firms Atrae had an organic working culture that had developed over time. In particular Atrae had an extremely flat organizational structure; aside from a handful of senior executives the vast majority of employees had the same job title. Taking a sip of his sake Arai reflected upon Morita�s objection. On the one hand Atrae�s historical success gave Arai confidence that the company could reach even greater heights with expansion and taking Atrae public would be the effective step for this. On the other hand he was aware that pursuing a public listing meant that Atrae had to institute formal systems of corporate governance and internal control.Arai knew that Morita�s concerns were legitimate: the rigidity that such a governance structure would bring stood in stark contrast with the highly decentralized and freewheeling culture that had characterized Atrae. Arai had a strong belief that this culture had been vital for Atrae�s success thus far. He too shared Morita�s fear that instituting such strict controls might backfire and destroy the culture that he and others had worked so hard to build inadvertently doing more harm than good.Arai sighed as he weighed the pros and cons of pursuing the IPO. Doing so would clearly be risky but would the reward be worth it? As he downed the last of his sake he knew that he had to come to a decision soon.Founding AtraeArai was born in 1974 in Tokyo. Even in college he was known for being both unconventional and entrepreneurial. While most of his classmates worked part-time jobs to earn some extra spending money Arai went off the beaten path and instead chose to run a small advertising business with his friends. He recalled �My major motivation for starting my own business was to earn money efficiently. However I realized that in addition to making a profit the advertising business made both the clients and us feel happy. I liked the business very much.�In 1996 when Arai was in his third year of college at Sophia University in Tokyo he started job hunting following the tradition of new university graduates in Japan. However he soon lost interest in working for large established companies. The business people he came across always seemed to be tired unmotivated and disinterested in their work.Traditionally many Japanese firms provided employees with an assurance of lifelong employment. In Japanese this was known as Shushin Koyo (____) which literally meant �employment forever.� Japanese firms were generally reluctant to hire mid-career workers and instead focused their recruiting efforts on new university graduates exerting their efforts only in April each year to get new recruits just as they graduated from universities. Generally a fresh graduate would require around 10 years of working experience at a firm before being eligible to take on a managerial position.The typical working culture in Japan was hierarchical in structure and emphasized the importance of group consensus and seniority. This culture was embodied by the Japanese term nemawashi (___) which literally meant �laying the groundwork.� For example before a junior employee presented an idea to a group of senior executives in a large meeting nemawashi meant that the junior employee was expected to informally and individually meet each executive to appraise them of the idea before the meeting to gain consensus. To succeed in this working environment employees would have to learn to navigate these unofficial channels of negotiation and rapport to win the approval of senior employees. The process of group consensus was formalized through a system of decision-making known as ringi (__). In this system an individual with a proposal requiring a decision would circulate the proposal among peers and managers. Employees would then affix their personal seal indicating their approval of the proposal.Arai believed that the structure of the traditional large Japanese firm was a key contributor to the low levels of work engagement displayed by the business people he had encountered. He wondered if it was possible to run a business where employees would work together like members of a professional sports team. To Arai this would be an ideal working environment. Each employee would be passionate about their work and individually responsible for their role but would also work together with other like-minded talented individuals to fulfill the common objectives of the team. Above all it would be fun.Arai soon recognized that the only way to create an ideal company was to start one by himself. He focused his efforts on the human resources (HR) industry.Early AtraeArai had spent a few years working in the HR industry and came to the realization that the industry had not fully taken advantage of the growing size and power of the digital economy. He saw that the space of �HR tech� was nascent with few players. This represented an excellent opportunity for a new market entrant with the right product offering. To pursue this opportunity Arai started a new company in 2003 Ubiquitous Communications Inc. which would later be renamed as Atrae.Confident in his ability to succeed in this venture Arai began a process of iterative experimentation to find the right business model for Atrae. A product line that emerged from this process was Green an online platform for job seekers and employers in the information technology (IT) industry. The platform used a proprietary algorithm to match job-seeking software engineers to firms seeking to recruit engineering talent. Green also enabled companies who were recruiting software engineers to create a company page that potential job seekers could use to engage with the company.Green had a different business model than that of other firms operating online HR platforms such as the ones provided by Recruit Co. Ltd. and En Japan Inc. (see Exhibit 1). Those platforms primarily worked by providing clients with advertising slots that contained basic details of the clients� various job openings. The HR firms typically charged clients a fee for listing a job on the platform regardless of whether the firm ultimately hired a candidate. In contrast the Green platform went beyond advertising to provide other value-added services typically associated with traditional recruiting agent services; for example Green included tools that clients could use to manage the interview process for job candidates. Green�s revenue model was also different: it used a contingent hiring fee model charging the client a fee only if the client successfully recruited a job candidate through Green�s listing. Atrae�s service design and revenue model were based on Arai�s philosophy of prioritizing value for clients over Atrae�s short-term profits. One way in which this was manifested was through Green�s contingent hiring fee model which only generated revenue for Atrae when value was created for its client�that is when a candidate was successfully recruited. Further Atrae had a policy of refunding the hiring fee if the newly recruited candidate left the firm within a short period. In addition Atrae provided some financial support for holding welcome parties at their clients� firms for employees hired through Green.Although encouraging high workforce turnover would technically generate more business for Atrae in the short term its business model was designed to discourage high turnover and improve the quality of stable matches between clients and job seekers. Arai recognized that Atrae�s revenue model meant that monetizing Atrae would take longer and revenue losses were possible in the short run. Nonetheless Arai felt that it was necessary to demonstrate that Atrae valued integrity and sincerity to its clients above all. He believed that this was key to ensuring that Atrae was sustainable overall.Financial CrisisWith the global financial crisis of 2008 economic growth slowed globally over the subsequent years. Japan was not spared the consequences of what was dubbed the �Great Recession� and by the summer of 2009 Atrae which had been growing steadily since its founding in 2003 was feeling the full brunt of the global economic downturn. Many client companies stopped hiring which had a drastic impact on Atrae�s bottom line. Similarly the entire HR industry in Japan was severely impacted by the recession. Many HR companies suffered from lower revenue as companies reduced their recruiting efforts. By the early 2010s only a few large HR firms remained in the industry.Mid-career employees who worked at Atrae gradually left for better prospects outside the firm. By late 2009 Atrae�s workforce had shrunk from a peak of 40 employees to only 15 most of whom had started their career at Atrae. Arai knew that he had to make a change in Atrae�s strategic direction and he planned to do so with the 15 members at its core. In 2009 Arai hosted a two-day boot camp with the 15 members to restart the company. They held serious discussions for the two days about the company�s direction strategic mission and corporate culture.Through the restructuring process Arai decided that he had to change his leadership style. Previously before the financial crisis he had run Atrae with a top-down approach because he had been confident about his decisions. At Atrae he was the one who had the most experience working in the HR industry. However in hindsight he felt that if decision-making had been more decentralized at Atrae it might have been better positioned to weather the impact of the financial crisis.In particular Arai recognized that Atrae�s Internet-enabled business model was multi-faceted and highly complex. Too complex in fact for any single individual person even himself to make good decisions on every dimension of the product. Instead he realized that each of Atrae�s functions (e.g. interface design back-end technical architecture and marketing) was developed and optimized based on different principles and thus needed different teams with specific skill sets to make the best decisions for each function.Despite the impact that the Great Recession had on Atrae and the broader HR industry in Japan there was a positive aspect: the crisis created new market opportunities for Atrae (see Exhibit 2). Atrae�s recruitment fee system allowed companies to minimize their recruiting costs by paying a fee only with a successful hire. In addition Japanese technology start-ups grew rapidly after the financial crisis which increased demand for talented software engineers in the Japanese labour market. As a result the number of users (job seekers) on Green grew steadily at an average rate of 35000 new users per year. By 2014 the number of users on Green had swelled to 285000 up from the 12000 users in 2007. As Green�s user base grew so did Atrae�s revenue and profits (see Exhibit 3). Company culture: the Atrae StandardArai believed that one reason for Atrae�s rapid growth was that it built its own culture. These cultural values were summarized in what was known as the �Atrae Standard� (see Exhibit 4) which was shared with all employees. The standard comprised five core principles that were intended to guide employees� actions particularly when they faced challenging situations in the workplace. Even for small decisions such as changes in the user interface or modification of a single function in an existing product Atrae employees were encouraged to refer to the Atrae Standard and ensure that their decisions were in line. For example four of Atrae�s employees (Toshiyuki Oka Yusuke Aono Ryo Toya and Yuri Hirane) reflected upon an incident when a principle of the Atrae Standard was vital in guiding a critical decision that the four needed to make. This principle was �pursue the things you believe in� which meant that Atrae employees were encouraged to act upon their own convictions and be responsible for challenging decisions in the event of disagreements. The four had an idea for a new service that Atrae could launch. This service was a smart phone application (app) they named �yenta� which was designed to allow business people to network with each other across organizational and industrial boundaries (see Exhibit 5). The app used machine learning to generate smart recommendations. However in an initial poll among Atrae members gauging their interest and feedback on the proposal the four found that a vast majority (90 per cent) of members that they polled disapproved of their proposal. Because of this negative feedback the four were about to abandon their proposal when they remembered the principle of pursuing the things they believed in. They discussed their idea at length to develop a concept they honestly believed in even though their co-workers were not yet able to see the potential. They even developed a prototype of the service and tested it among 300 users. The test came back with overwhelming feedback which helped to convince their colleagues of the service�s value in driving potential business growth. Respecting the passion and the enthusiasm of the four the rest of the members set their minds to supporting the challenge and launching yenta as a product line.The standard not only served as a guide for Atrae�s members to make new decisions but also was helpful as they reviewed decisions made by others. In another incident Arai himself proposed a seemingly lucrative business plan of developing an online dating service. His intention was to promote a healthier online matching service fitting the culture of the younger generation but some members upon reviewing Arai�s business plan raised a concern: the service had an unfiltered board that allowed users to post opinions that could make other users feel hurt or uncomfortable. These Atrae members objected to Arai�s idea noting that his proposed service would violate the �integrity first� and �build mutual trust� principles of the standard. One member even challenged Arai asking �Would you be willing to let your children use this service?� Arai recognized that these concerns were legitimate and tried to redesign the service to allay these concerns. However even after extensive redesign and concepting he was not able to find a way to simultaneously fulfill the business objective of the new service and adhere to the spirit of the standard. Eventually he abandoned the idea. Even though Arai�s idea was not implemented he reflected positively on this episode because it showed him that Atrae members were serious about their commitment to the principles of the standard even if it meant disagreeing with the company�s founder.Distinctive systems were created to maintain Atrae�s unique corporate culture and to help members be proactive in their work. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Atrae was its extremely flat organizational structure. With the exception of the directors required by Japanese corporate law members at Atrae had no job position.Within each project team all members were viewed as equal in rank: there was no concept of superiors or subordinates among members and no promotions either. Although each team had a leader the leader�s role was to create a working environment where each member could work proactively and maximize the productivity of the team. Morita who was the team leader of the recruiting platform Green saw himself as a servant-type leader. Specifically he viewed himself as a facilitator who coordinated the work within the team and monitored the overall progress of the team but he always respected the will of each team member. In addition he regularly discussed the direction of the overall business framework with Arai on an equal footing and served as a liaison between management and business execution. This system reinforced Atrae�s culture in which all members were encouraged to express their frank opinions and where individuals would take ownership of tasks and work proactively after reaching a consensus. Other policies that were put in place to develop Atrae�s culture and encourage employee motivation included a long vacation of one month every three years an environment that enabled remote work and a workplace where employees could bring their children to work. All members were also shareholders of Atrae.In Arai�s view Atrae�s culture and business success were deeply intertwined. He felt that the culture promoted by the Atrae Standard encouraged value creation for Atrae�s job seekers and client firms and positioned the company for long-term success instead of just short-lived profits. This was reflected in how Atrae advertised its services to its clients. For example Atrae prohibited advertisements for its services that promised job seekers �you will earn more� even though such an advertisement would likely increase customer acquisition. But Arai was not willing to make what might be perceived as a promise that in good conscience could not be guaranteed and thus would contravene the �integrity first� principle of the standard. Instead Atrae�s advertisements relied on humour to gain traction (see Exhibit 6). This practice led to an increase in trust from customers and laid the foundations for building long-term customer relationships. In addition because the �integrity first� principle of the Atrae Standard encouraged members to treat other people as they would treat themselves Atrae members viewed external stakeholders (e.g. clients and business partners) as they did their fellow Atrae teammates. Face-to-face meetings and joint workshops were regularly conducted and business partners were invited to join weekly internal social events in Atrae�s offices. (In the typical Japanese working environment it was considered highly unusual to allow �outsiders� to casually enter one�s office.) The goal was to transform clients into Atrae �superfans� and achieve high business retention rates organically.In typical Japanese companies teams from different functional areas tended to work independently of each other and had an arms-length relationship with other functional teams. Atrae however was characterized by a flat and flexible decision-making structure. Members from distinct business functions such as marketing engineering interface design and customer success often collaborated in cross-functional project teams�for example in developing new product features. These cross-functional initiatives frequently occurred organically. For example one such project began when a member of the customer success team shared an idea with the web design team for improving users� experience on the platform. Other members from the marketing and sales teams also joined in the discussion because they felt that they had relevant and valuable inputs to add. These ideas were shared for all members through an internal messaging system and new initiatives were implemented by individual members at their discretion without the need to go through layers of approval in contrast with the ringi system used in other Japanese firms. Arai believed that Atrae�s culture was responsible for his employees� high levels of engagement and motivation which in turn drove Atrae�s growth. �Atrae employees are strongly proud of themselves being part of Atrae� Arai remarked. �Atrae-ism is that all employees have a sense of ownership and responsibility.� Arai felt that because everyone in Atrae was generally motivated to contribute toward the organization it was in a good position to achieve its long-term goals and to avoid the unhealthy sectionalism that tended to plague other Japanese firms. Moreover the high level of engagement contributed toward an extremely low turnover (averaging one person per year).As the company grew Arai wanted to ensure that Atrae�s unique culture was protected and preserved. One area that he paid particular attention to was the employee hiring process. Because he viewed recruitment as akin to accepting new friends into the Atrae community assessing how well a potential candidate would fit with Atrae�s culture was paramount to Arai. In Atrae�s hiring process existing members were required to participate in interviews of job candidates so they could assess the candidates� suitability for Atrae�s community. Candidates were asked questions during the interview process such as the following: Describe a challenge in your life that you�ve overcome and are proud of. What was the most difficult decision you�ve ever made and how did you arrive at that decision? And if you were the CEO of this company what would you do to address this particular issue? If Atrae members found it challenging to make a hiring decision they would take the candidate out socially to get to know them better or even invite the candidate for a one-day on-site internship to truly understand their character. Listing Atrae on the stock market As Atrae�s user base revenue and profits grew Arai started to consider the prospect of taking Atrae public. After learning more about the intricacies of pursuing a public listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from speaking to a number of senior executives and specialists in the stock market Arai summarized his perspective about a potential public listing through an analogy musing that �going for an IPO is like driving on the highway. It would allow Atrae to take a shortcut and reach our growth targets much more rapidly. However once you�re on the highway it�s not easy to get off and you�re not allowed to slow down.�Arai and his team began to weigh the specific risks and benefits of a potential IPO and its implications for Atrae�s future growth. On the positive side Atrae would be able to raise new capital for future growth and indirectly increase the prominence of Atrae�s brand. This could increase credibility with Atrae�s business partners users and even financial institutions the latter of which could help if Atrae were trying to secure new lines of credit. In addition the stronger brand could boost Atrae�s chances of recruiting talented individuals to join the company. Arai had also done his homework and confirmed that the cost of preparing for the listing could be covered by Atrae�s current assets.However as a public company Atrae would have to institute much stronger internal controls over its employees than it had been doing. For example it would have to comply with Japan�s Labour Standards Law which required companies to accurately track and manage employees� working hours and pay overtime wages appropriately. If Atrae introduced a typical management system to do this such as a timecard it could reduce the engagement and motivation of Atrae�s employees who had been accustomed to working with complete flexibility over their hours.Further if Atrae went public Arai anticipated facing pressure from investors to move away from Atrae�s famously flat structure to a more traditional hierarchical one. This would entail multiple layers of middle management and multiple vertical reporting lines. Arai was aware of the merits of the traditional structure: it would be easier for checks and balances to be put in place. Yet Atrae�s culture of open dialogue and organic cross-functional teamwork could be in jeopardy if it was forced to conform to a rigid hierarchy. Would investors balk if Atrae were to insist on keeping its flat organization? Perhaps there was a way to come to a middle ground that would make investors happy but would also maintain Atrae�s culture? Time to Decide The sushi restaurant had closed for business but the restaurant owner allowed Arai and his colleagues to stay while he went about preparing the ingredients for the next day�s service.Morita remained skeptical. �If we go public and start to manage our working hours in a rigid way we will not be able to work freely with an entrepreneurial spirit. In my view it is nonsense that employees� compensation will be determined not by their performance but by the working hours.� Morita challenged �Tell me the truth Arai: were you tempted by the money in front of you? Did you forget your ambition to create the ideal organization?� Morita also feared that even if Atrae�s listing was successful pressure from shareholders would prevent Atrae from taking risks and testing new ventures that would not generate short-term profits. Oka who had been silently listening to his colleagues finally spoke up: �I am neutral about starting to prepare the listing itself because I think that establishing internal controls would be beneficial in dealing with foreign companies in the future. However I agree with Morita that we would not be able to operate our ideal business under the pressure of new shareholders especially if we force ourselves to go public and we fail to grow as planned. To be honest if going public results in Atrae becoming a boring company I think the listing would be meaningless because we would have lost what makes Atrae unique.� Arai was taken aback by his two colleagues� staunch opposition but he remained calm. He regarded the two as more than just colleagues; they had become close friends over the many years that they had worked together since the early days of Atrae sharing both joys and sorrows. He was delighted that they had given serious thought to the future of the company and had expressed their frank opinion which was itself a testament to the success of Atrae�s open culture. However Arai was at a loss as to whether the company should start listing preparations immediately. If his two closest friends at the company had such strong objections he could only imagine how other employees might react if he commenced the listing process without their consent. In contrast to the quiet atmosphere at the late-night restaurant his mind was filled with tumultuous conflicts. He knew he had to decide soon.Exhibit 1: Green Platform business MODEL VersuS OTHER PLAYERSNote: JPY = � = Japanese yen; JPY 104.85 = USD 1.00 on January 2 2014.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Number of companies established in Japan and Percentage Change (2009�2014)Note: No. = Number.Source: Compiled by the case authors with data from Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd. �Trends of New Corporations Nationwide Over the Last 5 Years (2009�2013)� [in Japanese] press release September 8 2014 accessed April 1 2021 www.tsr-net.co.jp/news/analysis/20140908_13.html; and Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd. �2019 National New Corporation Trends Survey� [in Japanese] press release May 29 2020 accessed April 1 2021 www.tsr-net.co.jp/news/analysis/20200529_02.html.Exhibit 3: Atrae Inc.

The weather fit the sentiments of Federica Santos country head of PharmaCorp Ukraine a global pharmaceutical company’s local unit in Ukraine. “Sales down by 40 per cent and 25 per cent loss of market share. . . . that is the worst performance ever” Santos sighed while scanning the latest figures of her firm. “When will the war stop?” Santos was suddenly interrupted by her phone ringing. It was the Ukrainian Secretary of State for Health telling her that it would not renew PharmaCorp Ukraine’s licence to participate in public tenders. “That’s really bad news” she thought. “Being excluded from public tenders will cause a 10 per cent slump in sales.”After all Santos had experienced during the past few months in crisis-ridden Ukraine this kind of message no longer surprised her. She had always known it would be a tough task to steer PharmaCorp Ukraine through the ongoing political and economic crises. Still she felt stuck and frustrated. So far she had not found a way to avoid further damages and boost sales. Now with the annual meeting with the regional headquarters (RHQ) fast approaching she was under even more pressure. During this meeting at the end of January Santos would need to present her ideas for strategic moves to revive sales at PharmaCorp Ukraine.PharmaCorpPharmaCorp was incorporated in 1896 and had its corporate headquarters (CHQ) in Munich Germany. In 2014 it employed about 54000 people worldwide and generated €20 billion in sales. Its portfolio covered more than 40 drugs in human- animal- and bio-pharmaceuticals.As one of the leading global pharmaceutical companies PharmaCorp ranked second in 2014 in terms of the percentage of its total revenue spent on research and development (R&D). It conducted R&D in Germany Austria France Japan and the United States had production in more than 11 countries and operations in more than 150 countries.In 1991 PharmaCorp started its operations in Ukraine and since then had been a premium brand recognized in the market for its high-quality drugs. Owing to the economic development of Ukraine and Ukrainian patients’ demand patterns PharmaCorp’s product portfolio was relatively small in Ukraine and contained mainly long-established well-proven drugs.PharmaCorp Ukraine was founded as an operating unit (see Exhibit 1) which meant that the office in Ukraine was an extension of PharmaCorp’s RHQ in Milan Italy and conducted local sales activities in comparison with a full-fledged subsidiary that was relatively independent. The RHQ issued all documents (e.g. working contracts legal documents and invoices) and was liable for the PharmaCorp transactions in Ukraine. PharmaCorp Ukraine was responsible for local operational tasks whereas most of the tasks related to strategic decision-making were located at the RHQ to which PharmaCorp Ukraine reported.The RHQ was responsible for 30 affiliates in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries as well as five Central Asian countries. In its intermediary position between the CHQ in Germany and the 35 affiliates the RHQ had a bridging function: It reported to the corporate CHQ in Germany and communicated the targets set by the CHQ to its own regional affiliates. In doing so the RHQ aligned the corporate strategy with the regional strategy and acted on regional opportunities. It also undertook intra-regional coordination and control activities. Intense co-operation between the RHQ and the Ukrainian operating unit was encouraged after the onset of the Ukrainian crisis in late 2013 which was marked by riots and the escalation of protests in Kiev (known as “Maidan”) and the Crimean crisis in early 2014 (followed by war in parts of Eastern Ukraine). The crisis pushed both the RHQ and the operating unit in Ukraine beyond their usual work practices and patterns.A New Manager ArrivesAs of August 1 2014 Barbara Haas the head of the RHQ in Milan faced major challenges in Ukraine which led her to assign a new country head for the operations in Ukraine. Haas felt that Federica Santos was the right person for the job. Even though she was fluent in neither Ukrainian nor Russian Santos had proven her ability to handle difficult markets. For example Santos had started working for the RHQ after graduation and soon after was given the chance to establish PharmaCorp’s subsidiary in Croatia after the war in the 1990s. Later she assumed responsibility for the whole Balkan region. When Haas offered Santos the chance to head the Ukrainian unit Santos enthusiastically agreed.Briefing by the RHQ“We entered the Ukrainian market in 1991 and we always made profits” said Haas as she briefed Santos on the situation in Ukraine. The local unit’s function was to manage marketing and sales activities. “And we always encourage our units to come up with initiatives. The RHQ might support them financially as well as with experience gained in other markets.” Santos knew the autonomy of the local units was restricted meaning that constant communication with the RHQ was necessary.So far Ukrainian health-care professionals and patients had appreciated PharmaCorp’s high-quality drugs. Therefore although PharmaCorp faced severe competition in Ukraine it had steadily gained market share. In fact the unit managed to outperform other PharmaCorp units in the CEE region in terms of sales and profitability. Even in 2008 when the economic downturn had severely hit businesses in Ukraine PharmaCorp managed to meet its internal targets.This time however the crisis was different. PharmaCorp Ukraine was going through the most difficult time since its establishment: All of a sudden the company was in the red. Furthermore PharmaCorp Ukraine’s responsibility for Crimea (a local region with a population of approximately 2.3 million) had been shifted to the Russian subsidiary and due to war some regions in Eastern Ukraine were cut off from supply. “We are losing ground in Ukraine” Haas emphasized. “Our performance in the market is devastating. And it is highly irritating that most of our global peers in the Ukraine are suffering from a slump in sales of only 10 to 15 per cent. Imagine some local competitors have even increased their sales.”Haas also informed Santos that PharmaCorp Ukraine’s local management team had recently made a request for an adjustment to the internal targets for Ukraine and for more local decision-making autonomy. However the RHQ did not see any need to change the internal targets (see Exhibit 2) which were identical across all RHQ affiliates. The RHQ was convinced that Ukraine would again be an attractive market once the crisis was over. RHQ did not expect profitability to continue to decrease in the medium and long run and it predicted that sales would soon return to their pre-crisis levels (referring to the growth rate of the gross domestic product: 5.2 per cent in 2011 and –6.8 per cent in 2014; see Exhibit 3).Santos was well acquainted with PharmaCorp’s procedures and standardized processes. She was also aware of the multinational corporation’s preference to act in accordance with the global strategy in order to maintain the established global reputation. Legal or any other issues in one single market could quickly spill over and cause damage to PharmaCorp as a whole. She also knew that at the very same moment other PharmaCorp operations were also struggling with major challenges resulting from unstable environments economic or political crises and turbulences.First Impressions: Assessing PharmaCorp Ukraine’s SituationOn September 21 2014 as Santos entered the modern building where PharmaCorp Ukraine had its offices someone called across the entrance hall “Wow—now the currency is up to 16.5.” (This value referred to the exchange rate between the euro and the Ukraine hryvnia (₴)). The atmosphere in the building was extremely chaotic and it took Santos a while to make her way to the elevators. She squeezed into one of them and learned that international exchange markets had started to fluctuate wildly after that day’s morning break in the ceasefire in Luhansk. Although she was aware of those turbulences when she exited the elevator Santos was stunned to hear that the exchange rate had risen to €17.4 per hryvnia up from 15.8 when they had started from the ground floor. She immediately started to check her smartphone for updates.During the past 30 minutes Santos’s inbox had been flooded with messages about the latest happenings in Ukraine—and at PharmaCorp Ukraine. While scanning the subject lines she read: “Massive bombings again” “Two distributors vanished in Eastern Ukraine” “Head of the Law Department resigned” “Inflation up at 15 per cent” “Today’s price of Silovma ₴295 (+ 50 per cent of last week’s level)” and “New health minister assigned.” Santos was overwhelmed by this news and eager to learn about the sentiments of her local management team in its first meeting.Unfortunately this meeting turned out to be chaotic: Everybody was talking at the same time providing different opinions and solutions to the topics Santos had addressed while constantly checking their phones for messages or answering calls. It dawned on Santos that finding a solution to PharmaCorp’s struggles amid the turmoil in Ukraine was now only a remote possibility.During her first weeks in Kiev Santos had met with numerous people from employees to business partners to get an idea of all the problems the crisis had brought about.Since the onset of the crisis health-care professionals including doctors heads of the medical centres and pharmacists had decreased the amount of PharmaCorp drugs being prescribed. In a meeting with the product manager Santos was toldOur best seller Silovma accounts for 20 per cent of total sales and was available for ₴100 before the crisis. Now purchasing power has dropped dramatically and Silovma has become a kind of luxury drug. Depending on the currency rate the price was between ₴180 and 250. One pharmacist stressed this in an amusing way talking about “Coco Silovma.” Salespeople were concerned about the future of their jobs. Those working in Eastern Ukraine were afraid of being attacked because of pro-Russians’ hatred for people who had Kiev licence plates on their cars. These fears were aggravated after some distributors of PharmaCorp’s drugs in the Eastern region of Ukraine had disappeared without a trace.During her first week in Kiev Santos had an odd experience. She went to a pharmacy to buy a pack of vitamin pills and was surprised when she was asked “How many blisters do you need?” Answering that she wanted to buy a full pack the pharmacist explained that pharmacies had started to sell single blisters on their own initiative in an effort to accommodate local demands.Santos also learned that the sharp devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the euro (see Exhibit 4) had led to severe consequences for PharmaCorp Ukraine which imported its products from the RHQ in prices that were denominated in the euro. The devaluation of the hryvnia combined with increasing inflation had led to decreases in local consumers’ purchasing power which made it more difficult for them to afford PharmaCorp’s drugs. The situation had been further aggravated because of rising unemployment more careful spending behaviours and a new value-added tax of 7 per cent on drugs. In addition PharmaCorp Ukraine incurred a duty of 5 per cent on import. In sum it was not only patients who were struggling to afford to pay for drugs; wholesalers were also struggling to pay.One wholesaler stated “I can’t afford to transfer money to you unless I have collected money from my customers the pharmacists.” Santos also heard that banks did not concede liquidity to their clients and granted loans only rarely. In response some firms had started to modify their terms of payment in favour of wholesalers for example by extending dates of payment. If Santos wanted to change the terms she would need the RHQ’s agreement.Santos was bothered by some additional issues including corruption and laws and regulations that continually changed. Since the political situation had been unstable several different people had held—and subsequently been removed from—the very same public office at short intervals. Public offices were characterized by a generally high fluctuation. For example between November 2013 and September 2014 three different people had held the position of health minister. Each one had a different idea about how to organize the health-care system and therefore each one had initiated new rules concerning manufacturing standards price regulations and registrations drug authorization advertising restrictions and much more. To counter these issues the local unit of PharmaCorp introduced some minor initiatives. To revitalize operations for example it granted more and higher discounts. Yet profits continued to fall.One sales manager who had been with PharmaCorp Ukraine for more than 10 years expressed her concerns about the structure of the global organization which hampered local decision-making. The operating unit in Ukraine lacked flexibility and autonomy. Only recently she had to talk to several people in Milan Italy just to get approval for granting a higher discount to a long-time customer. Furthermore she had to wait for two weeks to get a signature from the RHQ so she could hire new drug distributors.Santos also worried about her unit’s expenditures. For example she had learned that the rent for PharmaCorp’s office space in Kiev accounted for a high share of total fixed costs; she also discovered that the operating unit’s number of employees was relatively high compared with its profits and that spending on internal training was much higher than the RHQ average. She was particularly surprised about the high number of internal training sessions. Santos understood that the daily workload of her employees had risen due to the crisis so she asked herself “Why additionally strain them with internal training sessions?”What was Next?Facing the upcoming annual meeting with the RHQ at the end the month Santos needed to develop ideas for further strategic moves. She therefore found herself in a tight position: She needed to find an approach that responded to local challenges while also conforming with PharmaCorp’s global strategy. Identifying such an approach was tricky in itself. Yet Santos and her employees were continuously busy responding to local events encouraging short-term thinking rather than focusing on the development of medium- or long-term solutions. She had thought of some solutions already but she had thus far not deliberated all their pros and cons. One of the first major decisions Santos needed to make was whether PharmaCorp Ukraine should stay in the market or because the situation in Ukraine had worsened recently she should recommend to the RHQ that the organization exit the market.EXHIBIT 1: FLOW OF PRODUCTS AND PAYMENTS BETWEEN PHARMACORP HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS AND WHOLESALERSNote: RHQ = regional headquarters; R&D = research and development; EUR = euro; UAH = Ukrainian hryvniaSource: Created by the authors.

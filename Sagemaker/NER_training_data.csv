CP had built the country’s first transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Its board of directors was the target of a proxy battle for control of the firm initiated by Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. (Pershing Square) in March 2012. Both CP and Pershing Square had made presentations to proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Proxy advisors provided voting recommendations to clients such as private funds and institutional investors. As part of their analysis the proxy advisors received information from management and from the dissident shareholder Pershing Square. Due to the lack of voting direction by management and CP’s high level of institutional ownership Smith believed that the recommendations of proxy advisors would be key in the proxy contest but she also needed to perform her own analysis of the intrinsic value of CP shares under the scenario of the status quo with CP’s current management and strategy in place versus a potential shakeup as suggested by Pershing Square.One statement in Pershing Square’s dissident presentation which had been sent out on January 24 2012 stood out for Smith: “Canadian Pacific is 70 per cent the size of Canadian National yet has an enterprise value 40 per cent as large due to its inferior profitability and asset utilization.”Class I North American RailroadsRailroad companies were ranked by revenues with Class I railroads being the biggest and Class III railroads the smallest. In the United States a Class I railroad had at least US$250 million in sales; in Canada a Class I railroad had at least CA$250 million in sales. The United States and Canada had six Class I railroads: Union Pacific CSX Norfolk Southern Canadian National Railway (CN) CP and Kansas City Southern (plus BNSF a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway). Rail was an integral part of the transportation network in North America for goods grains and commodities. For example more than two-thirds of U.S. coal was carried by rail. Rail was typically used as part of intermodal operations facilitated by the use of standardized containers that could be moved from trucks to rail to ships. The single most important measure of profitability in the railroad industry was the operating ratio defined as the firm’s operating expenses as a percentage of its total revenues. A lower operating ratio was desirable and firms targeted operating ratios below 80 with a figure in the mid-70s being more desirable. Components of these operating expenses included major categories such as labour materials fuel and depreciation. Of operating expenses labour could account for more than a third and fuel could account for a fifth.Operating ratios at these six major railroads had improved as non-core infrastructure was divested investments were made in more efficient equipment and new operating procedures were adopted. For example CN’s operating ratio declined to 63.6 per cent in 2010 from 97.1 per cent in 1992. Over the same period CP’s operating ratio dropped to 77.6 per cent from 95.9 per cent (see Exhibit 1). Canadian Pacific RailwayThe Canadian Pacific Railway was incorporated on February 16 1881 with the intent of building a transcontinental railway in Canada. As a condition of joining Canada’s confederation in 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were promised rail links with Quebec and Ontario. But government mismanagement resulted in little progress on the project until a group of businessmen founded CP. A century later in 1986 CP was the nation’s second-largest firm with $15 billion in revenues and had become a conglomerate with subsidiaries in energy commodities hotels and ships. With the goal of unlocking shareholder value Canadian Pacific’s parent company spun out its five subsidiaries—CP Pan Canadian Energy Fording Coal CP (later Fairmont) Hotels and CP Ships—into separate companies on October 3 2001. CP had a 14700-mile (23657-kilometre) network of railroads and intermodal transportation links from the Port of Vancouver in Canada’s West to the Port of Montreal in Canada’s East and to the U.S. industrial centres of Chicago Newark Philadelphia Washington New York City and Buffalo. This network transported bulk commodities merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. In 2011 CP’s strategic goal was to “become the safest most fluid railway in North America” focusing on five areas: service safety productivity and efficiency people and growth.CP’s board included members of the country’s business elite. For example John Cleghorn was the former chairman and chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada the country’s largest financial services company. Frederic J. Green had been the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) since 2006 (see Exhibit 2).CP faced a challenging first six months in 2011 as a result of disruptions to its operations due to severe winter weather and flooding. These delays limited the speed at which its trains could travel and productivity had suffered. The firm worked in the second half of 2011 to restore service and its reputation for customer focus. Management stated:Despite these challenges we were able to complete our planned capital program in 2011. Our continued work on building new sidings and extending our current ones to support our long-train strategy paid dividends; CP set a new full-year record in train weights in 2011. In addition we set full year records in both terminal dwell and car miles per car day as a result of implementing our First Mile-Last Mile program in Canada. We expect further improvements as we continue to tighten standards in Canada and roll out the program in the U.S. We completed the second phase of our Locomotive Reliability Centre strategy which will reduce the number of major locomotive repair facilities from eight to four highly efficient super shops with improved repair capabilities. These improved efficiencies will allow us to do more with less and to reduce our asset pools and associated costs.CP has signed several commercial agreements with customers terminal operators and ports that will drive improvements in supply chain performance. In early 2012 we announced a new five-year agreement with Canadian Tire and a ten-year agreement with Canpotex. In addition CP has worked with its customers leveraging technology to enhance car request management and implementing new productivity tools. Our scheduled grain program has been successfully implemented in Canada and the U.S. program will be implemented by August 2012. We are also developing new volumes of Powder River Basin coal for export off the west coast of British Columbia.In 2011 CP’s accomplishments includedManaging overall indebtedness by repaying US$246 million of maturing 2011 debt and by calling US$101 million of 2013 debt; Making a $600 million voluntary prepayment to its main Canadian defined benefit pension plan; andDelivering consistent dividend growth by increasing its quarterly dividend to common shareholders by 11 per cent from $0.27 to $0.30 in 2011.CP announced a goal of bringing its operating ratio down to the range of 70–72 per cent for 2014 and continued improvement beyond 2014. It aimed to reduce the operating ratio to the range of 68.5–70.5 per cent by 2016. According to CP’s position much of the difference in operating ratios compared with other railroads was due to external factors such as legacy pension costs; tighter curves and steeper grades that required slower speeds and more locomotives respectively; and greater competition along its routes.Between April and September 2011 the trading price of CP’s common shares declined from approximately $63 per share to a low in late September of just below $49 per share. CP’s stock price performance for the 10-year period 2002 to 2012 was roughly similar to a Toronto Stock Exchange index but fared much lower than CN’s performance (see Exhibit 3). Pershing Square Capital ManagementWith a corporate partner Leucadia National William Ackman founded Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing Square) a hedge fund in 2004 with US$54 million of his own capital. Pershing Square was known for taking large positions in targeted firms and being actively engaged in their management. Recent activist campaigns included Target Corp. Canadian Tire Wendy’s (forcing the company to spin-off Tim Hortons) and most recently J.C. Penney. Ackman’s track record included successes and failures. After a months-long debate between Target Corp.’s management and Ackman shareholders voted down Ackman’s effort to gain board representation at their annual meeting in Waukesha Wisconsin. In a preliminary tally of voting more than 70 per cent voted in favour of the company’s proposed slate of directors and the same margin voted to keep the size of the board the same. Target Corp. had urged its shareholders to vote in favour of a proposal to set the size of the board at 12 and to vote for the company’s nominees.In a regulatory filing released October 28 2011 Pershing Square indicated it owned an aggregate 20.7 million common shares (which included 2.65 million common shares underlying a call option) representing 12.2 per cent of CP’s outstanding common shares. The firm had begun buying CP shares in September 2011 investing $1.1 billion in total for an average price of $54.46 per common share. Pershing Square’s intent according to the filing was to discuss with CP’s management its board and other shareholders ways in which the business could be improved.Ackman’s chief recommendation was to install Hunter Harrison as CP’s new CEO. With an established track record as CN’s chief operating officer and then its CEO Harrison had a reputation for improving CN’s productivity and profits. He had reduced staff levels and introduced the concept of precision railroading which involved putting operations on a strict schedule. His drive for efficiencies had even led to the implementation of penalties for customers who did not load or unload their freight on time. The Role of BoardsA board of directors was generally accepted as being necessary to manage the agency relationship created by the separation of ownership and management and was a legal requirement for incorporation. A board was ultimately responsible to the shareholders for all aspects of the corporation but would delegate most of the operating responsibility to professional management. Thus in any firm a board had specific responsibility for hiring performance evaluation compensation and succession of the CEO. A board might also choose to require management to obtain the board’s specific approval before proceeding with certain types of initiatives such as strategic changes major financial commitments and significant acquisitions. In those areas management was responsible for initiating proposals and implementing board-approved decisions; the board of directors was responsible for choice among and/or ratification of management recommendations and monitoring their implementation by management. From a corporate governance perspective boards were being encouraged to re-evaluate the meaning of the phrase in the Canadian Business Corporations Act (see Item 122 (1) (a) page 88) “act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation.” One perspective was that it meant in the best interests of the shareholders commonly known as the shareholder primacy norm. A second perspective was that it meant in the best interest of all stakeholders which was known as the plurality perspective. This view included shareholders debtors communities provincial and federal governments the environment customers suppliers employees managers members of boards and other stakeholders. A third perspective was that the corporation was viewed as a legal entity in and of itself and that the phrase literally meant in the best interests of the corporation as a legal entity. According to this perspective boards could make decisions that would sustain the corporation and be to the detriment of all other stakeholders including shareholders and debtors.The TimelineIn late September 2011 funds controlled by Pershing Square began acquiring common shares of CP at prices of approximately $50 a share approximating the two-year low in CP’s trading price. By October 18 2011 Pershing Square had acquired more than 5 per cent of the outstanding CP shares prompting an obligation to file a Schedule 13D report with the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States where its stock was listed for trading. By the time that report was filed on October 28 2011 Pershing Square’s interest exceeded 10 per cent resulting in an obligation to file an early warning report with securities regulators in Canada where its stocks were also listed for trading which ultimately was filed five days later. Pershing Square disclosed in those reports its belief that CP’s shares were undervalued and that it was engaging in discussions with management the board and other shareholders regarding CP. Subsequent negotiations between CP’s board and Pershing Square broke down and by early January 2012 the two sides were entrenched in their positions and the public was aware that a proxy battle was imminent. CP’s board decided to address its investors and the public by publishing an Open Letter to Pershing Square on January 3 2012. In it CP’s board aimed to correct what it felt were inaccurate comments by Pershing Square and reiterated CP’s invitation for Ackman to join its board subject to a few restrictions. Ackman’s response provided in an Open Letter to CP on January 9 2012 indicated that Pershing Square felt its media statements were accurate. He went on to assert that Pershing Square intended to transform CP’s culture and operations with the goal of turning it into one of the best railroads in North America. Ackman also defended his decision to put forth Harrison as CP’s new leader. Pershing Square’s nominees for the board included three independent Canadian business leaders (see Exhibit 4).Pershing Square sent a requisition for a shareholder meeting to CP on January 23 2012 but when CP later that same day announced that its annual meeting would be held on May 17 2012 Pershing Square withdrew its requisition. Pershing Square filed a dissident information circular on January 24 2012 and began holding public investor meetings to build support. CP filed its proxy circular on March 22 2012 and began holding its own public investor meetings. Various proxy battles followed intended to gather enough shareholder votes to win corporate votes (see Appendix 1).Smith Gathers Information for her ReviewSmith supplemented her analysis with an overview of current economic conditions. She noted that the Government of Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond had a yield of 1.79 per cent at the end of April 2012. In Canada real gross domestic product was expected to achieve annual growth of 2 per cent in 2012 and then increase to an average annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent between 2013 and 2016. Canadian exporters were forecast to be negatively affected by a slowdown in the Euro zone and China and the Canadian dollar was expected to be at or around parity to the U.S. dollar until 2016. In the United States the economy was in the midst of a broad-based recovery with the unemployment rate trending downward. The United States was expected to grow at a slightly faster pace—2.3 per cent per year from 2013 to 2016 (see Exhibit 5) as real private consumption rose and as exports grew especially to emerging markets.What Smith read about Ackman’s public statements seemed to provide reassurance that he did not want to take over the entire board:Pershing Square—What a vote for the Nominees for Management Change (NMC) does NOT mean: Not a change of control; NMC will be five of 13 or 15 directors. Pershing Square would have two of 13 or 15 Board seats (proportionate to ownership). The entire refreshed Board will make the CEO hiring decision.In contrast she sensed frustration on Green’s part when he stated that bringing Harrison’s management methods was counter to the culture he was trying to build at the firm. Green stated:You can work your way across the breadth of stakeholders whether it’s communities governments customers or shareholders people see the risk attached to this proposal. The venom that exists in the shipper community towards the dismissive attitude that Mr. Harrison brought to the marketplace is what it is.CP’s income statements balance sheets and cash flow statements provided Smith with a great amount of financial information (see Exhibits 5 6 and 7 respectively). Smith also read that some believed it would be difficult for Harrison to transfer his methods from CN to CP. First CP’s railroads traversed tougher terrain in contrast to the easier routes taken by CN. Second CP had higher labour costs and was in discussions with its union to improve productivity including implementing a 12-hour workday and new rules on vacations. The Teamsters union represented 4800 CP conductors engineers and rail traffic controllers. To show his interest in the top job Harrison had purchased $5 million worth of CP shares earlier in 2011.Ackman believed that despite the differences between CN and CP the latter could be more profitable arguing that under Harrison’s leadership it could achieve an operating ratio of 65 per cent by 2015. Green countered insisting that an adversarial attitude would be unproductive as 80 per cent of its business was subject to direct competition. The Oliver Wyman Group an independent consultant hired by CP to gauge the feasibility of both plans concluded that Harrison’s target was “not possible” whereas CP’s was both “reasonable and achievable” and also took into consideration the steeper grades and greater curvature of CP’s network which the consultant estimated that it would add about 6.7 per cent to its operating ratio. “Curves and grades [are] physics and the dismissive comments by Harrison indicate a clear lack of research or understanding or both” Green said.Smith Estimates CP’s ValueSmith at GBR Capital wanted to value CP’s shares based on the status quo and current management versus Hunter Harrison as CEO implementing a cost-cutting program (for simplicity as of December 31 2011). In doing this valuation Smith needed to develop two sets of projected cash flows and review information on comparable railroads. She created a set of estimates that included the status quo and a more optimistic forecast that assumed Harrison would become CEO and implement a new strategy. The status quo forecast—from 2012 to 2016—would have revenues at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rising 4 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 80 per cent and decrease to 76 per cent by 2016. Depreciation would start at $600 million and capital expenditures at $1.1 billion. Both figures would rise by $25 million each year. The more optimistic forecast included revenue projections that also started at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rose by 5 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 76 per cent and decrease to 68 per cent by 2016. Her estimate of depreciation expenses would not change. She estimated capital expenditures in 2012 at $1 billion rising by $25 million a year reflecting the conjecture that Harrison would be focused on cutting costs and investing capital more efficiently. Smith gathered comparative information on competitive firms (see Exhibit 9). She contemplated how best to use this information to estimate intrinsic values under the two scenarios.Smith planned to estimate intrinsic values using a discounted cash flow approach as well as relative valuations. She assumed a tax rate of 25 per cent. She planned to use the capital asset pricing model to estimate the cost of equity using a risk-free rate of 1.79 per cent a beta of 1.3 and an expected market risk premium of 5.0 per cent. CP’s before-tax cost of debt was 6 per cent. Smith ignored any changes in working capital which she assumed would not be material. Under both scenarios Smith assumed a growth of free cash flows beyond the next five years at 2 per cent. She also pondered what kind of return equity investors might garner over a five-year horizon under the two scenarios assuming Pershing Square’s average acquisition price.In the short term Smith faced the proxy vote decision. She needed to send in GBR Capital’s votes on behalf of her fund. While her main aim was to make a decision that would maximize value for GBR Capital’s investors Smith also questioned the extent to which her decision should factor in CP’s corporate governance issues.Exhibit 1: CaNadian pacific AND Canadian national railway financial performance and OPERATING RATIOS 2007–2011 (in CA$ millions)Source: Canadian Pacific 2007 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2007/AR2007.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2008 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2008/AR2008.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2009 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2009/AR2009.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2010 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2010/AR2010.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2011 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2011/AR2011.pdf; Canadian National Railway Company 2007 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2007-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2008 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2008-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2009 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2009-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2010 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2010-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2011 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2011-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den.Exhibit 2: Frederic J.

Chris Janssen had been in Kenya for three months conducting research on the Kenyan agricultural market. Before returning to Canada to check on his first start-up he sat down at a Nairobi coffee shop to do a final assessment of all the data he had collected. Janssen had taken three unique approaches to learning more about Kenyan farmers: primary interviews a survey and his own attempt at chicken farming. He was pretty sure he knew what his new venture would offer the market but he wanted to review the data one more time. As he sipped on some coffee grown just outside of Nairobi and ate a chapati Janssen decided to use design thinking principles to synthesize the data and solidify the value proposition of his new undertaking.PRIMARY INTERVIEWSDuring the trip Janssen connected with people at all stages of the supply chain. Finding information was easy: Kenya had a strong culture of communal support. Janssen�s findings provided deeper insights into the macrodata he had previously reviewed. Some of Janssen�s key learnings pertained to the following.PopulationJanssen learned that a culture of land inheritance meant that farms remained small and therefore could not reap the benefits of scale (see Exhibit TN-1). As one farmer told Janssen �I have already split half my land among four of my children and the other half will go to the next four when they come of age.�Climate ChangeThe farmers also told Janssen about their experiences with the changing climate. To them it now seemed like every season was different from what they were used to. This made it difficult to effectively plan what to grow and it led to many farmers losing their crops to drought or torrential rain. The farmers Janssen met did not have the educational resources to find the technologies that would mitigate climate risk. Talking to one chicken farmer he was told A flood last fall destroyed much of our communities� grain supply so the cost to feed my chickens has been high eliminating my profits! Some of my neighbours have begun feeding their chickens household food waste. For some this killed their chickens and for others it worked so I do not know if this is a good option!Market AccessJanssen spoke with farmers whose only means of selling outside their town was via a broker who visited seasonally with a non-negotiable price. While some of the coffee farmers Janssen met participated in co-operatives to improve their bargaining power he did not find similar arrangements between produce and livestock farmers. Janssen thought that there might be an opportunity to improve co-operation between these farmers similar to what had occurred in the coffee market. Some of the young start-up farmers that Janssen connected with in cities told him how they had mastered taking care of their fruits and vegetables but they could not find a consistent buyer who would purchase their produce in bulk. Yet when Janssen asked what they had done to promote their businesses the farmers had often spoken with their immediate community members but done little to formally market their products. Janssen knew that the demand existed because a vegetable canner in Nairobi had told him that his business frequently experienced shortages for the produce it processed. Janssen sensed that there were gaps in many farmers� knowledge of how to participate in formal markets. Asking a few farmers if they had considered purchasing storage silos or water pumps provoked laughter: �No we can�t afford those. However recently many of us have been using credit to purchase fertilizers for our plants so we can harvest more.� Connecting with the microloan community in Nairobi revealed that the cost of performing due diligence in rural communities was generally considered the primary barrier to increasing the supply of capital for African farmers.Mobile PhonesJanssen was with the farmer Charles Mwangi one day when he came to truly appreciate the unique role that cell phones played in Kenyan society. A young man David Nganga approached Mwangi and Janssen because he had previously agreed to purchase a few of Mwangi�s chickens. After seeing the chickens Nganga and Mwangi exchanged a few words and Nganga left. �The deal fell through?� Janssen asked. Mwangi replied No David currently has his line of credit SIM card but does not want the bank to see the transaction on his account. You see Equity Bank [Equity Bank Kenya Limited] gave David a line of credit for buying fertilizer from a supplier in town but David doesn�t need fertilizer right now. So he is going to go to the fertilizer shop �to pay� them and then they will give him cash to pay for the chickens. Janssen was with some dairy farmers one day when he saw how the growing prevalence of smartphones was affecting farming: �You see Janssen my friend who works at Tuskys [a Kenyan grocery chain] told me how cheese is growing in popularity. I used YouTube to learn how to make cheese and now I am turning a portion of my milk into cheese every week and selling it to a few restaurants in town.�EducationWhile harvesting maize with some women one afternoon Janssen learned about extension workers. He asked the women how they learned to farm: �We learned from our mothers and our fathers and from each other!� �Did any of you go to school for farming?� Jansen asked. �No but sometimes extension workers come by with information for us on how to improve our farms. The problem with them is that sometimes they demand money and they bring education that does not actually solve our problems.� University students shared with Janssen their dreams of working for large agrochemical and energy companies. Janssen could not help but feel like the universities were not training students to meet Kenya�s primary agricultural needs. He recalled when he had been conducting research on microfranchises in Nairobi after graduating university. Microfranchise owners had articulated to Janssen their goals of attending or sending their children to university and yet no one ever spoke of attending trade schools or technical colleges. One evening Janssen was talking with some friends he had made on the rooftop of his hostel�s restaurant. Atieno Barika and Collins were all unemployed university graduates who each ran several different businesses to earn their incomes. Atieno ran a small chicken farm in Nairobi as well as a fruit stand; Barika owned a plumbing installation company and vegetable plot; and Collins operated a butcher shop and managed a hotel. They all shared the same sentiment: �Our university educations did not teach us to do what we do now�we taught ourselves.� Janssen concluded that the tertiary education system in Kenya was improving people�s aptitude for learning and problem-solving but it was not disseminating the practical skills people needed to build the nation.Emerging Services for FarmersAlthough current start-ups were creating value for farmers Janssen felt that these services had two shortcomings: First they failed to leverage the strong sense of community that Janssen had been observing through his interactions in Kenya. Second the dominant services were SMS (short messaging service) based. SMS-based platforms would lose supremacy in the long term given the anticipated increase in the use of smartphones and mobile Internet networks.FURTHER RESEARCHSurveysJanssen performed a lean market research experiment using Facebook Ads and Google Forms. Using Facebook�s targeting capabilities Janssen promoted surveys to females and males aged 15�65 who had previously demonstrated an interest in farming through their �likes� and group memberships. Naming the company eLengo Janssen collected unique and valuable data on the needs of Kenyan farmers. �Lengo� meant �aim� or �target� in Kiswahili so it was a fitting name for a company aimed at helping farmers achieve their business goals. Janssen needed help estimating the potential market for a smartphone-based platform. Assume Kenya had a population of 55 million people 40 per cent of whom had a smartphone and that this data otherwise represented smartphone users in Kenya. What services could Janssen offer to what markets? Using this data for whom should Janssen design a minimum viable product (MVP)?  WhatsApp Messenger Minimum Viable Product Within the survey Janssen also invited people to join WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp) chat groups. Ninety-eight per cent of survey respondents signalled that they would like to join these groups. WhatsApp groups allowed Janssen to test his hypothesis which was that by bringing people with similar interests together and leveraging the Kenyan culture of communal support active communities would develop. With prompts from Janssen groups soon confirmed the hypothesis. Janssen began seeing the sharing of expertise and educational resources within the WhatsApp groups (see Exhibit TN-2).Chicken Farming ExperimentWith the survey revealing that chicken farmers would be the optimal first target market Janssen decided that if he was going to teach others how to raise chickens he should probably first learn how to raise them himself. Janssen asked his friend David Otieno if he would like to use his plot in Nairobi to try to raise chickens with Janssen providing the initial investment. Otieno agreed and Janssen arranged to send 50 chicks to Otieno�s plot. Janssen attempted to manage the farm remotely but it took only a few weeks to realize that raising a flock of healthy chickens was a genuine challenge. In week two temperatures dropped one night and 20 of the chicks died. This cold spell gave another 10 influenza killing them in the next two weeks. Just when Janssen thought that 20 birds may reach maturity Otieno called him one morning to report that almost all of the remaining birds had been attacked by some other animal in the night. With almost all of his birds now dead Janssen found a new appreciation for the challenges of raising animals.FINDING A VALUE PROPOSITIONAs Janssen finished his coffee he thought about how he knew the resources and processes he would be able to leverage but he needed to determine what value proposition he could offer the Kenyan agricultural market. Janssen considered which potential business models he should use to serve this market as well as which ones would be profitable. He decided to use design-thinking frameworks to identify key opportunities in the market.Exhibit TN-1: SurveysExhibit TN-1 (Continued)Exhibit TN-1 ContinuedSource: Adapted by the authors from Google Form surveys conducted by Chris Janssen ~April 25 2018.Exhibit 2: Sample WhatsApp ConversationSource: Adapted by the authors from WhatsApp conversation ~March 15 2018.,"[{""start"":0,""end"":13,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":124,""end"":130,""labels"":[""Location""]},{""start"":258,""end"":265,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":910,""end"":919,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":602,""end"":609,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":1009,""end"":1018,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":1070,""end"":1077,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":1243,""end"":1250,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":1702,""end"":1709,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":1415,""end"":1422,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":2184,""end"":2191,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":2360,""end"":2367,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":2512,""end"":2519,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":2700,""end"":2707,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":2901,""end"":2908,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":3081,""end"":3088,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":3250,""end"":3257,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":4026,""end"":4033,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":3836,""end"":3843,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":4215,""end"":4222,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":4645,""end"":4652,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":4775,""end"":4782,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":5098,""end"":5105,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":5564,""end"":5571,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":5641,""end"":5648,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":5915,""end"":5922,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":6076,""end"":6083,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":6615,""end"":6622,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":6914,""end"":6921,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":7034,""end"":7041,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":7334,""end"":7341,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":7463,""end"":7470,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":7860,""end"":7867,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":7646,""end"":7653,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8121,""end"":8128,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8292,""end"":8299,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8184,""end"":8191,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8492,""end"":8499,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8695,""end"":8702,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8741,""end"":8748,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":10526,""end"":10539,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":10172,""end"":10179,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":8973,""end"":8980,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9106,""end"":9113,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9641,""end"":9648,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9961,""end"":9968,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9218,""end"":9225,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9278,""end"":9285,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9331,""end"":9338,""labels"":[""Person""]},{""start"":9860,""end"":9867,""labels"":[""Person""]}]"
The Indian government wanted to shift 30 per cent of the country�s transport fleet to electric by 2030. It was pushing electric vehicles (EVs) because of its global commitments to control carbon emissions as well as its high dependence on imports to fuel its economic growth. India�s oil import bill in fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 was expected to be US$90 billion further rising to an estimated $160 billion by 2030. The spike in oil prices following the United States� move to impose sanctions on Iran in May 2018 had given a new momentum to India�s ambitious EV program which aimed to reduce oil imports and pollution cut emissions and boost energy security.The government had launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 in 2013 to achieve national fuel security by promoting hybrid and EVs in the country. In the government�s annual budget for FY 2015/16 the NEMMP had initiated a scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) which proposed achieving six million�seven million sales of hybrids and EVs in India year on year from 2020 onwards by providing various fiscal (e.g. tax holidays inexpensive land and power availability duty exemptions etc.) and non-fiscal incentives (e.g. waiving road tax and registration charges for electric vehicles) worth _87.3 billion to EV firms until 2020.Many Indian and foreign automobile firms were finding these initiatives very lucrative and were formulating strategies to aggressively foray into this proposed EV environment. One automobile firm that was quite optimistic about the Indian government�s EV endeavour was Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited (MEM). MEM was the pioneer of EV technology in India. Under the brand Mahindra Electric MEM had a wide variety of EVs spanning personal and commercial segments. According to MEM�s chief executive officer (CEO) Mahesh Babu the firm�s vision was �to become a leading brand in providing customised electric mobility experiences through cutting edge technology.� Babu�s vision was backed by MEM�s holistic efforts in creating a comprehensive road map for establishing a robust EV ecosystem.Though it seemed that there was a perfect fit between MEM�s vision and the Indian government�s EV initiative plans to seamlessly move to EVs ran the risk of total breakdown as multiple government departments were presenting disparate views on the EV road map creating confusion among stakeholders. In September 2018 many macro and micro issues were present in the overall environment that was being created for EVs. Would companies like MEM be able to effectively formulate strategies and compete successfully in this dynamic and changing business environment? COMPANY BACKGROUNDMEM was part of the Mahindra Group (Mahindra) conglomerate which was started in 1945 and had become a $19-billion global federation of companies by 2018. It operated in 20 key industries such as automobiles information technology financial services and hospitality many of which were fairly recent inceptions. Mahindra�s EV initiative began in 2010 when it acquired majority stake in Reva Electric Car Company India�s leading EV manufacturer at that time. The acquired firm was renamed Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles. By 2016 the firm had branched out to produce a wide variety of EVs. It had also entered powertrain and drivetrain technology and provided mobility solutions to enable shared electric mobility. As its product portfolio expanded (see Exhibit 1) the firm rebranded itself as Mahindra Electric Mobility (MEM). In FY 2017/18 MEM sold 4000 EVs nearly a third of which were cars; the rest were electric rickshaws and vans.Mahindra had planned to cumulatively invest _35�_40 billion in MEM�s EV business out of which _8 billion was to be invested in product development and capacity expansion. Mahindra aimed to have at least four new EV models on the road by 2021. The remainder would be put toward developing a battery-module plant that would have the capacity to make half a million battery modules a year. The plant would also house a battery module pack line. In 2018 MEM joined hands with LG Chem Limited to develop lithium-ion batteries for its EVs. The entire facility for both module and pack was expected to begin production in the last quarter of FY 2020. The intent of the company was not only to drive and lead the EV market in India but also to act as a supplier of components. MEM was also developing infrastructure to support an electric-led mobility system. MEM EVs were expected to have an output in excess of 35 kilowatts (kW) per hour and would likely be priced at about _1.1 million.Anticipating higher demand MEM had commenced work towards increasing production capacity for EVs from 5000 units a year in 2018 to between 60000 and 70000 units a year. Despite the limited success of its EVs in the Indian market thus far the company was expecting huge demand from taxi operators and others in the fleet segment. In 2018 MEM had a pilot project running with 100 electric cars in association with Ola Cabs (Ola) a leading Indian cab aggregator in the central Indian city of Nagpur. It had formed a similar association with Uber Technologies Incorporated (Uber) to deploy EVs in the major Indian cities of Delhi and Hyderabad. MEM had already supplied 500 EVs to an electric-cab service provider Lithium Urban Technologies and had landed an order for 1000 electric cars from Bangalore-based fleet operator Baghirathi Travel Solutions. In addition MEM was partnering with Italian design house Pininfarina which Mahindra had acquired in December 2015 to develop an electric sports vehicle. MEM had also helped Ford Motor Company in developing an electric version of its Aspire entry-level sedan which would hit the market by 2019. In September 2017 the two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding to explore joint work on EVs and to approach global distribution as a team.Babu had been with Mahindra for 18 years and had worked in the design and development of engine and vehicle platforms�from frugal three-wheelers to Mahindra�s flagship models. He was a Fulbright scholar and had completed a program in leadership management at the Tepper School of Business Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Under his leadership MEM had launched four new models including the award-winning e2oPlus. Babu had been instrumental in shaping the electric-mobility solutions of the future through path-breaking initiatives in the commercial-fleet space and by expanding the electric portfolio of both low- and high-voltage drivetrains.THE INDIAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND Electric vehiclesThe Indian automobile industry was worth $93 billion in 2018. It commanded 22 per cent of India�s manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) and contributed 7 per cent to the country�s overall GDP. The automobile industry and its over 10000 component manufacturers collectively employed about 30 million people. The firms in India had exclusive distributors for their range of vehicles and a multiple-brand distribution network in the automobile industry was not the norm. Nearly 70 per cent of passenger vehicles (PVs) sold in India fell into the category of small cars. Electric cars accounted for less than 0.1 per cent and overall EV sales were only 1 per cent of the 3.268 million passenger-vehicle sales in India in 2017. Ninety five percent of EVs on Indian roads were low-speed electric scooters powered by lead-acid batteries whose speed was less than 25 kilometres (km) per hour. In such a scenario the Indian government�s EV push was dictated by an urgent concern about rising pollution levels in most Indian cities in addition to its international carbon-reduction commitments and the pressure of the oil import bill.As a result of the government�s initiative it was expected that by 2030 as many as 40 per cent of new PVs to be sold in the local market would be EVs. Assuming a growth rate of 8 per cent in the PV segment every year about 71 million new vehicles were expected to be added between 2018 and 2030. Of this 28.4 million vehicles were expected to be EVs and the remaining 42.6 million would be equipped with conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs).This would lead to a massive technological shift as ICEs and EV engines had very different powertrains (see Exhibit 2). While a conventional ICE vehicle had 3000 moveable parts EVs only had 30 such parts. The configuration of EVs would be different from the ICE as the engine transmission and exhaust would be replaced with an electric motor inventors battery pack and control unit. Hence the electrical and electronics systems would take precedence over mechanical engineering. On the battery front the economics favoured lithium-ion batteries as their prices had dropped about 73 per cent�from $1000 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2010 to $272 per kWh in 2016. Lithium also had an advantage over oil because it could be recycled for future use. Battery price was an important consideration; creating battery-manufacturing capacity would take up a large part of the investment required to create EVs as nearly 70 per cent of the cost of an EV was contributed by the battery.Experts felt that the cost of batteries might halve by 2020 making EVs more affordable while driving the costs higher for conventional vehicles that had to comply with Bharat Stage 6 emission standards (comparable to Euro 6 emission standards). Hence they believed that EVs would become increasingly viable by 2023 with the Indian manufacturing ecosystem having matured by then. However many also felt that EV technology was still in the evolutionary phase and there were a lot of uncertainties with regards to cost structures and the evolution of the ecosystem. Between complete EVs and ICEs there was another set of vehicles which were called hybrids. These vehicles ran on both battery and ICE and could be an interim solution. INDIAN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVESTo lead from the front in its EV endeavour the Indian government created Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in 2010 formed under the Ministry of Power. It was a joint venture of four national public sector undertakings: NTPC Limited Power Finance Corporation Limited Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. EESL�s objective was to facilitate energy-efficiency projects that would significantly reduce energy consumption and costs. As part of its energy-conservation initiatives EESL had floated a tender for 10000 basic electric sedans in August 2017. Tata Motors Limited (TM) had cornered 60 per cent of the tender and the rest had gone to MEM. EESL had floated its second global tender for procuring 10000 electric cars in April 2018. In May 2018 the Union Ministry of Home Affairs was planning to seek guidance from EESL and switch to EVs replacing diesel-guzzling vehicles including heavy trucks and buses for the seven security forces operating under the ministry. In December 2017 the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises had sanctioned _4.4 billion to 11 states to procure 390 electric buses taxis and automobiles as a pilot project under the FAME scheme.To enhance the infrastructure for EVs in India in May 2018 the government proposed setting up EV charging stations every 3 kilometre (km) in cities with over a million people and every 50 km on busy national highways. For the further proliferation of EVs it planned to offer fiscal incentives and facilitated land acquisition for those who were interested in setting up the required EV-charging infrastructure. The government also considered providing subsidies to public sector undertakings in the energy sector such as NTPC Limited the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited to initiate the process of setting up charging stations. Besides these state-run enterprises Indian automakers including Mahindra and TM and cab-hailing companies like Ola and Uber were all interested in setting up charging infrastructure for EVs.As part of the _94-billion package for encouraging the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles among Indian consumers and cab aggregators the government was planning to offer incentives of up to _250000 for those who would scrap their old gasoline or diesel vehicles and purchase EVs (see Exhibit 3).To incentivize Indian manufacturers in April 2018 the government planned to double the mandatory local content in EVs to 70 per cent in the coming three years and to impose heavy duties on imports. In 2018 the local content in EVs was about 35 per cent as most companies imported batteries which accounted for a major cost of EVs. As per the proposal by 2019 the domestic content in EVs would be increased to a minimum of 50 per cent which subsequently would be increased to 60 per cent in 2020 and to 70 per cent in 2021. COMPETITORS IN THE INDIAN electric vehicles MARKETTata Motors LimitedTM was a part of the $100-billion Tata Group founded in 1868. TM itself was a $42-billion organization. It was a leading automobile manufacturer in India with a portfolio that included a wide range of cars sports vehicles trucks buses and defence vehicles. At the Geneva International Motor Show in March 2018 TM premiered its electric concept sedan�E-Vision�which was set to eventually become the brand�s flagship sedan in the Indian market. TM was operating on three different levels of electrification. The first was a plug-and-play solution with the Electra EV which would power lower-voltage vehicles like the Tiago Tigor Magic Iris and Ace. The next was to modify the new-age Omega architecture for electrification so as to offer longer-range and faster vehicles. Finally TM was looking at a dedicated EV architecture in the mid to long term. TM planned for the majority of its vehicles in India to be electrified by 2022 including mild hybrids hybrids and battery-operated EVs.TM had created an electric-mobility division to have special focus on developing cleaner mobility solutions for the future. Other firms of the Tata Group were roped in to offer a complete turnkey solution: While TM would offer the EV Tata Power Limited would set up charging stations; Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited would build physical infrastructure depots or dedicated EV stations; and Tata Consultancy Services Limited would help develop the required software platform. TM had cornered 60 per cent of the EESL tender. However the electric cars it provided to EESL were only running 70 to 80 km on one charge compared to the initial claim of 130 km per charge. This made EESL question TM on performance criteria. With a price point of _1.12 million for each TM electric car this single-charge range was considered inadequate.Maruti Suzuki India LimitedStarted as a joint venture between the Indian government and the Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan in 1981 Maruti Suzuki India Limited (Suzuki) eventually became the largest car manufacturer in India. The Indian government later divested from this venture. In April 2018 Suzuki was the parent company�s most successful subsidiary in the world and at 50.10 per cent it had the largest market share among PVs in India. Suzuki along with Denso Corporation and Toshiba Corporation had pooled $180 million in 2017 to build a plant in India for producing lithium-ion batteries. Suzuki had also partnered with Japan�s largest carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) to roll out a small electric car for the mass segment in India and elsewhere by 2020. Its first affordable EV would be based on technology from parent Suzuki Motor Corporation and was to be made before the products that were going to be developed in partnership with Toyota. Thus the company was working with partners as well as focusing on in-house capabilities to put the ecosystem in place for EVs.Suzuki was likely to have an EV with a power output of 25 to 35 kW per hour suitable for the compact-car segment and possibly priced below _1 million. The company was looking for collaborations in the areas of materials handling battery recycling and reuse and charging infrastructure. In addition it would continue to refine its ICE vehicles and make them more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. Hyundai Motor India LimitedHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai Motor Company (HMC). Since its inception HMIL had been the second-largest car manufacturer and the number one car exporter in India. In FY 2017/18 HMIL had about a 17 per cent share in the Indian PV market. India was the third-biggest market for HMC globally behind China and the United States (outside its home market of South Korea) and its share in the company�s global revenue was about 15 per cent. The company sold 680000 million vehicles in FY 2017/18 (including exports). HMC was developing both battery EVs and fuel cell vehicles. HMIL was likely to introduce pure electric and hybrid vehicles in India in 2019�a year ahead of Suzuki. HMIL had developed hybrid vehicles for the domestic market but a spike in the goods and services tax rate for hybrid vehicles compelled the South Korean carmaker to shelve its hybrid vehicles completely and shift to electric ones. It would start with importing completely knocked down units of its Kona Electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2019 and look at local manufacturing as the market matured. The Kona Electric would be priced between _2 million and _2.5 million. HMIL was planning to invest over $1 billion in India by 2020. HMC�s Kia Motor Corporation was also planning to manufacture an electric car and hatchback in India after its entry in the second half of 2019. However it believed there was a need to address critical issues such as establishing charging infrastructure in India.BYD Auto Company LimitedFounded in 1995 the Chinese firm BYD Auto Company Limited (BYD) was a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Its automobile business included new-energy vehicles like EVs. In India BYD had teamed up with lesser-known Indian firm Goldstone Infratech to manufacture electric cars trucks and other automobiles with fast-charging batteries that could run up to 400 km on a full charge. In 2018 it planned to invest _2 billion in establishing a plant in India wanting to make the country its manufacturing hub for exporting EVs to other South Asian nations. BYD planned to manufacture 5000 electric buses per year in India by March 2021 and it would increase localization content to 70 per cent�which in 2018 stood at 35 per cent.Other Prospective PlayersIndian consumer durables maker Micromax Informatics Limited also planned to enter EV and battery manufacturing. It was in the advanced stages of testing formalities for the vehicles and had gotten approval for some of its lithium-ion batteries. It was keen on entering the electric two- and three-wheeler categories where it would compete with the likes of Bajaj Auto Limited Mahindra TVS Motor Company and Piaggio. Many other Indian firms�such as Hero Future Energies Limited Ravin Group Sun Mobility and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited�were also venturing into the domain of battery manufacturing for EVs. Being successful in this arena promised massive rewards as a study done by U.S.-based Rocky Mountain Institute estimated that switching completely to EVs in 2030 could create a battery market of $300 billion in India. If battery manufacturers imported the cells and assembled the battery they could capture only 30 per cent of this value whereas if they imported only the raw materials lithium and cobalt and manufactured the battery locally about 80 per cent of the value could be captured.In line with the Indian government�s push for EVs many foreign firms were also keen on taking initiatives. French company FM Logistic had plans to develop green vehicles for environmentally sustainable road cargo transportation in India. It planned to launch the first electric or hybrid truck in India in 2019. Japanese EV maker Terra Motors Corporation which sold electric rickshaws in the Indian market was looking to shift its operational base to India to expand in Asia. Terra Motors� research and development centre in India would design products control quality and test specifications of EVs being manufactured in India. The company was looking to introduce in 2019 an electric two-wheeler powered by a lithium-ion battery. The start-up Uniti Sweden had formed a strategic partnership with the Bird Group for its foray into India. It was going to launch an affordable five-seater electric city car with a range of 250 km priced at about _250000 in 2020. Many other foreign players such as Renault-Nissan Honda Motor Company Limited Mercedes-Benz BMW Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive had also expressed interest in bringing EVs into the Indian market but were awaiting clarity in government policy before finalizing their next course of action. According to a study conducted in 2016 by Variant Market Research the market in India for lithium-ion batteries was expected to reach $5 billion in 2024 and subsequently grow at 26 per cent a year. As a result many battery manufacturers from various countries like EnerBlu from the United States and Delta Electronics Industry from Taiwan were looking forward to supplying batteries for EV to Indian firms.INDIAN CONSUMERS� PREFERENCES India was known as a small-car market. However the country was witnessing an SUV rush. In FY 2017/18 PV sales in India grew by 8 per cent to 3.28 million units whereas SUV sales grew by 21 per cent crossing 900000 units. In the pricier segment (_1.2 million�_4 million) three out of four cars sold in India were SUVs. From 14 per cent in FY 2009/10 the percentage share of SUVs in PV sales had risen to 30 per cent. Rising incomes and aspirations had led consumers to go from buying small cars to buying SUVs. By showing a preference for SUVs Indian consumers were behaving like their counterparts elsewhere in the world. SUVs had outpaced industry sales in many markets the world over. In Europe from a figure of just over half a million in 2000 SUV sales touched 4.6 million in 2017. The United States showed a jump in SUV sales from 3.4 million in 2000 to seven million in 2017. In the case of China the increase was more dramatic�from 4600 units in 2000 to 10.7 million in 2017. Between FY 2002/3 and FY 2017/8 SUV sales in India showed more than an eight-fold increase (see Exhibit 4). The thrust of SUVs in the forthcoming EV scenario had led companies such as Volvo Cars and BMW to provide hybrid-engine options. HMIL�s Kona Electric SUV would be the company�s first EV in India in 2019. Mercedes-Benz was working on the EQ concept EV range based on its GLC mid-size SUV. TM was designing electric versions of its off-roaders H5X and 45X. MEM was also working on an electric version of Mahindra�s popular KUV100 model.CONCERNSDespite the government�s heavy push experts felt that electric road transportation was yet to become viable in India due to the dearth of infrastructure primarily charging stations. There was concern as to how to electrify small cars and make them affordable. Many firms felt that as far as EVs were concerned there were three major challenges facing them: performance range and cost. According to Kenichi Ayukawa managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki making affordable electric cars was one of the biggest challenges for auto companies especially as vehicle batteries were very expensive and there was no public charging infrastructure. Expert opinion was that the ecosystem to manufacture the battery-management systems power electronics and lithium-ion batteries required for EVs was not yet available in India. On the other hand India�s northeastern neighbour China was already the world�s largest EV manufacturer with almost 60 per cent of the global market share in terms of volume (see Exhibit 5). With active policy support of the Chinese government and large investments in the new-energy space China was likely to emerge as a trendsetter and significant technology driver in the EV arena in coming years. It was also expected to create a huge ecosystem for battery manufacturing recycling and charging infrastructure as well as other related components of the EV package. It was believed that in the future India would have to depend on China for battery imports and that ultimately Chinese companies would dominate the Indian market. This was already being seen in many instances. French carmaker Groupe Renault�s electric version of the Kwid small car intended for India would have batteries and battery-management systems manufactured in China. The current market trend was also showing an increase in the import of automobile parts from China (see Exhibit 6).Experts were also skeptical about the proliferation of EV usage reducing India�s pollution levels as the country met 75 per cent of its electricity needs by burning fossil fuels. It was felt that EVs on roads would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands where the required power was generated. In addition to this for a power-deficit nation like India there would be challenges in ensuring adequate supplies needed to run EVs. Besides issues related to charging infrastructure the need for fast chargers parking spots and swappable batteries required robust solutions and public�private partnerships. Experts felt that the push for EVs was largely coming from the central government and there had been limited policy-level support at the state and municipal levels.The Indian automotive industry came under the purview of the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises and ministries of road transport and highways. It had faced the brunt of intervention from various regulatory bodies in India like the National Green Tribunal; the Supreme Court; the Goods and Services Tax Council; the National Institution for Transforming India; and the ministries of urban development power and environment and forests. This had led to multiple voices sending out multiple messages creating an environment of confusion and uncertainty for the industry.Besides stressing EV usage in 2016 the Indian government also decided that the country would leapfrog from BS 4 emission standards to BS 6 emission standards for all of its gasoline- and diesel-driven vehicles by 2020 which warrantied an investment of more than _600 billion. This further stressed the budgets of the research and development departments of many automobile manufacturers including MEM which had to work on both EV- and BS 6-compatible engines for the Indian market. With intensifying competition and a success ratio of just two in every 10 new models introduced in the market return on investment and viability were serious challenges ahead for the vehicle makers.There was also a fear that the industry would be shaken up as close to 60 per cent of automobile industry revenue came from engines and powertrains which would be under threat in the upcoming EV scenario. There was danger that an EV-based automobile environment in India would make many of the casting forging and machining sectors unviable risking about 1.5 million jobs in an already job-stressed Indian market.the WAY FORWARDIn its endeavour to shift 30 per cent of the country�s transport fleet to electric by 2030 the Indian government had initiated plans to provide many incentives to public and private enterprises as well as Indian consumers. Despite the multitude of government initiatives and the serious attempts being made by many automotive firms in India there was still a lack of clarity regarding the various macro- and micro-environmental factors that had to be addressed to make the EV dream a reality in India. As this change in business environment became imminent Babu realized that he would need to study competitors� initiatives and that MEM would have to formulate its own strategies. How should Babu approach a competitive analysis of the environment?

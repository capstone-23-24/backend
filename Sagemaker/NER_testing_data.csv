(Bon-Ton). She tried to recall her first-year financial accounting class. Her mentor at the firm had asked her to analyze Bon-Ton’s financial condition as the investment company was managing some client portfolios where Bon-Ton stocks were present. Smith did some initial investigation and discovered that the store was not doing very well. Moreover the US retail industry had been experiencing a systemic meltdown since 2017. More than 15 US retailers had filed for bankruptcy in 2017 the most in the last six years. The 100-year-old company Bon-Ton was no exception. In 2017 it had announced store closures in five states and on January 16 2018 it had entered into forbearance agreements with some of its lenders after the grace period of a US$14 million debt payment expired. On January 31 2018 it announced store closures at 42 locations as part of its rationalization program. The company ultimately filed a voluntary petition for protection against bankruptcy and for reorganization on February 4 2018 under chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Thinking about the risk of retaining Bon-Ton stocks in the client portfolios Smith wondered whether it would be feasible for Bon-Ton to stay afloat and revive its business. How were its competitors faring? Could Bon-Ton survive and if so how? While researching retail companies that had gone bankrupt Smith came across a tool to predict bankruptcy Altman’s Z-score. She planned to complement her analysis with the bankruptcy prediction findings to arrive at a comprehensive analysis of Bon-Ton and recommend a course of action for her firm.ABOUT THE COMPANYBon-Ton Stores Inc. was a department store chain in the United States founded in 1898. The company’s stores offered “fashion apparel and accessories for women men and children.” Its products also included “cosmetics home furnishings and other goods.” As of 2017 the company operated through more than 250 stores in 24 states and the majority of its stores were leased. The company was headquartered in York Pennsylvania which was its administrative and sales support hub. The merchandising and marketing divisions were based in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The company owned and leased distribution centres in Illinois Pennsylvania and Ohio; operated a furniture warehouse in Naperville Illinois; and leased an omnichannel fulfillment centre in West Jefferson Ohio. The company operated under seven retail nameplates across the United States: Bon-Ton Carson’s Younkers Herberger’s Elder-Beerman Boston Store and Bergner’s.BON-TON’S BUSINESS MODELValue PropositionBon-Ton promoted itself as a store that offered “better brands better savings” and it carried a broad collection of quality goods at favourable prices. Bon-Ton stores provided an assortment of nationally distributed brands of apparel accessories footwear cosmetics and home furnishings—for example Anne Klein Calvin Klein Jessica Simpson Kenneth Cole and Under Armour. It also offered exclusive private brands like Laura Ashley Ruff Hewn Relativity and Studio Works. Bon-Ton’s private brands made unique and exclusive fashion products available at compelling price points contributing to competitive differentiation and customer loyalty. The costs associated with in-house private brands enabled Bon-Ton to realize a favourable profit margin.Customer RelationshipThe primary target consumers of Bon-Ton were “women between the ages of 25 and 60 with average annual household income of $55000 to $125000.” The company also targeted a “broader audience” that included men and children.Bon-Ton focused on excellent customer service in order to develop long-standing relationships with its customers. It provided training programs to build an efficient sales force for customers and in addition to phone and online support Bon-Ton had sales associates dedicated to customer sales assistance in selected stores. Many departments had self-service centres for customer convenience. Bon-Ton also implemented a “Let Us Find It” program to assist customers in finding preferred items at other store locations or through the company’s omnichannel assortment which enabled customers to order merchandise for delivery directly to their addresses. Bon-Ton also expanded its order-fulfillment locations to serve omnichannel orders that were directed to store locations. In 2016 Bon-Ton introduced mobile capabilities and provided customers with a “Buy Online Pick Up In-Store” convenience program. To gain customer loyalty it also had a private-label credit card program which offered cardholders rewards including advanced sales notices discounts and event invitations.Vendor ManagementBon-Ton served as a distribution channel that helped merchandise vendors reach their target customers. The company created relationships with vendors by evaluating their sales and profitability and making purchasing decisions based on these analyses. As was prevalent in the industry Bon-Ton received allowances from some of its vendors when sales did not meet specified margins. It also received support from some vendors in the form of allowances and reimbursements for costs incurred to promote and sell on behalf of the vendors. MarketingBon-Ton engaged customers through a multichannel marketing program that included traditional print media broadcasting and digital media. Bon-Ton used localization and personalization strategies in its email and direct marketing to individual customers. Besides advertising and sales promotions it offered purchase incentives and in-store events such as designer appearances and fashion shows to build a solid customer base. Bon-Ton also tried to connect with people by participating in charitable causes and events.Inventory ManagementBon-Ton had a centralized planning and allocation team for all its stores; this team included staff who supported regional and local planning and allocation. The company operated a pre-distribution model “through which we allocate[ed] merchandise on our initial purchase orders to each store. This merchandise [wa]s shipped from our vendors to our distribution facilities for delivery to designated stores.” Bon-Ton had a “reactive distribution technique” for stores with high customer demand. The technique leveraged electronic data interchange inventory management technology to effectively move and deliver prelabelled merchandise to individual stores and it used high-speed automated conveyor systems and hand-held radio frequency devices to track merchandise. Bon-Ton’s third-party carriers distributed merchandise to the stores where most of the merchandise was held. Bon-Ton monitored inventory levels following a seasonal pattern and maintained inventories to support both offline and online sales.ABOUT THE FOUNDER AND chief executive officerMax and Samuel Grumbacher started Bon-Ton in 1898 as S.Grumbacher and Son a one-room store on Market Street in York Pennsylvania founded by Max and Samuel Grumbacher. It had come a long way and now operated in approximately 2.2 million square metres (24 million square feet) in around 260 stores in 24 US states under the different nameplates.Tim Grumbacher had been involved in the company’s management since 1977 and had been the chairman of the board of directors and strategic initiatives officer since June 2013. Kathryn Bufano held positions as president chief executive officer (CEO) and director. After August 25 2017 William Tracy the former chief operating officer took over the CEO role after Bufano stepped down when her contract ended. Although the firm had posted annual losses under Bufano’s tenure Bon-Ton’s press release announcing this change gave no specific reason for Bufano’s resignation. Bufano supported Tracy as he moved into the new role and Tracy stated that he appreciated the board’s confidence and support during his transition.PAST PERFORMANCEBeginning in 2014 Bon-Ton’s downturn was prominent and this was reflected in the company’s share price (see Exhibit 1). Its sales and margin performance were below expectations that year resulting in a greater net loss than that of the prior year. However according to Bufano “It was a year of both challenges and accomplishments.” She felt confident in the long-term potential of the company saying that while the performance was “disappointing we believe the progress we made on our strategic initiatives will contribute meaningfully to future profitability and growth.” In the fall of 2014 the company started a “Voice of the Customer” brand positioning program supported by the tagline “Your Store. Your Style.” According to Bufano this served “as the embodiment of our customer focus and commitment to delivering localized and relevant fashion across our many channels—our brick-and-mortar stores website and app.” Even after executing customer-centric strategies Bufano felt that the company had failed to reflect its accomplishments in the financials (see Exhibits 2–4). In 2016 Bon-Ton realized a “net cost savings of $31 million which was $7 million above the high end” of the company’s target. According to the CEO’s statement in the annual report “2016 was a year of progress for Bon-Ton despite the ongoing challenges that we faced from the retail environment.” The company paid off a $150 million asset-based term loan and $57 million in outstanding principal on its 2017 senior secured notes which slightly improved its liquidity and overall capital structure. However the company still ended up with a net loss of $63 million as of January 2017—around $6 million more than that of the previous year (see Exhibit 2). In 2017 the company continued to meet losses. Sales decreased and the bottom line plunged (see Exhibits 2–7). In the company’s Form 8-K for the first quarter (Q1) of 2017 Bufano stated Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift. That said our omnichannel business once again generated double digit growth and we continued to expand our merchandise offering with highly recognized brands as well as exclusive and private brands that resonate with our customer. Bon-Ton planned to focus on its omnichannel strategy and expand its merchandise portfolio to appeal to customers. Internally Bon-Ton was looking to roll out a profit improvement initiative to achieve additional cost reductions in fiscal 2017. In Q2 2017 as per Bon-Ton’s earnings call the company was optimistic about sales in several categories such as fine jewellery young men’s denim and brands such as Under Armour Tommy Hilfiger and Vera Bradley. According to Tracy the new president and CEO Our cosmetic business performed ahead of our expectations driven by the strength in the fragrance category. We are also pleased with the continued momentum in our e-commerce business which saw a double-digit increase during the quarter. . . .We made great progress on our cost reduction plan as we reduce SG&A [selling general and administrative expenses] by $20.7 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization] was $9.1 million an increase of $6.6 million compared to last year’s second quarter. Second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA includes $12.1 million in benefit from gift card breakage and gains in our real estate transactions.Bon-Ton planned to expand its merchandise offerings “focusing on five core areas” of “gifting cold weather merchandise activewear denim and private and exclusive brands.” Bon-Ton planned to launch FAO Schwarz and expand its Discovery Kids product and its previous success with pantry offerings influenced the company to consider expanding its specialty food business with national and key local brands.RESULTS AND OUTLOOK FOR THE YEARBon-Ton’s third-quarter report of 2017 indicated that there had been progress on a number of strategic initiatives. The report showed that Bon-Ton did the following:Experienced strength in key merchandise categories and brands and drove continued double-digit growth in our omnichannel business (reflecting sales via our website mobile site and our Let Us Find It customer service program) as compared to the third quarter of 2017;Continued to effectively execute on a number of profit improvement initiatives substantially reducing our selling general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for the quarter; andMaintained careful inventory controls as we reduced inventory by 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2016.At the same time the company faced continuing challenges. Sales at stores decreased 6.6 per cent because of warm weather and subdued footfall at malls. Revenue realization was less from proprietary credit card operations miscellaneous revenue departments and gift-and-merchandise return card breakage. Shifts in the mix of merchandise led to a markdown rate that affected gross margins and was in turn intensified by a decrease in the gross margin. Net interest expense increased from the previous year due to a spike in weighted average interest rate and expanded debt.The company’s cash flow from operations and up to $880 million in borrowings provided a source of working capital. The company had planned capital expenditures; beyond these its main cash expenses would be for servicing debt and financing during peak selling seasons.Bon-Ton’s quarter-wise financial performance in 2017 reflected the challenging situation (see Exhibits 5–7). The company indicated that it had started evaluating potential strategic alternatives and engaging consultants for financial restructuring.CHALLENGES In 2017 many retail players closed their stores and planned for more closures in 2018. Many retailers in the United States filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to overburdening debt a decline in footfall and pressure from competitors. Some of the troubled retailers were Sears Payless ShoeSource Inc. Abercrombie & Fitch Toys “R” Us and Gymboree Group Inc. Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were expected to acquire a large amount of the industry’s gains. Amazon had been the chief competitor to all the other retail players. Some other department store industry leaders such as Dillard’s Inc. Kohl’s Corporation Nordstrom Inc. Macy’s Inc. and J.C. Penney Company Inc. were also facing challenges in the current market condition (see Exhibit 8).A Forbes report on retail sales for June 2017 provided “a sobering look at the current state of American retail.” Although year-on-year total sales were up for the first half of 2017 the estimated figures for May–June 2017 were lower. With some exceptions (electronics; appliance stores; sporting goods; and hobby book and music stores) most reporting categories showed monthly declines: “Even non-store retailers . . . reported a 2.8% dip. Overall June retail and food services sales dropped 3.2%” compared to the previous month.Department store and retail companies were affected by consumers’ shifting shopping patterns: from shopping in brick-and-mortar stores to buying through online retail channels and using smart phones and social media. Certainly Internet shopping had been “replacing the hassles of in-store shopping.” Online shopping not only gave consumers “access to more products often at a cheaper price” but it also saved “huge amounts of time when people need a specific item.” Forbes also reported that men were “spending more on clothes. This is an interesting trend especially now that Walmart has acquired men’s clothing retailer Bonobos. Men are paying serious attention to their presentation both at work to advance their careers and in their personal lives when casual attire is called for.”The US retail industry which included mass merchandisers national chain retailers and specialty retailers became highly competitive as online retailers emerged and mobile technology and social media expanded. Competition in the industry revolved around “price quality and selection of merchandise reputation store location advertising and customer service.” While Bon-Ton competed with similar department stores and many other retailers “including store-based mail-order and internet retailers” many of its competitors were in better shape (see Exhibit 8).Moreover prevailing economic conditions and various economic factors affected consumers’ spending habits especially with respect to the merchandise that Bon-Ton stores sold. “Reduced consumer traffic in traditional shopping malls” where most of the Bon-Ton stores were located had caused a decline in the company’s financial condition and operating results.Customer traffic and conversion both in stores and online had important effects on sales and in-store sales were highly dependent on the geographical locations of stores. As demographic patterns changed many of Bon-Ton’s current locations had lost appeal. Financial conditions that affected the operators of some shopping malls where Bon-Ton stores were located had also affected the company’s sales.Declining operating performance and a severe liquidity crisis meant that vendors might demand accelerated payments resulting in “a significant adverse impact” on Bon-Ton’s operating cash flow and liquidity. As of January 28 2017 the company had a total debt of $989.3 million which included capital lease and financing obligations.This indebtedness curbed Bon-Ton’s ability to “replenish inventory at competitive prices and terms generate sales and maintain . . . stores” and price increases for “merchandise raw materials fuel and labour or their reduced availability” threatened to increase the company’s cost of goods further damaging its financial results. To create an online presence Bon-Ton invested in technology and made operational changes which increased customer traffic but did not significantly affect the company’s bottom line. The “cost to ship merchandise to customers and the competitive pressures to offer free or reduced shipping” as well as the “significant cost to provide and maintain the infrastructure and systems necessary to operate [an] omnichannel business” all led to lower margins.The turnover rate in the retail industry was very high. Bon-Ton faced significant costs—for example for wages and benefits such as health care—to attract and retain key employees.Bon-Ton’s real estate exposure was significant. The company owned or leased approximately 260 stores. Its store lease agreements included both a fixed rent portion and a variable portion based on the sales percentage at each location. These agreements also prevented stores from closing before the contracts terminated although some stores that were in economic distress were allowed to close. However leases and other obligations restricted Bon-Ton’s ability to close unprofitable owned or leased stores and forced the company to operate some locations at a loss. Moreover a decline in real estate values posed a risk to Bon-Ton’s borrowing.ANALYSTS’ OPINIONs ABOUT THE COMPANYSmith also went through some analyst reports. Neil Saunders a retail analyst of GlobalData (data and insights solution providers) noted that Bon-Ton’s offerings were undifferentiated and unclear and had become increasingly irrelevant to consumers. “Many of Bon-Ton’s stores were in areas where the availability of branded fashions and home wares was traditionally poor” Saunders said. “However while this once made them a focal point and a destination for local shoppers the internet has done much to change this dynamic and has made the stores less relevant.”Another analyst made a similar comment. “Bon-Ton is kind of a microcosm of the department store industry” said Philip Emma senior analyst for restructuring intelligence firm Debtwire. “Their business model is selling brand-name merchandise that consumers recognize in a mall-based setting—and that’s the segment of retail that’s had the biggest struggle.”ALTMAN’S Z-SCOREOne of the most popular bankruptcy prediction models was developed by Edward I. Altman in 1968. Altman applied a statistical technique called multivariate analysis to a mix of financial variables to detect the likelihood of solvency in times of distress. Each company was given a score (Z-score) calculated through a discriminant function of the five variables weighted by coefficients. The model had been revised several times for different contexts (e.g. for private firms). The Z-score model for non-manufacturing firms and for companies in emerging markets outside the United States was introduced in 1995 (see Exhibit 9). The Z-score model excluded industry-sensitive asset-turnover variables from the last revised model to minimize the industry effect.CONCLUSIONOn February 6 2018 Bon-Ton announced that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware had approved its voluntary petitions for financial restructuring. With existing losses and significant loans what actions might put Bon-Ton back on track? What measures could the company take to fight bankruptcy? Smith prepared to analyze these questions from the perspectives of both Bon-Ton and an investor in order to present her findings to the investment company.EXHIBIT 1: BON-TON—STOCK PRICE CHANGES Source: Excerpted from “The Bon-Ton Stores Inc.

The management of SaskPower had requested the approval of its 2003 foreign exchange strategy to manage the long-term currency risk exposure in the utilityâs U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower issued US$619 million of debt in the early 1990s with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Canadian dollar had since increased (i.e. the Canadian dollar rate had depreciated) increasing the effective burden of the debt and reducing the utilityâs net income. By the end of 1999 SaskPower had hedged US$112 million through foreign currency swaps. By the end of 2001 the translation value of the U.S. dollar debt had increased to CA$986 million and represented more than 50 per cent of SaskPowerâs long-term debt.A change in accounting practices was implemented in 2001 in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. SaskPower was required to recognize as a gain or a loss in the current year any translation differences in the value of its outstanding U.S. dollar debt resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate during the year. This policy change led to a significant reduction in net income in 2001 followed by a significant increase during the first eight months of 2002. The volatility in earnings had complicated the task of setting rates for electricity and had proved politically difficult to justify. An overarching objective of the proposed foreign exchange strategy was to eventually eliminate all currency exposure in the outstanding U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower: The Company SaskPower was a Canadian power company established in 1929. This crown corporation was owned by the provincial government of Saskatchewan and governed by a board of directors. It was the main producer and supplier of electricity in the province with an installed generation capacity of 4281 megawatts. In fiscal year 2001 SaskPower serviced 432000 customers spread over 652000 square kilometres across Saskatchewan. Around 68.3 per cent of the generated power was sold to industrial users. The companyâs distribution network was also tied to the grids of Alberta and Manitoba and to the U.S. state of North Dakota (although no notable sales were recorded across the border).SaskPowerâs revenues in 2001 were CA$1.126 billion 88 per cent of which came from sales within Saskatchewan. Its expenses were CA$1.097 billion. The cost of fuel and purchased power represented 43 per cent of expenses. Finance charges which included foreign currency translation losses related to the U.S. dollar debt represented 16 per cent. Expenses increased by 10 per cent relative to 2000 driven primarily by a 22 per cent increase in the cost of fuels namely natural gas and purchased power which was required due to low river flows and reduced electricity generation (see Exhibit 1).Origins of U.S. DebtSaskPower was a capital-intensive vertically integrated electric power utility. Asset replacement was required even during slow economic times. Like most crown corporations SaskPower sourced debt through the provincial treasury.In the 1990s Saskatchewan was in poor financial health. Canadian financial institutions showed little interest in buying Saskatchewan debt and the province faced relatively high credit spreads over Canadian treasuries. Therefore the province deemed it advantageous to borrow in the United States where its debt was better received and interest rates on long-term debt were significantly lower. SaskPower made five U.S. debt issues between 1990 and 1993 totalling US$619 million in principal and maturing 10 to 30 years later (see Exhibit 2). The exchange rate at issue averaged CA$1.22 per U.S. dollar or US$0.82 per Canadian dollar and the debt was worth CA$755 million. SaskPowerâs all-in cost of its U.S. debt was much lower than the typical equivalent Canadian dollar debt. On average it was 160 basis points lower or 17 per cent lower than what the Canadian dollar debtâs all-in cost would have been. Therefore the U.S. dollar would need to move up a long way before the Canadian dollar cost of servicing the U.S. debt exceeded what the cost would have been if SaskPower had chosen to borrow in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 2). The U.S. dollar debt carried semi-annual coupon payments. The debt was non-callable and non-convertible. Being primarily held by institutional investors it had little to no market float. Accounting Policy Change and Exchange Rate UncertaintyAt the time the accounting standard that SaskPower followed was the Canadian version of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Foreign exchange translation adjustments that resulted from year-end revaluation of the U.S. debt were amortized over the remaining term of the debt. The Canadian dollarâs value deteriorated for most of the 1990s which meant that the U.S. dollar appreciated in value (see Exhibit 3) creating a build-up of unrealized foreign exchange losses. A portion of these losses was amortized annually although these were non-cash chargesâno additional funds were required until the debt matured. The amortization was an amount of multi-million dollars per year; however it was offset by significant reductions in actual finance charge payments as SaskPowerâs debt declined sharply over the 1990s. The amortized exchange losses were CA$8 million for 1999 and CA$9 million for 2000. At the end of 1999 unamortized foreign exchange losses were CA$97 million.In 2001 SaskPower adopted a new accounting policy in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. The new policy required all foreign currency translation differences to be recognized and recorded as a gain or loss in the current year. The purpose of this policy shift was to bring Canadian accounting practices in line with those of Europe and the United States. This change had a significant effect on SaskPowerâs financial results in 2001 increasing finance charges by CA$31 million and reducing net income to CA$29 million (see Exhibit 4). Repercussions of the accounting policy change were rather fundamental. Stakeholders started questioning why SaskPower had U.S. debt in the first place. Some of the unrealized foreign exchange losses were reversed during the first eight months of 2002. The Canadian dollar increased from US$0.6279 on December 31 2001 to US$0.6415 on August 30 2002 (i.e. the U.S. dollar dropped from CA$1.5926 to CA$1.5588) resulting in a year-to-date foreign exchange gain of CA$15.5 million. Estimates for foreign exchange gains for the year were approximately CA$15 million based on a forecast closing rate of CA$1.00 = US$0.64. However this estimate was highly unreliable due to the recent volatility in the exchange rate the disagreement among foreign exchange analysts on the value of the Canadian dollar and past forecast errors. With each US$0.01 change in the value of the Canadian dollar translating into a change of approximately CA$12 million (increase or decrease) in SaskPowerâs net income possibilities were wide-ranging (positive or negative) for the yearâs results. These foreign exchange gains or losses complicated the setting of electricity rates. In most utilities the total asset base was allowed to earn an approved rate of return referred to as a âreturn on rate base.â SaskPower used a less formal process but still required approval from the government. The process focused on the expected net income that would result from the approved rate adjustment. Finance charges would normally be predictable if they were based on long-term fixed rate debt. However the significant exposure to the U.S. dollar generated large unpredictable swings in net income which could not be accommodated in the rate-setting process.Plan of Action Market sentiment about the Canadian dollar was negative towards the end of 2002 with expectations of additional weakness. There was extensive discussion in the business press of the differences between the Canadian and American economies where the focus was tax policy and general fundamentals. The tone of the discussion on the Canadian economy seemed bearish. Given this outlook and in order to manage the volatility in net income caused by the U.S. debt SaskPowerâs treasury group entertained and then promoted the strategy of hedging all the U.S. debt. Currency swaps emerged as the most appropriate hedging tool. Currency SwapsForeign currency swaps were derivative instruments that allowed an entity to change the currency denomination of its assets (cash inflows) or liabilities (cash outflows). A company for example could swap the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt for equivalent interest and principal payments in another currency effectively transforming the existing debt into a comparable-value debt that was denominated in the other currency. Currency swaps were over-the-counter contracts negotiated between a company and a financial institution. A currency swap could be structured in several forms. For example it could involve the swapping of a newly-issued debt for an equal-value debt in another currency. In this case the counterparties at the outset exchanged the debt issue proceeds for an equivalent amount in the other currency. Then they exchanged interest and principal payments over the term of the debt. A swap could also involve the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt or it could involve swapping only interest payments.Plain vanilla currency swaps called for the exchange of fixed interest payments in one currency for fixed interest payments in another currency (with or without an exchange of the principal). Currency swaps could also involve the swapping of fixed interest payments in one currency for floating or adjustable payments in another currency. The floating payments in this case would be indexed to a benchmark short-term interest rate in the respective currency. Given the nature of SaskPowerâs assets management considered swapping its outstanding long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar debt for Canadian dollar debt with equal term and similarly fixed interest rates. Hedging OptionsSaskPowerâs management recommended a hedging program to its board of directors as part of the companyâs 2003â2007 business plan. Convinced that the status quo or simply doing nothing was not an option management provided two possible hedging options for the company to pursue in regard to managing its U.S. debt.  Option 1: Lock In All Remaining U.S. Debt NowThis option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk by converting all future U.S. debt payments starting at the beginning of 2003 to fixed Canadian dollar payments. In return SaskPower would give up the upside potential if the Canadian dollar were to appreciate. Even though market conditions had changed drastically since the U.S. debt was issued the hedged all-in costs based on swap rates in December 2002 would have been near the costs that SaskPower would have paid if it had originally borrowed in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 5).Option 2: Phase-In Hedges Over the Period Remaining Until December 31 2005This option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk before the end of the five-year business plan. SaskPower would be susceptible to currency movements in the interimâthe exposure would decrease as swaps were gradually entered intoâbut could benefit from a strengthening of the Canadian dollar. The key elements of this strategy were as follows:During the phase-in period the companyâs treasurer was to set a target range for the quarterly foreign exchange rate based on a consensus forecast which incorporated forecasts from a number of different agencies. Swaps would then be executed when the market exchange rate (Bank of Canada mid-noon rate) traded outside of the range. For added flexibility the treasurer had the discretion to execute a swap if the exchange rate was within the target range depending on the time remaining in the quarter current market conditions and the amount hedged to date. The unhedged principal amounts of the first three debt issues (maturing in 2003 2008 and 2013) totalling US$207 million would be fully hedged by the end of 2003. Priority would be given to these debt issues for two reasons: dealer spreads were tighter for swaps with shorter maturities; and the hedged all-in costs for these issues at the swap rates in December 2002 would be near the original equivalent Canadian dollar costs for these issues (see Exhibit 5). Thereafter an annual hedging target would be set to ensure that the remaining US$300 million debt issues were covered by December 31 of 2005.Whichever option was chosen SaskPower would structure the swaps in sums of US$25â50 million solicit quotes from multiple dealers and spread the deals over many banks to reduce credit risk. the decisionHaving read the management teamâs recommendations and reviewed the data provided James agreed with management that a course of action needed to be takenâdoing nothing was not an option. He pondered the details of a proposed swap for US$25 million of the 2008 debt issue. The U.S. dollar principal amount would be swapped for CA$35.6 million and the 7.125 per cent coupon rate on the U.S. dollar principal starting with the payment on September 15 2003 would be swapped for an 8.875 per cent coupon rate on the Canadian dollar principal (see Exhibit 6). However to ensure the most effective financial position for SaskPower James had to decide between hedging option 1 or option 2.Exhibit 1: Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year 2001Exhibit 1 (continued)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Breakdown of U.S. Dollar DebtNote:* This is the estimated all-in-cost if SaskPower had originally issued Canadian dollar debt.

This note provides a guide to options trading for entry-level traders and represents a logical next stage to the note An Introduction to the Pricing of Options. The note reviews characteristics of options and the factors affecting their valuation and outlines several trading mechanisms that new options traders might use as they seek their most effective strategies. These mechanisms include long call short put bull call spread short call long put bear put spread short straddle short strangle long butterfly long straddle and long strangle. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION Options are financial products that derive their value from an underlying asset. They are leveraged financial instruments that allow traders to make a higher return on a smaller outlay than they might make by investing directly in the underlying asset. Options give traders increased exposure to changes in the value of the underlying asset; that is traders can profit and lose more with an option than with the underlying asset itself.Options are bought and sold. A buyer is said to take an option and is thus referred to as a taker. A seller is said to write the option and is thus referred to as the writer.There are two types of options: call options (calls) and put options (puts). Calls give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) before or at the expiration date of the option. Puts on the other hand give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date. Both calls and puts share the same uniform characteristics: premiums maturity strike price an underlying asset and option style.OPTION CHARACTERISTICSPremiumA premium is the amount a buyer pays to receive the option; that amount changes on a daily basis. When a trader buys an option (takes a long position) the trader pays the premium. When a seller writes an option (takes a short position) the seller receives the premium. The premium compensates the option seller for taking on the risks associated with writing the option.The premium for an option is the sum of the option’s intrinsic and time values. The intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. The time value represents the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the possibility that the market will move before the option expires. As the amount of time available decreases the opportunity to become profitable declines; this decline in value is referred to as time decay. Time value is influenced by several factors: market volatility time to expiry future dividends and interest rates.Maturity Maturity is the time remaining between the date the option is purchased and the date the option expires. The majority of options bought and sold have a maturity of a month. However the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) list both options that expire in a month and those that expire in a week providing traders with a choice of maturity. When deciding on a trading strategy traders need to consider when and over how much time (the time period) their predicted event or movement will occur. As the needed amount of time increases (the maturity gets longer) the associated premium increases because the option writer takes on a greater risk. Strike PriceStrike price is the predetermined price a buyer will pay if exercising the option to purchase the underlying asset. The strike price is locked in with the options contract. For instance on August 19 2016 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) stock was trading at A$73.12. Assume a trader believed the share price was going to rise so took a long position in a call option—that is took an option to purchase the underlying asset—with a strike price of $73.00. The trader would have the right to buy CBA shares at $73.00 regardless of the market price up to the option’s expiry date.Underlying AssetEach option derives its value from an underlying asset. Options on both the ASX and the CBOE derive their value from either equities or indexes. The CBA example discussed above under “Strike Price” would be classified as an equity option because the option value is derived from an individual company’s stock. In contrast the value of an index option is derived from the underlying index (e.g. S&P500). Options less frequently use commodities as the underlying asset; commodities traders prefer trading with other derivative instruments such as futures and forwards. Option StyleThere are two option styles available on the ASX: American and European. An American style option allows the option holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiry date; European style options in contrast can only be exercised at maturity. Index options are all European style while equity options can be either style based on trader preferences. CBOE equity options are all American style. American and European style options are the most frequently used styles; however there are numerous other styles. The styles vary mainly in terms of the rights to exercise the options; for example a Canary option allows the option holder to exercise the option at quarterly dates but not before a set period of time has elapsed. Another a Bermudan option gives the holder the right to exercise the option a set number of times prior to maturity. Contract SizeAll single stock options traded on the ASX have an initial standardized contract size of 100 underlying shares. On rare occasions the contract size may be adjusted to compensate for corporate actions on the underlying asset such as issuing new shares. In general a standardized contract size means a trader who has purchased a call option on CBA stock would have the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 CBA shares at the predetermined price any time up to the option’s maturity. Index options (e.g. XJO) are usually standardized at an index multiplier of $10 per index point movement.Equity options traded on CBOE also have a standard contract size of 100 shares; however their index options have varying amounts for the index multiplier dependent on the underlying index. Factors Influencing Option Price and ValueThere are several factors that affect the value and price of an option. When investing directly in an equity the trader’s only concern is price movement: did the share increase or decrease in price? The value of an option however depends on several factors: volatility intrinsic value movement of the underlying asset price expiry date interest rate changes and dividends.Volatility Volatility captures the variation in price expected in the underlying equity or in the case of index options the variation in the underlying index. The variation is measured by the standard deviation of returns; that is how much the price or index deviates from the mean. When an underlying equity asset is highly volatile the share price fluctuates widely increasing the chances that the anticipated price of the shares will be reached. The premium paid for the option is thus greater. When the implied volatility is low the price for the underlying equity is predicted to be reasonably constant and the premium paid for the option will be less. As implied volatility increases the value of both calls and puts increases and as implied volatility decreases option values decrease accordingly. The ASX and CBOE each have real-time volatility indices (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The ASX has the A-VIX which reflects expectations about volatility in Australia’s equity index the S&P/ASX 200 VIX. The CBOE tracks the Volatility Index (VIX) which is based on the S&P 500 Index. Both the A-VIX and the VIX provide insight to expectations of market volatility and the sentiment of futures traders. The A-VIX has a strong negative correlation (inverse relationship) with the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index (see Exhibit 3) and is therefore a useful tool for assessing the market trend and anticipated changes in volatility.Intrinsic Value The intrinsic value of an option is largely dependent on the strike price set in the option.If on August 19 2016 when the market price of CBA was $73.50 a trader took a long call position on CBA stock with a strike price of $65.00 the intrinsic value of the option would have been $8.50 (the difference between the market and strike prices). When a share price on the market is greater than the strike price in a call option (as in this example) the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). Option buyers pay a high premium for this valuable option.If on the same day another trader took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $73.50 the current market price and the strike price would be the same. This call option would be considered to be “at the money” (ATM). ATM options have no intrinsic value but because the market price is almost certainly going to change over time ATM options have the greatest time value. A premium for an ATM option is usually less than the premium for an ITM option. In the final scenario if yet another a trader on the same day took a long call position in CBA stock with a strike price of $75.00 the current market price would be less than the strike price. When the strike price is higher than the market price the call option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). OTM options have no intrinsic value and have a smaller chance of success than ITM or ATM options. OTM options require the most price movement in the underlying asset to be ITM. The premium on an OTM option is significantly less than the premiums for ITM and ATM options. Therefore the advantage to buying an OTM option is the potential even if small for a significant return on a very low premium. Movement of the Underlying Asset PriceThe price movements of the underlying asset play a key role in determining the value of an option. If the price of the underlying asset is increasing the value of a call option (the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a fixed lower price) increases and the value of a put option (the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a below market price) decreases. When the price of an underlying asset is decreasing the opposite is true: the value of call options decreases and the value of put options increases.Expiry DateThe more time there is before an option expires the greater the chance the option will end ITM. Time decay (decline in the opportunity to become profitable) has the greatest negative impact on the value of an option. Typically an option loses one-third of its time value in the first half of its life and the remaining two-thirds of time value in its second half. An OTM option approaching expiry will suffer the greatest drop in value. Interest Rate Changes Interest rate changes have a small but measurable impact on option prices. When interest rates increase call premiums increase and put premiums decrease. This occurs because call buyers have the right to purchase the underlying asset at any time up to expiry; until they decide to exercise their option (or not) call buyers can invest their funds at higher yielding risk-free rates. Call buyers in this case are earning income while holding the option. Put prices decrease because put buyers have the right to sell the underlying asset any time up to maturity. They are holding the underlying asset so do not have the ability to invest their funds at higher risk-free rates. Traders in this case have the benefit of purchasing put options at a lower premium.DividendsOption prices are affected by anticipated dividends to be paid on the underlying asset within the option’s term (i.e. before expiry). The general consensus is that when a dividend is paid out on a stock the share price will drop in proportion to the dividend paid. Therefore if a dividend of an underlying asset increases during the term of the option the value of the underlying asset will likely decrease before the option expires. This affects the option’s premium: call premiums decrease and put premiums increase. (When assessing the impact of dividends it is important to remember that a share’s ex-dividend date—the date when a declared dividend belongs to the holder of the stock—is usually earlier than the date the dividend payment will be made.)Option Value Sensitivity MeasuresDelta is a sensitivity measure comparing the change in an option’s price to the change in the price of the underlying asset. We can estimate the likely change in an option’s price by multiplying the underlying asset price change by the option’s delta. Delta also infers the intrinsic value of an option and constantly changes with price movements in the underlying asset.All call options have a delta range of zero to one. A delta below 0.5 implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly 0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta above 0.5 implies the option is ITM.All put options have a delta range of zero to negative one. A delta above −0.5 (approaching zero) implies the option is OTM; a delta of exactly −0.5 implies the option is ATM; and a delta below −0.5 (approaching negative one) implies the option is ITM.Vega is also a sensitivity measure. It measures the impact of changes in the underlying asset’s volatility on the option’s price. The vega of an option represents the amount that an option’s contract changes in relation to a 1 per cent change in the underlying asset’s volatility.Besides delta and vega there are other “Greeks” measuring option sensitivities. For example theta measures the change in an option’s price as the number of days until expiration decreases; theta is usually measured by one day. Rho measures an option’s change in premium if interest rates move by a specified percentage. Gamma measures the option’s delta change if the underlying asset moves by a specified percentage. (Further information on options Greeks is available on ASX’s website.)Options at ExpirationWhen an option expires—which for monthly single stock contracts listed on the ASX is every Thursday before the last Friday of the month and on the CBOE is the third Friday of the month—the option holder faces three alternatives: exercise the option sell the option or roll the option into another option if the held option is ATM or ITM. If the held option is OTM at expiration the option expires worthless. Tree diagrams demonstrate the call and put option holder’s choices at expiration (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Market Participants Options market participants include hedgers speculators arbitrageurs and market makers. Hedgers use options to reduce the risks associated with market uncertainty. Speculators use options to leverage into a position to capture gains based on the direction they believe a market is going. Arbitrageurs exploit imperfections and inefficiencies in the market often at very high speeds to make money. Market makers trade volatility (vega) as opposed to market movements (delta). Traders normally fall into the categories of hedgers or speculators. Brokers and dealers represent investors and place orders on their behalf for execution on the exchange (central market).There are four types of trades that an options market participant can make:Buy a call.Sell a call.Buy a put.Sell a put.Option holders called buyers or takers can choose whether or not to exercise the option. These participants could be hedging their current shareholdings from price risk or they could be investing in these leveraged derivatives to get greater exposure to the predicted price movement in their underlying asset. Losses for option holders are limited to the premium paid for the option (if the option expires OTM); however option holders have the potential to earn unlimited profits if the option expires ITM.Option providers called sellers or writers provide option holders with the right to exercise the option. That means that option providers are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder decides to exercise the option. Thus option providers limit their profit to the premium received for providing the option; however they have potentially unlimited losses if the option expires ITM (with the market price higher than the strike price). For this reason option sellers are required to lodge a margin to ensure they can meet their obligations if an undesirable outcome occurs. Exhibits 6 7 8 and 9 provide profit and payoff diagrams of the four options trades. The four trade types when combined in different ways create different strategies for trading options.ANALYSESAn options trader needs to be able to make a market prediction and set an investment goal before selecting a trading strategy.Market Prediction: What do you think will occur in the future?An options trader must first predict what will happen to an underlying asset over a given period. Most traders will use some type of analysis whether it be fundamental or technical to determine what they believe will happen to an underlying asset whether a stock or an index. The analysis should consider when and over what period of time the underlying asset is expected to move. For example a trader’s prediction may be linked to a type of planned market announcement such as company results or to a piece of economic news such as a change to the reserve bank cash rate.Once the investment period and expected price movement are calculated traders need to add their own (or their investors’) risk profiles to the decision to decide what strike price and maturity to use within an options strategy. It is fair to say that the more a trader risks the more a strategy will return.Investment Goal: What are you trying to accomplish using options?Knowing what is wanted from an investment will reduce the number of option strategies to those appropriate for reaching the desired goal. An investor may want to protect the value of held shares in the event the market goes down or an investor may want to earn extra income from held stocks while markets are flat. To illustrate these goals assume the market analysis indicates stock XYZ will rise 2 per cent in the next four months (the prediction) and the investor wants to earn extra income (the goal). A trader could sell a 102 per cent strike call option with a maturity of four months meaning the option holder can purchase the investor’s shares at 102 per cent of their value at any point during or at the end of the four months. The prediction is that the investor will not have to sell the shares (because the market and strike price are the same) and the investor earns the premium paid by the option buyer. However if the analysis is slightly out—say for example the investor’s stock goes up 2.5 per cent—the option holder will exercise the option to purchase the shares and the investor will need to deliver them meaning the investor will have sold the stock at a loss. If the trader was writing a call option to gain income on a stock position this would not be the desired result. To reduce the risk of the option being exercised (also called “assigned”) and keep the underlying stock the trader may want to consider writing a call option with a shorter maturity date (three months) or a higher strike price (103 per cent) or possibly both. In either case the option premium would be less.Tools for AnalysisTraders now have multiple tools they can use to analyze option strategies and choose which are the best to use under certain conditions. An example of one of these tools is the ASX/TradeFloor options trading simulator which was developed to help first-time options traders understand how options work. Within this application traders can review stocks they are interested in build different option strategies based on their views of where an underlying asset may trade in the future and manage their portfolios. The application allows traders to investigate the payoffs and risk profiles of using different strategies while also allowing the trader to see how a particular risk profile of a given strategy changes when using different strike prices and maturities.Fundamental AnalysisFundamental analysis involves evaluating the intrinsic value of a company. It involves the use of balance sheets financial reports cash flow statements public announcements earnings reports and all publicly available information to establish an opinion about the direction and outlook of the company. There are numerous methods for determining a fair share value; that value can then be compared to the current market price which in turn signals the direction of price movement. Earnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) provides information about the earnings attributable to each outstanding share. This ratio is easily calculated by dividing a company’s net profit after tax by its total number of shares outstanding. Traders prefer an EPS to be growing at a consistent rate which suggests a bullish outlook while a decreasing ratio implies a bearish outlook. Price to Earnings RatioThe price to earnings (P/E) ratio provides information about a company’s growth prospects and indicates whether the company’s shares are currently over under or fairly priced. The ratio is calculated by dividing the share’s current market price by its EPS. In isolation the P/E ratio is meaningless; for meaningful information a company’s P/E ratio needs to be compared to that of a similar company. The P/E growth (PEG) ratio further aids in determining whether an equity is under- or overpriced. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected rate of growth in EPS. A PEG ratio close to 2 suggests that the stock is overpriced and a PEG ratio of 1 suggests the stock may be fair value. DividendsWhen analyzing a company the trader must determine whether the company pays a regular dividend on the equity. A dividend that is maintained or increased from the previous year signals to the market that the company is in good financial health. A dividend that is reduced signals that the company does not have sufficient profits each year to pay its shareholders. To calculate a dividend per share ratio divide the sum set aside for dividends by the number of shares outstanding.Dividend yield is a good method for comparing dividends paid out from companies in similar industries. To calculate dividend yield divide the dividend payout per share by the current share price. Companies with growing dividend yields suggest a bullish outlook and companies with decreasing yields suggest a bearish outlook. Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) provides information about how well a company is using shareholders’ funds. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s after-tax profit by the shareholders’ equity. A high ROE suggests that management is making good use of shareholders’ funds while a low ROE suggests the contrary.Earnings ReportsIt is essential to know when companies are due to release any earnings reports or announcements. These releases can have a profound effect on share price. If a company were to report mass losses for a quarter the information could initiate a massive sell-off in the market which would cause a large drop in share price. Alternatively the company could publish profits higher than expected which would cause an increased demand for the company’s shares and hence a rise in share price. Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis consists of studying past market data specifically the price and volume to predict future price direction. There are a vast number of technical indicators that traders use to forecast price movements. In this note we will focus on the use of trend lines Bollinger bands moving average convergence divergence and relative strength indicators to evaluate a company.Trend Lines Trend lines are highly suggestive of the direction a stock price will move. Support and resistance lines are established for the desired period of time: the support line illustrates the lowest price traders believe the share will fall to and the resistance line indicates the highest share price traders believe the share will earn. Technical analysts believe that a share will trade between the two lines and that the price is unlikely to fall below a support line or rise above the resistance line. Analysts believe that if a resistance or support line is broken once it is broken the share price will continue in the direction of the breakout requiring a new resistance or support line to be established (see Exhibit 10).There are numerous patterns that technical analysts seek with trend lines (see Exhibits 11 and 12 for uptrend and downtrend respectively). An ascending triangle occurs when an up-trending support line approaches a flat resistance line. This suggests the share may well make a sharp move upward for an explosive breakout. A descending triangle where the down-trending resistance line approaches a flat support line signals the opposite—a large price drop (see Exhibit 13 for a descending trend line). Bollinger Bands Bollinger bands are used to establish a share’s short-term prices. The indicator is created by plotting the average predetermined number of prices. Two trading bands are then added representing the standard deviation of the share price one band above (the highest price) and the other below (the lowest price) the centre line. Simply adding and subtracting one standard deviation from the moving average creates the outer bands. Under normal market conditions the price of a security will trade within the bands. The bands will expand as the share price becomes more volatile and contract as volatility decreases.Bollinger bands help establish common trends. Periods of high volatility (expansion) tend to follow periods of low volatility (contraction). When the price of a share crosses the upper Bollinger band analysts believe the share is overbought and the price is due for a correction with a drop (a pullback). When the price crosses the lower band analysts believe the security is oversold and a price correction back up to its true value (rally back) is imminent (see Exhibit 14).Moving Average Convergence DivergenceMoving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that analysts use to establish a buy or sell signal. MACD illustrates the relationship between two moving price averages. The MACD is the result of subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD termed a signal line is then plotted on top of the MACD. When the MACD falls below the signal line it is a bearish signal. When the MACD rises above the signal line it is a bullish signal (see Exhibit 15). Relative Strength IndicatorA relative strength indicator (RSI) is also a momentum indicator; it compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to gauge the speed and change of a share’s price movements. RSI is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. If RSI values cross above 70 it is believed that the security is overbought and due for a pullback in price. If the RSI values cross below 30 the share is believed to be oversold and a price increase is due (see Exhibit 16).Option StrategiesThere are many option strategies available for varying market conditions. We will analyze a select few strategies for bullish bearish neutral and event-driven situations. It is important to understand the risks involved with trading options. Buying an option with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset will increase limits the buyer’s potential loss to the premium paid for the option. Providing or writing an option however exposes the trader to the potential of unlimited losses; for that reason the provider must have a margin account containing collateral. To analyze the selected strategies we will focus on the construction margin requirement market outlook and profit and loss of the strategies. For the purpose of explanation a hypothetical strike prices has been added for the following strategies. Bullish ViewBullish strategies do better in a rising market. They usually involve buying call options and selling put options to benefit from increasing asset prices.Long Call (see Exhibit 6)When a trader expects the price of the underlying stock to rise the bought call can provide leveraged exposure to the price increase. Buying a call also locks in a maximum purchase price for the life of the option.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will rise above A; volatility increasing.Profit: Unlimited profit potential if share price continues to rise (see Exhibit 6). Loss: Limited to premium paid.Break-even: Share price = strike price + premium paid.Intuition: Share price will rise above A; the call option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Effect of time decay works against the buyer of the call. If the expected rise in share price does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will erode the value of the option. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the cost of the option against the rise in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest rise in share price. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the best balance of risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for the share price to rise and will be more expensive than a shorter-term option. The trader needs to decide when and over what period of time the share price is expected to move. If the rise in share price takes place as expected the option buyer must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not rise as expected it is often advisable to exercise the option (“close out the position”) and recover some time value on the investment. If the option is ITM when it expires the trader must choose whether to sell the option or exercise it. The choice will be determined by whether the trader wants to own the underlying shares.Bull Call SpreadIf the trader is not bullish enough to buy a call outright but expects the share price to rise moderately the bull spread is a lower-cost way to gain exposure to such a market movement. The strategy consists of the simultaneous purchase of a call option (“long leg of the spread”) and sale of a call option with a higher strike price (“short leg of the spread”) but with the same expiration date.Construction: Buy one call at strike price A and sell a call at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bullish; market price to rise; volatility steady to rising.Profit: Limited to the difference between A and B (spread) less the premium paid for the spread.Loss: Limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = lower strike price + cost of spread.Intuition: Bought call A will be ATM (hence costly); therefore sell an OTM call with higher strike price B to receive a premium that reduces the overall cost of the strategy.Other points of consideration:The bull spread has limited risk and limited reward. It is a cheaper strategy than simply buying a call option. As a result the profit potential is reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is worth the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting will be greater for this strategy than when buying a call outright.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the option will cost money; however if the stock is trading around the higher strike price the option will make money.If the stock unexpectedly rises sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the upper strike price is reached. Although time value is helpful around the strike price of the short call unwinding the strategy early removes the risk that the short call will be exercised. If the stock price falls suddenly the spread may be unwound before the long call loses too much time value.Consider the bull spread when expecting a limited rise in the price of the stock. Do not enter the call options separately (“leg in” to the strategy). Enter the trade as a spread and unwind it as a spread. Bearish ViewBearish strategies work best in falling markets. Bearish strategies generally rely on buying put options to lock in selling prices as asset prices decrease.Long Put (see Exhibit 8)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to fall the bought put provides leveraged exposure to the price fall. Buying a put option is one of the few ways traders can speculate on a falling share price. Put options may also be used to protect an investor’s holding in the underlying stock.Construction: Buy one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to fall below A; volatility rising.Profit: Limited to strike price less premium paid for the option (see Exhibit 8).Loss: Limited to premium paid for the option.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium paid.Intuition: Share price will drop below strike price A; the put option’s value will increase accordingly for a profit.Other points of consideration:Time decay works against the buyer of the put. If the expected share price fall does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option. When setting the strike price the trader must balance the cost of the option against the fall in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will be the cheapest but will also require the largest fall in share price. If the trader is buying a put to protect a shareholding the cost of the option must be weighed against the required protection. The ITM option locks in the highest sale price for the underlying shares but is also the most expensive option.If the fall in share price takes place as expected the put option taker must decide whether to close out at a profit or maintain the position in the hope of a further increase in price. The longer the option position is left open the greater the effect of time decay.If the share price does not fall as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to recover some time value.At expiry the holder of an ITM put option will usually close out rather than exercise the position (unless the holder owns the underlying shares). If the put has been bought to protect a shareholding the trader must decide whether to continue holding the stock in which case the put would be sold or sell the shares in which case the option would be exercised.Short Call (see Exhibit 9)When the trader expects the price of the underlying stock to go down the sold call can provide leveraged exposure to the price reduction. Selling a call does not limit the trader’s potential loss so it carries a greater risk profile than purchasing a put.Construction: Sell one call at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bearish; share price will go below strike price A; volatility neutral to reducing.Profit: Maximum profit is premium received for providing the option (see Exhibit 9).Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received. Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed.Other points of consideration:Time decay works for the seller of the call. If the expected share price reduction does not take place soon after entering the position time decay will start to erode the value of the option to the seller’s advantage. The trader will usually have a choice of strike prices and must balance the premium received on the option against the reduction in share price required for the strategy to be successful. The OTM option will obtain the lowest premium but also carries the lowest chance of loss. Many traders regard the ATM option as offering the highest risk and reward. A longer-term option allows more time for a reduction in the share price to take place. It will generate a higher premium but it carries a greater risk of the market moving against the trader. The trader needs to identify the time period over which the share price movement is expected to take place. If the share price reduction takes place as expected the call option taker will normally not exercise the option. However if the stock price is ATM or ITM and the taker exercises the option the writer must deliver the stock.If the share price does not reduce as expected it is often advisable to close out the position to remove the risk of assignment if not already holding the underlying shares. This is called a “naked” position since you hold an option on shares you do not own and would have to acquire these shares if the option were exercised. Assignment risk brings the uncertainty associated with the pricing and timing of acquiring the shares before you can sell them.  Bear Put SpreadThe bear spread can be considered when the trader expects a moderate fall in the market but is not prepared to take a put position outright. The strategy consists of the purchase of a put option (“long leg”) and the sale of a put option with a lower strike price (“short leg”).Construction: Sell one put at strike price A and buy one put at strike price B.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Bearish; market price to expire below strike price A; volatility steady to increasing.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the difference between A and B (the spread) less the premium paid.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the spread.Break-even: Share price = upper strike − cost of spread.Intuition: Purchased put B will be ATM—hence fairly costly. Therefore sell an OTM put with a lower strike price A to receive a premium which decreases the total net cash outlay. Once the share price drops below strike price A the profit is capped. (A short position creates a loss; however this is counterbalanced by the purchased put being deep ITM.)Other points of consideration:The bear spread has limited risk and limited reward. It costs less to place than an outright purchase of a put option. As a result the potential for profit is also reduced. The trader must be satisfied that the cost of the spread is justified by the potential reward. Commission costs on entering and exiting can significantly reduce profitability.Time decay will vary depending upon where the share price is. If the market is around the lower strike price the impact of time decay will be positive and you will make money due to the strategy; if the stock is trading around the higher strike it will cost money to hold the strategy.If the stock unexpectedly falls sharply it may be advisable to exit the strategy once the lower strike price is reached. Time decay will benefit the spread around the lower strike price; however the trader will usually be more concerned with avoiding exercise on the short leg.If the stock price rises suddenly the spread may be unwound before the taken put loses too much time value.Use the bear spread when you are expecting a limited fall in the underlying stock. Do not leg in to this strategy; rather trade both options at the same time. Neutral ViewNeutral strategies work best in stagnant markets. They often involve balancing the purchase and sale of both call and put options to take advantage of any changes in underlying asset prices.Short Put (see Exhibit 7)The written put can provide the trader with extra income in flat to rising markets. It can also be used as a way to buy stock cheaply. This strategy is generally used when the trader expects the share price to remain steady or increase slightly over the life of the option.Construction: Sell one put at strike price A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Bullish view on stock; share price will expire above A; volatility falling.Profit: Limited to premium received (see Exhibit 7).Loss: Maximum loss equals strike price A less premium received.Break-even: Share price = strike price − premium received.Intuition: The option will expire worthless; the premium received for providing the option will be pocketed. Other points of consideration:Many traders write put options as a way of buying stock cheaply. If the share price falls and the option is exercised the purchase price is effectively the strike price of the option less the premium received which is less than the price of the stock at the time of writing the option. If the share price at expiry is above the strike price the option will expire worthless. The trader does not get to buy the stock but has benefited from the receipt of the premium. Time decay works in favour of the put writer. If the stock price stays steady the ATM option will deliver the most profit to the put writer because this is the option with the most time value. The put writer must be wary of exercising the option too early. Generally a put option is more likely than a call option to be exercised early. This strategy can result in heavy losses if the share price falls significantly. Puts should only be written if the seller has the financial capacity to buy the underlying shares should the option be exercised. Monitor the position closely. An ITM option will need to be closed to avoid exercise. Short StraddleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short straddle may be considered. This strategy has a higher potential profit than the short strangle; however it offers less protection since the share price remains within a tighter price range in order to profit. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Sell one call at A and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: Neutral; share price will expire around A; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit limited to combined premium received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium received.Intuition: The break-even point for the sold call A is the strike price plus the premium received. For the sold put A the break-even point is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader expects the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option to expire worthless and the premiums received to be pocketed. Other points of consideration:The straddle yields higher potential profit than the strangle because of the higher premiums received for writing ATM options. However the strategy provides less protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price does not have to move as much before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. The short straddle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. There is high risk of early exercise on one of the written options making up the straddle because both the call and the put have the same exercise price. Unless the stock price closes at the strike level set in the options one of the options will be ITM and more than likely be exercised.The options trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down (by increasing or decreasing the strike prices in one of the options) thereby creating a strangle.Because the potential is for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. Do not choose distant expiry months. Short StrangleWhen option premiums are overpriced and the trader believes the underlying shares will stay within a narrow price range the short strangle may be considered. This strategy has a lower potential profit than the short straddle; however it offers greater protection because the share price must move further to cause a loss. The strategy consists of the sale of a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Sell one call at B and sell one put at A.Margin requirement: YesMarket outlook: The option will expire between strike prices A and B; volatility falling.Profit: Maximum profit is limited to the combined premiums received for providing options.Loss: Maximum loss is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less the premiums received.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium received; Share price = lower strike − premium received.Intuition: The intuition for the short straddle also applies here. The difference is that with the short strangle both options have distinctive strike prices. This extends the spread (bounds) within which the trader expects the share price to remain. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while the short straddle is better in a less volatile environment. Other points of consideration:The strangle yields lower potential profit than the straddle because the premiums are lower for writing OTM options. However the strategy provides better protection against an unexpected increase in volatility in the underlying shares because the share price has to move further before the strategy incurs a loss for the writer. As with the short straddle the short strangle benefits from time decay. It is often best to construct this combination using options with near-month expiries to gain the most from time decay. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options there is a lower risk of early exercise than for the straddle. However a dramatic change in the share price can bring one of the options ITM thereby introducing the risk of exercise. The option trader may choose to limit potential losses by purchasing protection. Taking a call and a put both of which are further OTM than the written options places a ceiling on losses. While the cost of taking these options reduces potential profit it may be worthwhile for the conservative trader. By taking protection the short strangle is transformed into another strategy known as a “long condor.” If the share price stays within a narrow band as expected the position may be maintained until near expiry in order to gain the maximum benefits from time decay.If the share price makes an unexpected move the trader should consider closing out the option that would be in danger of being exercised. Another alternative is to vary the break-even points of the strategy by rolling one of the legs up or down thereby maintaining the strangle. The trader should always be aware that although the short strangle is a more defensive strategy than the short straddle a sudden and extreme change in volatility can be very damaging.Because of the potential for unlimited losses be sure that the premium received is worth the risk taken. A trader should use the short strangle over the short straddle if there are any doubts about the market’s neutrality. Do not choose expiry months that are too distant. Long ButterflyThe long butterfly can be used to generate extra income when the trader believes the market is stagnating but does not want to be exposed to an unexpected rise or fall. The strategy consists of buying one ITM and one OTM call and writing two ATM calls.Construction: Buy one call at A sell one call and one put at B and buy one put at C.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Neutral; market price will expire around B; volatility reducing.Profit: Maximum profit will occur at strike price B.Break-even: Share price = lowest strike price (A) + the cost of strategy; Share price = central strike price (B) − the cost of strategy.Loss: The maximum loss is limited to the premiums paid for the strategy.Other points of consideration:The maximum profit from the long butterfly will be earned if the market finishes at the middle strike price when the options expire. In this case only the lower strike price call will finish ITM. Accordingly the trader will profit on the difference between the middle and lower strike prices less the cost of the spread. Most of this profit will develop in the last month as time decay accelerates. The most the trader can lose is the cost of the spread which will occur if the market finishes out past either “wing” of the long butterfly.The presence of short options in the strategy means that an increase in the market price above the central strike price introduces the risk of exercise. The long butterfly can be difficult to place in all but the most liquid stocks. The ATM options that are required on both sides are often thinly traded (exchanged in low volumes with limited interested traders) making the strategy difficult and sometimes costly to set up and trade out. In these circumstances the reward may not justify the effort of entering the position. If the share price remains steady the position may be left until close to expiry since the profit develops almost entirely in the last month.If the share price moves sharply up the trader may consider liquidating the position in order to avoid exercise. If the share price moves sharply down the trader may close out in order to salvage some time value from the taken options in the strategy.Be sure the rewards are sufficient to justify establishing the strategy in the first place. Do not use this strategy on thinly traded stocks. Enter the position with at least a month until expiry.Event Driven (Price Break Out)Long StraddleWhen the trader expects a sharp movement in the share price but is unsure of the direction the movement will take the long straddle may be appropriate. The strategy consists of buying a call option and a put option with the same strike price.Construction: Buy one call at A and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside; on the downside the maximum profit is limited to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = strike price +/− premium paid.Intuition: The break-even point for the bought call A is the strike price plus the premium received. The break-even for the bought put A is the strike price less the premium received. These distinctive break-even points create a spread in which the trader does not expect the underlying asset to remain hence causing the option value to increase. Other points of consideration:The bought straddle consists of two long positions. As a result time decay works strongly against the strategy. The longer the straddle is left in place the greater the loss due to time decay. The position must therefore be closely monitored and may need to be closed out well before expiry. The trader must balance the cost of the strategy against the time needed to give it the best chance of success. Distant expiry months will provide the strategy with more time; however longer-dated options will be more expensive than those with shorter dates. The taker of a straddle expects volatility in the market to increase. Only rarely will this strategy be held to expiry. If the trader’s market view proves correct the straddle should be unwound to crystallize the profits. The position can be liquidated on both sides simultaneously or if the OTM option has little value it could be left open in the event the market were to reverse.If volatility does not increase as expected the strategy should be unwound well ahead of expiry before time decay damages the position.Choose options over shares if the market is expected to remain or become volatile. Select an expiry month that gives the strategy time to work. Monitor the position closely and be prepared to unwind it well before expiry. Long StrangleWhen implied volatility is relatively low but the trader expects the stock price to make an explosive move buying a strangle may be appropriate. The strangle is cheaper than the straddle; however a larger move in the share price is required for the strangle to be profitable. The strategy consists of buying a call option with a higher strike price and a put option with a lower strike price.Construction: Buy one call at B and buy one put at A.Margin requirement: NoMarket outlook: Volatile; unsure of the direction of stock—however a large price movement is imminent.Profit: Maximum profit is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside to the strike price less premiums received.Loss: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the options.Break-even: Share price = higher strike + premium; Share price = lower strike − premium.Intuition: The intuition for the long straddle also applies to the long strangle. The difference is that both options have distinctive strike prices which broadens the spread (bounds) that the trader expects the share price to exceed. This strategy would be beneficial for an underlying asset with higher implied volatility while long straddle is more beneficial in a less volatile environment.Other points of consideration:As with the long straddle the long strangle is exposed to time decay. Since both options are OTM they consist entirely of time value. As expiry approaches time decay accelerates. For this reason the strangle is generally unwound well before expiry. Because the strangle is constructed using OTM options it costs less than the straddle. The disadvantage is that the share price must move further for the strategy to be profitable. The trader must be expecting a significant move for the long strangle to be considered. If the expected increase in volatility or change in share price is not achieved both options will expire worthless.The strangle should not be held too close to expiry. If the expected move in the share price has taken place the position can usually be unwound at a profit well before expiry. If the stock’s direction becomes clear it may be appropriate to close out the option that is losing its value and continue to hold the profitable option.If the expected increase in volatility does not take place it may be advisable to close the position out before time decay starts to damage the strategy.Choose options over shares when the share price is expected to move strongly in either direction. Always be aware of the effects of time decay and do not hold the position too close to expiry. Choose expiry months that allow enough time for the underlying shares to move. ALTERNATIVES TO TRADING OPTIONSThere are a number of alternative products that can be used by traders to obtain a leveraged investment profile similar to that of options. These products include warrants futures and contracts for difference (CFDs).In order to compare the appropriateness of using an option instead of an alternative product the trader needs to consider the following questions:What is the delta exposure of the product and does this change?Can I write (short) the product?Is margin charged and if so to whom?Is the product traded on exchange or over the counter (OTC)?Who issues the product?How is the market price determined?WarrantsWarrants are very similar to options in that they have rights but not obligations to purchase or sell an underlying product at a given date. Warrants can also have varying degrees of delta just like options. However warrants are issued by companies either on exchange or OTC as opposed to exchange-traded options (ETOs) which are listed by the exchange. Traders cannot write warrants like they can options. Warrants normally have longer expiries than options. The issuer (or appointed market maker) of the warrant product is the only one allowed to write meaning the issuer dictates the price. Options allow all participants to buy and sell creating a more efficient market. Because warrants can only be purchased they do not require a margin to be lodged. ETOs also do not require a margin to be lodged if purchasing but they do require a margin if selling. FuturesFutures are highly leveraged products that give users the ability to hedge or speculate on price movements of an underlying product. The primary difference between options and futures is that an options contract contains the right to buy or sell the underlying asset; equity futures on the other hand are traditionally cash settled at expiry. Futures are a delta one product whereas options have a delta range of between minus one and one. Margins are required to be lodged against futures positions for both the long and short holder of the contract and this can change daily. For options only the seller is required to post a margin. Both futures and options are listed on exchanges and the market users set the prices. However in Australia retail access to trade futures is limited to available brokers as compared to traders’ access to options.CFDsA CFD is a varied futures style product that gives the holder delta one exposure to the underlying asset. The contract normally settles a cash amount between the buyer and seller daily based on the change to the value of the underlying asset over the day. This is separate from a daily change in margin. CFDs are traditionally highly leveraged and require margins to be posted. CFDs are traditionally traded on an OTC market where the market price is ultimately determined by the CFD provider. This can on occasion lead to variations in price from the true underlying market price. The cost for trading CFDs is normally less than for options and futures listed on a traditional exchange. A trader should be mindful though that CFDs are not suitable for a buy-and-hold strategy due to the daily interest changes being applied to the trader’s account based on the notional exposure. It is also important to note that the risks associated with CFDs are higher due to the less stringent regulatory framework in which CFD product providers operate.Considering the above options provide traders with greater flexibility than competing products. Options not only allow traders the ability to trade underlying movement (delta) but also volatility (vega). What this equates to is a marketplace where the buyer and seller can both benefit from a trade. In addition the strategies discussed earlier in the note can only be achieved using different combinations of options and this ultimately enables traders to achieve a better risk–return profile and a closer match to their goals for investment. EVALUATIONBefore implementing any strategy traders must determine what they think the market is going to do over a given period of time. Once the prediction is established traders can implement a corresponding strategy based on the market outlook for the respective equity (or index) to exploit the expected condition. Understanding how the respective market index is calculated and making use of the tools outlined above greatly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. In Australia the companies listed on S&P/ASX 200 are ranked based on market capitalization. The top 20 listed companies will affect the movement of the S&P/ASX 200 index more than the other companies. As previously noted the A-VIX is inversely correlated to the S&P/ASX 200. The A-VIX exhibits mean reversion (i.e. oscillates around a long-term average); hence a trader can try to predict where the market is heading and further anticipate the general direction of the top 20 equities that will cause the most likely trend. When implementing investment strategies traders must choose the strike price spread size and maturity month for the options. Strike prices are set according to the desired outcome; their intrinsic value is a key determinant in the premium paid. On a spread trade (where several calls and puts are employed) the respective option strike price creates the boundaries in which a trader expects the underlying asset to remain (or exceed). The majority of options are traded in the short term with outlooks of a month or two primarily because there is more certainty over the short term about an anticipated underlying trend. There are numerous online calculators that check the risk and potential profitability of an option’s position. The calculators make use of a simple Monte Carlo simulator that allows the trader to enter the current underlying asset market price the target price days remaining to expiry and the annual volatility percentage (from the respective volatility index). The results provide traders with information about the probability of the underlying asset being above or below the target price.Prior to implementing any strategy traders need to outline and understand the associated costs risks potential profit potential losses and potential impact of time decay on the strategy. The long call long put bull call spread bear put spread long straddle and long strangle are low-cost strategies that require no margin are easy to implement and provide the desired leveraged exposure to the underlying asset. The short call short put short strangle long butterfly and short straddle all require margin accounts because the risk involved with these strategies is higher. CONCLUSIONOptions trading strategies can result in great returns and can achieve a much better tailored risk profile than alternative products. An entry-level trader can use strategies that do not include margins are low cost and are relatively easy to implement. In order to be successful and achieve the best outcome traders must do the required pre-investment analysis and understand the factors that affect the value of the options.EXHIBIT 1: INDEX PRICES FOR S&P/ASX 200 VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 2: INDEX PRICES FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE VIX (01/02/2008–01/09/2017)Source: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 3: INDEX PRICES FOR THE S&P/ASX 200 INDEX VERSUS A-VIXSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 4: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING CALL OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.EXHIBIT 5: TREE DIAGRAM OUTLINING PUT OPTION HOLDER’S ALTERNATIVES AT EXPIRATIONSource: Created by the authors.

Singh the chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Networks India (Sony) was sitting in his office in the Malad suburb of Mumbai India wondering what to do about some impending problems. Singh was concerned about the future of the television show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah (TMKOC) which aired on the television channel Sri Adhikari Brothers Television (SAB TV) a general entertainment channel (GEC) owned by Sony. TMKOC was a flagship family-friendly comedy show that had enjoyed top ratings for years. However new comedy shows that featured edgier and less family-oriented content with jokes at the expense of characters rather than at situations were gaining new viewers. Current viewers were also using mobile devices rather than traditional television sets to watch content; SAB TVâs online platform was less popular than those of their competition. Singh was concerned about how to sustain SAB TV as a market leader despite the growing popularity of unsavoury content from new comedy shows and emerging digital platforms (see Exhibit 1). What steps could Singh take to ensure that SAB TVâs high ratings would continue?OVERVIEW OF INDIAâs MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYIndiaâs media and entertainment (M&E) industry was among the fastest-growing in the world with television radio film print and the Internet among the various platforms available to 1.324 billion potential consumers. To date television had been the top revenue-generating platform. In 2016 Indiaâs television industry was worth â¹588 billion of a total M&E industry valued at â¹1.262 trillion.Television was introduced in India in 1959 under the monopoly of the public broadcaster Doordarshan. In 1991 during the Gulf War the US Cable News Network (CNN) started transmitting television content to India via satellite thus giving the country its first taste of private television. With globalization becoming a trend during that time India allowed private television to grow without stringent regulations which led to a tenfold growth in the consumption of television content. During this first phase Indian television was flooded with foreign programming. However in October 1992 Zee TV began providing Indian viewers with local content on private satellite channels. Zee TV had established a 50/50 joint venture Star TV to make this possible. By 2017 Indiaâs television industry had 877 granted satellite television channels. During that same period the industry catered to 183 million television households roughly equivalent to 870 million individuals. The television industry in India was expected to grow to â¹1.166 trillion by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 per cent. In 2016 an average Indian viewer spent three hours and 16 minutes per day watching television.In 2008 Indiaâs television industry was worth â¹245 billion and was growing at a rate of 9.3 per cent compared to 17.4 per cent annual growth between 2004 and 2008. Of the total revenue in 2008 61 perÂ cent was generated from distribution and 34 per cent was earned from advertising. Total revenue from cable and satellite television households amounted to â¹118 million.The 2008 financial crisis had an adverse effect on the television industryâespecially in regard to advertising revenue. Television channels realized that to remain in operation they had to increase consumption despite severe challenges including rising production and marketing costs restricted funding investment in both analogue and digital distribution retrenchments and the addition of four new GECs: 9X Colors TV New Delhi Television (NDTV) Imagine and Real. Although the share of viewership was being divided among even more channels greater competition was helping raise the overall quality of programming. As a result viewership for GECs increased from 900 gross rating points (GRPs) to 1200 GRPs in less than a year for 33 per cent growth.In 2017 the M&E industry grew at a rate of 11.2 per cent for a total revenue of â¹660 billion. Cable and satellite penetration of the country reached a high of 64 per cent with access to 780 million individuals in 183 million households while television penetration was at 52 per cent in rural areas. Each day Indians were spending an average of over three hours and 44 minutes watching television and 77 per cent of total viewership came from GECs and film channels. Government initiatives such as demonetization and the introduction of a goods and services tax complicated the industryâs attempts to recover losses from slower periods but content creators experimented with new genres and ideas to increase viewership. Sri Adhikari Brothers TelevisionSAB TV was founded by Gautam Adhikari the current chairperson and director. The television channel was incorporated in December 1994 and listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 1999. Since April 2000 the Doordarshan channel ran syndicated content such as comedy shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Shrimaan Shrimati and Zabaan Sambhalke (see Exhibit 2). With 1305 hours of content and related assets SAB TV was acquired in March 2005 by Sony Entertainment Television (later renamed Sony Pictures Networks India) which eventually owned 31 channels. The network positioned SAB TV as a channel for young people and broadcast International Cricket Conference World Cup 2007 matches in Hindi. However when India failed to qualify to the group stage in cricket that year Sonyâs plan to expand the viewership of the channel did not go as expected. Singh said âWhen we came back with the second season of all the showsâSAB had taken a season break on all its successful shows during 45 days of World Cupâthe loyalists had moved on.â In June 2008 SAB TV was repositioned as a comedy GEC as was originally intended before Sonyâs purchase and Sony looked for a cost-effective show to help it increase viewership over the long run. TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH In 2006 Asit Modi proposed a new show TMKOC to Singh. Modi was the founder of Neela Tele Films Private Limited. Modi pitched TMKOC as a show about the comic interplay between multicultural residents of a residential society called Gokuldham (see Exhibit 3) in their day-to-day lives supplemented with social commentary. TMKOC was inspired by the 1970s popular magazine column âDuniya Ne Undha Chasmaâ written by humourist Taarak Mehta for the Gujarati magazine Chitralekha. Singh offered to commission Modiâs show specifically for SAB TV rather than for the entire Sony network which Modi found disappointing because SAB TV had only 25 GRPs at the time. However Singh stressed that the show would be a good fit because SAB TV was being reinvented as a comedy channel from the former youth-based content. Modi had previously pitched the show idea to Sony six times without success. On one occasion the creative team suggested that Modi include a female protagonist in the show but as Modi had always visualized the main character Jethalal as the focus of the show and was not prepared to change he turned down the offer. After a proposal to Disney Channel the entertainment giant asked that the grandson character Tapu be portrayed as less mischievous but Modi refused that offer as well. Zee TV and Star TV had also rejected the show proposal. Modi would narrate stories from his show idea to his family for their feedback. His seven-year-old son enjoyed listening to the stories. Eventually with persuasion from his wife Modi accepted Singhâs offer to air the show on SAB TV. Singhâs team drafted an agreement for 104 episodes of TMKOC; however Modi asked for a base agreement of at least 208 episodes. âI was thinking that 104 episodes will get over in six months and so artists will feel insecureâ Modi said. He was asked by SAB TV to keep to a low budget for the showâs set but Modi opted for more permanent construction which would last at least two years in case the show became successful. This plan required Modi to invest more of his own funds without a long-term commitment by SAB TV. Despite uncertainties Modi believed in the show enough to endure the high initial investment. After Singh approved the contract for 208 episodes TMKOC aired on July 28 2008 as a daily (Monday to Friday) comedy sitcom.  THE BEGINNING For the first six months TMKOC garnered less than 0.5 television rating points (TRP). The low ratings coincided with SAB TVâs operation during a recession. Still Singh upheld his conviction in the show. Modi was also learning along the way. During the first two months of the show an issue would be covered over two consecutive episodes. Around episode number 40 the storyline revolved around Janmashtmi an annual Hindu festival that celebrated the birth of the Indian god Krishna. During that time the showâs TRP increased to 0.7 from the usual 0.3 or 0.4 rating and viewers expressed a desire for more episodes on the same theme. Realizing that people were interested in stories Modi decided to run each storyline for more than two episodes. âI got a grip on storytellingâ he said. After six months of airing episodes TMKOC had arrived at its inflection point a significant change in the situation as Singh realized: âIf we stay true to the core Indian values of joint family and community living this show will appeal to the masses.â Modi also believed in incorporating core family values as well as joint family systems in his showâs content.CONSUMER INSIGHTS Modi had been a regular reader of Mehtaâs writing during his high school years. For his show he altered some of the characters in Mehtaâs magazine column which was written in 1972 to suit the current times. For example he replaced the âHimmatlal masterâ character with a Marathi-speaking teacher to attract more Marathi viewers to the show. He also included Punjabi and Tamil families in the show to attract a wider viewership.Mehtaâs column was originally based in a low-income tenement neighbourhood (known as a chawl in India) but Modi moved the setting to a more appealing housing co-operative (known as a residential society in India) where many different families lived and interacted regularly. During the showâs development Modi had visited various chawls in the Mumbai suburbs of Bhuleshwar Kalbadevi and others to see how people lived but he realized that chawls had changed over time from the setting Mehta had depicted in her column in 1972. Modi decided instead to creating a housing co-operative for the show where different families lived like one large family which he thought would appeal to everyday people. He applied the insights he had gathered and an Indian mindset to the showâs joint family system.Modi created relatable and innocent characters like Tapu Sena (a mischievous group of children); Daya (Jethalalâs wife) who broke into dance (the Indian Garba) on any happy occasion; and Popatlal with his characteristic umbrella. He highlighted the bond between grandfather and grandson in the show. Moreover he visualized Gokuldham society itself as a character.Modi also adapted the show to reflect viewer feedback. For example when a particular ghost storyline had covered four episodes of TMKOC Modi planned to get to the storyâs climax over the next three or four episodes. However after a viewer told Modi that he was curious how Daya would engage with the ghost which Modi had not yet considered he asked the showâs writers to extend the storyline over 16 episodes to accommodate more character interactions.Regarding some aspects of the show however Modi was inflexible. For example he insisted on having a narrator in the show despite some viewer reactions that the narrator slowed the action in the show.Modi brought to life everyday situations through actors who portrayed lovable people-next-door characters. The episodes were based on events that viewers found familiar. âWe had to think what people would expect in terms of story on this Ganesh Chaturthiâ stated Modi referring to the 10-day festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesh. âWhat is the political environment? How is the husband and wife relationship changing?â The scenes of celebration such as Janmashtmi and Ganesh Chaturthi that Modi included in the show where portrayed as larger-than-life just like in a mega-budget show. TMKOC also addressed current events like the Indian governmentâs demonetization initiative. Other stories from the show that sparked viewer attention included the ghost in Gokuldham the Gokuldham Premier League Tapuâs child marriage and Jethalal in Pakistan.Throughout the journey of developing the show over the years Modi was in constant touch with key stakeholders. At gatherings parties and social visits at home or in public he was constantly seeking consumer insights. CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHANNEL Although TMKOCâs TRP ratings were only at 0.3 at the start all other SAB TV shows had lower ratings (around 0.2 TRP). At the showâs first party SAB TV staff members worried that no one was interested in the channel but Modi reassured Singh: âI believe that if the program is good people will come searching for the channel.âTMKOC eventually became important to the channel for more than just viewership as Singh explained. âWhen you have a driver like this it also gets a lot of revenue riding on it.âTMKOCâs success helped SAB TV hold its position in the industry much like the hit show Kaun Banega Crorepati was influential in the success of Star Plus. In fact TMKOC kept increasing its viewership beyond the showâs 10th season. According to data from the Broadcast Audience Research Council of India in 2017 TMKOC topped the rating charts between June 17 and June 23 surpassing some of the biggest shows on Indian television including Naagin 2 and Kumkum Bhagya (see Exhibit 2).According to Modi TMKOC was the number-one show in the 4â14 age group surpassing both Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. The show was also popular among those aged 35 and over. Modi admitted however that viewership for the show was low in the 15â35 age group which was the main viewership of Star TV and Colors TV.In 2016 Jethalal and Daya were among the top 10 fictional characters on Hindi television which reflected the popularity of the show in its 10th year (see Exhibit 1). Modi advised the actors that their characters would remain popular as long as they did not allow vanity to affect their work. Modi was also concerned about the actors growing older which had to reflect their characters. However Modi was pleased with the showâs success to date:The show not only grew in the last decade it also fetched better time spent than many other shows in the 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. slot on Indian television. Constant innovations in storytelling look-feel and characters as per the changing times could have helped us achieve this.  ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS CASE Modi thought back to the ideation of TMKOC around year 2000 when the television environment was changing. âMost of the weekly shows stopped and the era of daily soaps beganâ he said. Shows like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ki were launched around that time (see Exhibit 2). Within the comedy category other shows also suffered; for example Sarabhai vs Sarabhai lost viewership  when it ran as a weekly show. Modi had produced many successful weekly comedy shows such as Hum Sab Ek Hain (for Sony) Yeh Duniya Hai Rangeen Meri Biwi Wonderful and others (see Exhibit 2). He felt that a daily show was needed to fit the new trend but demand for comedy was declining. âWhenever I would pitch comedy the other person would put the phone down as there was a demand of typical family drama that revolved around saas-bahu (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law) conflicts.â But he found that humour was a missing element in day-to-day life so he wanted to deliver a light-hearted show to viewers in a daily format. In 2008 when Singh was trying to relaunch SAB TV as a comedy channel the recession was forcing television channels to keep costs under control. SAB TVâs content had not been successful so far and financial pressure was increasing. Singh had to ensure that TMKOC was produced at a reasonable cost even though top management had confidence in the show as he explained:The viewership was not very strong and therefore revenue was also slow to come by. There was that initial phase of six to nine months (after the show was launched) when everything was iffy and that was right in the middle of the recession and keeping your head above water was more important for everyone.Singh believed in the channelâs new strategy and was confident about the content of TMKOC which made him support the show. Singh was ready to suffer losses for one or two years because he believed that TMKOC was going to be successful. TMKOC soon became a household name in Hindi-speaking homes of India. Hindi was only one of 22 major languages prevalent throughout India but TMKOC managed to also gain popularity across non-Hindi-speaking markets because the show incorporated characters and references representing Indiaâs diverse cultures. Modiâs efforts to bring positive attention to social issues through humour helped TMKOC become the preferred platform for a progressive India. The show was nominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent and contribute to the governmentâs Clean India (Swachh Bharat) Mission which was one of several government initiatives intended to encourage participation by the Indian people. The show was also one of the most desirable programs on Indian television for the promotion of Bollywood films. The success of TMKOC helped other channels realize the potential of the comedy genre which led to the launch of shows with similar appeal such as Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai (see Exhibit 2). TMKOC was the only daily show airing on a GEC within India where the intellectual property rights to the story and characters were held by the production house rather than by the channel. Modi treated each of his characters as a brand with trademarks for all characters. To ensure that TMKOC remained at SAB TV the channel provided regular incentives over the course of the showâs first 10 years. Modi also had the demanding task of keeping the showâs 26-member cast together over that decade which he was able to do successfully for all but one character. Modi was able to keep his cast intact by providing generous remuneration and understanding their whims and emotions. Most crew members had also stayed with the show all that time. TMKOC had started out with a lower budget than most other shows on Hindi GECs and Modi was prepared to wait for a long-term breakeven point. However positive results began appearing by the end of the first year. JOURNEY OF COMEDY Shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Hum Sab Ek Hain and Shrimaan Shrimati which were popular in the 1990s led the way for shows like Khichdi and Sarabhai vs Sarabhai in the early 2000s and with Comedy Circus making its debut in 2007 a new brand of comedy was emerging. The new shows featured edgy content with double meanings and louder characters. One of these new shows Comedy Nights with Kapil aired from June 2013 to January 2016 and ruled the non-fiction comedy category in 2014.Modi saw the new trend as being more accepting of questionable content. âNow if a vulgar joke is playing on TV people would see it with their daughters. Previously they used to switch it offâ he said. SAB TV seemed to be the only channel to avoid featuring âin-your-face comedyâ and TMKOC was becoming the only show that parents felt comfortable allowing their children to watch without supervision.DIGITAL FORMAT Singh recalled how episodes of TMKOC were distributed among viewers before digital streaming of content became common. Pirated copies of television shows including TMKOCâs shows on digital versatile discs (DVDs) were sold outside railway stations the same night that they aired on television. Viewers had the opportunity to catch up on the missed shows at their preferred time.By 2016 TMKOC was viewed by 2.5 to 3.0 million people in digital format according to Modi. After the launch of the Indian mobile network operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited many more people were watching the show on their mobile devices than at a fixed time on their television sets. Modi wondered how the viewing habits of his loyal audience would change in the future. Research suggested that adults in India were expected to spend an average of one hour and 18 minutes per day on digital media. In 2016 there were 412 million Internet consumers in India. For all online videos viewed by consumers in India 47 per cent used Facebook and 42 per cent watched videos on YouTube where TMKOC episodes were available. The remaining 11 per cent of online viewing was on online video streaming platforms such as Hotstar VOOT Netflix Amazon Prime Video and Jio TV. Although SAB TV had its own video streaming platform called SonyLiv on which TMKOC episodes could be viewed it was not among the most popular online video sources in the country. Star TVâs platform Hotstar was one of the more popular sites and streamed the second season of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai starting in May 2017.WAY FORWARDTMKOC had been successful in attracting viewership to SAB TV but general comedy content on television was diverging away from the typical content on TMKOC. Singh worried about potentially negative effects on the channelâs viewership and wondered what pre-emptive steps might be necessary. He also had to consider how extending SAB TV content on digital sources would require changes in programming time advertising models and other areas. In general Singh wondered how he could ensure the growth of viewership for SAB TV content.EXHIBIT 1: TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH SHOW PERFORMANCE 2008â2017Note: TVT = television viewership in thousands; TAM = television audience measurement; HSM = Hindi-speaking market; CS = cable and satellite homes; BARC = Broadcast Audience Research Council (trusted Indian media research organization as of 2016).Source: Prepared by the author with information from company documents.Â EXHIBIT 2: INDIAN TeleVision SHOWS exhibit 2 (continued) Sources: India TV Entertainment Desk â7 Die Hard Laughing Sitcoms that Will Make You Grin Ear to Mouthâ IndiaTV June 27 2016 accessed May 10 2018 www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/bollywood-best-comedy-serials-336734; Sana Farzeen âShriman Shrimati Set to Return on SAB TV Here Are All the Deetsâ The Indian EXPRESS February 21 2018 accessed May 7 2018 http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/shriman-shrimati-return-on-sab-tv-meet-new-cast-5072906; Roshni Chakrabarty âTop 10 TV Series Showcasing Indian Cultureâ NewsGram December 31 2015 accessed May 10 2018 www.newsgram.com/top-10-tv-series-showcasing-indian-culture; âKumkum Bhagyaâ Zee5 accessed May 11 2018 www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kumkum-bhagya/0-6-127; âKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thiâ Balaji Teleflims accessed May 11 2018 http://balajitelefilms.com/serial.php?id=18; âCast of Kahaani Ghar Ki Reunites; Kavita Kaushik Shares a Fun Postâ Times of India March 12 2018 accessed May 11 2018 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/cast-of-kahaani-ghar-ghar-ki-reunites-kavita-kaushik-shares-a-fun-post/articleshow/63265400.cms; âSarabhai v/s Sarabhaiâ TV DB accessed May 8 2018 www.thetvdb.com/series/sarabhai-vs-sarabhai; âOur Showsâ Neela Telefilms accessed May 11 2018 www.neelatelefilms.com; Menka Shivdasani âOver to Sonyâ Business Line September 4 2000 accessed May 11 2018 www.thehindubusinessline.com/2000/09/04/stories/100444m9.htm; âBhabi Ji Ghar Par Hainâ Zee TV accessed May 11 2018 www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/bhabi-ji-ghar-par-hain/0-6-199; âStar to Launch New Weekly Comedy in Septemberâ Indian Television August 22 2002 accessed May 8 2018 www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k2/aug/aug131.htm; âSony Announces New Reality-Based Comedy Format âComedy Circusââ Exchange4media June 8 2007 accessed May 11 2018 www.exchange4media.com/media-tv-news/sony-announces-new-reality-based-comedy-format-comedy-circus-26392.html; Shweta Mulki âKapil Sharmaâs Next: Star or Sony?â Afaqs January 22 2016 accessed May 11 2018 www.afaqs.com/news/story/46924_Kapil-Sharmas-next-Star-or-Sony.EXHIBIT 3: MAJOR CHARACTERS IN TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAHSource: Company documents and âOur Showsâ Neela Telefilms accessed May 11 2018 www.neelatelefilms.com.ENDNOTES

(TCW) a privately owned third-party logistics (3PL) company based in Haddonfield New Jersey could detect the determination and firmness in the voice of the company’s president and chief operating officer (COO) Jim Tucker: “Mike it is not just about being cheap fast and easy” Tucker said. “We have an obligation to provide the best logistical solution to our customer for each of their shipment requirements.” Mellencamp was working on a bid to provide logistics support to Bell Oil a refinery based in Reading Pennsylvania.  Winning this contract would further TCW’s establishment as a leader in the 3PL industry. As Mellencamp walked out of Tucker’s office he realized that preparing the bid would not be as straightforward as he had thought it would be. The proposal would need to effectively showcase TCW’s value address all practical transport options and remain consistent with the company’s core practice. Above all Mellencamp had only that day Friday June 1 2018 to bring it all together.HISTORY OF Tucker Company WorldwideTCW a third-generation family-held corporation was founded in 1961 by Jacob Tucker. The company provided logistical services to shippers and their customers helping companies efficiently execute freight hand-offs; saving them time; and eliminating the hassles of paperwork billing audits training staffing and optimization. It acted as an intermediary both between shippers and receivers and between shippers and carriers. Through its market knowledge and subject expertise it often helped its clients open new market opportunities receive volume discounts lower overhead costs and achieve timely service.After Jacob’s sudden death his son Bill Tucker took over the business. For the next 32 years Bill immersed himself in the business and industry. His two sons Jeff and Jim worked for their father for over 10 years and later took over the business; they shared a passion for the business and the industry. Jeff served as the chief executive officer overseeing sales and marketing as well as industry participation and leadership. Jim served as the president and COO managing the carrier side credit collections and accounting. Over the years Jeff and Jim had built an outstanding reputation in the 3PL industry. TCW was ISO certified in 2008 and it held ISO 9001:2015 certification as well. In all their business interactions the brothers strove to uphold their core values: customer focus integrity safety quality and advocacy. Services Offered by Tucker Company WorldwideAs a non-asset-based company (i.e. it owned no trucks but worked with fleet operators) TCW provided supply chain solutions to companies in industries such as oil and gas life sciences and health care high-value and high-security goods and food. It also provided services to government entities for example providing relief work during national emergencies such as forest fires hurricanes and terrorist attacks; freight services for the U.S. Mint; and helicopters and boats for the military. TCW utilized an array of transportation modes—including truck rail ocean and air—to arrange logistics all over the world. It offered truckload (TL) intermodal flatbed and specialized equipment for transporting freight. It specialized in freight transportation that required higher service needs—that is where the risk of shipment delays or cargo theft was high where the delay consequences were high and where there was visible corporate behaviour dysfunction. TCW also provided real-time tracking and tracing (through a customer portal) quarterly business reviews (for existing customers) scorecards (based on shipping characteristics) and technology options that included visual performance statistics. Customers appreciated these analyses by TCW and considered them to be value-added services.One thing that had set TCW apart from its competition was its investment in establishing strong communication and visibility channels between its customers and service providers including truck air and ship carriers. This helped TCW create the right logistical solutions for its customers. Results from an internal customer survey showed that TCW was one of the most dependable and reliable partners for most of its clients.The Request For ProposalOn Friday June 1 2018 Bell Oil a large refinery in Reading Pennsylvania sent out a request for proposal (RFP) soliciting bids to transport multiple products from multiple origins to multiple destinations. The refinery solicited local and regional 3PL companies to submit bids for three unique transportation needs. The first requirement was to ship a highly critical 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. The second requirement was to transport a large 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. The third was a small (90-kilogram [200-pound]) but highly valuable $48600 computer server containing sensitive company information which was to be transported across the country from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California.According to the RFP each component could use a combination of transport modes but the best solution should offer the best service in terms of transit time reliability damage rate insurance and of course cost.Jim Tucker saw the call and asked his manager Mellencamp to begin working on the bid right away. However preparing the bid was not easy and TCW had a set of challenges to overcome. TCW’s ChallengeCustomers typically preferred solutions that were fast easy and cheap; they assume that the right vehicle with the desired transit time reliability insurance terms and damage rates would be available. This last-minute attitude increased the overall transportation costs for most customers and became the enemy of corporate savings. They would often not realize how sharply logistics costs rose in the absence of their own advance planning and clear communication and examination of needs. TCW knew that overcoming this attitude would be its first challenge. It could not provide the lowest-cost option to its customer if the customer waited until the very last moment.Jim Tucker wanted to prepare a bid that exceeded expectations for customer service and satisfaction—a solution that provided the lowest-cost option while maintaining the required reliability and service to successfully transport the shipments. He knew that an overly expensive option would jeopardize TCW’s chances of winning the bid.  Tucker and Mellencamp recognized that they were competing with other 3PL companies in the region on this bid. They understood the market and were aware of the different strategies their competition might use—and they were afraid the competition might present a low-ball offer that might be attractive to the customer. At the same time they were confident that the competition could not deliver the experience and service that TCW could offer.Tucker was aware of several past instances where a competitor 3PL had bid on and lost a deal because of a lack of communication and feasibility analysis from the trucking company and driver. Conversely TCW had seen competitor 3PLs win business but then fail to follow through and meet customer expectations leading to aggravated customers. Tucker and Mellencamp discussed their strong communication channel which kept all involved parties in touch at all times as well as their forensic dispatch practice which had been successful over the years. They were confident that a careful examination of the available options and clear communication of the customer’s needs would enable TCW to provide the best logistical solution for the Bell Oil refinery. TCW’s Transport OptionsTo prepare the bid Mellencamp carefully examined all shipping options for serving the refinery’s three specific needs. He prepared three different tables for the three different scenarios and shared these with Tucker. Together they needed to create a bid that not only minimized transport costs but also maximized reliability and customer satisfaction.Shipment Requirement 1: Ship a 67-kilogram (148-pound) gasket from Houston Texas to Reading Pennsylvania. In this requirement the customer wanted to move a 67-kilogram gasket which was critical to the normal operation of the refinery. If the gasket were needed a delay of one day in receiving it could result in millions of dollars in losses for the refinery. Mellencamp evaluated the different shipping options and prepared a table that compared the different components of each option (see Exhibit 1). Shipment Requirement 2: Ship a 102058-kilogram (225000-pound) tank from Houston Texas to Wilmington Delaware. In the second requirement the customer wanted to move a 102058-kilogram tank from Texas to Delaware. Mellencamp considered four different transport options to move this oversize load across state boundaries:Option 1 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it on a 19-axle trailer over-the-road (OTR) to its final destination (see Exhibit 2).Option 2 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the rail ramp in Houston then transload and move it on rail to the customer site via a local rail line. Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the final location on a 19-axle trailer. Option 3 involved picking up the vessel from the manufacturer and moving it OTR to the port in Houston then transloading it onto a barge and barging it to the port in New Castle Delaware. Finally it would be transloaded to a 19-axle trailer and moved OTR to its final destination. Option 4 was to pick up the vessel from the manufacturer and move it OTR to the port in Houston then transload it onto a barge and barge it directly to the customer’s site. (This option would require site improvement on the customer’s end.) Finally the vessel would be transloaded and delivered to the installation site.Mellencamp prepared a table listing all the feasible transport options to carry out this oversize load transportation (see Exhibit 3).Shipment Requirement 3: Ship an estimated 90-kilogram (200-pound) computer server valued at $48600 from Herndon Virginia to San Jose California. The shipper believed the dimensions were roughly 36 × 36 × 40 inches. Under the third and the last requirement the customer required a computer server with very sensitive corporate information to be transported coast to coast. Mellencamp developed a set of feasible solutions to successfully carry out this transportation (see Exhibit 4).THE DECISIONBased on the choices he had developed the challenge for Mellencamp was to come up with a decision for each shipment requirement that would become part of the final bid. He wondered how he should go about making the right logistical decision. What strategy should he use to prepare TCW’s bid?Exhibit 1: Options for Transporting a 67-kilogram Gasket

Mishra had called a meeting with his plant managers to review the progress on their production targets. As the plant director he had received a request from the head office at Bangalore fifteen days earlier asking him to produce 27000 units of a popular inverter brand for the month of June. The original target of 5000 units set two months previously had unexpectedly been raised to 7000 just a month ago and since the Rudrapur operation was already struggling just to deal with that change in its original production target this latest order represented a massive challenge both for the plant and for its director. SCHNEIDER ELECTRICFounded in 1836 Schneider Electric (Schneider) was a French multinational corporation that specialized in producing components for energy management and electricity distribution. It operated in over 100 countries around the world and employed approximately 160000 people. In 2015 the company made a profit of €3.6 billion on revenues of €26.6 billion.Schneider Electric had been operating in India since 1963 and had established a 100 per cent owned subsidiary in 1995. The company’s growth in India had been inorganic in nature with several well-known acquisitions including Conzerv (2010) Zicom (2010) Digilink (2011) and Luminous (2011).SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC PLANT—RUDRAPURA New Plant The city of Rudrapur was located in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. The State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) had been formed in 2002 with a mandate of promoting industries by developing industrial infrastructure in the state. SIIDCUL set up a large integrated industrial estate in Rudrapur that attracted companies such as Tata Motors Ashok Leyland HCL Technologies Limited and Schneider among many others. This flood of new business led to significant infrastructure growth in the area along with an influx of migrants from across India who were looking for jobs in these industries. Schneider set up its Rudrapur plant in 2009. Availability of land infrastructure facilities a cheap labour force and attractive tax incentives represented the major reasons for Schneider’s selection of Rudrapur as the site for its new plant. To quickly set up the operation old machines from the Bangalore plant were relocated to Rudrapur. Quality testing of products continued to take place at the Bangalore plant during the initial setup period and eventually in 2010 this process was moved to the Rudrapur plant.Schneider divided its business operations in India into three clusters each of which was led by a vice-president who oversaw operations at eight to 10 factories. Each cluster had three to four directors of operations who were responsible for plant-level profitability. Initially all senior plant managers reported to their counterparts at the main plant in Bangalore Karnataka in southern India but this decentralized form of supervision led to a lack of unity of command in the individual plants a situation that adversely affected operations. In 2010 the plant director at Rudrapur was given complete command of that plant and all senior managers reported to him (see Exhibit 1). The plant director reported to the vice-president at corporate office. Early Workplace Culture at Rudrapur A significant number of Schneider operators had been relocated from Bangalore to Rudrapur in order to run the new plant and train local hires. These workers faced a variety of issues in their new city such as language barriers and difficulty adapting to the extreme weather conditions of Rudrapur. As a result they jumped at any opportunity to return to Bangalore. This ongoing shifting of jobs soon created a transactional mindset among the relocated employees and their performance lacked a sense of ownership and responsibility. The Rudrapur plant employed over 450 workers 20 per cent of whom were permanent staff; the remaining 80 per cent consisted of temporary local hires. Because the local workers were not offered any formal training they found it difficult to match the productivity of the operators who had come from the main plant. This lack of preparation and some human resources (HR) issues resulted in low morale among the workers who felt unmotivated to improve their productivity. During the first few years of operation at the Rudrapur plant the corporate culture suffered from the workers’ limited sense of connection to the products and to the plant a low degree of involvement by senior management with the workers and the workers’ dislike of the senior managers’ authoritarian leadership style.Production IssuesWorkers at the Rudrapur plant were untrained in the latest methods of lean production and the five basic phases of the “5S” workplace methodology (derived from five Japanese words for “sort” “set in order” “shine” “standardize” and “sustain”) were missing. Thus the overall operation lacked this main component of a lean manufacturing system. Newer managers noted that tools were not stored in the proper drawers and areas the production line was haphazard and the production floor and surrounding area were not cleaned to management’s expectations.Rudrapur was located a significant distance from other manufacturing hubs so it faced the additional problem of long lead times for delivery of materials. This situation combined with unmet high production targets and low labour productivity led to a pileup of inventory at the plant in terms of raw material and work in progress. Since the plant output had a seasonal demand inventory targets fluctuated a factor that further exacerbated the inventory pileup.Due to these and other planning-related issues idle production lines were a familiar sight at Rudrapur. The plant often fell below its production targets and faced a constant struggle to keep the lines rolling. Worker productivity was low and there were quality issues with the products. The defect rate was high with customers returning a large proportion of products back to the company. Schneider’s head office believed that the problems at the Rudrapur plant were caused by external factors over which the management had no control. For that reason no corrective actions were initiated by the head office or by plant management.Acquisition of LuminousIn 2011 Schneider Electric India acquired a major stake (74 per cent) in Luminous Power Technologies India (Luminous) a well-known manufacturer of power back-up solutions for retail customers in India. Luminous was launched in 1988 by Rakesh Malhotra and had sales of approximately 11 billion Indian rupees (€170 million) in the year ending March 2011. The company was well known for its power inverters and uninterrupted power supply devices. This product segment had been growing at a compound annual growth rate of over 20 per cent in the last five years and was expected to grow at the same rate for the next decade. India experienced severe power outages during the summer season (April to August) and demand for Luminous products was highly seasonal in nature. Over the course its existence Luminous had been able to establish a reputable brand name in the power-supply segment. As a leader in a fast-growing market Luminous was a good strategic fit for Schneider Electric India. This acquisition helped Schneider triple its sales locally and made it the seventh largest operation in the Schneider group globally.Prior to the 2011 acquisition Luminous had appointed Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador in 2010. This brand-building strategy sought to project an image of excellent product quality by associating it with a cricketing legend like Tendulkar.Luminous planned to introduce a new product in 2014 the production of which was assigned to the Rudrapur plant. Starting in late 2013 the plant began to receive ever-increasing targets of manufacturing components for that particular model but in line with its past record the plant kept falling short of meeting those targets and its product quality fell far below expectations as well. Defective returns were high which did not bode well for the Luminous brand which had Sachin Tendulkar as its ambassador.Mishra Joins the Rudrapur TeamSamir Mishra held a master of science degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university and had worked with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (India) Mahindra Reva (India) Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Limited (India) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (United States) prior to joining Schneider as its director of engineering in 2012. In March 2014 Schneider Electric India appointed Mishra as the plant director of its Rudrapur plant. Mishra was given the overarching mandate of turning the plant around—specifically to successfully deliver on the new Luminous product line. Up to the time of this appointment Mishra’s experience consisted of managing small teams of engineers; he had no prior experience with managing workers at a plant level. Even so Mishra nurtured a passion for active people management and he welcomed the opportunity to move from a technical role into one of leadership. PLANT TURNAROUND A Plan for Change at RudrapurAfter taking over leadership at Rudrapur in March 2014 Mishra took stock of its operations. Upon a review of the reports on product returns he noticed that the plant rejection rate was around 96000 parts per million. An industry average plant rejection rate of 25000 parts per million was considered acceptable; the rate at the Rudrapur plant was almost four times that. Mishra was surprised at this poor state of affairs. Upon accepting the offer to manage Bangalore he had been assured that while the plant faced a major issue concerning productivity quality was not an issue. Mishra quickly realized that the head office was not being kept up to date on the quality issues so he arranged a personal meeting with the plant’s quality manager Anil Rao to get to the root of the problem.  Rao was adamant that the plant’s quality issues could not be resolved as quickly as Mishra was expecting. He also complained to the top management that Mishra was interfering in his functional domain. After some discussion with his superiors Mishra decided to dismiss the quality manager asking him to leave immediately. Within a week Mishra had appointed a new head of quality. From his two decades of experience in working with various organizations across different geographies and cultures Mishra had derived a three-pronged philosophy for running a successful business. He believed that customer satisfaction drove volume lean manufacturing minimized waste and motivated the workers and informed workers were more engaged and hence highly productive. To drive customer satisfaction Mishra believed the product should have high quality and high reliability. Moreover these traits should not come at an added expense; the product should be priced competitively. Mishra’s time in the United States had exposed him to the principles of lean manufacturing so he understood that minimizing waste and improving productivity provided effective ways to reduce costs. Finally he felt confident that employees who had a sense of ownership towards their product and company would be motivated to make sound decisions to improve quality and reduce waste. Mishra knew that if he could successfully implement his three-pronged philosophy he could improve the state of affairs at the Rudrapur plant. Dealing with Resistance Deciding to tackle the HR issues first Mishra planned to launch a number of HR and learning interventions to empower engage and energize the workers and improve productivity at Rudrapur. Most of his interventions were based on the belief that workers perform better when they possess a sense of ownership. Before he could implement his plans however Mishra’s changes met with some stiff resistance from the most unlikely of corners.Anit Singh who had served as the HR manager at the Rudrapur plant since its inception did not appreciate his new director meddling in HR issues. To his credit Singh had a proven track record of keeping the plant free from any industrial relations issues. Furthermore the plant remained non-unionized while all the other plants under SIIDCUL’s control were plagued with union issues. Singh was concerned that the plant’s temporary employees who constituted 80 per cent of Rudrapur’s workforce might raise demands to be promoted to permanent status if they began to feel empowered by Mishra’s planned HR interventions. In light of these concerns during discussions between the two men Singh presented Mishra with some strong arguments against such changes. Singh informed Mishra that the former plant head used to keep workers at arm’s length and had a highly directive approach to leadership; he was in the habit controlling the workers through Singh.Mishra shared “The HR manager and his style of functioning before I took over were highly controlling and directive. No dissent was [allowed from the workers]. I had to deal with Singh’s mindset which was more challenging than dealing with workers.” To deal with Singh’s concerns Mishra invited Singh to his cabin for a discussion over a cup of tea. Before Mishra could initiate the conversation Singh told him “You are playing with fire. Temporary workers may create industrial relations issues.” Mishra acknowledged Singh’s concerns but went on to request that Singh proceed with the suggested HR interventions. Further Mishra assured Singh that the HR department would be given the credit for all potential benefits derived from such interventions and if any of the interventions failed Mishra was ready to take the blame. Mishra listed the probable benefits which included lowering the plant’s attrition rate enabling workers to develop a sense of ownership and fostering a new feeling of security among temporary workers all of which would improve the engagement level of the workers. Eventually Singh understood that there would be no personal risk in the interventions and he agreed to follow through with Mishra’s plan. Human Resource InitiativesThe Collar SystemWith Singh on board Mishra started off by rigorously emphasizing a collar system. Trainees in the workforce wore a red-coloured collar on their shirts which was upgraded to orange and then green when they became experts in their sections and passed the requisite tests. This graduated process was designed to facilitate other HR interventions that involved peer learning and on-the-job training. Public functions were organized to congratulate workers as they graduated from one stage to the next. Once workers arrived at the green-collar level they became members of a high-powered group that could directly approach senior management with suggestions for ways to make the plant run more smoothly. Senior managers were asked to forward these suggestions to the director within 24 hours along with a brief analysis and plan of action to ensure quick decision-making and implementation. By quickly implementing many of the workers’ suggestions Mishra established himself as a leader who believed in empowering others. The implementations had the added effect of instilling a sense of ownership among the green-collar workers who numbered about 60.Training ProgramsAnother intervention that Mishra initiated—one that he liked to call the “Duality of Training”—was essentially peer learning. The green collars were specifically given the task of training the red collars which fostered close interaction between the trainees and the skilled workers. Plant engineers used to sit in on these training sessions to evaluate the trainers. The engineers’ input honed the skills of the green-collar workers and made them expert at their tasks.  Mishra also asked the line leaders to swap positions with operators on the line for a few shifts each week calling the process “Face the Management.” This intervention was initially opposed by the line leaders who felt that performing the tasks of an operator was a demotion. Mishra also heard concerns that temporarily allowing operators to run the line might create issues among the operators and line leaders. By outlining the expected learnings from the job-swap process Mishra was able to defuse the tension around the process and things went smoothly forward. Operators were expected to understand and appreciate the challenges faced by line managers and thanks to the job swap and managing the production line for a day the operators realized that the job of line leader was not as easy as they had previously believed. Similarly line leaders were exposed to the pain points of the operators and to the issues these workers faced in performing to their peak capability. Over a period of several such rotations this intervention fostered a sense of mutual respect between the operators and line leaders in place of the previous animosity. The process also facilitated empathy and meaningful communication in the workplace which had been missing up to that point.Communication EffortsMishra implemented a policy of having an open house each month where the plant’s workforce and the management team would discuss plant issues. At these meetings Mishra shared Schneider Electric’s vision for the plant with the workforce and regularly highlighted how the workers’ career goals were in sync with the vision of the plant. The goal was to instil a sense of belonging and cohesion across the workforce and bind the disparate groups with a shared vision.For his part Mishra started a daily routine of walking throughout the entire plant and assembly lines mingling with the workers. He was open to discussing any issues the operators faced on the line and he tried to come up with on-the-spot solutions. This daily communication removed the power distance perceived by many of the workers who finally began to see the management and workforce as a single team with a shared vision striving to improve the future of the plant.THE CHALLENGEProduction Targets at SchneiderThe Schneider India marketing function was an independent vertical that reported to the senior vice-president of marketing based out of the Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong. Schneider India’s marketing management team received a quarterly target based on the average yearly revenue target that had been fixed for its business operations. This number was reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis taking into consideration the actual production target as well. Based on this quarterly number set for Schneider India’s marketing team each cluster was assigned a revenue target. Further down the line the respective marketing managers who were each responsible for one or more plants set the product forecast based on the clients’ needs. The production target-setting process was dynamic and was linked to the revenue target set for the entire Indian operation. The production target of the plant was reviewed regularly and the targets for various months were updated in advance after a review process (see Exhibit 3).An Unexpected Jump in DemandSoon after Mishra joined the team at Rudrapur in March 2014 the Bangalore head office set a June 2014 production target of 5000 units of finished goods for the new Luminous product (see Exhibit 2). Two months later in May 2014 this target was revised to 27000 units. The sudden spike in demand was due to the Luminous team’s aggressive marketing efforts for the new product and it was essential not just to fulfil the demand but to fulfil it with quality products. Mishra and his management team were shocked by this sudden change in expectations. Several people felt that the plant could not supply the increased demand and they asked Mishra to negotiate lower targets with head office. Off the record senior management at the head office suggested the same approach advising Mishra to formally ask head office to lower the plant’s production targets. One senior executive from the head office privately advised him against accepting the order at all since failure to fully meet Luminous’s request could cost Mishra his hard-earned professional reputation. MEETING THE CHALLENGEConvincing Head OfficeMishra did not want to let the Luminous order slip away from the plant and he was keen to take up the challenge in spite of being advised against doing so. He spoke to his management team and presented them with a roadmap for how he planned to execute the order. Mishra’s plan included the introduction of a learning culture through a people-process intervention and the launch of a lean production concept that included a re-engineering of the production process. The members of the top management team were convinced by Mishra’s enthusiasm for meeting the challenge and they handed Mishra free rein to implement his ideas at the plant. They did however advise Mishra to act with caution. They realized his strategy would have to be put into place immediately before the plant’s issues hurt the market for the new product. Convincing the Team at RudrapurDespite considerable advice to the contrary Mishra decided to push ahead. He saw an opportunity in this challenge. Having tasted initial success with the HR interventions he felt this production challenge represented a growth opportunity for the plant. Mishra called his plant management team together for a meeting where he announced his intention of accepting the target and he discussed his plan to meet it. Immediately the heads of two departments—procurement and production—raised their protests. The procurement manager Vikas Choudhary was among the strongest opponents of Mishra’s plan to forge ahead with the increased order. Choudhary argued that accepting the increase in demand at the plant’s current production level would impose a severe inventory shortage on the plant and purchasing large amounts of raw materials in such a short span of time would be very expensive. The suppliers would demand a significant premium and freight costs would also increase significantly to ensure the faster transport of goods. Added to all of these logistics issues was the possibility that Rudrapur’s routine suppliers would not have the spare capacity to be able to match the plant’s short-term demand.Rakesh Razdan the production manager pointed out that the production line in its current configuration did not have the capacity to produce even half the output expected from the plant. Mishra accepted these concerns as genuine and appreciated the thoughtfulness of his managers during the meeting. He gave the responsibility of finding solutions back to the managers themselves promising them his full support in their efforts to meet this challenge and pointing out the benefits of being able to successfully re-engineer the current processes to meet such a demand spike.Creating Production Efficiencies The plant management team quickly realized that improvements in worker productivity alone could not match the required demand; it was time to implement lean and agile production techniques. Razdan was given the task of studying each process in the assembly line and identifying those that were creating bottlenecks. Upon finding a bottleneck he was given the authority to redesign the process and workflows to effectively “debottleneck” the line. Razdan also undertook an action study by observing the workers as they performed their tasks on the line. This activity allowed him to identify the processes that needed to be re-engineered to improve worker productivity. Razdan found many simple changes that could be quickly implemented. Minor changes (for example moving a raw-material feeding tray from a position below the line to a platform alongside it) improved worker productivity and line capacity significantly. The line operators were responsible for correctly aligning and installing electrical components inside the inverter bodies. The plant’s own research and development team shared the operators’ feedback (for example regarding the placement of various components inside the inverter) with the research and development team at Luminous and  these two teams jointly improved the product layout to make it easier and quicker to assemble. The testing bench for the inverters was also shifted to the Rudrapur plant from the Luminous offices thus enabling quicker identification and correction of assembly issues.Choudhary was asked to expand Rudrapur’s current group of raw-material suppliers. Finding it difficult to bring new suppliers on board in a short period of time he decided to ask Luminous to share its own list of suppliers. The Luminous management team initially balked at this request but soon complied when they realized that their latest product launch would collapse if they did not assist the Rudrapur plant. Two of the new suppliers were located in Pune and Vadodara in western India so Choudhary decided to visit them personally to persuade them to help the Rudrapur plant with its high inventory requirements in the short term. To save time Choudhary hesitantly asked Mishra for permission to travel by airplane instead of the usual train. Mishra approved this request on the spot and commended Choudhary for his commitment to the endeavour. Seeing Mishra follow through on his promise of support was a morale booster for the entire management team. THE PATH FORWARDMishra and his team had made a lot of progress in improving the overall function of the Rudrapur plant but there was still a long way to go and a huge production hurdle had yet to be crossed. It remained to be seen whether Mishra would be successful at turning the plant around and fulfilling the challenging order. Were his interventions likely to succeed? Could Mishra have adopted a different approach to meet the challenges? exhibit 1: organization structure of the rudrapur plantSource: Created by the authors EXHIBIT 2: PRODUCTION TARGETS FOR luminous’s NEW PRODUCT LINE IN 2014 Source: Created by the authorsEXHIBIT 3: RUDRAPUR PLANT PRODUCTION PER MONTH IN 2014Source: Created by the authors

Che Jianxin (CheChe) founder chairman and chief executive officer of Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. (RSM) was providing the finishing touches to a growth-oriented action plan he termed the “1001 Strategy.” RSM was the largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in China. CheChe was to unveil the plan at RSM’s upcoming 30th-anniversary celebrations. While preparing to host the event at the sprawling New International Expo Center in Shanghai CheChe was also weighing his options on implementing the strategy:The “1001 Strategy” is about two action plans: building 1000 brick-and-mortar shopping malls focused exclusively on home-centric business all over China and integrating them into a seamless ecosystem of our offerings and their end-users through a single overarching Internet platform. The goal in the short term is to convert RSM into a technology-driven enterprise that leverages data in real-time. In the long term the strategic intent is to make RSM an O2O [online to offline] leader in China. Our guiding post in the imminent journey will be to take all complexities out of the ecosystem. We want to make it easy as a result for our customers and vendors to transact with one another and for our employees to facilitate those transactions.RSM had for many years considered physical stores as its core medium for reaching customers in its shopping malls. In 2012 however it launched online shopping with what was known in China as O2O (online to offline) functions. Targeted at individual consumers O2O enabled shoppers to order and pay for goods online and receive delivery at their nearest store offline. In 2015 RSM launched an upgraded version of O2O at selected shopping malls. It was targeted at business customers who would use the same functionality. However in both formats the model encountered two specific problems: the online service was not always consistent with the offline service and the prices displayed online often differed from those displayed offline. As a result of his pursuit of an integrated and interactive model CheChe was now moving towards an omni-channel strategy as his “1001 Strategy” was generally known worldwide. An omni-channel strategy provided an environment wherein customers shopped through a variety of online and offline channels while also switching easily and seamlessly between them. It was challenging in the age of the Internet for a home improvement and furnishings company to operate in a standalone mode of either brick-and-mortar stores or e-commerce. Building a new Web 2.0 mode integrating the two channels was crucial to exploiting business synergies. CheChe was keen that RSM should be the first to do so in its industry in China in an effort to stay ahead of its competitors. RSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015 mobilizing ¥5.6 billion. In mid-2016 it announced an initial public offering (IPO) on the A-share market to mobilize an additional ¥3.95 billion. The company had set aside ¥1.45 billion toward the construction of an exhibition mall ¥600 million for the construction of a unified logistics service system and ¥500 million for upgrading projects to the O2O platform. To execute its strategies RSM had also recruited a team of 200 professionals from top Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft. Bin Li (Lao Li) the new president of the company was to orchestrate the projects. Lao Li had previously worked as executive president at Suning Commerce Group Co. Ltd. a large home appliances retailer in China where he had headed its O2O project.THE OMNI-CHANNEL STRATEGYHistorically retailers displayed their products in brick-and-mortar stores and walk-in customers could examine the products and buy them. The launch of the commercial Internet in 1995 led to numerous channels in addition to the physical channel. For example customers could log on to company websites to buy their products online. They could order through designated kiosks and call centres and more recently through social media and mobile devices. Also launched were online pure-play companies in categories that did not require customers to touch and feel the products before buying—for example books movies music and office supplies. Their end prices were lower because the online distribution costs were lower. Very soon two trends had become evident. One was “showrooming” wherein customers would visit a physical store to examine merchandise and then make their purchase online. The other trend was “webrooming” wherein customers would research products online but visit a physical store to make their purchase. The latter was particularly evident in such categories as shoes sports equipment and cosmetics. Omni-channel retailing was the result of the convergence of the two ongoing trends. In omni-channel retailing a customer could switch channels—buy online and pick up in-store or use a mobile device in-store to research a product or make a purchase or buy in-store and make a return online. The retailer also gained a 360-degree view of a customer’s purchases across all channels. Two retailer capabilities were thus crucial to the success of omni-channel retailing: enabling the customer to order online and pick up in-store; and enabling the customer to buy in-store and return online. In building those capabilities technology came into play. Online retailers were establishing what were known as “storefronts” in their attempts to build customer relationships engage in real-time market research and provide hands-on assistance to those wary of shopping online. These retailers saw a storefront not just as a store but also as a space where opinions reviews social media and technology combined to create “connections.” A storefront was particularly relevant for products where the customer experience associated with touch and feel were crucial to closing the sale. Said CheChe:The proposed omni-channel platform will allow our customers to view design scenes for their home interior ideas examine the products of their choice write reviews save and share images with family and friends and purchase those products online. It will provide our tenants with an additional point of contact with potential customers. It will enhance our customer stickiness and increase their conversion rate resulting in higher gross sales at our shopping malls. The first-hand consumer data collected through the omni-channel platform further improves our data pool for analysis of and research on customer tastes and industry trends providing us and our tenants with valuable market intelligence.The HOME IMPROVEMENT AND HOme FURNISHINGS INDUSTRY in chinaChina’s home improvement and home furnishings industry had recorded sales revenue of ¥3704.1 billion in 2015. It was forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent over the next five years.The growth was being driven by four factors. First urban per capita disposable incomes were rising in China—having increased at a CAGR of 10.3 per cent during the period 2010 to 2015—leading to individual families demanding larger and well-furnished living spaces. Second the rate of urbanization in China was rising steadily: at 771 million the urban population had exceeded the rural population of 603 million in 2015 leading to demand for home improvement and furnishings products as migrants from the interior settled into their new urban locations. Third with the gross floor area having increased and the refurbishing cycle of existing homes having decreased to six years both the furnishing of new homes and the refurbishing of existing homes were on the rise in China. Fourth notwithstanding the rate of growth of the industry China’s per capita expenditure on home improvement and furnishings was lower at US$425.50 in 2015 as compared with $1033.40 in the United States and $867.10 in the United Kingdom indicating potential for market expansion.The industry had two major segments: business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B). The B2C segment consisted of households and individuals purchasing home improvement and home furnishings products for their own use and represented 64.1 per cent of the market in 2015. The B2B segment consisted of centralized procurement by real estate developers and wholesale purchases by contractors and represented 35.9 per cent of the market.The home improvement and home furnishings industry consisted of three broad product categories: furniture home decoration products and light building materials. Furniture was the largest subsector by retail sales value. The demand for light building materials was tied to new home sales and was therefore cyclical.China had more than 14000 home improvement and home furnishings manufacturers. Some were located along coastal export hubs serving as offshore manufacturing centres for overseas firms. Among those manufacturers some focused on the domestic market and manufactured and marketed products under their own brands. The majority of the brands had limited recognition among consumers because home improvement and home furnishings products were typically low-frequency and low-quantity purchases. The companies themselves had limited marketing expertise and low marketing budgets. Said CheChe:Raw materials such as wood plastic and metal are available in China in plenty. But because they are also commoditized low cost is the basis of differentiation at that phase of the industry’s value chain [see Exhibit 1]. The most important element of the value chain is distribution at the downstream end. That is where the source of competitive advantage lies. That is where a lot of innovation has also been happening. Other key success factors include brand recognition the location of the shopping mall the product mix offered by tenants and the ability to understand customer needs. The quality of customer service is also a differentiator.  China’s home improvement and home furnishings industry was highly competitive. Prominent foreign players included B&Q plc (the United Kingdom’s largest home improvement and garden centre retailer) and IKEA (a Swedish company which had located eight of its 10 biggest stores in China). Prominent domestic players included Easy Home (a furniture retailer with approximately 50 stores that marketed high-quality brands from around the world) and Ayd Home Furnishings (one of the largest retail furniture mall operators). Many other local operators worked in the brick-and-mortar space. Major competitors in the e-commerce space included Jia.com (which sold home furnishings and decoration) and the home improvement retail businesses of Tmall.com (the country’s largest B2C platform) and JD.com (another online B2C company).An important characteristic of the home improvement and furnishings industry in China was that Chinese consumers preferred the do-it-for-me (DIFM) model over the do-it-yourself (DIY) model. The latter was typical of retailers in North America and Western Europe which offered semi-finished products and simple tools to go with them thereby enabling customers to complete the work in their own homes. Chinese preferred finished products that were ready to go with no additional work needed. Their preference was both historical (i.e. driven by the low availability of tradespeople low labour costs and the need for convenience) and cultural (i.e. the DIFM model carried a premium in the mindset of a Chinese consumer). Another characteristic was aggregation at the point of sale of diverse product categories from diverse manufacturers. The system had evolved in China because product manufacturers had found it expensive to develop their own distribution channels or invest heavily in their own brands. They pooled their resources to build a one-stop shop a mall in its own right to attract foot traffic and generate sales volumes that would justify large investments in marketing. As a result the mall rather than the company was the brand. Consumers recognized and trusted mall brands over individual product brands. This approach was in contrast to the North American and Western European trends of standalone firms such as Home Depot becoming brands in their own right and marketing diverse products under a single brand. A recent trend was that many home improvement and home furnishings retailers in China were moving beyond their traditional brick-and-mortar presence and launching online shopping; however the transition was creating tensions for many of these retailers. For a majority of the industry products physical factors such as touch were important at the point of sale. Retailers were struggling with providing the suitable customer experience.China’s CHANGING CONSUMER PROFILEChina was in a state of transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. The transition had been triggered by several government actions aimed at increasing national incomes. For example the Chinese government was progressively increasing the retirement pension coverage in urban areas (it had increased by 40 per cent from covering 250 million people to covering 350 million by 2015). It was also launching several financial-sector and industrial reforms which would lead to new job creation countrywide. The process of urbanization was also fuelling consumption-led growth. The consumption of upper-middle-class and rich families was estimated to account for 55 per cent of all consumption and to contribute 81 per cent to the total consumption increment by the end of 2016.An important trend in China’s consumer profile was the growing weightage of the “mainstream” consumer (defined as having an annual income of between $16000 and $34000) accompanied by a shrinking weightage of the “value consumer” (defined as having an annual income of between $6000 and $16000). The percentage of value consumers among the urban population was expected to decrease from 82 per cent in 2010 to 36 per cent in 2020 while during the same period the percentage of mainstream consumers was to increase from 6 per cent to 51 per cent of the urban population (see Exhibit 2).The mainstream consumers would comprise 167 million households or nearly 400 million people who would be the trendsetters for consumption. In terms of spending patterns three broad shifts had already become evident in China. First mainstream consumers would be more willing to spend on discretionary items (which included home improvement and home furnishings) as a result of those items becoming affordable to increasing numbers of consumers. Discretionary categories were forecast to show the strongest overall growth at 13.4 per cent between 2010 and 2020 (see Exhibit 3). Second mainstream consumers would be trading up to high-priced goods because they were aspirational about the way they lived and their perceived social standing. Third mainstream consumers would be among the most dedicated and sophisticated of online shoppers and would seek such shopping conveniences as easier price comparisons unique assortments of products freshness of goods quality of service and a social networking experience.China’s online retail market was already the world’s largest with e-commerce accounting for more than 13 per cent of the country’s total retail sales of consumer goods. In top-tier cities roughly 90 per cent of Internet users and 70 to 80 per cent of consumers as a whole were shopping online. As Chinese consumers enjoyed the options and transparency available online they were also becoming increasingly choosy often visiting four to five sites before reaching a purchase decision according to McKinsey research.Overview of RED STAR MACCALINERSM had been listed on the H-share market in 2015. In mid-2016 it announced an IPO on the A-share market. By the end of 2016 RSM had opened its 200th mall. It had in fact announced in 2012 its goal of opening its 200th mall by 2020. The goal had been accomplished four years ahead of schedule. By June 20 2016 RSM had become China’s largest home improvement and home furnishings shopping mall operator in terms of three metrics: number of shopping malls (181); operating area (11814928 square metres) and geographical coverage (129 cities). The company had generated revenue of ¥8.76 billion and net profits of ¥4.37 billion for the year ending December 2015 (see Exhibit 4). RSM had 17086 full-time employees. Its mall tenants had their own employees only at the sales counters.CheChe had founded the company in June 1986 with capital of ¥600. A high-school dropout CheChe had taken up carpentry with his apprentices in the city of Changzhou in the province of Jiangsu. By 1988 they had put together 500 sets of furniture and sold them for $80000 before setting up a furniture warehouse in 1992. It was a year later that CheChe thought of leasing a shopping mall focused on furniture. He rented a decrepit building divided it into small shops and rented them out to small individual furniture traders. The idea became so successful that he replicated the model to establish 20 similar malls in cities big and small in Jiangsu Province. Within a year he had progressed to purchasing freehold land in metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai on which he built malls. In 1998 CheChe switched to the franchise business model. Franchising required less capital on his part because the investment was shared with the franchisee. The model ensured faster geographical expansion nationwide. Said CheChe:In 2003 we launched garden-style malls which are environment-friendly and followed it up in 2005 with what we called “experience shopping” by combining the Chinese traditional store mode with the Western shopping mall mode. In 2008 we opened a new park-style home furnishings mall in Shanghai as a flagship store for home furniture brands from around the world. Built on an investment of $1 million and housing more than 2500 individual stores the mall has a monorail the first of its kind in the world spiralling its way up and down six floors ferrying shoppers. In 2014 we brought in the concept of “spatial art” wherein live theatre performances averaging 40 per annum are held at RSM malls for shoppers to enjoy free of cost.The business model of RSM was built on a combination of portfolio shopping malls and managed shopping malls. By June 30 2016 RSM had 56 portfolio shopping malls and 125 managed shopping malls (see Exhibit 5). The former were spread over a total area of 4457050 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 95.4 per cent. The latter were spread over a total area of 7357877 square metres at an average occupancy rate of 92.2 per cent. Portfolio shopping malls offered comprehensive services to their tenants including designated shopping space staff training sales and marketing daily operations and management and customer services. In exchange RSM received a fixed monthly rent and management fees. Managed shopping malls provided full-scale operating services to their business partners including site selection construction consultation design and decoration tenant sourcing and daily operation and management. In exchange RSM received fees during different stages as part of the contract management agreements.Most of the portfolio shopping malls were located in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities providing recurring and predictable operating income through rent and management fees. Most of the managed shopping malls were located in Tier 3 and other cities. They were asset-light. Said CheChe: Our hybrid expansion model is one of a kind in the Chinese home improvement and furnishing industry. It has created high barriers to entry. It is difficult to replicate. We have firmed up prime locations in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities for our portfolio shopping mall footprint. There is nothing left for our competitors present or potential to source. We also have deeply entrenched industry relationships supporting our managed shopping mall footprint. Our success with the hybrid model has led to a virtuous growth cycle for us our partners our tenants and our customers.RSM was shifting its focus from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where most of its malls were located to smaller county-level areas where urbanization was accelerating.RSM had expansion plans for the future in its core business of mall development. It had identified attractive market opportunities in the 2500 Tier 3 and other downstream cities across China. According to RSM each such city could support at least one branded shopping mall. RSM would have a first-mover advantage on the strength of its asset-light strategy which could generate rapid growth and high returns on capital without straining the company’s cash flow. It had already shortlisted the cities it planned to expand into in the next three years based on size population local market conditions and the disposable income of residents. The company was working on launching a “mini mall” format of 15000 to 30000 square metres in some of those cities.Since its inception RSM had positioned itself as a trading platform for the home improvement and home furnishings business. The imminent launch of the 1001 Strategy had led to the company being repositioned as a “home-centred” enterprise that was extending its reach to five interrelated industries: residential real estate home decoration home commodities (e.g. appliances vases and curtains) finance and service. The company was also entering into three non-core sectors aimed at reinforcing its core offerings. The first was consumer and vendor financing. Customers were in need of financing because of the high costs of home improvement and home furnishings products. Vendors were in need of financing to cover their rental expenses and procurement costs. RSM had taken the first step in this regard by establishing a consumer financing joint venture with Haier and Greentown in December 2014. It had applied for its own consumer financing licence. The second non-core section was logistics and fulfilment services. By leveraging the company’s existing nationwide footprint these services were meant to provide so-called “last-mile services” such as warehousing assembly and delivery. These services helped vendors manage their inventory better and reduce their costs of operations and enabled customers to track their shipments from the comfort of their homes. The services enabled RSM as a company to aggregate its orders and deliveries leading to better control over resources. It also enhanced the stickiness of manufacturers vendors and customers. Another potential area of related diversification was home design services which prevailed at the upstream end of the industry value chain. RSM was planning to identify talented home design professionals invest in their start-ups and endorse their business with its premier brand. In exchange the start-ups would agree to purchase 80 per cent of their home improvement and home furnishings products from RSM shopping malls. The move was aimed at promoting agile and nimble innovators within a large organization. In addition RSM was also expanding into bulk procurement services connecting home improvement and home furnishings suppliers and vendors with construction contractors and real estate developers. It was focusing on small- to mid-sized developers who did not have the scale to set up their own centralized procurement. RSM was the first in the home improvement and furnishings retail industry in China to implement a comprehensive enterprise resource planning system which was known internally as “Star Cloud.” It had been rolled out across the group at a cost of ¥80 million. Star Cloud was serving two objectives: it enhanced operational management particularly with regard to inventory and it helped commercialize the data collected through its system to better analyze consumer preferences. Said CheChe:The home improvement and furnishings industry is characterized by product offerings where physical touch remains a valued aspect of the purchase decision. Hence an online strategy will be successful only when combined with a physical mall network. The shopping experience is an integral part of our brick-and-mortar stores. Our online platform will be designed around the customer experience and our strategy is to leverage our shopping mall network to offer a synchronized shopping experience for our consumers.THE WAY FORWARDRSM’s 1001 Strategy had two components: building 1000 malls as physical infrastructure and building one Internet platform.On the physical front RSM had shown evidence that it could deliver. Having already built a total of 181 malls by mid-2016 RSM opened its 200th mall at the end of 2016. The company had then set a new target of building 1000 malls.The new malls would still be part of either portfolio shopping malls or managed shopping malls. They would be designed to upgrade from home malls to family malls permeating not only Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities but also key counties from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The new malls would be integrated into the local business community infrastructure and the public facilities serving local residents and consumers.On the digital front RSM had already designed a mobile application (app) for its malls in Shanghai and a peer-to-peer platform for furniture buyers commercial tenants and factories partnered with the malls. The way ahead would involve replicating these offerings enterprise-wide. Lao Li the company’s president had outlined three 100-day plans for implementing the omni-channel strategy: launch the fundamental platform in the first 100 days; launch the full chain product in the second 100 days; and open for sharing and collaboration in the third 100 days. In deploying the digital medium Lao Li needed to manage the tension between the traditional brick-and-mortar model and the e-commerce model.Executing the 1001 Strategy would also be an opportunity for RSM to take a fresh look at determining its core competitiveness. Lao Li saw the emerging competitive advantage in terms of three components: RSM as a brand RSM as a repository of omni-channel talent and RSM as a digital enterprise. Lao Li was keen that the user interface be easy and convenient to handle and that all the complexity should be limited to the back end. Simplicity should be the hallmark of the 1001 Strategy. He was keen on having no more than four layers of reporting relationships (i.e. President → Person in charge of the business unit → Person in charge of department → Common employee). This reporting structure was in contrast to the approximately 17 to 18 layers prevalent in traditional enterprises of the size of RSM.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright � 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-10-04India-based Oravel Stays Private Limited (OYO) was South Asia�s biggest among China�s top five largest and the world�s fastest-growing chain of leased and franchised hotels homes and living spaces. According to Fast Company magazine OYO was the 10th most innovative company from India in 2018. In September 2018 the company was valued at US$5 billion. In April 2019 within six years of its inception OYO was present in 11 countries including India China the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom. Ritesh Agarwal founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of OYO wanted to make the company the world�s largest global hotel chain. He stated �We want to convert broken unbranded assets around the globe into better-quality living spaces.� Globally budget hotel space was largely unorganized. OYO investors including venture capitalists like UK-based SoftBank Vision Fund (SoftBank) and US-based Greenoaks Capital believed that OYO could become a large player in several geographies. Satish Meena senior forecast analyst of Forrester India stated �There is an absolute merit in OYO�s back-to-back entry into foreign countries. The size of opportunity seems to have driven investors to value OYO that much.� Nevertheless as the company prepared itself for global expansion problems occurred in its home country India. According to YouGov a UK-based online market research firm the customer satisfaction index for OYO fell from 21 to 15 between July and September 2018 especially among female customers owing to safety issues. In addition in December 2018 some budget and mid-market hoteliers from India decided to file a lawsuit against OYO over breach of contract between OYO and these hoteliers. Jai Vardhan an expert on Indian start-ups considered OYO�s global ambitions lofty and believed that a $5 billion valuation of the company was based on the optimism of its investors regarding OYO�s international expansion potential and not on OYO�s actual performance in its home country. Tim Culpan an award-winning technology journalist also believed that OYO should focus on quality rather than international expansion. He stated �If quality plays second fiddle to expansion OYO�risks becoming�a brand name that�s of little value to anyone.� Agarwal wondered if the company could succeed in international markets or if he needed to reconsider his strategy of focusing on international markets instead of the domestic market. Could legal issues in OYO�s home country create impediments to his growth plan in foreign countries? If so how should Agarwal deal with these issues?BACKGROUNDOYO was founded by Agarwal in 2012 when he was just 19 years old. Prior to starting his venture Agarwal juggled different roles such as a hotel housekeeper and a call centre employee. Agarwal started the OYO journey by first taking a lease on 11 rooms from a hotel located in Gurugram in the north of India. He followed an aggregation model. Whenever hotel owners signed an agreement with OYO OYO upgraded the hotel�s belongings including linen toiletries and bathroom fittings to OYO�s quality specifications. The hotel staff was trained by the company and supplies across hotels were standardized. After a hotel was upgraded OYO listed the hotel on its website with room prices starting from $25 per night. OYO charged a 25 per cent commission to the hotel. For Indian budget travellers who were used to dirty washrooms broken taps and soiled bed linen the standard amenities that OYO provided were like wish fulfillment. This entire service was under the brand name OYO Rooms with OYO standing for �on your own.� Later in 2016 in a move to reduce excessive spending and negative cash flow OYO stopped giving a minimum occupancy guarantee (i.e. an assurance where OYO would pay the hotel if a minimum number of bookings was not received by the hotel) to hoteliers and switched to a revenue-sharing model. Then in 2017 the company shifted from being an aggregator to a franchising model for faster expansion in different geographical markets. By January 2018 90 per cent of OYO�s revenue came from hotels operating under the franchising model wherein OYO leased the hotels from their owners. Agarwal aimed to reach 100 per cent by 2019. Under the franchising agreement OYO spent between $0.14 million and $0.21 million on leasing renovating hiring and deposits for hotel management. The franchising model was also popularly known as a �manachised model� as it had features of both management contracts and franchising. In 2017 OYO expanded the portfolio of its services and launched OYO Home and OYO Townhouse. OYO Home was similar to the Airbnb Inc. (Airbnb) short-term rental marketplace. Under the OYO Home brand OYO provided long-term self-service independent homes managed by OYO. OYO Townhouse on the other hand operated as a 25 per cent hotel 25 per cent home 25 per cent cafe and 25 per cent store. By the end of 2018 OYO had more than 125000 rooms in India and was present in more than 350 cities across nine countries. Despite being in the hotel industry technology was at the heart of OYO�s business model. OYO employed approximately 700 software engineers out of its total workforce of 8500. The engineering team released an average of 20 software developments every day which included new and updated versions of existing mobile applications (apps). For instance one of OYO�s most effective apps ORBIS instantly calculated a hotel�s projected occupancy rate and potential revenues if the hotel joined OYO�s network. ORBIS did this by analyzing �hundreds of thousands of items of data in that particular local lodging market.�INTERNATIONAL MARKET EXPANSIONGlobally the hotels and resorts industry experienced strong growth between 2015 and 2018 mainly due to the rise in global travel and tourism (see Exhibit 1). Among the different hotel segments in 2018 medium-end hotel accommodations had the maximum market share (see Exhibit 2). Globally the majority of travellers staying in hotel accommodations were domestic travellers contributing approximately 55.6 per cent to the industry. By 2018 42.2 per cent of global tourism occurred in Europe followed by North America (see Exhibit 3). However between 2018 and 2024 the annual growth in hotel revenue was expected to remain stagnant at 3 per cent (see Exhibit 1). OYO in the People�s Republic of ChinaOYO started its international expansion in 2016 with Malaysia being its first market. In 2017 it expanded to Nepal and then in November 2017 to China. Despite being fragmented China�s hotel industry was worth $150 billion in 2018. China had a strong influx of both domestic and international tourists. With the economic boom more than 500 million Chinese locals wanted good accommodation at reasonable prices. Agarwal stated that �OYO�s platform of��predictability standardization quality�and affordability� will help attract both guests and investors.� It aimed to add 30000 rooms per month in China to its portfolio. As in India OYO followed the manachised model in China. OYO also launched six OYO Skill Institutes in China; by November 2018 it had trained 924 staff across 76 cities in China. China was also expected to become the leading tourist destination globally by 2030 (see Exhibit 3). In 2018 OYO formed an alliance and signed a five-year memorandum of understanding with Shanghai-based Huazhu Group Ltd. (Huazhu) which was in the business of developing and operating manachised and franchised hotels in China. OYO believed that Huazhu�s experience and expertise in managing large properties could accelerate the growth plans of OYO in China. OYO also signed an agreement with China Lodging Group a hotel operator in China. According to this agreement China Lodging Group invested $10 million in OYO in return for 1 per cent equity in the company. OYO and China Lodging Group were also expected to jointly develop knowledge- and technology-sharing projects related to the field of hospitality. These projects included an exchange program for employees apart from sharing intellectual property. OYO stated �The partnership is also expected to leverage benefits for economies of scale not limited to sourcing and procurement and joint loyalty programs.�OYO scaled up from only a handful of properties in November 2017 to 87000 rooms across 171 cities in China within 10 months of its entry into the country. Within one year of OYO�s expansion into China it became one of China�s top five�hotel chains. Agarwal stated �Our secret to success in China is the way we�ve built our business in the country. We didn�t approach the market like an Indian start-up setting shop in China but like a Chinese player building and localizing the OYO business model to make it work in the Chinese market.� Local managers in China had significant decision-making autonomy to manage the complexities of Chinese markets. Agarwal stated �We operate like a Chinese company not a global company operating in China.� He added �If you go to one of our hotel owners in China and ask them [sic] where OYO is from they�ll say it�s Chinese.� OYO intended to spend approximately $600 million in the Chinese hotel industry. In fact by November 2018 OYO was growing faster in China than in its home market (i.e. India).In February 2019 China�s ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. (Didi Chuxing) also made a $100 million investment in OYO which brought OYO�s $1 billion financing round to a close. OYO and Didi Chuxing�s partnership was not new. In 2017 when OYO entered China it partnered with Didi Chuxing to announce its entry into China�s market. In fact its tag line was �Ride comfortably with Didi Stay comfortably with OYO.�OYO in Middle Eastern CountriesIn October 2018 OYO entered Dubai with an inventory of 1100 rooms. Commenting on the choice of market Manu Midha regional head of Middle East OYO Hotels & Homes stated the �UAE one of the world�s leading MICE [meetings incentives conferencing and events] capital[s] of the world then becomes a highly strategic location for us [OYO].� By 2020 the company was expected to reach 12000 rooms across 150 hotels. In January 2019 OYO also launched OYO Home brand of service in Dubai with 40 homes. The company aimed to increase this to 200 homes by August 2019. Elaborating on OYO Home in the UAE Kavikrut the chief growth officer of OYO stated What we are attempting with OYO Home guarantees [a] unique experience for our guests and higher yields for homeowners. There is significant market opportunity especially as people have invested in second homes in top holiday destinations across the UAE. GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] and international travelers today are open to choosing the comforts of a fully managed holiday home for short stays. OYO in UAE adopted the same manachised model across two- three- and four-star hotels. Commenting on the success of this model Midha stated Since our recent launch we have been inundated with requests from several hotel owners in the UAE to migrate onto OYO�s [manachise] business model. We are on track at the moment and our vision is to support the large number of business travelers that are expected to arrive by the time UAE opens [the] door to its billion-dollar EXPO 2020 with 190 country pavilions. In February 2019 OYO launched operations in Saudi Arabia after signing deals with 50 hotels offering more than 3000 rooms across seven cities. Agarwal said that OYO would completely support Saudi Arabia�s blossoming hospitality ecosystem while creating infrastructure for asset owners so that a high quality of service standards would be ensured. He stated �We are honoured and delighted to support the Saudi government's Vision 2030 for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are committed to continuing investing in the multi-billion dollar opportunity in the hospitality industry in the country.� OYO intended to create over 5000 jobs for Saudi citizens by 2020. The company also intended to launch two OYO Skill Institutes one in Riyadh and another in Jeddah the two major cities of Saudi Arabia to provide hotel management training to Saudi graduates. OYO in the United Kingdom and the United StatesOYO ventured into the United Kingdom in September 2018. According to Agarwal the United Kingdom represented a multi-billion dollar opportunity for OYO. He stated �The UK has been the topmost international travel destination for several years and last year hosted over 19 million tourists from around the world.� He further added that with OYO independent hoteliers of the United Kingdom would be empowered with technology and operational expertise that would help them enhance the customer experience and thus increase sustainable incomes. The United Kingdom was OYO�s first expansion outside Asia. The company planned to invest $53 million to launch its services across 10 British cities. OYO wanted to select hotels from Britain�s 35000 to 40000 independent operators and help them compete by offering design services property management and marketing support. To begin OYO was present in Manchester Birmingham Glasgow and Edinburgh in addition to four properties in London that offered about 80 rooms. Under its Townhouse brand OYO partnered with small-scale hotels through its manachised model. OYO intended to increase its presence in the United Kingdom to more than 5000 rooms by 2020. In the United Kingdom the company also intended to expand its OYO Townhouse hotel brand to between 400 and 500 accommodations by mid-2019. In February 2019 OYO entered the budget hotel market in the United States. It opened an office in Dallas and tested properties in both Austin and Dallas. In December 2018 Marcus Higgins was appointed head of OYO�s US operations. Furthermore several business development managers and sales executives were also hired in cities including Dallas Austin San Antonio Miami Orlando Denver and Charlotte. Commenting on OYO�s US expansion a company spokesperson stated We see great opportunity in this market but also appreciate the competitive nature of franchising and [the] uniqueness of the United States. We will bring learnings from building similar markets like the UK and constantly learn and modify our strategy to suit the needs of the US market like we did to succeed in the UK In 2019 OYO intended to add approximately 2000 hotels in different US states. The company stated that it was in the ��early stages� of expanding in the US market� Commenting on the likelihood of OYO�s success in the United States Robert Cole founder of the hospitality consulting firm RockCheetah stated �The US hotel market isn't clamoring for it but the business model will be very attractive to a lot of small hotel owners who are not being well served by the lower tier hotel franchise brands.� Commenting on the differences between the franchising model of OYO and a typical franchise hotel chain in the United States Cole stated that in a typical franchise model hotels focused only on branding. In contrast OYO had complete control over the technology operations and distribution. According to Cole this difference should have made the OYO model work in the United States. To begin with OYO first partnered with manager-owners which was a soft-brand arrangement (i.e. imposing minimum standards for independent hotels to adhere to as well as providing a marketing platform) later it wholly leased and franchised its budget hotel properties. In the United States with this model OYO was particularly aiming to compete with budget chains such as Best Western Hotels & Resorts Super 8 Worldwide and Choice Hotels International Inc.OYO in JapanIn April 2019 OYO entered the Japanese market in a joint venture with Yahoo! Japan which was considered Japan�s most popular Internet platform. OYOs� presence was made available at Yahoo! Japan�s search engine homepage travel portal and real estate site. Yahoo! Japan had in-depth local knowledge expertise and extensive reach to help OYO have better access to people and inform them about OYO Life which was OYO�s rental housing services. Yahoo! Japan was largely owned by UK-based SoftBank the same venture capitalist firm that had invested in OYO. The joint venture was named OYO Technology and Hospitality Japan (OYO Japan). Hiro Katsuse a Japanese entrepreneur and former Japanese market leader for Handy Japan Co. and Booking.com was appointed CEO for OYO Japan. OYO entered Japan with its rented furnished apartments and townhouses which did not require residents to pay a security deposit or introduction fees. At the time of its official launch in Japan OYO Japan had more than 11000 preregistrations and an occupancy of 114 per cent. The company felt that such a response was because of its immense popularity among students and young professionals. LAVISH FUNDING FROM VENTURE CAPITALISTSSince 2013 OYO had participated in 11 rounds of funding resulting in $1.8 billion in funds. OYO�s latest funding round was in February 2019 for a total value of $100 million (see Exhibit 4). OYO had 18 venture funding partners including SoftBank�Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Critics however believed that OYO was simply burning cash due to its lavish funding. Sarah Tavel partner at the US-based venture capital firm Benchmark stated There�s a lot of strength and value to having a lot of capital but as you know there�s a lot of damage that having a lot of capital can do to a company.... It can diffuse focus it can cover up things that aren�t working inside it and it can stop the leadership from understanding the mechanics of its own business. For instance China was already an oversupplied market in terms of hotels. OYO not only forayed into that market but also offered guarantees of minimum business and pay to hotels if the requisite number of customers did not arrive. According to critics during a recession this could become a dangerous situation for OYO threatening the sustainability of its business. It was also feared that low prices might result in price wars as more competitors entered the market. However lead investor SoftBank insisted that at least OYO�s India hotel business had �unit-level profitability.� This profitability arose because of low customer acquisition costs since most customers of OYO were repeat customers. Furthermore 90 per cent of its customers booked OYO directly online rather than through online searches which required a heavy digital marketing investment. Overall however OYO was facing losses (see Exhibit 5).GLOBAL COMPETITIONBased in Shanghai China Jin Jiang International Holdings Co. Ltd. (Jin Jiang) which owned the world�s fifth-largest hotel chain was a major competitor of OYO in Asia. Jin Jiang had a total of 6932 hotels across 54 countries covering more than 50 brands. The brands included Royal Tulip Golden Tulip Sarovar Hotels Kyriad and Tulip Inn which were operational in India as well. Jin Jiang commented that if it felt threatened by OYO in any country it would compete by bringing its own brand in the aggregator segment where OYO primarily operated. According to unofficial estimates there were more than 4 million unbranded rooms in India out of which OYO covered approximately 1 million. The branded space in India such as Taj Group ITC Hotels and Marriott International Inc. accounted for 100000 upscale rooms. Marriott the world�s largest hotel operator had a global room inventory of 1.28 million as of June 2018. At that time OYO�s room inventory globally stood at 270000. OYO added approximately 140000 rooms to its global portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. Marriott added approximately 20000 rooms in the second quarter of 2018. Agarwal explained that traditional hotel chains took approximately 10 to 11 months for signing a franchise or management-contract deal with a property owner. At any major chain a negotiator would first call his city boss who then called the country boss who called the regional boss and so on. At OYO according to Agarwal �ORBIS on his mobile phone is the boss.� The ORBIS app helped Agarwal and his team calculate risks associated with a deal and arrive at a decision quickly. Agarwal stated that by leveraging data science OYO was able to sign a deal within 10 days of meeting with a property owner. Two other start-ups�namely Treebo Hotels and FabHotel�also ventured into the Indian hotel industry following a model similar to OYO�s. Due to lack of funds these two brands could not expand internationally the way OYO could. Specifically commenting on the threat from OYO to branded hotel chains in the United States Cole stated �OYO won't kill the major hotel brands in the US but if they execute well they can have a successful business that will present the major hotel brands with some challenges similar to the way Airbnb is creating issues.� In March 2019 Agarwal even changed his name for the Chinese market and was known as Li Taixi not Ritesh Agarwal to suit Chinese consumers. He also did not lose focus on the domestic market as he considered borrowing more funds for the expansion of Townhouse in OYO�s home country.PROBLEMS IN THE HOME COUNTRYUnhappy PartnersBudget and mid-market hotels in India suffered due to deep discounting high commissions and contract changes made by OYO. A member of one of the many hotel and restaurant associations of north India commented that once OYO had agreements with a substantial number of hotels across major cities and acquired a reasonable customer base the company started offering deep discounts and forced the partner hotels to abandon the minimum guarantee agreements that they signed with the company. Budget hoteliers jointly considered taking legal action against OYO. Ashraf Ali president of the Budget Hotel Association of Mumbai India stated �Rooms that we used to sell for Rs 2000�2500 [$28.21�$35.26] are now being sold for Rs 800�900 [$11.28�$12.69]. Because of funding they are able to sell rooms at much lower rates. The minimum guarantee fee is also not coming so we are not left with a choice.� In December 2018 the Hotel and Banquet Hall Association of Bareilly a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh India issued a notice to hoteliers emphasizing the suffering of several hoteliers in the city. The notice stated that after paying 25 per cent commission charges to OYO and expenses toward staff salaries electricity and general upkeep small budget hoteliers saw no profits. The notice further stated �A real business partner cares about the partner also but OYO is just concerned about itself at the expense of its partners. They play one up against the other. Beware as giving your hotel to OYO will lead to total loss of goodwill.� After this 15 to 18 hotels in Bareilly ceased partnering with OYO. Hoteliers appealed to the Competition Commission of India about the contractual issue and urged them to investigate the matter. However Ayush Mathur head of supplies at OYO refuted the claims made by hoteliers. He stated This is absolutely incorrect. We have on the contrary invested over thousands of crores in capex [capital expenditure] appointed hundreds of general managers to oversee operations and customer experience and introduced technology-driven innovations in the hospitality sector that [have] greatly transformed the standard of service delivered by a once unbranded hotel now part of the OYO chain. He claimed that since the room rates were decided by OYO the question of discounts did not arise. Mathur further said We have been engaging with the FHRAI [Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India] the apex body that represents all hoteliers and its respected executives and are open to creating a platform for potential discussions and invite all other hotel chains in the country who operate leased or franchised assets to participate in the same. Consumer ComplaintsAs OYO�s scale increased it was frequently criticized for deteriorating quality control. In September 2018 a female customer sharing her experience of staying in an OYO hotel in India claimed the staff attempted to make sexually suggestive calls to her. Subsequently OYO cancelled the franchise agreement of that hotel. A survey by YouGov indicated that the overall brand health of OYO based on parameters such as impression quality value reputation satisfaction and recommendation scores had declined. The �Buzz� score (which calculated whether someone had heard anything positive or negative about the brand) fell from 24.4 in July 2018 to a low of 19.5 in mid-September. Among female customers OYO�s �Buzz� score fell from 20.8 to 12.2 during the same time. The YouGov survey also found that �Likelihood to Recommend� (whether a customer would recommend the brand to a friend or colleague) and �Purchase Intent� for OYO fell among females in September 2018.However a survey conducted by KalaGato an India-based analytic start-up rated OYO�s �Net Promoter Score� (a customer satisfaction measure) as 0.58 in India in 2018. For other operators in India like Agoda Airbnb Hotels.com and Trivago the score ranged from 0.50 and 0.63.OYO believed that leveraging technology allowed its employees to monitor quality. The company claimed that customer problems were rectified within minutes of registration of complaints. OYO believed that it was only because of quality service that it was able to scale in international markets at such a fast rate.THE ROAD AHEADOYO was expected to be India�s first budget travel brand to become global. Commenting on balancing the growth in home and international markets an OYO spokesperson said �We plan to rapidly scale our business in these countries while continuing to invest further in technology and talent.� The company said it would continue its focus on global expansion while customer experience would remain its priority and management would take appropriate steps to ensure quality service and the safety of its customers. According to Agarwal growth not profit was the company�s priority. In a note to OYO employees he stated �With a strong balance sheet we today can go more places than ever introduce new categories invest in our assets while maintaining our high-quality standards without raising any further capital.� The number of �stayed room nights� for OYO increased globally from 6 million in 2016 to�75 million in 2018. As OYO diversified into the home and townhouse sector targeting midscale millennials it reported 90 per cent occupancy in townhouses and planned to enter the luxury space. However a market research analyst warned that at OYO�s pace of growth �their organization can easily be overstretched which may drag facility and service quality down and damage their brand.� Critics have also raised suspicion about the profitability of OYO�s franchising model as it operated at low prices. Commenting on profitability Agarwal mentioned: �Remember for hotels the return is based on two multipliers price and occupancy. Even if you keep the price 10 per cent lower and increase the occupancy three times the return is still roughly 2.8 times. Not bad!� OYO came under scrutiny from the FHRAI which accused the company of large-scale breaches of contract with hotel operators and violation of laws. An OYO spokesperson stated that �allegations were misguided and misplaced and reflected cartelization� by certain groups of hotels that were not even OYO franchisees but had vested personal interests. Would Agarwal reconsider his decision of aggressively expanding internationally? Were legal issues in India likely to hamper growth of his venture abroad? How would he manage quality service and growth simultaneously?EXHIBIT 1: REVENUE GROWTH 2006�2024 (%)�HOTELS AND RESORTS INDUSTRY (GLOBALLY)Note: E = expected revenue growth.Source: �Global Hotels & Resorts Industry�Market Research Report (Industry Performance)� IBISWorld May 2018 updated July 2019 accessed June 29 2019 www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/global-industry-reports/hotels-restaurants/hotels-resorts.html.EXHIBIT 2: MARKET SHARE OF DIFFERENT HOTEL SEGMENTS 2018 (%) Source: �Global Hotels & Resorts Industry�Market Research Report (Products and Markets)� IBISWorld May 2018 updated July 2019 accessed June 29 2019 www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/global-industry-reports/hotels-restaurants/hotels-resorts.html.EXHIBIT 3: TOP 5 TOURIST DESTINATIONS worldwide BY NUMBER OF VISITIORS (IN millions)Source: Eric Rosen �New Rankings Of The World's Fastest-Growing Tourism Destinations� Forbes September 6 2018 accessed January 10 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/2018/09/06/new-rankings-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-tourism-destinations/#16e7df7c57ea; �Leading Country Destination Worldwide in 2016 By Number of Visitors (In Millions)� Statista September 18 2017 accessed January 10 2019 www.statista.com/statistics/750800/ranking-tourist-destination-worldwide-number-of-visitors/; Kate Whiting �Why China Will Soon Be the World's Top Destination for Tourists� World Economic Forum November 13 2018 accessed January 12 2019 www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/china-will-be-the-world-s-top-tourist-destination-by-2030/.EXHIBIT 4: OYO�FUNDING ROUNDS AND VALUATION ($ millionS)Note: *For details on the objective of different funding rounds (for a start-up and the funding venture capitalists) refer to Alejandro Cremades �How Funding Rounds Work For Startups� Forbes December 26 2018 accessed February 12 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2018/12/26/how-funding-rounds-work-for-startups/#63c78c6d7386.Source: �OYO: Funding Rounds� Crunchbase accessed March 10 2019 www.crunchbase.com/organization/oyo-rooms#section-funding-rounds.

This new form of commerce had been called the sharing economy the gig economy the platform peer sharing and even the on-demand economy. Within this context Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber) transformed itself into an international transportation powerhouse that dominated its sector of the sharing economy in just seven years. Uber had gross booking revenues of US$5.4 billion in 2016 and net revenue in the fourth quarter of that year of $1.7 billion. It operated in 70 countries had an approximate valuation of $70 billion in 2017 and maintained a polished web presence that was designed to reflect regional cultural norms. However Uber’s rise to prominence was controversial almost from the company’s inception. The corporation had an increasingly contentious relationship with its drivers and was the subject of numerous lawsuits which included a much-publicized sexual harassment lawsuit that eventually contributed to the departure of co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Travis Kalanick. What had been the substance of Kalanick’s tumultuous era and how had his leadership as CEO affected Uber’s organizational culture? How did Uber’s manipulation of its drivers through the use of knowledge derived from behavioural science affect the company’s operations? And finally after Kalanick had been fired what were the options for Uber’s next plan of action? KALANICK: The perennial entrepreneurKalanick was a product of the southern California suburbs. He attended high school in Northridge just outside of Los Angeles. Kalanick’s father was an engineer and his mother pursued a career as a retail advertiser with the Los Angeles Daily News. When he was young Kalanick was known for being confident persuasive and a particularly good salesman—a quality he demonstrated as he sold knives door to door for Cutco. Some described the young Kalanick as a perpetual hustler who always had his game face on. Those who had known Kalanick when he was young agreed in interviews and other commentary that he was a smart intense hyper-rational and driven entrepreneur. At the same time many viewed him as both an egotist and an opportunist who had no compunctions about stepping on people’s toes in order to succeed. Kalanick started his first business an SAT-preparatory service called New Way Academy when he was 18. His own impressive SAT scores helped him get accepted at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where he majored in computer engineering. This was where he met Michael Todd Vince Busam and Dan Rodrigues who were working on a peer-to-peer search engine enterprise called Scour which was supported by angel funding from their friends and relatives. Kalanick was hired at Scour in 1998 and he dropped out of college to work for the start-up. Although Kalanick was actually Scour’s second employee he often later described himself as one of the company’s founders sometimes to the dismay of the actual founders. Kalanick took no salary for a year but instead lived on unemployment insurance while he devoted considerable energy and talent to the file-sharing enterprise. Working out of Rodrigues’s apartment bedroom Kalanick handled business development and marketing for Scour and became known for the guerrilla marketing campaigns he undertook to push the product name. Scour was ultimately sued for $250 billion by a group of entertainment companies that claimed Scour had allowed consumers to obtain copyrighted content without paying for it. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000.After the demise of Scour Kalanick had a new venture underway almost immediately. He and Todd launched Red Swoosh a technology company that focused on delivering web content and worked by having users share bandwidth. In effect Red Swoosh was a networking software company. Kalanick called it his revenge company; he intended to make the customers of the companies that had sued Scour his customers. By mid-2001 the company had seven employees but was completely out of cash and struggled to meet its payroll obligations. Even worse the financial effects of the attacks of September 11 2001 meant that start-up funding—especially for companies in the software industry—was disappearing. As Red Swoosh struggled the company cut corners and neglected its financial responsibilities including the responsibility to withhold income taxes from employees’ paycheques. The company soon owed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $110000 for unpaid income tax—a criminal offence. The founders were able to pay the debt before the end of 2001. They avoided prosecution but the company was almost finished financially. Employees had gone through long periods without any pay at all and disputes arose over stock options that were promised but not realized. According to insiders both Kalanick and Todd had hidden business decisions from each other and each had accused the other in the IRS debacle. Their amicable business relationship was permanently destroyed and Todd left Red Swoosh. After Todd’s departure Kalanick managed Red Swoosh through a series of ups and downs until 2007 when he sold the company to Akamai for $23 million. Many former employees of Red Swoosh later made negative comments about their impressions of Kalanick noting his constant reinterpretation of events his pomposity and his winner-take-all attitude. Meanwhile Kalanick had been working for three years without a salary and had lived in his parents’ basement for a time after Todd’s departure from Red Swoosh. He had relocated the company headquarters to Thailand as a cost-saving measure and had made numerous changes to the team in order to make Red Swoosh a success.The sale of Red Swoosh made Kalanick a millionaire. He spent the first year after the sale travelling the world and investing in various projects. During his travels he met Garrett Camp from whom he first heard the idea for Uber. The company began as UberCab under Camp and co-founders Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan. Kalanick was brought on board in 2008 as an advisor and he quickly gave himself the title of chief incubator. UberCab was officially launched in 2010 with Camp as CEO but Camp in an amicable arrangement deferred to Kalanick at the end of the year. Kalanick became CEO while Camp assumed the role of general manager. Kalanick had earned a reputation for being a hard worker but he also spent much of his time embroiled in various controversies of his own creation. Kalanick made enemies quickly. His foes included regulators in jurisdictions where the company was located business and personal rivals the taxi industry and even customers who criticized the company. Kalanick expressed himself vigorously in speeches e-mails company blogs and videos. In early 2017 a video distributed by Bloomberg showed Kalanick losing his temper in an argument with one of his drivers about falling pay rates. Kalanick was verbally combative with the driver and used profanity—and was forced to quickly offer a public apology only hours after the video began airing. Kalanick did not deliver his apology to the driver in person but instead delivered an e-mail apology to all employees and referred to a different conversation with the driver. The apology was subsequently posted to the company’s public blog. At least one contemporary analyst noted that Kalanick’s approach was to win at all costs. This was a source of strength but was also the executive’s biggest weakness. Certainly Kalanick embodied the stereotype of a technology industry mover and shaker: he was young brash energetic known for his intensity and pompous style and was credited with being reckless although effective by many who had known him over the years. However the video of Kalanick’s argument with the Uber driver publicized the dark side of Uber’s top manager and shed light on another undesirable personality trait: immaturity. Employees who mimicked Kalanick’s full-tilt work- and lifestyle were known within the company as “Uberettos”—a comparison that was not meant to be flattering.Uber’s CultureLike that of all founders or early leaders of organizations Kalanick’s personality and style made a lasting imprint on Uber. The company’s organizational culture was influenced significantly by Kalanick’s demonstrated values and ethics. Some of these values and ethics were illustrated in a list of 14 core values Kalanick presented to employees before a company retreat in Las Vegas in 2014. Among the phrases in the list were “toe-stepping” “always be hustlin’” “super pumped” and “principled confrontation.” Kalanick demonstrated similar thinking early in the company’s history: a profanity-filled 2013 letter he sent to employees was found during an investigation into sexual harassment at the company just before his departure in June 2017. The document set “rules” for an upcoming company party in Miami; these included a monetary penalty for vomiting and a prohibition against throwing kegs from the tops of buildings and the document outlined explicit rules for sex between co-workers.Unethical behaviour was often the rule at Uber and the corporation’s highly publicized activities certainly influenced public perception of the company. Uber’s dispute with its drivers for instance was the source of numerous articles in the public press as well as the subject of blog posts from Uber itself and the topic of social media postings from current and former drivers. Uber’s internal measurement of driver satisfaction showed driver turnover averaged approximately 25 per cent every three months. The sexual harassment allegations levelled in 2017 by former employee Susan Fowler were certainly well-publicized. Uber used questionable tactics against rival ride-sharing company Lyft in San Francisco. Uber employees booked rides with Lyft drivers and then cancelled and Uber used “brand ambassadors” who booked rides with Lyft and then tried to persuade the Lyft drivers to work for Uber. Uber also purchased analytical data about Lyft’s customers and used the information to evaluate Lyft’s financial health. Additionally Uber gathered an intimidating legal team and hired a private investigator to interview friends and colleagues of its legal adversaries. It made extensive use of political operatives who argued the company’s merits with officials at all levels of government including the federal administration under President Obama. The corporation’s well-known aggressive philosophy and disregard for regulations was reflected in the observable artifact that hung proudly on a wall at Uber’s headquarters: the first cease-and-desist order issued to the company. The company’s reputation epitomized that of the Silicon Valley tech industry in general. For example executives had an overall disdain for regulation a penchant for flouting laws an active anti-union stance and a boy’s-club atmosphere that devalued female employees and was often rampant with sexual harassment. Uber also used technology such as Greyball and other cyber products that helped it evade government officials who were investigating Uber’s operations. Uber used surge pricing—that is raising rates at various times and locations when the corporation felt it could dominate the marketplace—to increase profits. Uber even instituted surge pricing during hurricanes and blizzards. Surge pricing infuriated users who perceived it as price gouging. controversial practicesIn early 2015 Kalanick had a meeting with Tim Cook the CEO of Apple Inc. (Apple). Although Kalanick showed up wearing his trademark hot pink socks and red tennis shoes his bravado was short lived. Cook had summoned Kalanick because Uber technicians had unsuccessfully tried to alter the company’s ride-sharing app so that its activities would be hidden from Apple’s technicians. Kalanick had used the app to identify and tag iPhone users—even those who had deleted the Uber app from their iPhones. Kalanick agreed to desist after Cook threatened to remove Uber’s app from Apple’s app store which would likely have decimated Uber’s customer base.In mid-2015 a privacy rights group the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a lengthy complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Uber. The complaint alleged that Uber’s information gathering practices were dangerous to consumers. EPIC claimed that Uber collected data about passengers after their rides were concluded by monitoring GPS data even after users had turned off their GPS location finders. This allowed Uber to access users’ contact lists for marketing purposes. This ability to track locations and identify and collect data about users was an internal program at Uber known as “God View” and the program worked without the users’ knowledge. EPIC further claimed that Uber had already abused users’ trust when it tracked the location of journalists who had reported on the app and then shared personal information about the journalists within the workplace.Uber similarly used a secret program called VTOS an acronym for “violation of terms of service” which identified potential abusers of the service as well as law enforcement officials who sought to ticket or otherwise compromise Uber’s drivers. VTOS included a tool called Greyball which was first noticed in operation in Portland Oregon in 2014 when the company used it to evade local officials who were trying to catch Uber drivers who operated illegally in the city. Greyball used an algorithm to identify where and when customers opened the Uber app; for example it identified those who opened the app in proximity to a government agency or building. After Greyball identified potential law enforcement agents the app tagged the users denied them rides or cancelled rides already accepted. It then sent them a fake app populated with ghost drivers to protect the actual locations of real Uber drivers. In May 2017 the U.S. Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation into Uber’s use of Greyball but neither the Justice Department nor Uber released any public comment about the situation. Uber had publicly announced in early 2017 that it would no longer use the Greyball tool.Economic Advisory CouncilThe year 2017 began poorly for Kalanick and continued that way until his eventual departure from the company in June. Kalanick joined President Trump’s economic advisory council in December 2016 and encountered a strong backlash from employees during the year’s first all-hands meeting in January 2017. Employees were primarily critical of the president’s immigration policies. In fact President Trump’s immigration stance was almost universally unpopular with workers and executives in the tech industry many of whom were immigrants themselves or believed strongly in globalization.When New York City taxi drivers supported protests against President Trump’s selective immigration ban by striking at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January 2017 Uber responded by saying that it was not going to institute surge pricing. This was perceived by the New York City taxi drivers as intimidation meant to break their strike although it was unclear if that was actually the intent of Uber’s press release.Kalanick announced his departure from the council after only a week but Uber employees had to convince him that he needed to distance himself from President Trump’s policies. Employees circulated a 25-page letter in the workplace that listed the reasons employees wanted Kalanick to resign from the council. Meanwhile more than 200000 customers had deleted their Uber apps and accounts since Kalanick had announced he would join the president’s council. There was considerable concern about how easy it was for them to delete the Uber app and replace it with Lyft’s. Uber’s Use of Behavioural ScienceUber used a variety of psychological techniques to influence where when and how long its drivers worked. These approaches used graphics and video game techniques and included noncash rewards that enticed drivers into working longer hours. The company intended to minimize its labour costs as much as possible and it often needed drivers to work in areas and at hours that were not as profitable for them as other times and places. At times the company’s own efficiency worked against it because faster pickup times overall meant more idle time for individual drivers and this led drivers to log off from service. To prevent this and because many individuals felt comfortable with earnings goals Uber alerted drivers to how close they were to achieving earnings targets which prompted some drivers to remain available. While Uber was concerned with shortages of drivers in areas where demand existed or was forecasted drivers were concerned with earning a sufficient wage. Uber tried to influence drivers to achieve dollar targets rather than working mainly when times were busy. One method Uber used to get drivers where it wanted them to be was by sending a continuous barrage of e-mails texts and pop-up boxes through the app to get the drivers’ attention. Sometimes these messages were accompanied by small maps with icons that indicated where they should go. Some local managers also realized that in areas with a high percentage of male drivers a female persona on the app produced better results in keeping drivers logged on for service. Uber also imitated an algorithm used by Netflix to keep its viewers watching. Uber automatically provided drivers with information on the next available fare opportunity in effect imitating Netflix’s technique that created binge-watching and was aimed at keeping viewers logged on. Uber’s version used a technique called forward dispatch which was an algorithm that sent drivers new fares before they had delivered their current customers to their destinations. This made Uber very efficient at choosing the closest driver but it also resulted in drivers working longer hours. Uber revealed that the number one complaint drivers had that led to them sign off was idle time. Unfortunately for the drivers Uber’s app did not allow them to see the next passenger’s destination before accepting the ride. Although drivers could pause the automatic forward dispatch feature it re-established itself as soon as the driver accepted another ride or logged on again.In addition to the persistence of forward dispatch drivers reported that Uber routinely resisted their efforts to log off. Uber usually responded with texts about earnings goals or encouraged the drivers to take another fare. Uber often showed drivers a graphic of a dollar sign with a needle that did not quite reach the goal. Uber was merely mimicking a technique that game developers had used for years: Uber had created a ludic loop—a psychological feeling of progress toward a goal that was always just out of grasp. Uber also used game-related metrics to influence drivers; these included graphics measuring passenger ratings and time logged on. Uber had recently developed a feature for its app that stored drivers’ preferences and gave them more control over their schedules by letting them set the times and places they needed to be. This would be good for the drivers and it also allowed Uber to forecast labour needs. However there was no evidence that this change was implemented or disseminated to the drivers. As a matter of practice Uber also gathered data on drivers’ driving habits such as braking and acceleration speeds and collected customer comments. Certainly Uber’s engineers could have discovered ways to use this data to improve driver and customer safety. It could be argued that Uber’s use of behavioural science was abusive to its drivers because the company maintained a low wage ceiling and influenced its drivers with gaming techniques that could be considered unethical. According to one perspective Uber manipulated its full-time drivers in ways that caused them to remain in a low-wage job and enticed others to continue to operate personal businesses that would not allow them to make ends meet. One commentator indicated that Uber’s drivers were paid with badges that did not cost Uber anything. By March 2017 the leadership at Uber knew they were in the midst of a serious cultural crisis and the realization was undoubtedly powerful. Top leaders called a press conference and announced they had been rethinking their relationship with their drivers who had complained about their indifferent treatment and shrinking pay for years. Self-Driving CarsUber’s attitude of principled confrontation was never more apparent than in the corporation’s quest to transition to self-driving cars. Uber had begun operations testing of self-driving cars in three states: California Arizona and Pennsylvania. In California 20 companies were certified to begin testing of self-driving cars on state roads. Uber was not on the list and the head of Uber’s autonomous vehicle program Anthony Levandowski publicly declared that the regulations limiting self-driving cars without state permits did not apply to Uber. Uber used self-driving cars beginning in California in August 2016 although the company neglected to inform the traffic division of the San Francisco Police Department. During the first day of the pilot run in San Francisco two of Uber’s self-driving cars were observed running red lights. Although Uber could have received permits for its self-driving cars if it had submitted to the regulatory process instead it had taken a defiant stance based on the form of technology it used. The corporation contended the technology made their cars different from other self-driving cars. Even after the mayor of San Francisco made a personal phone call to Uber to warn the company to stop using the self-driving cars Uber officials responded in blog posts that called the requirement for a permit debatable. The California Department of Motor Vehicles responded through the state’s attorney general with threats of immediate legal action. Uber’s woes were exacerbated even more in early 2017 when Alphabet Inc. the parent company of Waymo asked for an injunction against Uber’s use of self-driving cars and alleged that Levandowski had stolen the technology from Waymo when he was an employee there. Uber later suspended all operations with self-driving cars when one of its vehicles crashed in a highly publicized incident in Arizona although it appeared that the Uber car might not have been at fault. Despite setbacks Uber committed to a future business model that used self-driving cars. This was an example of automation at work: the replacement of the most expensive part of the business equation the human with a machine. One of Uber’s other strategic initiatives involved urban air transport using vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing—that is flying cars. Uber had already formed relationships with a variety of partners in the venture. Its primary goal was to transform urban transportation by creating an on-demand network of high-speed flight in cities facilitated by technology that was similar to the Uber driving app. The flying car initiative was announced in April 2017 and the notion immediately raised numerous questions. These related to issues such as noise problems in cities testing regulation implementation of the technology certification and control systems.Allegations of Sexual HarassmentIn February 2017 a blog post by a former Uber engineer who had left the company the previous December exposed the company’s entrenched atmosphere of sexism and sexual harassment. An investigation followed almost immediately 20 employees were fired and the executive group was restructured. The former employee Susan Fowler who said she had been ignored by Uber’s human resources department when she had tried to file a sexual harassment claim against her direct supervisor posted her lengthy public accusation after finding new employment. Fowler worked at Uber from November 2015 through December 2016. While she had gone so far as to supply screenshots of the executive’s offensive solicitations to the human resource department Fowler was told by upper management that they were uncomfortable punishing her supervisor because he had high performance reviews and that it was probably just an honest mistake on his part. Within hours of the publication of the blog post Kalanick delivered a public statement by e-mail to say that this was the first time he had heard of the allegations and to explain that he had instructed the head of the human resource department to open an urgent investigation into Fowler’s claims. Fowler’s post about the sexist corporate culture at Uber reinforced the widespread public notion that the tech industry was rampant with sexual harassment and sexism. Her allegations followed much-publicized incidents in 2015 when Ellen Pao had filed similar charges in a lawsuit against upper management at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and later in 2017 when six female employees at Binary Capital accused a co-founder of that company of sexual harassment.The atmosphere of sexual harassment at Uber began at the top with Kalanick who once bragged in a Gentleman’s Quarterly interview that his association with Uber had boosted his desirability with women and jokingly referred to his company as “boob-er.” In early June 2017 after the law firm Perkins Coie LLP had finished their internal investigation into the allegations of widespread sexual harassment Uber fired 20 employees for inappropriate behaviour. This was quickly followed by the firing of Eric Alexander the company’s president of business in the Asia Pacific region. Alexander had acquired the medical records of a woman in India who had allegedly been raped by her Uber driver. Alexander then shared those records with Kalanick and another vice-president. This resulted in a lawsuit by the woman who alleged that Uber wanted the records to destroy her credibility.Kalanick announced in early June 2017 that he would take an indefinite leave of absence and he handed over management of day-to-day operations to a group of executives. Within a week however five of Uber’s largest investors including Benchmark Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments demanded Kalanick’s resignation and forced him out of the company.Outlook for uberWhat options did Uber have for their next plan of action? While Kalanick had helped to build Uber into an international transportation powerhouse that operated in more than 70 countries and had a value of approximately $70 billion his often out-of-control style had also delivered the company to the brink of destruction. Uber’s U.S. market share declined in the first six months of 2017 as consumers and drivers alike reacted to the variety of negative issues that clouded the company’s future. By January 2017 approximately half a million subscribers had deleted the Uber app from their phones in a widespread campaign known as #DeleteUber. Rival on-demand provider Lyft gained 7 per cent of the Chicago market during the same time period.Uber had earned its reputation which was negative enough that having been employed at Uber was for some employees a black mark on their resumes. An anti-Uber website titled Why Everyone Hates Uber listed and described Uber’s controversial practices. Uber had needed to change its practices for some time. Top leadership at Uber perpetuated a hostile workplace that was rampant with sexism; the company was accused of using stolen intellectual property and it utilized behavioural science knowledge that manipulated rather than engaged its drivers. Many high-level executives besides Kalanick had left Uber by the middle of 2017. These included Jeff Jones the company president who left after a six-month tenure several high-level executives who left after the sexual harassment investigation the vice-president of product and growth and the top security researcher. After Kalanick’s departure top leaders at Uber quickly stressed the need for better top executives and an improved organizational culture while commentators speculated about the advantages of hiring a female CEO to help turn around the corporation’s culture. Uber had committed to self-driving cars but it had not developed a solution to the current challenges with its drivers which were significant because the cost of changing to an employee-based work system was prohibitive. Finally some analysts cautioned that Uber’s finances needed better controls that would generate cash and stimulate outside investment. There was no doubt that Uber needed to move quickly and decisively. Uber was especially vulnerable while it changed direction and leadership. Some analysts noted that it was a perfect time for competitors to steal Uber’s best remaining talent who had proven skills and it could be a dangerous time if company morale plummeted and consumer confidence in Uber faded.ENDNOTES

NPCI�s organizational form was unique: A not-for-profit entity that was initiated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) India�s central bank but owned by a consortium of India�s leading banks. By creating multiple new products for India�s financial payments system NPCI established its reputation as a trail-blazing financial technology (fintech) innovator. Many of its platforms which were initially devised as unique solutions for India had by now attracted the attention of other countries. As NPCI moved on to further streamlining national payment systems in the digital age the RBI decided to open up the market allowing banks and other financial services companies to compete directly. Did NPCI have the right structures processes and strategies to continue to thrive in this rapidly evolving environment or should it change the not-for-profit collaborative organizational structures that had made it successful in the first place?INDIA�s FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE: �CASH IS KING DIGITIAL IS DIVINE�In 2018 the RBI came up with a catchy motto: �Cash is king digital is divine� signalling how far India had come in digital payments. Some analysts claimed that India had surpassed the West in payment technology.India�s journey toward a cashless economy began in the early 1990s when following economic liberalization India experienced a significant improvement in economic growth. With the increase in commerce came a wave of banking needs for businesses and individuals and this resulted in an unprecedented increase in banking activities. Despite practically no change in the number of commercial banks during 19912005 deposits and credits grew by an annual average of more than 16 per cent in that period. While the liberalization policies including the new regulations for the financial sector contributed to this massive growth in banking activities an even more important role was played by the proliferation of information technology in handling large-scale increases in payments and settlements.By 2005 almost all private banks and 77.5 per cent of public sector bank branches were fully computerized of which 28 per cent had core banking solutions. There were 21147 bank-operated automated teller machines (ATMs) nationwide. Also the acceptance of credit cards for retail payments had increased sharply as had the use of various new funds transfer and settlement technologies. Consequently non-paper-based payments and settlements had increased from 29.4 per cent in 200102 to 51.2 per cent in 200506.The digital revolution provided India with an opportunity to surpass more advanced markets through technology. The banking landscape however was dominated by several state-owned banks that were lagging in pioneering new technologies. The absence of a common platform offering interoperability across different banks caused delays in payments and settlements. Along with this a low penetration of bank accounts beyond urban areas was hampering the growth of the burgeoning financial sector. The inefficiencies in interoperability reduced the attractiveness of owning an account and a low volume of accounts in turn made any investment in technologies mitigating those inefficiencies prohibitively expensive. India�s time for overtaking had not yet come.It fell on the RBI India�s central bank to look for solutions that could smooth inefficiencies in the financial system. To this end the RBI had already taken several measures. For large-scale interbank transfers new real-time gross settlement systems allowed for faster settlements. In addition the RBI started incentivizing banks to adopt cost-efficient payment technologies while also improving the legal infrastructure for digital payments. However the RBI also had a broader mandate to pursue financial inclusion which would require more innovative fintech solutions. In order to achieve its goals the RBI came up with a road map entitled Financial Sector Technology Vision Document (2005) which ultimately led to the emergence of an unlikely homegrown Indian fintech innovator: the NPCI.THE BIRTH OF NPCI: publicprivate collaboration reimaginedBy 2005 the RBI was ready to roll out a pilot for its cheque truncation system (CTS) which would reduce cheque clearing time to a single day. However the RBI recognized that improving cost efficiency in the payments and settlements system was not possible without a greater level of interoperability among banks and other financial service firms. A critical question was who should be responsible for spearheading the development of a new interoperability technology.The banks did not have enough incentive to invest in developing such infrastructure themselves. The public nature of interoperability infrastructure made investments susceptible to potential free-rider problems. If the RBI were to appoint a single for-profit entity to develop the entire interoperability technology for payments and settlements an undesirable concentration of market power could potentially result.As a way forward the RBI consulted the Indian Banks� Association (IBA) to design a solution. The RBI and the IBA came up with the idea of forming a not-for-profit �co-opetitive� entitya structure characterized by co-operation among competitors. The new entity would be jointly owned by competing banks and focus on improving inefficiencies in the interoperability system.It was an intriguing proposition. In a world dominated by faith in the invisible hand of competition could a not-for-profit collaboration between competing players deliver innovation? Naturally this not-so-traditional idea raised a few questions: Had such a model ever been tried? Even if the model were workable on paper would profit-seeking banks be interested in co-operating with each other?It turned out that a couple of similar examples could in fact be found in the financial sector. Interestingly these came from none other than the bastion of free market capitalismthe United States. Both Visa Inc. (Visa) and Mastercard Incorporated (Mastercard) had been not-for-profit co-operatives with thousands of banks and credit unions across the United States as members. Only recently had these two credit card giants become independent firms. While a co-opetitive model among banks was certainly not without precedence unlike Visa/Mastercard which were private sector initiatives it was the regulator that had championed the idea of a coopetition in India.A creative reimagination of publicprivate collaboration was warranted to solve this collective action problem inhibiting digital growth. After much deliberation a road map and scope of operations for the new firm was drawn up by the RBI and the IBA and the 10 largest commercial banks agreed to go ahead with the plan. These banks included six public sector banks two private sector banks and two multinational banks. To overcome potential resistance to co-operation among competitors the banks were assured that the profits from any transaction would be retained by the bank that executed the transaction while the co-opetitive firm would focus only on innovation. Thus NPCI was born.AN INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURENPCI started its journey in 2008 with the mission of establishing �safe secure sound and efficient payment and settlement systems for the country.� This new venturethe progeny of publicprivate collaborationwas intended to leverage technology to significantly reduce transaction time remain cost efficient and allow interoperability among banks and other payment platforms. It was decided that NPCI would be incubated by the RBI for the first three years after which it would operate independently while being regulated by the RBI. According to NPCI�s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Dilip Asbe the organization�s goal was �to touch every Indian through digital payment platforms.�NPCI�s mandate was to develop a homegrown platform that could be scaled up to create a flexible ecosystem for interoperability. One key issue that needed to be resolved was whether to rely on foreign technology or to develop it in-house. The industry norm was to purchase key technologies from specialist vendors or outsource them entirely. For instance Kenya�s money transfer service M-Pesa used technology from Visa and Bangladesh�s bKash service used technology from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. NPCI on the other hand was completely homegrown which not only provided flexibility but also helped in terms of cost efficiency. As Vishal Anand Kanvaty NPCI�s chief of market innovation explained �We completely insourced our technology. We didn�t want any third-party dependency. We wanted to have complete control of the codes to make changes.�For the new entity to deliver on its promise the RBI and the IBA needed to make sure that the right people were hired the right organizational structure was designed and the right type of rewards metrics were implemented. From the start NPCI deliberately put together a group of people who were not from the RBI or the banking system but rather primarily from the technology sector. It was important that these hires believed in the mission of NPCI. In fact NPCI operated very much like a private entity with its own board independent of both the RBI and the IBA.Both the RBI and the IBA had the foresight to recognize the potential advantages and drawbacks of such publicprivate collaborations. Although being part of a government agency could be useful when it came to offering public goods such close ties might also attract bureaucratic interventionantithetical to innovation. Likewise while private ownership could offer a customer-centric orientation critical for innovation the typical private sector focus on profitability could slow down investments in common payments infrastructure.A not-for-profit multi-bank ownership structure combined with an independent board regulated by the RBI provided NPCI with the best of both worlds. While NPCI�s independence gave it much-needed breathing space to innovate a not-for-profit structure made it possible for NPCI to focus on long-term collective benefits without having to worry about short-run market pressures.CREATING THE FINTECH HIGHWAYNPCI�s first set of innovations was meant to improve existing systems in terms of efficiency and speed� something that clearly benefited all banks who used these systems as well as their ultimate customers. NPCI was able to improve the basic workings of the existing financial system in India. At the time of the launch the RBI handed over to NPCI the responsibility of finding solutions in three areas: (1) expansion of the National Financial Switch (NFS) (2) implementation of the CTS and (3) upgradation of the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS). These technologies were already being developed by the RBI.The NFS became the largest network of shared ATMs in India after NPCI took over its operations from the RBI. In 2009 there were around 50000 ATMs nationwide under the NFS. As of July 2019 the network connected over 241000 ATMs. Thus NPCI was able to bring together under this co-opetitive umbrella not only the large banks but also many smaller regional and co-operative banks. In fact NPCI established tie-ups with several international card schemes�namely Discover Financial Services Japan Credit Bureau and China UnionPay International�allowing international cardholders of these organizations to use ATMs connected to the NFS network.Similarly the CTS became the standard for cheque clearing in India. The process involved capturing the beneficiary�s information encoded in the cheque and sharing it digitally thereby eliminating the need for physical transportation. This reduced the cheque clearing time by up to nine working days. The benefits offered by the CTS apart from the faster clearing cycle included a better verification process same-day local cheque clearing and next-day intercity cheque clearing minimized transaction costs and minimized operational risk by securing the transmission route. Soon after the adoption of the new standards new peaks were achieved in the cheque clearing process.At the time NPCI took over upgrading the ECS system from the RBI multiple systems were in operation at the local regional and national level. These systems were platforms that could be used for repetitive and periodic transactions which were typically large in volume. NPCI consolidated all of these systems running across the country under one web-based solution�the National Automated Clearing House (NACH). Despite being one centralized system NACH allowed enough flexibility to let the member banks design and customize the associated services for their clients. A few months into its launch in July 2013 NACH processed around US$170 million. In September 2020 the amount processed through this system was $17 billion. Almost simultaneously NPCI started working on developing a more efficient solution for interbank fund transfer the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) system. This was the first major platform developed from scratch by NPCI. Transferring funds in real time had been a major problem for the banking industry and IMPS solved this challenge by allowing real-time fund transfers using the NFS thereby improving both the safety and economy of such transactions.The success of these novel interoperability products established NPCI�s reputation as a fintech innovator while improving the ecosystem by creating a common �highway� for the banks. According to Kanvaty �NPCI is the highway that connects all banks on a single platform where all messages are standardized and every bank can talk to any other bank in the country.�A HELPING HAND FROM THE GOVERNMENT: The �JAM TRINITY� AS THE CATALYSTHaving successfully innovated and put in place new systems to improve interoperability among existing players and increase their efficiency the next task for NPCI was to go beyond offering efficiency in interoperability and become a key stakeholder in the nation�s financial inclusion drive.Building trust was key to providing convenient payment solutions for every Indian. As Arif Khan chief digital officer at NPCI reflected: �Building trust in the early days laid the foundation for the growth in the ecosystem of payments.� NPCI started gaining this trust by facilitating instant bank-to-bank transfers greater ATM interoperability and easy linking of bank accounts with mobile phones.However a large portion of the Indian population remained unbanked due to issues on both the supply and demand side of the financial ecosystem. On the demand side unbanked people did not seem to have any real use for banking services. They primarily engaged in localized small-scale economic activities conducting all transactions in cash. Moreover the low levels of literacy and lack of proof of identity among this population segment were impediments for complex economic transactions. On the supply side it was simply not financially feasible for commercial banks to provide services to much of the unbanked population. The potential transaction volumes were too low for the banks to make the services accessible to this section of the population. Thus there was neither demand nor supply for the services among the unbanked population.Three important pieces eventually came together to help NPCI solve the puzzle on the demand side. First there was a remarkably high penetration of mobile phones among the unbanked population. Second the government of India had started issuing Aadhaar cards (national identity cards) to identify much of the population. These cards could be used to resolve the onerous know-your-customer requirements of the central bank. Third if government subsidies for the unbanked population could be channelled through the banking system instead of through the local administration then demand for banking could potentially be ignited. This led the government of India to introduce the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana schemepopularly known as �Jan Dhan� (people�s wealth). Under this scheme individuals no longer needed a minimum amount to open an account which greatly increased the demand for banking services. Together these three componentsJan Dhan Aadhaar cards and mobile phonescame to be known as the JAM trinity.CONNECTING THE DOTS WITH RUPAYWith the JAM trinity in place to spur demand there was a need to improve the supply side. As a way to provide a common channel across multiple banks NPCI launched an affordable card scheme RuPay. Developed from scratch RuPay allowed NPCI to provide similar services as any other card scheme such as Visa or Mastercard at just one-sixth of the cost. The ability to launch a card with low fees incentivized the commercial banks to adopt RuPay immediately. Moreover the pricing structure for RuPay was deliberately kept at a simple flat rate for all customers unlike Visa or Mastercard. This helped in the adoption of RuPay by both larger and smaller banks.Another challenge was to understand the needs of the unbanked. In an effort to do so the banks engaged individuals known as �bank mitras� (friends of the bank) as local bank representatives to help community members open bank accounts. The bank mitras received a commission for every newly opened account and each transaction. The community members trusted the bank mitras with their finances as they knew them personally. This concept became an important pillar for NPCI�s financial inclusion drive as it brought financial services to the customer�s doorstep. The combination of the JAM trinity RuPay cards and bank mitras thus led to a revolution in financial inclusion. The RuPay card issuance drive mandated by Jan Dhan became a massive success leading to more than 600 million RuPay cardholders across India in 2019.Subsidies such as home gas subsidies and insurance benefits started coming directly into the bank accounts of beneficiaries. Three hundred and fifty eight million beneficiaries were part of Jan Dhan with almost $20 billion deposited into bank accounts. Thanks to RuPay and bank mitras almost 80 per cent of the adults in India had bank accounts by 2017 far outpacing other emerging economies (see Exhibit 1). The high penetration of digital banking also facilitated direct government transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.To take full advantage of the recently built national payments ecosystem NPCI had earlier launched three other solutions for facilitating financial inclusion. These were (1) the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) (2) *99# and (3) the Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) System. NPCI launched AePS in 2011 to allow interoperable transactions through micro-ATMs and through the bank mitras of any bank where customers were able to use their Aadhaar card. In 2013 NPCI launched the *99# service for simple mobile-banking transactions based on unstructured supplementary service data (e.g. transfers and payments). The APB System allowed customers to link their bank accounts to Aadhaar numbers thus making it easier to receive funds from various agencies without having to inform them about changes in bank account information. These services facilitated digital payments of government transfers and subsidies thus taking substantial steps toward accelerating digital payments. The next step then was to move payments beyond the banking system and unleash a new wave of financial innovations based on NPCI�s latest fintech solutions.DEMOCRATIZING PAYMENTS THROUGH the Unified Payments InterfaceTo move further into the digital financial payment space NPCI began introducing new innovations targeted at the digitally savvy urban-banked population who now had many choices of payment platforms. While the traditional banking platforms were now more interoperable and efficient this was not the case for the non-bank payment platforms that were popping up everywhere. With the advent of Paytm Google Pay PhonePe and other payment platforms some of which had been introduced by the banks themselves the need arose to make these bank and non-bank payment platforms interoperable. NPCI therefore had to move beyond its original purpose of providing interoperability infrastructure primarily for the banks. In addition to providing interoperability for banks and fintech players NPCI also created its own products. As Praveena Rai NPCI�s chief operating officer commented �Yes it is infrastructure but it goes beyond offering [only] the platform.�The digital innovation drive led to the development of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)�a first of its kind globally and NPCI�s source of pride. This was essentially a payment highway where any payment platform could connect and seamlessly execute inter- and intra-platform transactions. The end-users only needed to remember their UPI ID and they could use any payment platform of their choice. UPI allowed peer-to-merchant and peer-to-peer transactions such as payments at retail stores; transferring money to others; requesting a payment; or authorizing a payment. Kunal Kalawatia chief of marketing at NPCI claimed �One of the innovative things we�ve done with UPI is that I can not only send money but I can also send a request to you saying you owe me this much please pay up. And you can authorize it. So this helps the merchants. UPI is also replacing cash-on-delivery.�Perhaps the most significant impact of UPI was allowing the democratization of the payment systems of which there were several aspects. To begin with UPI was built on protocols that could interact with a variety of payment solutions. It could be used by not only traditional bank and credit card solutions but also the more recent payment platforms such as Paytm WhatsApp Pay and Google Pay among others including NPCI�s very own Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) payment app.Further the open-source technology that NPCI had chosen for UPI made the system more efficient. It also made the system more democratic by reducing the cost of innovation for small fintech players. As Khan explained �The moment you use open source and open stack by definition it allows many more people to participate with you.� Also UPI allowed individual users to pick and choose their payment service providers. For instance it was now possible for customers to keep their funds in one trusted bank while using specialized fintech services for greater convenience. Lastly the greater accessibility lowered the barriers to entry and led to more collaboration between the legacy institutions (such as banks) and fintech organizations. Khan added �Typically the legacy financial organizations see fintech as competitors and they don�t really collaborate. UPI actually allowed the fintechsthe giant fintechs and the start-upsto come together and co-create experiences under a clearly defined set of rules.�In the first three months after the launch of UPI in August 2016 transactions through UPI were approximately $11 million with 26 banks using the platform. In the second quarter of 2020 transactions through UPI reached $83 billion with 155 banks using the platform. NPCI also launched several other platforms that were compatible with UPI.NPCI launched the UPI Chalega (loosely translated as �UPI is accepted here�) campaign in early 2020 to increase widespread acceptance of UPI at merchant locations. In hindsight the campaign turned out to be highly prescientthe benefit of cashless digital transactions was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic which called for social distancing.With NPCI individual banks and other fintech players all creating innovative products the challenge was now to achieve greater acceptance for these innovations. To extend the products� reach NPCI put a substantial amount of time and effort into reaching every Indian. It offered its BHIM app in 17 languages and offered one for the visually impaired. Yet around a quarter of the adult population was not fully able to read or write. NPCI was actively working on the use of icons in its payment systems interface so that people lacking in literacy were able to interpret and make transaction choices thereby helping to increase financial literacy.The use of UPI and the products it supported grew tremendously allowing NPCI to revolutionize India�s payment systems. Asbe NPCI�s CEO pointed out that UPI also stimulated India�s economic growth. Sateesh Palagiri head of mobility solutions for NPCI remarked �UPI brought about a paradigm shift. It acted as a stepping stone for a lot of fintechs and emerged as the first choice for a lot of global giants to venture into retail payments. When I look at the daily volumes today I feel humbled at the enormity magnitude and scale.�KEEPING THE innovation CYCLE GOINGWhile its initial journey had been as a business-to-business firm NPCI became a business-to-business-to-consumer firm with a large range of innovative products and solutions. How had NPCI been able to innovate and launch solution after solution in such a short period of time? When it came to developing novel solutions both NPCI�s extreme customer focus and active stakeholder participation had been instrumental. Kalawatia said �There are 60 banks of various representations giving us inputs in the product development process . . . and the process involves reaching thousands of customers through the participating banks. This experience you cannot replicate in a research.�Anubhav Sharma head of international business for partnership business development and marketing at NPCI International Payments Limited a subsidiary of NPCI and former head of UPI and the IMPS at NPCI concurred. He added that such links to the member banks made all the difference:NPCI worked closely with member banks as stakeholders to align expectations features and functionalities. It is aligned to the democratic philosophy of NPCI that the users of the product and platform have their say in building and shaping it. This not only helped NPCI build UPI as a platform of citizen scale but also helped member banks remain in control of the innovation at the front-end driving consumer behavior and preferences.When it came to implementing those innovative solutions the unique organizational structure of NPCI offered important advantages. The primary customers of NPCI solutions were the banks who were also the owners. As pointed out by Nalin Bansal head of RuPay and the NFS �Typically the adoption [of new solutions] takes a lot of time . . . the fact that NPCI is owned by multiple banks made adoption easier.�To keep the innovation cycle going NPCI identified several important areas that would need careful handling. First NPCI needed to continuously upgrade and refresh its talent pool to keep up with new technologies. For instance capabilities such as blockchain could be valuable one day but the technology could take a different direction the next day requiring NPCI to update its human resources accordingly. Second NPCI would have to encourage a culture of risk-taking. Operating at the frontier of fintech with disruptive solutions launched frequently NPCI needed to look beyond the existing products and solutions and venture into the unknown. Thus the firm made a deliberate decision to inculcate a culture of risk-taking within acceptable limits. The third area was the acceptance of potential cannibalization due to innovation. With several highly successful products NPCI had to decide between being protective of these products or engaging in its own Schumpeterian creative destruction.In addition to the above NPCI also benefited from innovation and stimulated this in others. For instance it launched an accelerator program to encourage collaboration among solution developers in the broader community. This was essentially a web portal that allowed start-ups to connect with the application programming interfaces (API) of NPCI and other global API providers to develop solutions for the banking financial services and insurance industry.making india the GOLD STANDARD FOR digital paymentsWhile NPCI was busy creating new innovations the government moved ahead with its successful Digital India program. An influential committee set up by the RBI concluded that �India with its uniquely rich payment ecosystem is now emerging as a global leader in innovative population-scale payment systems.� NPCI had played an important role in this significant achievement for such a large emerging market as India.To cement India�s role as a global leader the committee advised the RBI to grow digital payments even further by fine tuning the system domestically and by linking it up globally. The committee also advised the RBI on how to mitigate the risks associated with digital payments. With the launch of UPI and RuPay NPCI managed an enormous amount of funds daily. Managing and operating these seamlessly without any glitch was NPCI�s primary security and risk-management concern. The RuPay card for instance was launched in 2012 when there were 375 million credit and debit cards in use in India. In 2019 that number reached 900 million with 600 million cards being RuPay alone. NPCI had to ensure the systems were always available without downtime interruptions disruptions or data loss.Another concern was the cost of digital payments and how to keep them as low as possible for consumers. The committee made various recommendations including stimulating interoperability and allowing more competition for UPI something that was also being discussed in the Indian media. It suggested leaving the so-called merchant discount ratea significant source of income for NPCIto market forces. While in some quarters NPCI was seen as a monopoly Rai clarified that �each product that we created competes with one or the other.� The RBI was trying to find the right balance between market forces common infrastructure and interoperability. The opening up of the market could have implications on the collaborative structure of NPCI enticing some of the member banks to break away from NPCI and create separate interoperability systems.Finally besides fine tuning domestic digital payments the committee strongly recommended NPCI to go global. This involved enhancing the BHIM UPI to allow for currency conversion and overseas remittances with connections to global payment systems. Moving beyond India was a new thrust for NPCI adding to its already busy set of priorities ahead. As Asbe said:Having created a strong infrastructure for digital payments in India NPCI is all geared-up to foray into international markets. With a successful pilot launch of RuPay and UPI in Singapore we wish to realize our ambition and redefine the payment system internationally. It is our vision to be the best payments network globally.Other countries were already paying attention. UPI had the potential to move beyond India and become a public good for the world supporting other countries in building real-time payment systems. In fact The Economist reported in 2020 that Google LLC had written to the US Federal Reserve asking it to endorse a similar model for America.WHAT NEXT: REMAINING FIT FOR PURPOSEAn extraordinary combination of tech innovation and national pride had led NPCI to become a large and successful organization. Looking back several factors could account for NPCI�s unprecedented growth beyond its own innovations. Asbe stressed the important role of the Indian government and the RBI in NPCI�s growth as well as the nurturing

Meakin was reviewing the financial statements for 2016 as compared with 2015 for Meakin Industrial Ag Corp. (Meakin Industrial) and Meakin Farms Inc. (Meakin Farms). While both organizations remained viable he wondered what he should do for 2017 and beyond given the unique structure of the businesses and the vast uncertainty of the agricultural industry. Should he remain at the 2016 farm size of 3200 seeded acres (1295 hectares) or go back up to approximately 4000 acres (1620 hectares) as he had farmed in 2015? What should he do with the trucking businessâexpand contract or maintain the current levels of business? Could he expand both operations or would he need to have a contraction in one to enable an expansion in the other? What were the risks and benefits of the changing business environment and how would they influence his decision? MEAKIN ENTERPRISES: COMPANY HISTORYAs a child Meakin had spent many days with his grandparents on the family farm near Langham Saskatchewan. Like many children when Meakin graduated from high school he was encouraged to attend university and develop a career away from the farm. He followed this advice and earned an engineering degree in 1998 and went to work for a farm implement manufacturer in Regina Saskatchewan some 300 kilometres away from the family farm.Although Meakin had a successful and fulfilling career as an engineer farming remained his passion. By 2004 when Meakin had chosen to return to Langham to embark on a career in farming the family farm had already been sold as land prices had been favourable and no successor had been identified. Meakin was left with the unenviable task of starting a farming operation from scratch. In 2005 Meakin started his farming operation Meakin Farms by purchasing one quarter section (160 acres or 65 hectares) of land from his grandmother and supplementing the owned acreage with rented land. Through the years Meakin gradually bought more land and rented additional land to increase the land base. The farm size peaked in 2015 at 3840 acres (1554 hectares). While growing the farm Meakin employed a true entrepreneurial approach and used his professional engineering skills to be of service to other farmers in equipment modifications servicing repairs and grain hauling. In this way he gained farming skills while creating income and cash flow to expand his own farming operation. This farm service income led to the creation of Meakin Industrial which grew into a trucking operation for the hauling of grain bins grain seed and fertilizer with annual revenues of more than CA$250000 by 2016. THE Agriculture IndustryThe Supply Chain: Sourcing InputsThe size and structure of the agriculture industry had seen significant change in recent decades: the total number of Saskatchewan farms had decreased from 63431 in 1986 to 36952 in 2011 and a further decrease was evident. The average farm size had grown substantially from 1036 acres (419 hectares) in 1986 to 1668 acres (675 hectares) in 2011 with many active farming operations managing 5000 acres (2023 hectares) or more. The thousands of Saskatchewan farmers typically purchased their crop inputs such as seed fertilizer and chemicals from numerous independent retailers across the province. Large multinational agrochemical and biotechnology companies such as Monsanto Bayer Inc. Syngenta Canada Inc. DuPont BASF SE and Dow AgroSciences LLC supplied many of these inputs to the retailers. Farmers were free to choose their retailer of choice and to seek a low-cost provider but price differences between retailers were negligible and many sought to create relationships with their local retailer in an effort not only to reduce transport distances but also more importantly to gain access to new products application methods and farming techniques. As with the farms themselves much of the production and retailing of agricultural inputs had been consolidated. For example many of the input retailers had other regionally affiliated stores and the large inland grain terminals that historically handled grain were increasingly adding input sales to their product and service mix. Furthermore fertilizer and fuel markets two crucial inputs had seen vast price variability in recent years given the changing microeconomic factors. As a result of this supply chain the farmer had become very much a price-taker with many of the crop inputs having volatile prices. The prices of the crop inputs supplied to the farmer varied due to not only the changing commodity prices of the inputs but also crop selection. Of the main inputs of seed fertilizer and chemicals the highest input cost was most often fertilizer. In crop selection the farmer faced difficult investment decisions; for example while canola traditionally realized a higher selling price than wheat the required seed fertilizer and chemicals costs were also greater for canola.From Field to PlateThe marketing of commodities was a vital skill not often associated with farming. Farmers aimed to be low-cost producers but also needed to maximize their profitability in commodity sales where prices were largely determined by global supply and demand. Many modern farmers were skilled in marketing commodities as crops such as canola peas and lentils had been traded in an open market system for decades. The marketing of wheat and barley however had recently changed with the dismantling of the Canadian Wheat Board marketing agency in 2012 which paved the way for a free market system that allowed farmers to capitalize on market opportunities but also exposed them to risks. Many farmers argued that the Canadian Wheat Boardâs monopolistic system had limited sales and subsequent price opportunities while others felt that the pooling system had offered the best returns for their commodities. Farmers often attempted to reduce production risks and âlock inâ prices by forward contracting a specified amount of crop at a minimum quality level and specified price. These contracts could be made using intermediary brokerage agents or directly with distribution processors and terminals. In practice forward contracting was a useful risk management tool but if discrepancies arose the agreements could be difficult for individual farmers to enforce with larger processors. Determining the grade of commodities was not an exact science particularly given the volume of product handled by both farmers and processors. Farmers were always seeking to produce and market the highest-grade commodities possible to capitalize on their price potential while processing and distribution intermediaries were trying to realistically assess the grades. Disagreements existed. Fluctuations in production both locally and internationally led to a wide variation in the price per bushel of crops produced (see Exhibit 1).As was the case with the production and marketing of all commodities differentiation of the final product was difficult. Farmers regularly sought means to make their products more appealing to processing intermediaries and final consumers alike. Some means of differentiation included attaining premium-grade quality crops or producing new crops and crop varieties that had characteristics desired by consumers. The organic movement which had resonated with end-consumers in recent years could yield price premiums for producers but much misinformation persisted and many farmers questioned the profitability and land use of organic production. Upon completion of harvest farmers delivered their commodities to several inland terminals and processors. Some farmer-owned co-operatives and independent intermediaries existed particularly in the processing of pulse crops such as peas and lentils but much of the processing capacity was also held by a few large multinational agriculture corporations such as Cargill Inc. and Viterra Inc. many of which also supplied the inputs and agronomy services used by farmers. The iconic image of the small-town prairie grain elevator had all but disappeared to make way for more modern and efficient grain terminals. These large terminals were strategically located in the province to reduce the rail infrastructure needed to move the commodities to shipping ports in Vancouver Churchill Thunder Bay and the St. Lawrence River. The consolidation of the inland terminals meant that more grain was transported from country farms to terminals via roadways with truck and trailer. The rail system was an oligopoly dominated by the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway and the scheduling of grain cars could be problematic resulting in the terminals becoming filled to capacity and forcing farmers to invest in grain storage while also straining their cash flow.The final market for commodities varied from year to year and new markets were emerging. While some of the canola was used locally in crushing plants to create canola oil and meal Canada exported approximately 90 per cent of the canola produced nationwide. Key canola markets included the United States Mexico and the European Union for biodiesel development and China and Japan for edible oil. Peas were generally used for human consumption in regions such as India Bangladesh and China. Wheat was Canadaâs most significant grain export to some major import markets in the Western Hemisphere (United States Mexico Colombia and Peru) Europe Asia (Indonesia China and Bangladesh) and Africa (Nigeria). Weather and PestsA number of exogenous variables influenced agriculture but perhaps none was more impactful than weather conditions. Producers needed to regularly contend with weather-related factors such as excessive rain or drought damaging winds hail and extremes in temperature (heat and frost). Farmers attempted to mitigate weather risks through insurance crop rotation production contracts and plant varieties but uncertainty persisted. Furthermore some scientists and interest groups were concerned that weather conditions were becoming unpredictable given the influence of global climate change. In addition to weather variables farmers needed to regularly monitor and control yield-robbing pest pressures in the form of weeds disease fungi and insects. Modern producers had long relied on herbicides and pesticides as effective means to control these pests. The use of herbicides had increased in recent years as farmers adopted a âzero-tillâ approach in an effort to capitalize on valuable soil moisture and nutrients that traditional tillage methods released into the atmosphere. Modern herbicides were much more effective in controlling pests and led to fewer health and safety concerns; still some interest groups were concerned about herbicidesâ long-term ecological impacts. The impact of weather and pests resulted in variations in production yields (see Exhibit 2).The Increasing Value of Farm LandOne of the greatest challenges affecting the viability of modern farms was the immense capital expenditure necessary to maintain an appropriate land base to contend with the ever-growing size of competing farms. Land prices had increased significantly in the past decade (see Exhibit 3). Although high land prices were a welcome sight for retiring farmers looking to sell their land the prices were prohibitive for those looking to start or expand. Land prices varied significantly from province to province and from region to region within each province. Numerous factors influenced land prices including farmersâ crop income and cash position the health of the land as a result of historical farming practices the landâs proneness to drought or flooding tree coverage oil or natural gas wells on the property proximity to urban centres foreign investment and competitive pressures from expanding farms. Farm Credit Canada noted that numerous profitable growing seasons and limited available land as a result of expanding farms and family succession had resulted in high demand for land. Purchase prices varied from as low as $1000 per acre ($405 per hectare) to well over $2500 per acre ($1012 per hectare) given some of the aforementioned influences. Lease rates were similarly volatile and varied with rates as low as $40 per acre ($16 per hectare) to upwards of $100 per acre ($40 per hectare) in certain regions. The âlease versus buyâ debate was a common discussion among farmers. Purchasing land enabled the upside potential of capital appreciation but required either an extensive cash investment or financing. Furthermore land prices had been rising for several years and some industry insiders wondered whether prices would begin to level out or even decline in the near future. Inclement weather or low commodity prices or both could further strain land prices at any time. Leasing land reduced some of the risks of land purchases but limited capital appreciation and determining lease rates could be challenging for both farmers and landlords. Securing leased land for periods of more than five years at a time was an uncommon practice and many farm operations had seen their leased acreage fluctuate from year to year making equipment investments difficult. When making land acquisitions the price was only one factor. Farmers also needed to assess the location and quality of the land the timing of expansion their financial situation the market situation and finally the businessâs short- and long-term goals. Skilled Labour in Short SupplyThe availability of skilled labour posed constraints for many farms. In past decades many farms were family-run operations where multiple generations would come together to bring in their own harvest and that of their neighbours. The dynamics were changing as children were often encouraged to pursue post-secondary education and many did not return to the farm. The average age of farmers in Saskatchewan had increased from 50.5 in 2001 to 54.2 in 2011. Families were getting smaller and farms were getting larger relying more on large-scale technology to replace the once historic abundance of labour. The jobs that remained were challenging to fill as they required a combination of skills that werenât always available: the agribusiness management necessary to execute a successful growing season and the technical skills of operating modern farm equipment. The seasonal nature of the business further exacerbated the problem and drove many prospective farm workers in rural areas into oil and gas jobs while farms close to the urban centres always contended with the draw of city opportunities. Even the grandparents and retired neighbours that were once relied on as seasonal help were less relevant as a labour pool given the complex nature of modern farm equipment. Operating a modern combine was more akin to flying an aircraft than driving a car. Many farm owners also maintained off-farm occupations to help alleviate the ever-present risk of a crop failure and cash flow concerns. The Crisis of Cash FlowA significant risk for a farming operation was managing cash flows. While most businesses had working capital requirements for inventory and receivables the working capital typically turned into cash inflows in a matter of a few months. In farming the lead times from the cash outflows such as crop inputs the interest and principal on the financing of land and machinery fuel wages and insurance preceded the cash inflows from crop sales by many months and sometimes by more than a year. As almost all of the farmâs cash outflows were expended before the crop was harvested and ultimately sold the economic effects of a crop failure were particularly acute. While other businesses could potentially avoid variable expenses if the revenue did not materialize farmers had already incurred all of their fixed and variable expenses before any revenue was realized. Thus any reduction in revenue due to crop failure or low commodity prices directly affected the operating earnings of the farm operation with little or no reduction of expenses. The Trucking Industry Bin HaulingThe demand for on-site grain bins had increased in the past decade as a result of the growing size of farm operations and the distance of the farms to grain terminals. Grain bins varied in length and diameter; the larger bins were up to 32 feet (9.8 metres) long and had a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). Bin delivery required the use of a pilot truck (the largest bins require two pilot trucks) to precede the truck that was hauling the bin to warn of the large load approaching on the highway. Bin hauling required specialized trailers that enabled the large round grain storage bins to be delivered to a farm fully assembled (see Exhibit 4). The trailers utilized a hydraulic lift system to transport the grain bins in a horizontal position. Once at their delivered destination the trailers were able to place the bins in a specific location in a vertical position. The hauling of bins required permits from the Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries obtaining permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck.The peak period for bin hauling occurred from August to October which coincided with the harvest period and the increased need for grain storage.Grain Seed and Fertilizer HaulingGrain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the grain terminals. As the distance of the farms to grain terminals increased larger trailers were utilized to haul grain. Grain and fertilizer could be delivered using a âSuper B Trainâ trailer that could haul a payload of up to 46.5 tons (42.2 tonnes or approximately 1700 bushels of wheat) depending on road conditions (see Exhibit 5). Fertilizer was particularly corrosive to trailers and could increase both depreciation and the costs associated with maintaining safety for insurance. Some trucking companies maintained special trailers to haul corrosive fertilizer or used smaller grain trailers to access farmyards and gravel roads when spring season weight restrictions were in effect.Chemical HaulingHauling chemicals and other goods required a flat-deck trailer which was the least complex and least expensive of the three trailers but was very useful in a variety of applications. The driver needed to attain hazardous goods training to haul chemicals. The Impact of WeatherWeather had a profound effect on the profitability of both the farming operation and the trucking operation. The excessive rain drought winds and hail that resulted in lower crop yields could also lower the demand for grain bins and grain hauling and could make deliveries challenging. Skilled Labour Still a ConcernTo drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries a driver needed a Class 1 licence which required oral or written knowledge tests for Class 1 vehicles and a road test in a Class 1 vehicle. A pre-trip inspection known as a circle check needed to be demonstrated at the time of the road test. Drivers possessing this licence were in high demand particularly during peak delivery seasons. Drivers typically sought to own and operate their own trucks and trailers often under the umbrella of a larger established trucking company. Maintaining loyal long-standing employees was often a challenge as competitors could entice drivers away by offering higher wages. Drivers could be paid hourly or by piece rate by the tonnage hauled while some farm employees received a salary and operated a truck and trailer as part of their farming duties. One of the challenges in the hauling business was employing drivers over a cyclical year where demand fluctuated from season to season and even from month to month. The scheduling of deliveries could also be complicated as trucking companies sought to link deliveries and make use of âback haulsâ to avoid empty miles on the road. Scheduling needs increased commensurately with deliveries. COMPANY OPERATIONSFarming OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Farms for the three-year period 2014â2016 is provided in Exhibit 6.Land: Lease or Buy?Meakin was in the unique and challenging position of trying to start a farm from scratch and the increasing prices were both a benefit and a curse. He was able to further leverage more financing as a result of the capital appreciation of his existing land but was limited in his ability to lease or buy more land given the high prices. The number of seeded acres farmed had fluctuated from 2014 to 2016 as Meakin Farms changed the proportion of land leased and owned (see Exhibit 7).The 2016 reduction in acreage was the result of Meakin not having renewed a lease on 800 acres (324 hectares) of land due to the high lease rate of $62 per acre ($25 per hectare). Meakin Farms had incurred rental rates ranging from $45 to $62 per acre ($18 to $25 per hectare) over the past three years. It was likely that additional farmland could be leased at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) in the near term. In 2017 the company purchased two additional quarters of previously rented land (320 acres or 130 hectares) which brought the total land owned up to 1200 acres (486 hectares).Crop ChoicesAs with most farms Meakin Farms produced a variety of cropsânamely canola wheat and field peas. The choice of one crop over another was not merely based on the highest price commodity. The farming practices for each commodity differed. For example canola which was often the highest priced commodity required more fertilizer than wheat. In addition the harvesting of canola was a two-step process of first knocking down the crop into swaths and then picking up the crop with a combine; thus requiring two passes in the field incurring the twice the costs in equipment fuel and labour as wheat and peas which when âstraight cutâ harvested required only one pass. Field peas were beneficial to soil health by fixing nitrogen and making it more available to crops planted in subsequent years. A healthy crop rotation of seeding different crops from year to year on the same land also helped to reduce the impact of diseases weeds and pests. During the past three years Meakin Farms had shifted away from wheat and towards canola (see Exhibit 8). Equipment UtilizationMeakin Farms used older farm equipment that was stretched to the limit in farming more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) in 2015 and was underutilized in 2016 as yields were down due to hail damage on 640 acres (259 hectares) of land. If the farm size were to return to more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) it would likely need a further investment of $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment. Human Resources: Daved Meakin as a Key to Success The availability of farm labour could be problematic. The need for the farm labour was seasonal yet the responsibilities of the labour when operating complex equipment were great. Like most farm operations Meakin relied on both seasonal farm labour and family. For example Meakinâs spouse Nicole a chartered professional accountant who had an off-farm career often pitched in to operate the combines during the peak harvest season. In addition Meakinâs management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. Unfortunately the busy bin-hauling component of the trucking operation often coincided with the harvest season of the farm. Meakin was clearly pivotal to the success of the business because of his time relationships and expertise which drove the organization. Farming was also one of Saskatchewanâs most hazardous industries with an average of 13 people killed each year and many others injured. In the unfortunate event of his injury or death the company operations would most certainly fail. As with many busy managers and entrepreneurs Meakin also wanted balance his obligations of work and life with his personal interests and family being key priorities. Financing with Long-Term DebtFarmland and equipment were financed with long-term debt. As a farming operation that did not benefit from a land-base inheritance Meakin Farms was highly leveraged with 75 per cent of the land and equipment financed. In addition the costs of crop inputs for seed fertilizer and chemicals which ranged between $110 and $130 per acre ($45 and $53 per hectare) needed to be financed until the resulting crop was harvested and sold. The costs of fuel wages insurance and repairs ranging from $25â$35 per acre ($10â$14 per hectare) along with the long-term debt servicing also required cash outflow before the crop was sold. This situation resulted in high levels of operating lines of credit and bank indebtedness.The Trucking OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Industrial for the three-year period 2014â2016 is provided in Exhibit 9.Types of Hauling Bin Hauling: The trucking operation Meakin Industrial began in 2013. The genesis of this business was to primarily service the delivery needs of two large industrial bin manufacturers for Central Saskatchewan. The bin manufacturers typically outsourced the delivery of grain bins to private operators such as Meakin Industrial. The grain bins varied in length and diameter with Meakin Industrialâs current equipment able to transport bins up to 32 feet (10 metres) long and with a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). In 2014 Meakin Industrial had contracts with two large bin manufacturers which resulted in revenues of more than $150000. In 2015 Meakin Industrial lost one of the contracts with a major bin manufacturer to a competitor that undercut the delivery charges. The bin hauling remained strong in 2015 albeit only for one of two bin manufacturers due to a need for on-farm grain storage because of a backlog of rail car grain deliveries. In 2016 the demand for bin hauling declined due to some hail damage in the area during the 2016 growing season.Grain Hauling: Grain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the inland processing terminals. Meakin Industrial provided this service to 10â15 farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. When one of the contracts for grain bins was not renewed in 2015 Meakin set out to expand the grain-hauling portion of the business. Meakin Farms was also able to reduce its own grain delivery costs by utilizing the services and equipment of Meakin Industrial.Seed Fertilizer and Chemical Hauling: During the spring seeding season Meakin Industrial was busy hauling seed fertilizer and chemicals to farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. A unique flatbed trailer was needed to haul chemicals and the driver needed to have attained hazardous goods training.Human Resources: Time in Short SupplyAs a result of the seasonality of the hauling business Meakin Industrial faced similar challenges to the farming operation in terms of the availability of skilled employees. As noted earlier to drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries required a Class 1 licence. In addition drivers who hauled chemicals required hazardous goods training. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck for bin hauling.Meakinâs management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. The hauling of bins required permits from the provincial Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries securing permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Financing with More DebtThe cost of financing equipment for the trucking operation was relatively high with interest rates usually at 8 per cent. All of the trucks were owned and financed with bank debt while most of the trailers were leased on five-year terms.Word-of-Mouth MarketingMarketing for Meakin Industrial was mainly done through word of mouth. The contracts with bin manufacturers were secured through direct marketing by personal contact from Meakin. All trucks were marked as âMeakin Industrial Agâ to facilitate name recognition when the trucks were delivering products on the highways. THE FUTUREIn January 2017 Meakin Farms purchased an additional 320 acres (130 hectares) of farm land that it had previously rented for $260000; 75 per cent of the cost was financed at a mortgage rate of 4 per cent. As Meakin contemplated his future plans he received a letter notifying him of the opportunity to lease an additional 960 acres (389 hectares) of government-owned farmland at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) which coincided with the rate he was currently paying for other rented land. Just as he began to prepare projections for an expanded farm size he received a text message from the large industrial bin manufacturer that had previously opted for another contractor in 2015. It was dissatisfied with the service from Meakinâs competitor and wanted him to handle the contract moving forward and offered a 5 per cent price increase for his services. Meakinâs excitement for the new opportunities was short-lived when he recalled that in 2016 he had been overloaded with management responsibilities. The demands on his time and the need for hired labour which was difficult to find were at a maximum. In addition the farmâs poor financial results in 2016 as a result of hail damage and the additional financing of the 2017 land purchase would leave little financing capacity to expand his farming and trucking equipment.Meakin quickly realized that the constraints of management time labour and financing would result in some difficult choices. He could choose one of following three options for 2017:Option 1: Maintain the current levels of business. Keep the farm size at 3200 acres (1295 hectares) (substituting the 320 additional owned acres [130 hectares] for rented acres) and keep the trucking business the same size thereby forgoing both the land lease and the bin-hauling opportunities.Option 2: Expand the farm to 4160 acres (1684 hectares) and reduce the trucking business. Meakin did not have the management time and needed labour resources to both increase the farm size and maintain the trucking operation. Given the similarity in peak seasons the bin hauling would need to be eliminated if Meakin were to expand the farm. He would need to invest $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment to expand the farm size of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing bin-hauling trailers for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needed for the farm expansion.Option 3: Reduce the farm to 2240 acres (907 hectares) and expand the trucking business. Due to the constraints of management time and labour resources Meakin could not both increase the trucking operation and maintain the farm size. He would need to invest $100000 in bin-hauling trailers and pilot trucks to service the new bin-hauling contract of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing seeding and harvesting equipment for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needs for the trucking expansion.EXHIBIT 1: CANOLA WHEAT AND FIELD PEAS CROP PRICES 2014â2016 (in Canadian DOLLARS PER BUSHEL)Note: 1 bushel = 35 litres; 1 tonne of canola = 44.092 bushels 1 tonne of wheat = 36.744 bushels and 1 tonne of peas = 36.744 bushelsSource: Created by the authors using Government of Saskatchewan âSaskatchewan Cash Pricesâ accessed September 20 2016 www.agr.gov.sk.ca/apps/markettrends/.

Samsui Central Kitchen (SCK) Samsui’s flagship corporate social responsibility (CSR) project provided 1.8 million meals annually to various long-term care facilities for the elderly and was especially crucial because the existing SCK facility was reaching maximum capacity and stakeholder buy-in would be needed to expand it. Ang strongly believed in Samsui’s ambition to embed CSR in its core company strategy. Having achieved his initial objectives for the central kitchen he set his sights on expansion to impact more beneficiaries in the company’s home base of Singapore. He wondered how to quantify the impact of SCK’s CSR initiatives in a clear and simple message in order to communicate the impact to various stakeholders and justify the further expansion of SCK. Samsui’s BACKGROUNDIn 2013 Samsui was set up by Soup Restaurant Group Limited (Soup Restaurant) to spearhead Soup Kitchen’s CSR efforts as part of its “drive to do good.” Soup Restaurant had started in 1991 as a restaurant operating out of a single shop-house in Singapore’s Chinatown with only six employees and six dining tables. The restaurant sold various herbal soups and home-cooked Chinese dishes at an affordable price-point to mass-market consumers. Soup Restaurant had since expanded to 17 restaurants across Singapore and Malaysia with a franchise in Indonesia. The company had been listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange since 2007 and operated an entire portfolio of brands and verticals in the food and beverage (F&B) sector. The products ranged from prepared condiments and sauces to frozen supermarket food (see Exhibit 1).A major reason for Soup Restaurant’s decision to set up Samsui was to enable better tracking of key process indicators and the resources needed for these activities with the goal of doing sustainable good. In 2016 Soup Restaurant received the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Award for Small and Medium Enterprises. The following year the company was recognized as a Champion of Good by the NVPC.Ang and the rest of Samsui’s management team decided that the company’s philanthropic efforts should not be restricted to one-off projects and events preferring sustainable and long-term initiatives. Given Samsui’s extensive experience in the F&B industry as well as the experience of its parent company Samsui decided to leverage its knowledge of the food value chain to help charitable organizations. Traditionally charitable organizations could not leverage economies of scale to negotiate lower prices for ingredients and they often lacked distribution networks for logistics. But Samsui had strong bargaining power in its relationships with suppliers due to the collective clout of Soup Restaurant when purchasing ingredients. Samsui also had distribution networks in place that it could leverage for the transportation and logistics of ingredients and cooked meals. This competency-based approach ensured that Samsui focused on its core expertise of food manufacturing which culminated in launching the “Makan Project” in 2013. Makan was a program that delivered better quality food to 20000 underprivileged recipients in homes and care centres. The initial 30000 meals were prepared in the existing central kitchen of Samsui’s parent company during downtime periods when excess production capacity could be utilized. As the program’s popularity increased Samsui explored ways of expanding this CSR initiative by increasing the number of meals provided to beneficiaries. Consequently Samsui decided that setting up a new central kitchen was necessary with the existing kitchens already running at full capacity. Samsui’s decision to pursue strategic CSR was exemplary. Industry experts had criticized the philanthropic CSR approach on the basis that CSR should encompass more than just philanthropy volunteerism and eco-friendliness. This view was echoed by research from McKinsey & Company which argued that companies typically took a too inward-looking perspective of CSR efforts and viewed CSR as a distinct program in a company’s operations. In contrast Samsui relied on its core competencies instead of reinventing the wheel to bring about social benefits in an innovative way that allowed it to create a sustainable initiative in the form of SCK. It could thus be argued that Samsui’s approach was ahead of its time in respect to its Singaporean peers.However there was a clear need for a framework in the decision-making process for CSR. When Samsui was just starting out new CSR projects could be quickly ideated materialized and tested to determine whether they met the expected objectives and were sustainable. However the absence of a formal and rigorous framework that considered the implications and viability of an initiative conflicted with Samsui’s ambition of embedding CSR into its core company strategy. Given that Samsui had limited resources as a relatively small enterprise it was prudent to avoid initiatives that were merely well-meaning but not profitable. Otherwise Samsui would risk creating an assortment of uncoordinated and unfocused CSR activities that would become unsustainable. Therefore it was imperative for Samsui to create effective key performance indicators to benchmark its performance and the achievements of the company. This was especially important because Samsui was engaged in CSR projects that were no longer small in terms of time operational scope and capital commitments despite Samsui’s limited resources. The most recent addition of a flagship SCK had cost the company $1 million in capital. Ang shared Samsui’s preference for working with like-minded program partners such as Standard Chartered Bank. In addition to collaborating with Samsui to build SCK Standard Chartered Bank had its own program—the Silver Lining—aimed at improving quality of life for the elderly. The program launched in 2012 involved the bank’s employees engaging with seniors through various community initiatives. BETTER FOOD NEEDED AT Long-Term Care FacilitiESThrough market research Ang found that the food served in Singapore’s long-term care facilities for the elderly had been the subject of criticism by industry experts. The two main criticisms were the lack of nutrition and the lack of variety. Many care facilities ran their own kitchens with mixed results. The issue of lack of nutrition had been well-documented with the most common nutritional problems for residents in long-term care facilities being weight loss and associated protein-energy malnutrition. The prevalence of these two factors among the elderly in these facilities in Singapore ranged between 23 and 85 per cent. The lack of variety in the food served in these facilities had been attributed to outdated kitchen equipment and time constraints resulting in limited menus with the same cooking methods and ingredients used repeatedly. In a 2016 study it was found that a quarter of long-term care facility residents did not enjoy the food provided while a third complained that they were unable to find their favourite food among the offerings.Both the lack of quality and lack of nutrition were issues that necessitated intervention. These factors could lead to adverse effects on the health and quality of life of long-term care facility residents. Malnutrition had been found to compromise their quality of life leading to chronic disability functional decline increased health care costs and possibly even death. A lack of food choice could result in inadequate food intake leading to weight loss and a suboptimal body mass index suggestive of malnutrition. As such it was imperative to find a major company prepared to tackle the root of the problem by providing nutritious food to improve quality of life for the residents. Globally autonomy of choice had been reported as one of the main reasons for improved food intake in long-term care facilities which could also indirectly tackle the malnutrition issue. The level of satisfaction with food service had increased up to 30 per cent after long-term care facility residents were offered the power to choose from a menu. Therefore providing a range of food choices was considered the key to providing adequate nutrition in the form of a balance of carbohydrates proteins and vegetables. Ang felt that given Samsui’s unique position in the F&B industry it was well placed to tackle the issue by providing a variety of food to improve the quality of life for the elderly.MARKET SIZeBased on the NVPC training program Ang realized that the first step was to estimate the number of meals for long-term care facilities. The first of two key figures to be used in estimating the number of meals was Samsui’s targeted market share of 30 per cent in Singapore by 2031. Based on Ang’s calculations Samsui’s current market share was closer to 17 per cent. This estimate was based on a linear projection over time and the first-mover advantage SCK’s project had in serving the relatively closed market of the long-term care facility meals industry. The second key figure was the total number of beds in institutional care centres which was projected by the Singapore Ministry of Health to be 17000 by 2020. The figure represented growth of 85 per cent from 2010. Ang assumed that the number of beds would increase in a linear trend during the forecasted period as opposed to the exponential growth seen from 2010 to 2020.Ang also projected that the supply of beds in long-term care facilities would increase to meet demand which was driven in part by the lack of quality home care options. Approximately 2 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and over stayed in long-term care facilities compared to an average of 6–8 per cent in Northern Europe and Australia. SAMSUI CENTRAL KITCHEN’s PROJECT Samsui’s flagship CSR project was the SCK project. It was intended to provide employment skills training to individuals in need. The SCK project was launched in October 2017 by Samsui and the Standard Chartered Bank of Singapore with the support of Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) a government organization that provided the matching service between the trainees and Samsui. The project had been touted as the first social service system in Singapore. It was a collaboration between the public sector private sector and social enterprises leveraging their respective strengths and resources to deliver sustainable long-term impact on the community. The current facility was staffed by 30 trainees and produced 1.8 million meals annually. The trainees would prepare meals to be served to beneficiaries at various non-profit organizations. Samsui’s menus were approved by dieticians and nutritionists before being rolled out. Through this project Samsui aimed to provide a greater variety of nutritious food options to increase the overall satisfaction of care health and quality of life for residents.  One immediate impact of the launch was SCK’s increased capacity with an almost 500 per cent increase from the 365000 meals previously delivered by Samsui. The impact on food quality was also palpable according to the recipients of the meals. James Tan chief executive of Touch Community Services (one of the beneficiaries of the kitchen) said that the food was delicious and that it helped to get good quality food at good prices. Trainees who worked in the kitchen were also offered jobs with Samsui upon completion of their training. Even if these trainees chose not to work with Samsui they would have picked up some useful skills for employment opportunities elsewhere. Ang also noted another less apparent impact of the SCK project: by outsourcing food operations the long-term care facilities could free up workers and related resources for other activities. This enabled the facilities to focus on their core strength of providing quality care.SAMSUI’S PLAN FOR EXPANSIONIn 2018 the capacity of SCK was 1.8 million meals per year. This could meet the needs of approximately 2465 long-term care facility residents annually which was a fraction of the 17000-capacity requirement set by the Singapore Ministry of Health for 2020. Ang saw an opportunity for Samsui to make use of its comparative advantage to meet the needs of even more long-term care facilities and residents. Samsui would be able to negotiate better prices for food ingredients and make use of its inherent knowledge in food production to provide a greater social good.A key challenge faced by long-term care facilities was providing nutritious and varied meals at a cost-effective price point. Options included setting up a kitchen within the long-term care facility and engaging third-party food caterers. Ang noted that setting up a kitchen was expensive. Using third-party food caterers was also not ideal because caterers had little experience and ability to address the dietary requirements of the residents often resulting in bland and unvaried meal plans. In contrast SCK aimed to provide sufficiently nutritious and varied meals without being prohibitively expensive.Ang felt that with Samsui’s team of professional chefs and the ability to purchase bulk ingredients from wholesalers SCK could provide an extensive balanced menu to long-term care facilities with high-quality ingredients and at a lower cost than other available catering options. The meals offered included local favourites tweaked to match the dietary requirements of the residents. For example Samsui chefs developed a low cholesterol version of laksa by using anchovies and fresh milk.SAMSUI’S NEED FOR a DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKGiven that the existing SCK facility was reaching its maximum capacity Ang knew that investment from the parent company “Soup Restaurant Group” would be needed for expansion. The first SCK was built at a cost of $1 million. Because Soup Restaurant was a publicly listed for-profit organization it had to be accountable to stakeholders and shareholders. Ang needed to ensure that the group’s commitment to doing good was sustainable. Samsui had joined NVPC’s Company of Good program in 2016 as a founding member. This program aimed to empower businesses in Singapore to contribute in strategic sustainable and impactful ways. NVPC advocated the “Four I’s” framework—investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 2). Ang reflected on how Samsui’s focus on doing good had been incorporated throughout the company’s business processes. During the recruitment process for new employees personal qualities such as integrity and willingness to do good for the community were highly sought. Samsui selected its employees for CSR initiatives based on the employees’ strengths and interests. The employees were also rotated among the various CSR activities to increase their exposure to varied experiences. Ang was thus able to build a culture of strong employee participation and volunteerism. Lee Chee Hua a chef participating in a CSR program to cook meals for the beneficiaries shared his thoughts: “When I participated in the programme I realized that ageing is a path that most people have to go through. Seeing the joy on the faces of the people we serve brings much satisfaction to me.”The learning experience from partnering with NVPC also prompted Ang to consider whether Samsui should use the Four I’s framework to benchmark its performance and achievements. Ang felt that the impact of the model could be further enhanced. Knowing that Samsui as a small-to-medium enterprise had limited resources it was important to avoid initiatives that were well-meaning but not profitable. Therefore Ang needed to conduct a more in-depth analysis. He needed to find options for evaluating the SCK project’s impact in a more formal and rigorous manner. Measuring impact quantitatively was important to ensure buy-in from key stakeholders including Samsui’s employees management and shareholders.SOCIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENTBy reviewing existing literature on the topic Ang identified two key tools that could be used effectively to evaluate the SCK project: the balanced scorecard and social return on investment (SROI). The balanced scorecard could clearly highlight the program’s objectives and the steps Samsui needed to take to meet those goals. However the balanced scorecard could only provide a subjective form of measurement. It was unable to quantify figures such as social outcomes and impacts. In contrast the SROI was an adaptation of the return on investment formula used by traditional investors to assess a company’s success. The SROI framework could measure and report a broad concept of value that extended beyond financial terms and enabled an organization and its stakeholders to see a more complete picture of the benefits from their investment of time money and other resources. Mathematically the basic formula could be expressed as follows: SROI = Present Value of Benefits ÷ Present Value of Total Investment. Ang knew that he needed some concrete numbers to gain stakeholder support for the expansion of SCK to reach more beneficiaries. The SROI formula could help provide those figures. However to estimate the SCK project’s impact using the SROI framework Ang needed to first complete four key steps.Step 1: Theory of ChangeThe first step was to identify the underlying theory of change (ToC) which was an overview of the relationship between interventions and expected effects or outcomes. That overview would map the chains of causes and effects. The ToC would highlight the transition from the current state to the final state via the intervention method (see Exhibit 3). At the current state food offerings at long-term care facilities lacked nutritional value and variety which led to a lower quality of life (QoL) for the residents. The World Health Organization defined QoL as “the individuals’ perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns.” There were several domains operating under the QoL umbrella. In respect to the SCK project the focus was on the domains of physical health and psychological health. The intervention method was providing meals with greater nutritional value and greater variety. Greater nutritional value would tackle the physical health domain whereas greater variety of food would increase food choices and address the psychological health domain. Step 2: Impact MappingImpact mapping was achieved using a logic model. The model examined various resources (i.e. inputs) used to conduct activities. The activities were measured in outputs which consisted of direct quantitative and qualitative summary measures obtained from the activities. Ultimately the outputs led to outcomes or social externalities that occurred within one to three years. The outputs also led to long-term benefits for stakeholders which were attained within 7 to 10 years. The impact map was fundamental to an SROI analysis. Using the developed ToC as the underlying concept the impact map ascertained the social impact of an intervention. Ang developed the impact mapping for the SCK project based on his own reading (see Exhibit 4).Step 3: Data CollectionThe data collection process comprised three progressive steps: (1) selecting indicators (2) identifying financial proxies (valuation and monetization) and (3) collecting data. In selecting indicators the developed ToC relied on secondary research to build the case for the need for intervention. To measure whether the outcomes set out had been achieved indicators could be selected to ascertain whether a change had occurred. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators could be used to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. The indicators chosen should be S.M.A.R.T.—specific measurable attainable relevant and time-bound.Indicators had to be chosen to measure the changes brought about by Samsui’s intervention. Many found the process of translating outcomes from social welfare interventions into measurable results challenging. Consequently both quantitative and qualitative indicators were used in tandem to illustrate several aspects of Samsui’s SCK intervention. This served to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. A quantitative indicator of saving for example would be the resource saved by outsourcing meals to Samsui. The quantitative indicator of these opportunity costs which were incurred by preparing meals in-house was used together with surveys of long-term care facility operators and service staff. One key consideration for Samsui was whether the indicators could be reasonably measured. Having chosen suitable indicators monetary values were attached to the outcomes to estimate the social value to different stakeholders. To do so financial proxies had to be chosen. Financial proxies helped to reach the desired indicator and estimate the social value of non-traded goods to different stakeholders. The financial proxies chosen had to be close to the desired indicators. For example a monetary value was calculated for a long-term care facility freeing up resources by outsourcing to Samsui on a per meal basis. This calculation was based on the difference between the existing industry average food price versus Samsui’s food price (see Exhibit 5). Data for each of the indicators chosen had to be collected based on research and existing sources (i.e. internal stakeholders and external sources). This step was done using reasonable efforts to evaluate the change that resulted. Two key variables were identified that could significantly alter the calculation of SROI: (1) the number of meals sold to long-term care facilities and (2) the difference in Samsui’s food price versus industry average. Other model assumptions were also used for the SROI analysis (see Exhibit 6). The calculation also involved estimating the SCK project’s deadweight; that is how much of the outcome could be achieved without intervention? No deadweight was assumed for the outcome of “residents having a greater variety of nutritious meals.” This change was unlikely to happen without Samsui because no other meal provider was offering a similar standard of nutrition or variety in 2018.Step 4: SROI Modelling In the final step the social benefits were summed up and discounted. The value of outcomes were discounted to the same period as when the investment costs were incurred. Subsequently the ratio of the summed benefits to the present value of the investment was calculated. Because SROI was a ratio it was meaningless on its own. It had to be compared against a benchmark such as competing companies within a given industry or Samsui’s own past performance. Alternatively both comparisons could be done. To compare the SROI against other Samsui performance would require another study. MOVING FORWARDBefore Ang could explain to the board members his plan to scale up the SCK project to double the current capacity he needed more evidence to demonstrate the current project’s achieved impact. He approached SG Enable an agency in Singapore dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities for a possible partnership pertaining to the possible location for the second SCK project and additional workforce that was inclusive of persons with disabilities. Ang was eager to continue doing good. The time of his meeting with the board members was fast approaching and he needed numbers for his presentation.EXHIBIT 1: KEY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS OF SOUP RESTAURANT GROUP*Note: *Soup Restaurant Group Limited owns Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd.

Ltd. (Chatar Patar) was a quick service eatery that was opened in 2012 with the vision of expanding to multiple outlets. Prashant Kulkarni managing director of the company and his team had planned to expand their business by 2018 once the brand was popular and the company had established a name in the market. As with every new venture the team was ready to put in hard work and establish a good reputation. The team had expansion plans and at the top of the list was the option of entering into a franchise model of business. In 2016 it had been more than a year since the franchise offers started coming in and the team had not yet decided what to do next. The team members did their research and consulted people in the same field to learn more with the hope of developing a lucrative solution to the problem. Kulkarni wondered whether he and the team were taking on their expansion plans too early before they were prepared or had a sufficient plan. Should they wait? If they proceeded which method of expansion should they adopt?The EntrepreneurIt was the summer of 1995 when Kulkarni ran to his father with ₹230 in his hand. His father was surprised to see his son with so much money and asked Kulkarni in a firm tone who had given him the money. Kulkarni replied in an innocent and excited voice that he had sold a total of 20 handmade boats. Kulkarni’s father was taken aback and enquired further asking how Kulkarni got the material to make these boats. The boy shared that he had used all the waste material that was kept in the garage. Kulkarni beamed with excitement and happiness pleased that he had sold all of his boats. Like his father Kulkarni was an entrepreneur and that day marked the beginning of Kulkarni’s entrepreneurial journey.Over the years Kulkarni had many ideas. Some worked but others no matter how good they looked on paper were difficult to implement. Two of Kulkarni’s successful ventures were a CD (compact disc) shop followed by a business in tire tubes. But ventures were short-lived and even though Kulkarni’s father saw potential in the boy he asked him to pursue a college program. Kulkarni completed an honours bachelor degree in commerce and was immediately placed with an information technology (IT) firm in Jaipur India after graduation.Kulkarni loved food and his new job gave him the opportunity to try out new dishes every week. One week he had a craving for panipuri so Kulkarni set out to find a street vendor selling the snack. He returned home having enjoyed his dinner only to feel ill. He went to bed nauseated and woke at 2:00 a.m. with sudden abdominal pain. By morning the pain was worse so Kulkarni went to the hospital where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. When he disclosed his diet of the previous few days the doctor immediately identified the panipuri as the culprit. The doctor shared that they had at least two patients every week sick after consuming street food and in almost 90 per cent of the cases panipuri was the cause.After spending a week in the hospital Kulkarni was discharged home with instructions to take certain precautions with what he ate. He resolved that he would refrain from panipuri indefinitely.Kulkarni completed his tenure with the IT company and decided to continue his education and pursue a master’s degree in business administration in his hometown. Indore was known for its delicacies of Indian street food but Kulkarni’s brush with food poisoning had stayed with him. He did however meet with his friends one day and joined them as they went to a street vendor for their favourite panipuri. It was then that Kulkarni noticed for the first time that the vendors prepared his favourite dish with a total lack of hygiene a factor Kulkarni had never considered before when eating his favourite street food. He also noticed that the quality of the ingredients was poor and that the vendors offered a limited choice of flavours. Kulkarni realized that whatever happened to him could happen to anyone. He wondered how many people would refrain from eating the food or stop their family members from enjoying this delicious dish because of its preparation or serving methods or because preparation was not hygienic or healthy.The CompanyKulkarni researched the idea of providing people with healthy panipuri that was an amalgamation of hygiene health and taste. He always believed in the power of ideas although this idea was fuelled by memories of a week in hospital with several painful injections and bitter medicines. He needed to get a brand into the unorganized world of Indian street food. Kulkarni worked on his idea with his younger sister Pallavi and his colleague Arti pushing the idea further every day. After in-depth study over 18 months the trio learned that although panipuri was a favourite food across the entire Indian subcontinent—India Pakistan Sri Lanka Nepal and Bangladesh—it was often frowned upon because of the vendors’ lack of hygiene. Although panipuri was popular and offered health benefits because of the variety of herbs and spices used many people did not consider panipuri to be a healthy eating option. The same was true with a variety of other savoury snacks served by roadside vendors. The trio decided to start their own venture opening an outlet that served the most liked and popular Indian street food. Their plan was to establish a name in this particular segment of the food industry. They did not want to be just another outlet on a long list of random outlets regularly launched to serve panipuri; they wanted their outlet to be different. And so they launched Chatar Patar an eatery store in the quick service restaurant sector that served standardized Indian street food that could be customized with an extensive scope of products all of it hygienically prepared and served. The vision was to deliver Indian street food that was healthy hygienic and tasted good. The IndustryThe Indian quick service restaurants sector a portion of the restaurant industry was estimated to have a market value of ₹68 billion in 2014. The market was expected to grow to ₹150 billion by 2020 providing lucrative opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs to be a part of this growth story. Another report highlighted that changing consumer behaviour and demographics were expected to drive the Indian quick service restaurants to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 for a market value of US$27.57 billion. Approximately 10 per cent of the fast-food market in India was organized. Novonous’s market research estimated that the organized fast-food market in India would grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by 2020. Vegetarian fast food constituted approximately 45 per cent of the fast-food market in India and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 18 per cent by 2020.Casual dining restaurants (CDRs) in the organized fast-food sector in India were projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent by fiscal year (FY) 2019/20. Non-casual dining restaurants (NCDRs) or fast casual dining restaurants had gained a tremendous market share over the previous 10–15 years. That sector was also projected to grow at a CAGR of 27 per cent over the next five years. The quick service restaurants market in the organized fast-food sector in India was projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 per cent by FY 2019/20.The Growth PhaseKulkarni brought his signature product panipuri to the customers of Chatar Patar “the house of India’s first branded golgappas (panipuri) Gapagap.” Kulkari and his team were pioneers in introducing the world’s first panipuri brand Gapagap.Kulkari and his team started their venture with an initial capital of just ₹40000. They opened their first outlet the parent store in Indore Kulkarni’s hometown initially offering 18 products on the menu. They leased space next to the university hoping the location next to their primary target market—youth—would give them visibility. They decided that it would be the founding team that handled the operations from procurement of the raw material to preparing and serving the snacks. The store made a profit after the first month so the team expanded. They hired two employees who were trained to prepare the snacks and attend to customers.The venture was an immediate success. Word-of-mouth publicity and the networking skills of the founding team led to increasing sales despite their inexperience. Customers were drawn in and made regular visits. The store was making profits much above the initial expectation of the team. Yet that was not enough for Kulkari. Even though the team had delivered on two of their promises—providing hygienic and healthy street food—they had yet to deliver on the third promise taste. The team took on the challenge and decided to expand the flavours offered. As they did not want to be just any other store in this line of business they chose to establish a niche with their flavours. Starting with seven flavours they developed a total of 60 flavours within two months and then over time expanded to 112 flavours of pani the main ingredient in Gapagap.The team members were proud to be pioneers adding various flavours to an age-old Indian street food. Really they had revolutionized the food. Word of mouth was strong which increased their footfalls and proved to be helpful in taking the next step. Strategic ShiftKulkari and his team were overwhelmed by the customer response but Kulkari still questioned what was next and how they would get there. The answer came when Singh a regular and loyal customer visited Chatar Patar on a day when the team was a little less occupied. Singh was an experienced businessman and liked the team’s concept of multi-flavoured hygienic and healthy food. He congratulated them on their success and asked whether they had considered expanding. Kulkari shared that this was exactly what was bothering him wondering what was next. Singh proposed a franchise business model but Kulkarni wondered whether it was too soon. The team had researched websites dedicated to promoting the franchise business model and they could develop and use their own website to advertise available franchises. They had a brand but the brand was not yet big enough that people would want to invest. And Chatar Patar charged prices that were a bit higher than what street vendors charged. But Singh maintained that franchising was the path and offered to be Chatar Patar’s first franchisee opening an outlet in Rajkot. Kulkarni and his team were surprised by Singh’s offer and requested time to consider it. In the meantime Kulkarni hired a friend to create a company website. Within three days the website was ready and working. With the website live the team began to promote their restaurant on social media platforms sharing their success story and directing people to their franchise business model which was available on the company website.As word spread more franchise offers came in. The team had already prepared a rough draft of a franchise business model offer but had yet to refine it. They did not anticipate such a quick response but they did not want to lose the opportunity. Before discussing business with Singh or looking at the other offers Kulkari and the team did more research and refined their franchise business model.Under their franchise business format Chatar Patar offered the following:The rights to use the Chatar Patar brand trademarks signs and logos to operate a storeThe ability to prepare and sell Chatar Patar’s standardized products by sharing the recipes and transporting the ingredients required for the preparationUse of the strategic business model and systems developed by Chatar PatarSupport with local promotion using well-thought-out campaigns and creative inputsUse of the support training and research used by Chatar Patar’s headquartersFranchisees could choose one of two types of ownerships:A single unit franchise orAn area franchise with the opportunity to develop multiple units within the franchise referred to as a master franchise (see Exhibit 1).CompetitionThe ethnic fast-food market in India was expected to experience considerable growth with a projected CAGR of 31.95 per cent by FY 2019/20. Millions of people were consuming ethnic fast food daily. To leverage this market and customer segment many players had entered the market as organized outlets between 2013 and 2015. The United Nations reported that India had 356 million people between the ages of 10 and 24—the largest youth population in the world. India’s economy was growing and more young people were entering the workforce giving them money to spend. There were also more women in the workforce bringing a need for different tastes and products. Also consumers were more mobile; they needed food on the go so the need for access to quick service restaurants increased. As a result the consumers in the Indian fast-food market were hungry for more availability of quick service restaurants with a diverse menu which paved the way for entry of international brands such as McDonald’s KFC Subway Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts which competed with local Indian fast-food restaurants. Technology and social media gave quick service restaurants the ability to make menus available online and gave customers the opportunity to post their reviews of the restaurants. Customers could also take advantage of online ordering and home delivery of items methods leveraged by many players. Slowly but steadily the competitors were focusing on three areas: quality food ingredients online ordering and home delivery and customized and dynamic menus to match customers’ taste interests. Panipuri was distinct in that it could not be ordered online because the most important part of the dish was its preparation and service on the spot. Consuming it right away accentuated the taste.ChallengesAlthough franchising seemed to be the next logical step for Chatar Patar and the team was elated with the response of prospective franchisees Kulkari wanted to continue to maintain a niche and exclusivity in the market. The challenge was to expand while maintaining and delivering on Chatar Patar’s promise of health hygiene and most importantly taste. The goal was to maintain the exclusive taste so no matter which outlet the customer visited the Gapagap would taste the same. The team planned to travel to all the locations and train the staff to prepare the products the right way but the team had no previous experience with how a food outlet was run nor did they have any experience with distributing to franchisees.The team had made the ingredients the pani of their signature product Gapagap in liquid form. The immediate challenge was how to transport the contents and ingredients to the kitchen teams in the franchises. The company was still in the initial growth phase and its income was limited so whatever method was adopted needed to be cost-effective. At the same time delivery needed to be done with minimal to no damage to the contents. The ingredients in the semi-liquid state had a shelf life of only two to three days and the goods risked being damaged in transit as a result of breakage or spillage. The team wanted the same method of delivery for all franchise outlets and they wanted a method of distribution that was lucrative in both the short and long terms. They were not looking for a stopgap solution; it had to be a permanent solution. The Way ForwardThe franchisee offers were pouring in. The team was already negotiating with seven prospective franchisees who were satisfied with Chatar Patar’s proposal and were ready to take up the franchises. The team again researched and found methods for transporting the ingredients to the franchisees. Their first thought was to emulate the methods adopted by the beverage giants such as PepsiCo Inc. or The Coca-Cola Company. The team worked out an option for transporting the semi-liquid formula from the main store in Indore to the first franchise offer they accepted in a nearby city in Rajkot (see Exhibit 2).The transportation cost involved carrying the goods from the parent outlet in Indore to the receiving location of the first transport agent which would take it from there to a local transportation company warehouse. The team estimated each trip would cost ₹250. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000.From the local warehouse the product would be moved to the transporter’s warehouses in the franchise cities. The cost for that stage would be ₹500 per trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹4000.Finally the product would then be transported from the city warehouses to the franchises. The cost for this stage of shipment was ₹250 per round trip. At eight trips per month the monthly cost would be ₹2000 (see Exhibit 3).When the team discussed this plan with the transporting agents the agents established that this plan could be used for all the cities that had direct bus links. Whether they transported their material to Rajkot Baroda Jamnagar or Vizag the cost would be the same. However if the weight of the shipped goods was more than 120 kilograms they would be charged an additional ₹10 per kilogram.This method of transportation of semi-liquid ingredients also carried the risk of 30 per cent damage to the ingredients. If the product incurred damages the loss would not only increase the transportation cost due to more shipments to replace the damaged goods but also decrease the profit margins. The shelf life of the product was two to three days and even after transportation there would likely be 30 to 40 per cent wastage because the ingredients did not taste fresh. The next approach the team considered was that used by large fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC. With this model the ingredients would be prepared and frozen which would increase the shelf life of the ingredients. However only 10 of Chatar Patar’s products could be converted to a frozen-food format; eight products needed to be freshly prepared. Planning needed to be more strategic with the frozen format. First a regular route would need to be established then the stores would be opened along the route to optimally use the delivery channel. The company would need to lease cold storage space located centrally on the route and invest in a blast freezing process. Another requirement would be to maintain a large inventory that could meet the product demand. The advantage with this option was that it was damage-proof (see Exhibit 4). The third alternative that the team considered was to convert the semi-liquid formula into a dry format. The cost for the drying process would be ₹300 for 120 kilograms of semi-liquid formula. The cost of transportation would be ₹1000 (see Exhibit 5).Yet another option the team considered was to share with the franchise owner the trade secret—the recipes and the exact procedure for creating their exclusive taste. This option would be the easiest for the parent company doing away with all the logistics hassle of transporting ingredients. The disadvantage was that the team would lose control of their market advantage; franchise owners could give up their franchises at the end of the contract and start their own ventures under another brand name.Another suggestion proposed by Arti and Pallavi was that they first focus on expanding in nearby cities where the material could be transported within a matter of few hours. Kulkarni suggested that they could also focus on opening franchises in Indore itself.Finally the team considered whether they should standardize the five or six key products and leave the remaining products to the discretion of the franchisee. The franchises could customize the panipuri according to local taste and preference.Exhibit 1: Chatar Patar Foods Pvt.

The �sun never sets� for China Eastern Airlines with flights in the air at any given time. We have the most advanced and comfortable aircrafts have built a global route network have simplified passenger travel and have improved the on-board service to be more personalized and user-friendly. More importantly we are actively involved in international airline affairs building a global network joining the top airline alliance and developing close partnerships with the world�s leading airlines; [China Eastern Airlines] has gained a commanding voice in the global airline industry.Shaoyong Liu chairman China Eastern Airlines Corporation LimitedFaced with fierce competition from major domestic and international airlines in 2014 Shaoyong Liu chairman of China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (China Eastern) first introduced the company�s �Pacific Plan.� The plan involved a comprehensive upgrade of hardware and software services to enhance the competitiveness of China Eastern�s cross-Pacific routes. Since November 2014 Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts were allocated for long-haul trans-Pacific routes and became the main force of the Pacific Plan. Seizing opportunities brought forward by the introduction of new-generation long-haul aircraft and in-flight Internet network services China Eastern built a new brand image with international influence. From 2014 to 2018 the China Eastern North America team made concerted efforts in expanding its route network and optimizing transit opportunities through �gateway� cities in China and North America. At the end of 2018 China Eastern operated a total of ten North American routes reaching international metropolitan cities including New York City Honolulu San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago Toronto and Vancouver. Among these eight routes seven departed from Shanghai. China Eastern strove to become more global by continuing to extend its influence from Shanghai to the rest of the world.With the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017 a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government what should China Eastern Airlines do to continue to expand its Shanghai-based globalization strategy?China Eastern AIrlines COrporation�History and BackgroundChina Eastern was one of China�s top three major state-owned air transportation companies headquartered in Shanghai. China Eastern first listed its H shares on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the New York Stock Exchange in February 1997. In October of the same year China Eastern issued and listed its A shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This signified the first Chinese airline to list its three securities on three stock exchanges.Air China Limited China Southern Airlines Company Limited and China Eastern dominated 64.6 per cent of the market share in China; the remaining market was shared by smaller airline companies such as Hainan Airlines Co. Ltd.The scope of China Eastern�s business included domestic international and regional air transportation of passengers cargo mail and luggage as well as other airline services. As China�s second-largest carrier by number of passengers China Eastern aimed to exploit potential in the domestic market as it boosted domestic and regional flight frequencies from Shanghai to other Chinese cities.On the international front China Eastern accelerated the pace of international expansion by increasing flight frequencies to international destinations. On June 21 2011 China Eastern joined SkyTeam Airline Alliance (SkyTeam) allowing the company to extend its flight network from Shanghai to 1150 destinations in 175 countries around the world. China Eastern leveraged the SkyTeam platform and route network of member airlines and commenced a code-sharing operation with over 10 SkyTeam member airlines covering 797 routes. China Eastern also sustainably commenced intensive co-operation with SkyTeam members in alliance projects such as SkyPriority SkyTeam Hubs and SkyPort. Furthermore China Eastern also strengthened its partnerships with SkyTeam members such as Air France-KLM S.A. (Air France-KLM) Delta Airlines Inc. (Delta) and China Airlines to continuously develop an international brand with a global influence.Brand DevelopmentCore ValueChina Eastern�s core brand value was �world-class hospitality with Eastern charm.� The company strove to provide globally integrated aviation services and logistics. Through the implementation of its brand operation strategy China Eastern dedicated itself to providing �accurate delicate and precise� quality of service in creating splendid travel experiences for global customers.Brand OrientationChina Eastern built world-class aviation services to ensure its safe operation. China Eastern emphasized the services and experiences it provided to its customers. Adhering to the service philosophy of �customer-oriented and dedicated services� China Eastern introduced the �Eastern Miles� frequent flyer program an incentivized program that allowed its members to enjoy benefits offered by 19 SkyTeam airlines as well as the use of more than 750 VIP airport lounges across the world. China Eastern also promoted marketing campaigns such as �Members Day� and the �818 Big Sale� aiming to develop a strong frequent-flyer member base and customer resources. By the end of 2018 the Eastern Miles frequent-flyer program had reached 39.63 million members.China Eastern steadily increased its service quality and services by vigorously promoting online service integration. Self-service check-in was expanded to 88.11 per cent of locations and the self-service check-in rate in China exceeded 78 per cent. China Eastern was committed to creating a digitalized airline that brought great convenience to passenger travel. Online service system and the luggage inquiry system were developed to enhance the customer�s travelling experience.Brand StyleWith a focus on building an �exquisite elegant [and] fashionable� brand style China Eastern was dedicated to pursuing service quality improvement and providing its customers with safe comfortable and convenient air transport services. The airline aimed to create an exclusive service brand by optimizing customer experiences. China Eastern constantly improved hardware service facilities; for instance it upgraded Shanghai Pudong International Airport�s high-end check-in area and renovated 37 VIP lounges at 13 airports. The Eastern Miles platinum card was introduced to forge a brand dedicated to high-end services.North American Lines and Call CentreOn August 6 1991 China Eastern opened its first trans-Pacific long-haul international route connecting Shanghai to Los Angeles. On June 16 2004 China Eastern extended its flight network connecting Shanghai to Vancouver by introducing the second North American long-haul route. Over the next ten years China Eastern focused its strategy on establishing transportation hubs by opening various international routes for long-haul flights to extend its flight converge. With Shanghai as China Eastern�s core hub five international routes for long-haul flights were added to the network connecting Shanghai with New York City Honolulu San Francisco Toronto and Chicago. In 2014 China Eastern founded a marketing centre in North America to expand marketing channels in the United States. In 2015 the marketing centre expanded its network to include airline routes to Canadian cities. With a focus on enhancing customer value China Eastern developed an international e-commerce platform to expand its sales channel in North America. As of 2015 China Eastern presently had a total of 73 flights flying from China to North America each week. It had become the third-largest carrier in the China�US market and the second-largest carrier in the China�Canada market.Informatization was the �engine� of brand internationalization. China Eastern formed digitized systems for major business services such as international operation control aircraft affairs and management control to enhance the customer experience. On November 17 2016 the North American call centre was established for airline services support and inquiries for North American routes. China Eastern vigorously promoted online service integration such as with their online self-service check-in system luggage inquiry system and abnormal flight information release platform to increase service quality; for example offline cabin meals can be selected through this online system in advance. The airline also developed a mobile marketing and service platform leveraging channels such as WeChat to provide passengers with always connected and 24-7 travel information services.The Pacific PlanChina Eastern aimed to accelerate the globalization process by strengthening its co-operation with partners in the aviation industry. With the goal to further optimize and better serve the North American market Liu rolled out the Pacific Plan in 2014 aiming to expand China Eastern�s route network and enhance the airline�s competitiveness in North America. Considering its customers� needs China Eastern expanded the VIP airport pickup service to Los Angeles New York and San Francisco as well as a series of overseas services cooperation with Delta to jointly implement customer development plan and to enhance service quality for foreign customers.From 2016 to 2018 China Eastern prioritized the Pacific Plan as one of its core marketing strategies with which to strengthen its international brand. The plan was also conducive to the company�s internationalization process. Taking the opening of new routes in North America as opportunities China Eastern expanded its route hub network marketing network and service security network laying a solid foundation for the company�s internationalization strategy. As of 2015 China Eastern had a total of seven gateway cities in North America�Los Angeles New York San Francisco Chicago Honolulu Vancouver and Toronto�providing as many as 73 flights per week enhancing the airline�s trans-Pacific long-haul capacity. Through a series of operations promotions service enhancement and customer development China Eastern�s North American routes became profitable in 2015. In 2016 China Eastern was ranked for the first time as one of the top 500 most valuable brands making Brand Finance�s Global 500 list for three consecutive years.In order to meet the increasingly intense competition in the global airline industry China Eastern actively co-operated with industry partners. In 2015 China Eastern co-operated with Delta as a strategic investor to establish a global strategic partnership. China Eastern actively sought strategic partnerships through joint ventures equity investments and mergers and acquisitions to acquire a global competitive advantage. Moving forward China Eastern planned to continue deepening its partnership with Delta by further expanding the code-sharing coverage and marketing channels. By taking advantage of Delta�s resources and established flight network in the United States China Eastern would be able to expand its own route network and optimize transit opportunities through the gateways of China and the United States. Meanwhile customer experiences related to shared and improved airport resources facilities and services; procedures for travellers; and an established luggage information system would be enhanced through partnership. For example Delta customers would have access to China Eastern�s network of premium lounges while the same would be true for China Eastern customers in Delta facilities. The strategic partnership between China Eastern and Delta would be a win-win enabling both parties to build and share an airline network with global coverage.In July 2017 China Eastern made a strategic investment in Air France-KLM purchasing a 10 per cent stake. The new landscape of the global aviation industry that China Eastern actively participated in had gradually formed and positioned China Eastern as more international than before. The Development of the New York LineSince its development China Eastern�s New York line had remained relatively stable in terms of capacity with significant expansions taking place in 2010 and 2016. Seizing the opportunities brought by Expo 2010 Shanghai China and the relaxation of visa requirements the China Eastern New York line increased its flight frequency from four flights per week to seven. Growth of the New York line�s capacity remained stable between 2012 and 2015. After November 2014 China Eastern extended some of its flight network by introducing the Fuzhou�Shanghai�New York route. Every Tuesday and Thursday direct Shanghai�New York flights were extended to Fuzhou providing more convenience and choices for Fuzhou travellers. Meanwhile China Eastern replaced the old A346 aircraft with new-generation long-haul wide-body aircraft�the Boeing 777 series. In order to meet the growing demand of the market in December 2015 the China Eastern New York line expanded to 14 flights per week (including the Fuzhou�Shanghai�New York route). As of May 2018 China Eastern�s Shanghai�New York four-hour minimum connecting time (MCT) original destination routes had a total of 109 flights monthly representing a capacity increase of 5.5 per cent as compared to 2017 while its six-hour MCT original destination routes had a total of 115 flights monthly representing a capacity increase of 3.2 per cent as compared to 2017.Strategy for Pricing International Flight TicketsThe objectives of China Eastern�s strategy for pricing international flight tickets were formulated to (a) determine optimal pricing to ensure China Eastern�s survival in the increasingly competitive market; (b) gain market share in the global market; (c) maximize the unit margin; (d) optimize operations; and (e) enhance revenue quality. China Eastern pursued a cost-plus pricing strategy which consisted of identifying and totalling all flight costs and then setting air ticket prices at a certain percentage above total unit cost in order to drive profitability. Meanwhile China Eastern took into account the competitive and legal environment in which the company operated. For certain international routes China Eastern pursued a competitive pricing strategy which set the ticket price based on the prices of similar competitors in the market. As the airline industry was highly subject to seasonality during periods of higher demand such as the peak season of summer China Eastern�s pricing strategy was adjusted based on dynamic demand fluctuating daily due to market demand factors and flight capacity. The level of revenue control and ticket pricing was also enhanced with the help of technological means such as megadata and cloud computing. China Eastern had started testing a strategy that leveraged machine-learning algorithms to customize airfare pricing and itinerary results based on collected customer data. The airline promoted informatization as it led to continual enhancement of operational management and the ability to reform and innovate in the competitive business environment.Throughout its development China Eastern continued to focus on extending its reach to the rest of the world and establishing itself as a global airline. China Eastern innovated on all fronts of its business to remain agile to meet the changing dynamics of the global airline market.brand DEVELOPMENT IN the NORTH AMERICAN MARKETSales ChannelWith �world-class hospitality� and �Eastern charm� China Eastern made continuous efforts to modernize sales and branding in North America. China Eastern constructed a marketing service centre and distribution channel in North America to build consumer confidence and trust. Adhering to the service philosophy of �customer-oriented and dedicated service� China Eastern continuously strengthened service software and hardware to optimize the customer travel experience. The establishment of a marketing system in North America brought opportunities for China Eastern. The company comprehensively promoted sales and distribution channels to enhance its ability to secure high-value customers. China Eastern emphasized strengthening co-operation with travel management companies online travel agents and major corporate clients. By taking advantage of the partnership with Delta China Eastern further expanded the code-sharing coverage and strengthened marketing co-operation. Furthermore to effectively broaden direct sales channels in North America China Eastern strengthened its online sales channels via its official website optimized the functions and settings of mobile applications and launched brand marketing through self-owned media.Meanwhile China Eastern strove to promote informatization and digitalization as well as to enhance operational management and control marketing channels. With the fast development of the mobile Internet promoting mobile applications became an important way to increase direct sales improve service and optimize the customer�s travel experience. As a result China Eastern revitalized its online sales channel to ensure appeal to a newer generation of travellers who were more Internet-savvy. In 2017 the airline�s revenue from direct sales increased by 34.3 per cent as compared to 2016 representing 51.2 per cent of revenue while agency fee expenses were continuously reduced. In 2018 China Eastern�s revenue increased to �114.93 billion�a 12.99 per cent growth.Integrated Marketing CommunicationChina Eastern aimed to enhance its brand awareness and reputation in North America. In co-operation with the American Association of Advertising Agencies China Eastern made continuous advertising investments in various sales channels to formulate advertisements and promotional projects. Meanwhile leveraging social media platforms. China Eastern promoted awareness of its brand and enhanced its market influence through various marketing campaigns in North America.The company deepened its partnership with Delta to jointly establish a route in the China�US market. The concerted efforts in expanding the route network in the United States and optimizing transit opportunities through the gateways of China and the United States allowed China Eastern to expand marketing channels in the US and enhance its influence in North American markets. At the same time China Eastern sought partnership opportunities that would increase brand awareness and loyalty generate revenue and support positive community involvement. China Eastern also actively sponsored a number of cultural and charitable events to promote its brand through airline ticket auctionsInternal ManagementChina Eastern established a comprehensive internal control manual for principal departments and branches in North America. It thoroughly reviewed and established the rules and regulations of its New York sales department. Thereafter the company formulated the work manual for its North American marketing centre which standardized the daily operational procedures and management of the business departments in North America.Moreover China Eastern steadily promoted a �delicate� management strategy and strengthened communication between departments and branches. Through establishing integrated management in departments such as sales marketing information technology and operations China Eastern in turn strengthened communication between headquarters and employees so as to optimize business processes and enhance foundational management in the North American marketing department. Furthermore China Eastern pushed ahead to create a harmonious corporate culture and labour relationship increasing employee recognition as well as loyalty towards the company. Employees were held accountable for completing assigned tasks and performing the duties required by their jobs. This in turn firmly fostered a sound atmosphere for continuous improvement in areas such as marketing and sales customer services and safe operation. As an important destination in China Eastern�s global network North America had been a focal point of the airline�s expansion strategy. By leveraging its existing partnerships and expertise China Eastern was able to successfully uphold its �world-class hospitality with Eastern charm� brand during its expansion.CHALLENGESChina Eastern rolled out the Pacific Plan to develop the China�North America sector operating ten trans-Pacific routes to seven gateways in North America. However aside from the brand awareness attained in major gateway cities in the United States and Canada China Eastern�s brand awareness was relatively low among North American cities thus hindering the airline�s ability to capture market share beyond these major cities and limiting steady long-term growth.The airline�s international operations were subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Foreign carriers such as United Airlines Inc. had built a robust flight network in the United States and Canada placing significant competitive pressure on other network carriers in the market. Although alliance with foreign carriers such as Delta allowed China Eastern to increase its ability to sell international transportation services to US gateway cities China Eastern faced competitive pressure from an increasing number of medium-sized Chinese airlines that had actively expanded their flight networks into North America. As more carriers obtained increased access to interior US passenger traffic beyond the traditional US gateway cities international air traffic flight rights and related resources became scarce.. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND DEVELOPMENTThe 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China which took place on October 18 2017 emphasized �going global� and implementing the Belt and Road Initiative. How should China Eastern adjust its international strategy of Shanghai-based globalization?

With its headquarters in Brussels Belgium the majority of its operations were in Europe though B-Kay Tech was also active in North America and Eurasia.Kay had started with the company as a planning analyst in the Belgian office in 2005 and between 2008 and 2016 he was project manager in the supply chain office. During that period he successfully established several supply chain improvement programs with one of his major achievements being the vendor-managed inventory collaboration agreement he had set up with the company�s two biggest retailers in 2012. The agreement with the retailers resulted in higher delivery order stability which helped B-Kay Tech to improve the planning of production and transport in turn resulting in better resource planning and shorter delivery lead times. Service levels rose over the following years while at the same time inventory levels were reduced not only in Kay�s own warehouses but also in those of the retailers. Owing to this collaboration agreement Kay was able to achieve significant supply chain savings for the company over the years which in part led to his promotion to supply chain director at the start of 2017. In order to impress B-Kay Tech�s vice-president of Operations and Supply Chain Kay wanted to devise a new breakthrough innovation project. He had heard about a different type of supply chain collaboration�horizontal collaboration�that involved partnerships with companies that operated at the same level in the supply chain; these companies could even be (potential) competitors. The idea behind horizontal collaboration was to bundle the partner companies� shipments in the same transport so that any available space in one company�s truck hauls could be utilized to transport shipments for other companies reducing the overall number of trucks required. With the logistics team responsible for the greatest part of the company�s carbon footprint this shift would not only affect B-Kay Tech�s bottom line but would also help the company to reach the stringent 2020 sustainability targets set out by management. Kay discussed this idea with his vice-president who agreed that it could be a breakthrough project and signed off on it�with the stipulation that first results be visible within the year and that Kay looked at more than just monetary savings in transport. With top management support in place how could Kay find potential partners within the designated time frame and convince them too of the benefits of a collaboration?Driving logistics efficiencies through collaborative shippingB-Kay Tech had its own fleet of 25 trailer trucks for the local logistics that was supplemented with outsourced third-party logistics (3PL) shipping for the international lanes. One of the major inefficiencies Kay�s logistics team faced was that many of the trucks were driving only half-full. Owing to strict delivery demands and high inventory holding costs Kay�s planning team members had only a few degrees of freedom to improve their truckload factors especially if they did not want their service levels to suffer. Through collaborative shipping with another company Kay could fill the empty space in his trucks resulting in greater sustainability and cost improvements.Given the high value density of B-Kay Tech�s products and the limited number of shipments Kay felt that horizontal collaboration could improve the current situation. With the initiative for collaboration having originated with him Kay was in charge of detecting bundling opportunities with other companies. This type of bundling was proactive: opportunities were detected prior to shipment and if desired plans were changed and shipments were delayed or moved forward in order to benefit from joint transport. This system contrasted with traditional freight groupage which was mainly reactive: in groupage shipping the logistics provider decided on bundling less than container loads in the execution phase rather than in the planning phase and the consolidation was only geographical (i.e. the timing of the shipments was not allowed to change).It became clear to Kay that to maximize the gains of collaborative shipping he had to alter his replenishment policy and be more flexible; he had to replenish inventories either sooner or later than originally planned to benefit from joint transport. He was not yet sure what this additional flexibility would mean for his inventory requirements.Revisiting old friendshipsAt the annual Supply Chain Award ceremony in March 2017 Kay had gotten back in contact with David Rollins a former colleague who had started working at WARE-TOUCH during the summer of 2013. WARE-TOUCH was a U.K.-based multinational company that produced and distributed everyday consumer goods throughout Europe and the Middle East and whose production sites and distribution centres were spread across Europe and Turkey. On one of its lanes towards Southern Europe WARE-TOUCH travelled more or less the same route from its distribution centre in Flanders Belgium to its distribution centre in the Lake Como area in Northern Italy. In addition WARE-TOUCH�s warehouses were located only a few kilometres from B-Kay Tech�s warehouses. Given that WARE-TOUCH arranged most of its international logistics on the spot market it was not bound by a contract with a 3PL for that lane. Kay decided to get in touch with Rollins to see whether WARE-TOUCH would be interested in collaborating and bundling transport in the future.Synchronization of orders by joint replenishmentAs of March 2017 Kay�s team managed inventories using a traditional reorder point and order quantity model: whenever the inventory position (inventory on hand plus items on order) dropped to the reorder point an order was placed for a fixed reorder quantity. The reorder point was based on the demand�s forecast error during lead time whereas the order quantity was defined to balance the cost of inventory with the cost of transport. To synchronize shipments in a collaborative shipping agreement Kay�s inventory replenishment policy needed to be adapted to allow for joint orders with WARE-TOUCH. Therefore he devised a replenishment policy that was both straightforward and transparent: when one or both companies placed an order (when its inventory position dropped to its reorder level) and organized a transport the other company could decide to join the transport. With sufficient inventory it was not necessary to replenish and fill the truck needlessly. On the contrary when the inventory position was close to reaching its reorder point it was worthwhile to fill the truck and to replenish a smaller amount. This policy allowed for the placement of joint orders yet each company maintained the flexibility not to join the order in the case that they still had sufficient inventory.The business case of a horizontal logistics allianceDespite their distribution centres being close to each other Kay was aware that WARE-TOUCH was in a different type of business than B-Kay Tech was and that their daily logistics were not necessarily the same. For starters B-Kay Tech worked with a fixed 3PL contract for its international lanes whereas WARE-TOUCH sourced its transport on the spot market. With respect to products B-Kay Tech offered low-volume high-value-density products while WARE-TOUCH supplied low-value commodities in high volumes (see Exhibit 1). Given its high volumes WARE-TOUCH managed to ship full truckloads. On average it shipped a full truck of 100 boxes to its distribution centre in the Lake Como area 60 times per year where it carried about five weeks� worth of inventory (see Exhibit 2). B-Kay Tech shipped between once and twice per week (100 times per year on average) but its trucks were only 35 per cent full. Due to high inventory costs and high shipment frequency its order quantity was only 35 boxes per truck. As a result B-Kay Tech�s distribution centre carried only four weeks� worth of inventory on average.For Kay co-loading one of his trucks would enable him to fill the empty space in the truck and to share a major transport cost even if his truck had to make a slight detour to pick up the order at WARE-TOUCH. But he wondered what the advantages of this arrangement were for WARE-TOUCH. After all WARE-TOUCH already shipped full truckloads and at full efficiency.To find out Kay decided to simulate the costs in the case that B-Kay Tech and WARE-TOUCH both shifted towards collaborative shipping. If Kay initiated the order (i.e. if B-Kay Tech reached its reorder point) he would fill the truck with 30 boxes. With WARE-TOUCH joining the transport it would fill the remaining space for 70 boxes. If WARE-TOUCH replenished its inventory it would order 80 boxes and Kay would fill the remaining truck space with 20 boxes. This way Kay would be able to increase B-Kay Tech�s shipment frequency from 100 to 115 shipments per year; 90 shipments would be initiated by himself (for urgent inventory replenishments when the inventory position dropped below the reorder point) and 25 would be joined with WARE-TOUCH�s transport. Under this collaboration WARE-TOUCH would be able to reduce the number of (self-initiated) transports from 60 to 50 per year a reduction of over 15 per cent. In addition WARE-TOUCH benefited from joining B-Kay Tech�s trucks 30 times per year which meant that its shipment frequency would increase by more than 30 per cent (see Exhibit 3).Next Kay analyzed the impact of the collaborative shipping agreement on each company�s cost performance. If he placed an order and organized the transport B-Kay Tech would be charged the major order costs (i.e. transport costs to Northern Italy) regardless of whether or not WARE-TOUCH joined the transport. If WARE-TOUCH joined Kay�s transport it paid for the minor order costs (i.e. the marginal cost of handling and picking up the goods at the WARE-TOUCH distribution centre). The same reasoning would be applied if Kay joined the WARE-TOUCH truck in which case WARE-TOUCH bore the major order costs and B-Kay Tech had to pay only the minor order costs. Kay calculated that under collaboration the transport costs for B-Kay Tech (with both major and minor order costs but without inventory holding costs) would decrease slightly (less than 5 per cent) and the company�s inventory requirements would also decrease (from four to three and a half weeks� worth of inventory). To his surprise the benefits of this collaboration were much greater for WARE-TOUCH as it would be able to reduce its transport costs by 10 per cent. Kay observed that although WARE-TOUCH would have to increase its inventories this was to only a minor extent (from five to five and a quarter weeks� worth of inventory). Trust and adequate gainsharingKay found that there would clearly be gains for both companies if they were to collaborate but the gains were not automatically distributed evenly. He considered several angles from which to approach WARE-TOUCH with his proposal and drafted a partnership idea that was both equitable and sustainable. However he quickly realized he would need a neutral third party to make the arrangement work from a legal point of view.Kay decided to call Erika Owens a former classmate who specialized in commercial law and who had started her own firm as a collaborative shipping trustee in 2014. After speaking with her it became clear to Kay how vital it would be to have a neutral trustee party to gather analyze and govern any information sensitive to anti-trust laws. In addition Owens could take care of constructing a legal framework with multilateral contracts that would be anti-trust compliant. This framework would then also define the rules of engagement and secure the mechanisms for entry exit and gainsharing in the partnership thereby ensuring continuity and stability in the collaboration. To deal with this legal complexity without hurting the savings Owens presented a business proposal to Kay: she would take care of the legal set-up and would fill the trustee role for the first year in exchange for access to B-Kay Tech and WARE-TOUCH�s shipment data. This access would allow her to bring in additional partners or wholly new collaboration options at a later stage at which point she would then be remunerated based on a percentage of the realized gains. In this way Kay would be able to bring a financially fair and legally sound proposal to the negotiation table without having to hand over part of the gains realized at that point to the trustee. With all of the building blocks identified the next steps in making the project a reality were clear to Kay: he would need to devise a gainsharing mechanism that would convince WARE-TOUCH to begin the collaboration and to prepare the negotiations that would undoubtedly follow.

Ltd.�s debut electric hypercar the Vazirani Shul (pronounced �shool�) was launched in July 2018 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex England. Chunky Vazirani the founder and chief designer of Vazirani Automotive created the Shul as a counter to the traditional aggressively designed supercars of the world. The concept car was appreciated for being futuristic in its design and use of technology. According to Vazirani the Shul was the perfect blend of art and science which along with power depicted a lesser-known side of Indian culture and mythology. If successful the Shul would become the world�s first electric car with a jet turbine-electric powertrain. Other automotive companies including the American giant automakers General Motors Company and (then) Chrysler Corporation had tinkered with the technology in the early 1960s but had not been able to successfully implement the technology in reproducible cars. With the Shul Vazirani Automotive ushered India into an elite exclusive club of hypercar manufacturers dominated by manufacturers from the United States and Europe. Although the Shul�s national origin was Indiaa the design centre and the manufacturing hub were located in the U.S. state of California. Indian hypercar enthusiasts would have to import the Shul after it was commercially launched. The Indian market had witnessed an increase in the sales of high-performance cars in recent years. However with the high cost of such cars purchases were far fewer than in developed countries like the United States (see Exhibit 1). The heavy import duty imposed by the Indian government on luxury cars supercars and hypercars made the cost of such imported cars almost double the actual price in the Indian market. Supercars sportscars and hypercars were typically priced above US$1 million with at least 12 out of 50 supercars in 2016 priced above $ 2 million. Consequently high net worth individuals or millionaires were the major customers. In 2017 India had only 263000 millionaires a number that was expected to increase to 1 million by 2020 (see Exhibit 2). Nevertheless automobile enthusiasts were skeptical about whether a market like India was ready for a hypercar like the Shul. Reckless driving accidents and traffic snarls were frequent occurrences in India as was the lack of space to drive such high-performance cars. Vazirani himself admitted that the Shul resulted more from passion than practicality. To skeptics the Shul had been likened to vapourware�something much promised but never delivered. However skeptics were somewhat reassured by Vazirani Automotive�s engineering partnership with the Sahara Force India Team (Force India) and design partnership with Kazunori Yamauchi. Force India was India�s first and only Formula 1 racing team and Yamauchi was the designer of the extremely popular PlayStation Gran Turismo video game series. Yamauchi was also credited with providing key inputs and design guidance for the Shul which increased the car�s feasibility. By the end of September 2018 Vazirani was quickly progressing toward the manufacture of the Shul. Could he succeed in making the Shul successful in India and in global markets? With its design and manufacturing centres located in the United States was Vazirani right to position the Shul as an Indian car? COMPANY BACKGROUNDHypercars were characterized by appealing aesthetics exorbitant price tags state-of-the-art technology and unimaginable speed and performance. Many hypercars were associated with developed countries with many hypercars coming from European and American luxury car manufacturers such as Ferrari N.V. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. and Automobil Lamborghini S.p.A. On a global level very few Indian automotive designers were successful. The few designers that were popular included Dilip Chhabria and Chetan Shedjale. Pratap Bose of Tata Motors was also credited with new-age Tata designs. Among these popular names Vazirani was unheard of.In 2015 at the age of 25 Vazirani founded Vazirani Automotive as an automobile design and manufacturing company in Mumbai India where Vazirani was born and raised. To the general public motor shows were nothing more than a demonstration of automobiles but for Vazirani they were a source of inspiration. In 2005 while attending the Geneva motor show he was struck by the design of the Enzo Ferrari and decided that his future was in designing cars.Vazirani graduated from the ArtCenter College of Design in California which was also the alma mater of popular Indian automobile designer Chhabria. Vazirani stated �Dilip Chhabria has been the only Indian car designer around who has done good work. He is responsible for letting people know that car design exists on the planet. It is crucial to have someone like him.� After working as a product designer for Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC and the Volvo Group Vazirani decided to return to India with a mission to build �India�s first hypercar.� By early 2018 he created the Shul hypercar concept vehicle. The car gave Vazirani global recognition and was expected to catapult him to global prominence. Vazirani stated that the principles that guided him in the car�s development were motivated by Indian culture and mythology. Vazirani considered his automotive company not just a hypercar company but also a design and technology company. He intended to work with other original equipment manufacturers on a consultancy basis to support them in designing and advancing future cars. He stated �We�re working on the technology of the next generation so that�s something that we can capitalize on by offering consultancy services to other companies.�Despite being an automobile company Vazirani maintained a lean structure with only 10 employees. The company hired various consultants and partnered with several designers across different countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2017 Vazirani Automotive had $30996 in fixed assets and $26555 in current assets. The two figures represented growth for the company of 2479 per cent in fixed assets and 1778 per cent in current assets over 2014 (see Exhibit 3). SHUL�S DESIGN and APPEARANCEVazirani wanted the Shul to look both modern and international to �strike the correct equilibrium concerning art and science He wanted his car to be unlike other contemporary hypercars which Vazirani described as being �built by engineering.�� Vazirani also wanted to depict a less familiar side of India to the world the side that involved getting closer to one�s soul. Thus he drew upon his Indian heritage and beliefs while designing the car. Commenting on challenges associated with embedding Indian culture and mythology in the car Vazirani stated �The Indian influence is very tricky as you tend to go overboard and be too decorative with colour.� He cautioned �On a sports car you need to be subtle.� The Shul was not about aggression but about reconnection. Its design was inspired by the Indian god Lord Shiva and his trident weapon known as the trishula. The Shul�s sides and hood had trishula-like lines. Its headlamps featured three vertical lines that resembled the three lines on Lord Shiva�s forehead known as the tripundra which personified life. In Indian mythology the symbol of the trishula could remove negative qualities human beings suffered from such as ego. It thus helped transform an individual from physical existence to the spiritual plane thus conveying a message of getting closer to one�s own soul. Shul drivers would be able to approach their own selves through the experience of totality. Despite the inspiration from Indian mythology the design of the Shul like other supercars in the market was also partly aggressive with several cuts and curves to enhance its aerodynamic capabilities. The body panels were designed to increase downforce as were those of most hypercars. With a plunging roof slanted front end and a graceful rear end the Shul was aesthetically comparable to Ferraris Aston Martins and Jaguars. It had light emitting diode (LED) lamps in both the front and back. The side of the car had vents and the exhaust system was centrally mounted. Because the Shul was designed with input and guidance from Yamauchi the Gran Turismo logo was mounted at the centre exit exhaust of the car. Vazirani intended to manufacture an electric car that gave the driver equivalent handling to that of a traditional sportscar. SHUL�S TECHNOLOGYVazirani used a revolutionary jet turbine-electric powertrain in the Shul enveloped in a suit of carbon-fibre which distinguished the Shul from competitors. Turbine-electric powertrains were generally used in warships submarines and railway locomotives. Despite repeated attempts in the past automobile companies such as Volkswagen AG England-based MG Rover Group and (then) Chrysler Corporation had not been able to achieve much success using turbine engines in cars. The Shul�s jet turbine-electric powertrain consisted of microturbines which enabled its propellers to run on multiple fuels including regular gasoline or petrol. This made it more efficient and less expensive to maintain than other electric hypercars. Microturbines also created less pollution than regular supercars and other electric supercars although noise levels were still a concern. The microturbine acted as an instant generator charging the batteries as the car ran. This feature allowed Vazirani Automotive to deploy a lightweight battery pack. The Shul battery pack weighed around 300 kilograms (kg) which was much lighter than batteries in other electric cars such as the 540 kg battery in the Tesla S. The lightweight battery pack not only reduced the car�s weight it also added a distinct sound and enhanced the car�s driving range. The signature �whoosh� sound from the turbine was expected to add to the unique driving experience for customers. In the Shul the battery pack was placed behind the passenger for equitable distribution of the car�s weight. The Shul was driven by four electric motors powered by the in-body 300 kg lithium battery pack. The four electric motors located beside each wheel acted as independent engines. Each engine provided its own independent torque resulting in unprecedented acceleration. The car body was made of carbon-fibre which made the Shul light and helped keep the car intact in a crash. Overall the Shul weighed around 1600 kg compared to heavier competitors such as the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 at 1888 kg or the Tesla Model S at 2100 kg.The smaller components of microturbine also helped create extra space which was efficiently used to improve the aerodynamics of the car. Air was channelled through and around the car to reduce drag and improve downforce. The Shul had a smooth flowing design with several air ducts which were designed to create adequate downforce to keep the hypercar of 1000-plus horsepower stationed at high speeds. The double diffuser of the Shul a shaped section of the car�s underbody that influenced its aerodynamics was also one of the biggest in the industry and components around it were innovatively and creatively packaged. A massive radiator ran across the centre of the car. The front bumper featured a large intake that fed air to the batteries located on the central tunnel and behind the passenger�s seat. The intake also created a lot of downforce toward the anterior end. An air duct was built under the headlights with the objective of cooling the brakes.Vazirani kept the design intact through the production stage stating that design and packaging were ready. Further aerodynamic simulations had been successfully conducted with favourable results as Vazirani reported: �A lot of interior ergonomics and the door-shut lines will stay on. The cooling requirements such as ducts for the individual components will also carry on unchanged.� SHUL�s PARTNERSFor the Shul�s development Vazirani worked with multiple companies globally including Brembo SpA for the brakes and Michelin for customized tires. For design and branding as noted earlier Vazirani partnered with Yamauchi and the team that created the PlayStation Gran Turismo series of racing video games which imitated the appearance and performance of real-world automobiles with licensed reproductions. Yamauchi himself awarded a final touch to the Shul�s design.Vijay Mallya the owner of Force India on collaboration with Shul stated �It is only logical for us to collaborate with Vazirani Automotive to advise mainly with aerodynamic design and participate in this important milestone in Indian automotive engineering.� In August 2018 Force India was acquired by Racing Point UK and rebranded as Racing Point Force India. Vazirani looked forward to collaborating with the new owners to gain expertise in using a wind tunnel which was required for developing the aerodynamics of the Shul. Vazirani also had teams based in the United Kingdom Japan Italy and the United States who worked on the design and development of the Shul.SHUL�S COMPETITIONAlthough the Shul�s pricing was not revealed by Vazirani Automotive industry experts believed that the Shul was expected to be priced similar to BMW�s i8 in India which cost $293000. The estimates were based on Shul�s size which was similar to the BMW i8 in several aspects such as design size and engine layout. Given their high pricing (see Exhibit 3) supercars and hypercars like the Shul needed average annual sales of approximately 400 units to break even. The two most prominent electric hypercars in direct competition to the Shul were the Rimac Concept One and C Two by Croatia-based Rimac Automobili. The Rimac Concept One delivered in early 2017 had a price of $1 million; the Rimac C Two scheduled for release in 2019 was priced at $2 million. Rimac Automobili claimed that the C Two would have a longer driving range of approximately 600 kilometres (400 miles) with a single charge compared to the Concept One at 340 kilometres (210 miles). The C Two also boasted an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometres (60 miles) per hour in 1.85 seconds and a top speed of 415 kilometres (258 miles) per hour.Another competitor to the Shul was Tesla�s 2020 generation of the tri-motor Roadster all-electric hypercar. Tesla was criticized for its claim to have a 200-kilowatt hour battery pack which implied a weight of approximately 833 kg. Such a weight would substantially limit the hypercar�s range and acceleration. Tesla claimed that its Roadster could accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres (60 miles) per hour in less than two seconds compared to Vazirani�s Shul at 2.5 seconds. Experts opined that this range of acceleration speed would become the norm rather than the exception once several electric hypercars were available in the market (see Exhibit 3).In India�s automobile market for high-end luxury cars sportscars and supercars most companies had received a mixed response. Well-known companies from developed markets such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motors Ltd. had registered some sales success in the Indian luxury car market. However less-known companies such as Koenigsegg Automotive AB from Sweden and Apollo Automobil Ltd. (formerly Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur GmbH) from Germany had been unable to generate any sales in India.MARKETINGThe Shul�s first teaser promotion was released on Vazirani Automotive�s YouTube channel. The channel described the Shul as �an aerodynamically enhanced elegant design paired with a Micro Jet Turbine Electric powertrain to deliver a spiritual automotive experience of restrained power eternal beauty and quiet eminence.� Vazirani advertised the Shul as a car of Indian origin and claimed it as being India�s first hypercar due to its headquarters in Mumbai India. The company however had its design and style centre in California. Shul was also expected to be manufactured in California considered the world capital of electric cars and companies. To explain why California was chosen as the foreign design location Vazirani stated �It�s the cash of the electric-powered auto environment and we have connections there.� Venture capitalists funding the future growth of Vazirani Automotive were more likely to be found in California than in India. Also the lack of suitable technologies for building hypercars in India was a roadblock.INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS IN INDIAThe Goodwood Festival of Speed was considered one of the best motor shows in the world. India received global visibility on the 25th anniversary of the festival when the Shul was first presented. With the Shul India was not only launching its first hypercar but a battery-operated electric hypercar. According to a survey by Velocity MR a market research firm in India 90 per cent of Indians surveyed claimed that they would choose to drive an electric car. However critics were skeptical about the future of electric cars in India because of the lack of electric car maintenance infrastructure such as publicly available charging points (see Exhibit 4). But the Shul was a hybrid-electric car built on the concept of �charging on the go.� Fuels such as gasoline or petrol were used to charge the batteries while the car was being driven so the lack of public charging points was less of a concern for Vazirani Automotive.Nevertheless hypercars like the Shul had a low ground clearance and were generally sensitive to road infrastructure problems. A modest blemish in the roads could result in a cost of thousands of dollars for maintenance and servicing. India�s road infrastructure was considered greatly inferior to developed countries. Poor road conditions such as potholes and bumpy roads had been known to cause accidents and even death. Another challenge to hypercars in India was road traffic. Traffic jams in major Indian cities often caused cars to slow to a crawl making walking much faster than driving. Further speeding related accidents were a major concern in India. In 2016 66.5 per cent of all road accidents and 61 per cent of deaths caused in road accidents were attributed to speeding. National and state highways where traffic that was relatively smoother and speed limits were generally more relaxed were the site of about 55 per cent of all road accidents in 2016. Skeptics further raised concerns about whether hypercars or supercars could be effectively driven in the uncontrolled obstructions of Indian roads including pedestrians disobeying street crossing regulations potholes in roads and roads blocked by the movement of stray animals such as cows and dogs. Driving supercars could also be particularly hazardous due to the driver�s lack of attention lack of knowledge of the vehicle�s high-end technology and incapability to deal with high acceleration speed limits and the required maneuvering. However with several start-ups in India posed to chase the electric hypercar dream as Vazirani Automotive had already done many experts believed that India would soon be recognized on the global platform as an influencer of the hypercar world.THE ROAD AHEADThe Shul was expected to hit the Indian market before being sold globally. Commenting on future plans Vazirani stated �We want to make things a lot more modular going forward in terms of not just the way we design the car. We see the powertrain evolving a lot faster in the future so owners will get an option to swap. For instance if in three years there�s a better motor out there we could offer this as an upgrade.� Other Indian entrepreneurs racing toward the development of supercars included Sathak Paul a 21-year-old entrepreneur. In 2015 Paul had intended to launch a supercar in the Indian market under his company�s name of Mean Metal Motors. However he found fundraising to be a major roadblock. Given the financial and engineering support Vazirani Automotive received automobile experts were far more positive about the possibility of the Shul running on roads. However according to media sources a similar project called the Techrules Ren RS was presented at the Geneva Motor Show in early 2018. The Techrules Ren RS was also a turbine-run car fuelled by diesel and powered by up to six electric motors. However after its Geneva debut no news about the company was heard. Vazirani wondered if he should continue to position the Shul as an Indian car despite its manufacturing in the United States.

He had a continuous fatigue-laden cycle: study very late get a few hours of sleep go to classes and repeat. Needless to say Kalbfleisch developed something akin to a coffee obsession as a university studentâdue in part not only to his area of study but also to his focus on achieving academic excellence.Kalbfleisch often faced long lines waiting for coffee at school but he felt the habit was necessary if he was going to keep doing late-night study sessions. He wondered if there was a better way to get the quality coffee he craved without having to endure the typical wait-times at a premium coffee shop. Making premium coffee at home did not work for him as he liked to drink his coffee while he worked which was rarely at his residence and travel mugs negatively affected the flavour of his cherished brew.âThereâs no doubt Iâm a coffee snobâ said Kalbfleisch. âItâs a passion of mine and many others but I simply canât find the combination of portability and premium quality coffee available anywhere in the crowded coffee products marketplace.â As Kalbfleisch began to design the travel coffee press that would meet his needs he realized he had a worthwhile business idea but needed funding to make the business a reality. In 2015 he wondered what form of funding was available to him. Would crowdfunding be a realistic way of raising the money he needed for this venture?Home Is Where The (Good) Coffee IsnâtSeveral methods were available for making coffee at home. The first traditional drip coffee was invented by Melitta Bentz in 1908. The process of making drip coffee involved drawing hot water from a reservoir and letting it seep through a waiting pocket of ground coffee drawing out the flavour of the beans through a paper or mesh filter and into the pot below. This method was popular largely because of its efficiency not because of the quality of the finished product. The maker could brew an entire pot of coffee in minutes with little effort but the taste of this coffee was poor to those who valued quality coffee.In the 1990s John Sylvan created a new type of coffee brewing similar to the drip coffee maker; this type of brewing became known as Keurig. Sylvan worked as a low-level marketing manager before inventing Keurig. Among his unofficial responsibilities was collecting money from his co-workers to pay the coffee vendor. He admitted it was like his full-time job most days. Not only did the chip-in system create headaches the coffee itself was lacklustre. On the rare occasion a co-worker got the coffee-to-water ratio right the half-full carafe would sit on the burner for hours getting stale and bitter. Sylvan envisioned a single-serve coffee system that would eliminate his trivial day-to-day coffee money shakedown and so the Keurig was born.In his quest to create a new brewing method Sylvan actually gave himself caffeine poisoning by taste- testing 30â40 cups a day. Unlike the drip models already on the market Sylvanâs machine was designed to brew single cups using sealed capsules of ground coffee. The Keurig process involved plastic capsules or pods of coffee grounds that when punctured released shots of nitrogen that kept the coffee from oxidizing. When a plastic capsule was closed into the Keurig brewer needles pierced its foil top and plastic bottom. The brewer then pumped in hot water turning the capsule into a miniaturized version of the filter basket found in a traditional coffee maker. This accelerated process took just 45 seconds to produce a steaming cup of coffee. Aside from being extremely time efficient a Keurig also saved users clean-up time. All they had to do was insert another pod into the machine and wait 45 seconds for another hot cup of coffee.  For those who valued the flavour of their coffee above all else the French press was the method deemed to generate the purest flavour possible. Making coffee using a French press involved boiling water to precisely 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius). Whole coffee beans were measured and coarsely ground and the newly ground beans were placed into the press and gently shaken to settle them into place. Finally half the required amount of perfect-temperature water was poured evenly over the grounds. This step was called the bloom. Hot water forced the ground coffee to release trapped gases leading the coffee to expand and release wonderful aromas for coffee purists to enjoy. During the bloom a thick crust of coffee grounds also formed. After 30 seconds the grounds were stirred gently for five seconds and the remaining half of the water was poured into the press. The lid was placed on the French press with the plunger pulled all the way up and the coffee was left to steep for four minutes. When the time was up the plunger was pressed all the way down to filter the grounds from the coffee which was poured immediately to avoid bitterness. The aroma the French press created and the view of the coffee oils floating on top were cherished by those who took pride in their coffee. When drinking a pressed coffee it was typical to actually taste the tiny bean particles. The reason the French press reached a higher flavour threshold was the absence of a paper filter which absorbed much of the oil in the grounds. Instead of soaking this up the press added tiny bits of coffee grounds to the coffee which actually percolated flavour. Steeping as opposed to filtering also increased the rich flavour. Ultimately the Keurig machine was far more efficient at coffee production but it undoubtedly lacked the high-value flavour that a French press was capable of producing.More Money More ProblemsAfter founding Keurig in 1992 Sylvan and his partner Peter Dragone hashed together prototype after prototype working in small offices and doing most of the taste testing themselves. For the first few years they drew no salaries and they were turned down for funding by scores of venture capitalists. For years their meetings with potential investors ended in various lectures as to why their invention would never catch on. Often they would be kicked out of the offices in which they met. After years of continuous rejection they found a Minneapolis-based investor called Food Fund which agreed to contribute US$50000. Subsequently MDT Advisers raised US$1 million for the company. An increasing number of investors yielded an increasing number of opinions. Sylvan disagreed with the majority of the investorsâ strategies and he did not take well to receiving direction from those outside the day-to-day operations of the business he was so passionate about. In 1994 after three years and a lot of energy passion and commitment Sylvan was forced out and demanded the company buy his stake which totalled US$50000. In fiscal 2017 Keurig was expected to make US$2.5 billion in revenues.Some Disassembly RequiredKalbfleisch sought high-quality coffee on the go. He tried travel French presses but found that the freshness suffered as the grounds remained in the bottom of the coffee spoiling the taste by the time he had taken it to school. Discovering no product on the market to suit his exacting requirements he began applying his knowledge of thermal fluids engineering to design his own all-in-one travel coffee press. As a child Kalbfleisch had been curious about how everyday objects worked. He would often take his toys apart to learn about the mechanisms that made them run. He was also a big fan of Lego like most future engineers and he often opted to build his own creations rather than follow the instructions. In high school Kalbfleisch learned how to use 3D modelling software through a technical designing course which helped to foster his interest in product design and eventually led him to become an engineer. During his undergraduate education Kalbfleisch took a year off to complete an internship at Ehvert Mission Critical an engineering consulting firm that specialized in the design of data centres. The small firm was owned and operated by a mechanical engineer who took an interest in developing Kalbfleischâs talents. This positive experience showed Kalbfleisch that an engineer with no formal business training could own a business. While working in data centres Kalbfleisch was amazed at the inefficiencies in the heating and cooling equipment of otherwise high-tech buildings. This led him to pursue a masterâs degree in thermal fluids engineering where his goal was to learn to develop more efficient solutions for heating and cooling. The curriculum in the masterâs program was heavily experiment-based; students built and tested many prototypes while making improvements along the way.When Kalbfleisch began his first foray into designing his coffee product his goal was to press fresh coffee within the travel mug itself. The unique design feature of separating the coffee beans from the liquid such that the maximum amount of flavour would be extracted while the beans were kept separate from the coffee itself seemed to Kalbfleisch a worthy way to differentiate his product from those that were currently available in the market. Accomplishing this design goal would insure a great-tasting brew with a consistent taste to the last sip. Kalbfleischâs product concept now called the Pascal Press would be the only product on the market with this separation feature. Combining his tireless pursuit of coffee perfection with the universityâs capacity to develop physical prototypes contributed greatly to Kalbfleischâs ability to design the worldâs best travel coffee press.Once Kalbfleisch had a rough draft of his design it was time to build a prototype. The experienced he had gained through his education made the process relatively quick and a prototype was made and perfected by September 2015. Constructed out of CA$20 worth of plumbing material the prototype visually showcased the plunge feature of his design so that anyone could easily see the unique process Kalbfleisch had created.Kalbfleisch met with a professor at Western Universityâs Ivey Business School and discussed the potential of Pascal Press. At the time Kalbfleisch had no intention of starting a business but the meeting exposed him to the possibilities and rewards of becoming an entrepreneur and selling his product. The professor suggested Kalbfleisch join the Propel Entrepreneurship Centre (Propel) a student-focused support group at Western University to develop his business. He joined Propel in mid-October 2016.In early December Kalbfleisch began designing and manufacturing his second major prototype using the machine shop provided through his school program. This resulted in an upgraded version of his product concept late in January 2017. By then Kalbfleisch had received a $2000 grant from Propel for a patent search and other forms of development support that enabled him to continue refining his vision. In spite of these various streams of financial support Kalbfleisch recognized that he had further work to do before he would have a product that could be manufactured and sold to consumers. Traditional sources of capital funding were difficult to obtain because the business to this point had achieved no sales. Kalbfleisch had the uncomfortable sense that his venture had effectively stalled. He needed money to further develop a product he believed strongly would be popular but he was unable to generate any sales without having a finished product. The idea that all his hard work and passion might go unrealized left Kalbfleisch desperately looking for new financing alternatives.Twoâs Company Three Thousandâs A CrowdAt that time some of the support staff at Propel suggested Kalbfleisch should consider crowdfunding his venture. He had heard of this relatively new entrepreneurship phenomenon where new business product concepts could effectively be pre-sold to those visiting a site as a means of effectively bridging the productâfinance gap that had previously prevented new products from reaching the marketplace. Anyone with a product concept could pitch it on a crowdfunding platform and if enough pre-sales were achieved the funds were released to the entrepreneur who could then use them to finish and deliver the product to those who had purchased it.Several popular crowdfunding platforms had emergedâincluding Kickstarter PBC Indiegogo Inc. and GoFundMeâall of which were designed to address the productâmarket gap Kalbfleisch was experiencing with Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set about learning how they all worked so he could determine which platform was the best fit. The concept of crowdfunding initially began in 1997 when the British rock band Marillion funded a previously cancelled tour of the United States by pre-selling tickets online to a group of hard-core fans. The success of this innovative method of financing tours and then record productions inspired the creation of the first online crowdfunding platform ArtistShare in 2000. Shortly thereafter more platforms began to emerge and the crowdfunding industry grew consistently each year. Crowdfunding made use of the vast networks and accessibility of social media to bring entrepreneurs and their ideas for new products together with the prospective buyers of those products. Traditionally capital funding sources for new products were limited by the orientations and preferences of small groups of investors who decided themselves whether a new product would be successful or not. Among the key virtues of crowdfunding was that it dramatically reduced investment risk by demonstrating through presales whether there was sufficient market demand for a new product. It also greatly expanded the pool of buyers from whom funds could be raised resulting in a greater volume of valuable products in the marketplace. In addition it was important to note that people who pledged money to crowdfunding campaigns would not actually pay for the products unless these had secured enough pre-orders to make production feasible. Perhaps most importantly crowdfunding greatly reduced the barriers involved in becoming an entrepreneur. By 2009 crowdfunding had emerged as a popular option for entrepreneurs to gain exposure funding and secure validation for their ideas. Revenue in the crowdfunding industry tripled from US$530 million in 2009 to US$1.5 billion by 2011. The explosion of crowdfunding cushioned the blow dealt by the decreasing availability of other funds such as small business association loans.According to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundationâs 2016 index of start-up activity data the number of new entrepreneurs rose in 2014. It increased again in 2015 boasting roughly 550000 new ventures every month. The number of women starting businesses hit its highest level in almost 20 years (40Â perÂ cent) while minorities and immigrants represented a significant portion of new entrepreneurs (28Â per cent).Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter generated revenues by taking a percentage of the funds raised usually 5 per cent of the funding total as well as payment processing fees of 3â5 per cent. Fees were taken only if the funding venture was successful. If the target was not reached no fee was taken and pledgers were not charged. To encourage investors to pledge their money many crowdfunding projects were reward-based. Pre-buyers participated in the launch of a new product and some received additional purchase benefits or pricing discounts. (Re)Search And Ye Shall FindKalbfleischâs approach to crowdfunding as a means of advancing his venture was typical for him. He broke down and analyzed everything he could about the subject such that he knew exactly what he would have to do to maximize his chances of success. One of many insights he gained from this research was that developing a pre-launch marketing campaign would be crucial to success. Kalbfleisch learned that he needed to create excitement and anticipation for his product prior to launching it in order to secure crowdfunding support. He knew most forms of marketing would cost moneyâwhich he did not haveâso instead Kalbfleisch posted images of his constructed prototype on free online forums such as Reddit and began to slowly build up a following. Kalbfleischâs pre-launch goal was to identify and locate his target market based on reactions to his posts. He quickly learned that tea lovers had no interest in his product concept whereas the majority of coffee fans showed instant enthusiasm for it. His posts soon became among the top-ranked on the forum and Kalbfleisch took this as validation of his idea. He sought feedback on these posts and continuously modified and reposted his design to seek additional ideas from forum users. For example one user suggested a spill-proof lid which Kalbfleisch incorporated into his final design. He also began collecting email addresses in preparation for his Kickstarter launch. Kalbfleisch used the recognition he had cultivated on various online forums and directly contacted relevant blog sites to solicit their support in spreading awareness of his upcoming Kickstarter campaign. By the month before his campaign launch Kalbfleisch had gathered over 1100 email addresses which he intended to use as the base of the communications efforts for his Kickstarter campaign. After consulting with his selected production partners in China Kalbfleisch estimated that he needed approximately $80000 in capital to cover the tooling required to manufacture the Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set the Kickstarter campaignâs goal at $40000 to be raised within a 30-day period. He believed that a lower goal would encourage more pledges from buyers and prove to traditional sources of capital that his idea had sufficient traction with the masses making them comfortable with providing the $40000 difference.Kalbfleisch had reviewed many successful Kickstarter campaigns but even after doing so he was not fully confident about which incentive structure would work best for Pascal Pressâs Kickstarter campaign. âI had an immense amount of feedback and input from my online discussion groups as well as my own research and it wasnât clear at all what would work in terms of getting someone to cross the threshold of interested supporter to actual customerâ he said. He set up a proposed incentive structure: the first 200 pledgers would receive 20 per cent off their press as an âearly bird specialâ and remaining buyers would receive 10 per cent off their purchase. Another vital detail to determine was the right price for a Pascal Press. The initial proposed production run of 2000 units would result in a cost of $12.50 per unit. Kalbfleisch would also have to pay for the tooling costs which were estimated at $55000â$60000. Kalbfleischâs instinct was to simply use his costs as the basis for an acceptable price for Pascal Press: âAs long as thereâs a reasonable profit per unit Iâm comfortable with it though I am curious as to other possible pricing approachesâ he said.  Ultimately Kalbfleisch intended to utilize a wholesale distribution system where coffee houses and other retailers would purchase his product with an eye to marking it up and selling it to their customers. Kalbfleisch wondered whether he should offer a deal to his Kickstarter buyers selling the initial production run for what would effectively become the wholesale price. He also wondered what his overall distribution approach should be. He had more or less assumed that the traditional manufacture-wholesale-retail approach was best for Pascal Press but he wondered if selling on Kickstarter was proof that a direct-to-consumer approach might be more valuable. He also had to consider whether he should try to sell through wholesale and onlineâand what the implications of those approaches might be.The Kickstarter campaign launch was only a few days away and it was becoming clearer to Kalbfleisch that some important decisions that would greatly influence the success of Pascal Press still needed to be made.

It had capacity for up to 300 people although at that time Qualtrics employed only about 60 people in Ireland. Plans for global expansion were aggressive—to grow the business by many multiples and to fill the office within three years. Ryan Smith the chief executive officer (CEO) of Qualtrics had travelled to Dublin for this event. During his visit he sought to discuss the approach to quickly building Qualtrics’s EMEA operations with Dermot Costello the recently hired managing director for Ireland. It was critical to decide on the company’s next steps. Company BackgroundThirteen years after it was launched Qualtrics a U.S. software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm based in Provo Utah was continuing to experience significant and exciting change. Established in 2002 Qualtrics initially focused on building sophisticated user-friendly online survey tools. After years of operating the company on little capital and steady growth in revenue and despite external economic effects including the U.S. financial crisis of 2007/08 Qualtrics’s expanded product offering experienced increasing traction in the market. At this time many cash-tight companies started to replace their costly market research contracts with cost-effective do-it-yourself online surveys. Seeing tremendous growth potential the founders brothers Ryan and Jared Smith together with their father Scott M. Smith and family friend Stuart Orgill took on US$70 million in venture capital funding in 2012 to spur growth. Qualtrics like many other digital platform companies had recognized a multibillion-dollar global opportunity that the founders were keen to capture. As a result of its continued success Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 to accelerate growth particularly in international markets. With the abundant opportunities that international markets presented Qualtrics’s management was excited but equally concerned about balanced and sustained growth. On the one side management was conscious of the economics of many software and online-service markets. In these markets the mantra was to prioritize firm growth over margins and cost structure—to “grow fast or die slow.” However the company was unwilling to accept that it needed to choose between aggressive growth and maintaining cash-flow positivity. Qualtrics was equally committed to both goals. At the same time Ryan was aware of the dangers of overly aggressive expansion after the company lived through the dot-com tech bubble of the early 2000s: We’ve seen companies “fuel the jet.” They put the gas line in the jet [secure major funding from venture capitalists] and they’re paying for the gas and they let it fly. Hopefully one day it’ll fly on its own and you can pull the gas line out. But if they got to hold the line out before that thing is ready to fly it all falls. We’ve seen that in the dot-com bubble. Indeed Qualtrics needed to make some difficult and far-reaching decisions regarding its international expansion especially in relation to its expansion in the EMEA region and the expansion of its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland. The company principals wanted to play their cards right by focusing on the most lucrative opportunities within the EMEA region. Also management including Costello was aware of the immense task ahead to quickly develop its regional headquarters in Dublin Ireland from which most of its EMEA expansion would be driven and coordinated. industry backgroundThe versatility and disruptive nature of online survey software delivered as cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) enabled firms to compete and indeed disrupt different markets. An industry born within the digital age online survey software provided an electronic platform for survey development use and analysis for market research product testing and customer satisfaction. Qualtrics had chosen to focus on three markets: market research customer experience and employee insights (see Exhibit 1). The market research industry was fundamentally premised on enabling firms to acquire additional information and insights on their target market; consumer preferences for products or product innovations; and potential needs of firms’ existing or future customer base. On the other hand customer experience management related to the process by which firms developed an understanding of consumers’ perception of their product and/or service to build a more extended relationship with their consumer base including operationalizing responses to customer feedback. Finally employee insights allowed firms to gauge the level of engagement among their employees evaluate and review their performance and acquire insights into potential opportunities for growth and development. These three markets showed evidence of strong growth as firms sought to become more data-driven in their decision making by integrating technological methods to gather process and analyze data in a more comprehensive and instantaneous manner. Online methods of collecting data facilitated the capture of a broader respondent base than was feasible with existing manual methods especially as the digital revolution had led to a greater use of mobile devices to complete surveys online. Moreover all of these markets could be disrupted by new technologies as many of these tasks were traditionally performed by administrative functions or outsourced to expensive third-party providers. In this respect Ryan estimated that companies spent $30 billion annually on outsourcing research projects to consulting firms. Depending on the market Qualtrics faced different competitors. In one sense Qualtrics had no direct competitors because no other company offered the full suite of products that could bring together insights from multiple internal functions to deliver holistic business insights that cut across market research employee insights and customer experience. In another sense Qualtrics had many competitors because it was competing on three separate fronts: customer experience employee insights and market research. Although Qualtrics was aware of competitors its leadership was clear that they did not pay much attention to them and remained focused on forging their own road. growth of Qualtrics The roots of Qualtrics dated back to the 1990s when Scott M. Smith then a professor of marketing at Brigham Young University became passionate about using the Internet to speed up market research (see Exhibit 2). Ryan in his early twenties at the time started to work on developing his father’s idea in the basement of the family home. Their goal was simple: to make sophisticated research simple using an online survey product. In pursuit of this goal they crammed racks of servers into closets of their home resulting in frequent power outages until eventually they bought a generator on eBay and located it in their garden. The current management imagined that many candidates who were invited for an interview with Qualtrics in the early days of operation never appeared spooked by the odd-sounding instruction to walk around the house to the basement door. Despite their idiosyncratic office space by 2006 Qualtrics was generating $1.3 million in revenue with 15 staff while still working from the basement of the Smith home. These early years and the experience of working with little capital embedded a deep sense of frugality and “scrappiness” in the company. The Qualtrics ProductIn terms of its product the Qualtrics offering was renowned for its sophistication ease of use and functionality. Initially Qualtrics focused on a niche market—universities—which in many ways was a result of Scott Smith’s personal experience. This target market allowed Qualtrics to build a top-notch online survey product by responding to the preferences and functionality requirements of demanding users— academic researchers. Although universities remained an important segment for Qualtrics it now served the three markets outlined above: market research customer experience and employee insights. Its SaaS offering was positioned as an insights platform built around value propositions that helped businesses gather data that would enable better business decisions. Most of Qualtrics’s revenues came from business customers including such major companies as JetBlue GE Yahoo and healthcare.gov. Ryan the CEO of Qualtrics emphasized that the advantage of the company’s offering related to it being an easy-to-use platform that didn’t require significant training or support thereby enabling all users to gather valuable insights for their organizations. In addition one of his favourite selling points was the product’s capacity to provide rapid-response insights or “fast data” to inform companies’ decision making instead of an overreliance on backward-looking approaches such as “big data.” The strategy seemed to pay off. Qualtrics started to gain more traction in markets than its competitors and generated substantial growth in revenues. In 2015 Qualtrics had more than 7000 clients running an average of more than 2 million surveys a day on the platform and the company was cash-flow positive. Having focused primarily on its U.S. expansion Qualtrics opened additional offices in Washington DC (in 2014) and Dallas (in 2015). Qualtrics’s Organizational CultureQualtrics management believed that it had created a special organization. Its unique characteristics included its customer orientation and sales culture. The goal was to have everyone focused on the customer. For example during the early days of the company if a customer called for assistance and had to wait longer than three rings for the phone to be answered a red siren flashed and low-pitched bells rang in the office alerting the entire company to drop what they were doing to pick up the phone and help a customer. The workplace also had a distinctly casual atmosphere where employees wandered around in jeans and T-shirts and employees described the organization as “fun” “energizing” and “stylishly nerdy.” At the same time Qualtrics was extremely results-driven with a heads-down hard-working approach. Ryan was a great believer in radical transparency and ensured that vast information on critical decisions and day-to-day operations were accessible to everyone within the organization. This transparency included for example visibility of employee performance allowing staff to approach top performers to learn from their expertise. On the Qualtrics intranet available to any company employee each team and department listed its quarterly goals; and each individual from the CEO to the newest intern listed their weekly activities and reported on how they had done the previous week. Hiring talented people with a tight person-organization fit was critical to Qualtrics management to ensure a high level of brainpower was available within the organization to work out any business challenge or problem. Although Ryan was not concerned about the culture of Qualtrics changing as the firm expanded he wanted to ensure that every decision made within the company bettered the organization. Given the rapidness of change in the technology industry Ryan also knew that Qualtrics needed to remain entrepreneurial and innovative: “We were successful in the basement we built a profitable company that’s valued over a billion dollars. . . . But we know that none of that’s going to matter anymore. How are we going to compete in the future? Our business is really like many start-ups in a row.” As Qualtrics focused on international expansion embedding entrepreneurship in its international offices to the same degree as it was part of the culture at the headquarters in Utah was integral to delivering on its long-term vision. Qualtrics’s Sales ModelThe heart of Qualtrics was its engineering and development department where new products were innovated. In addition Qualtrics had developed a large high-performing and proactive sales organization that was responsible for much of the company’s progress thus far. Indeed management believed that Qualtrics succeeded first and foremost because of a great product and an unparalleled sales force. Qualtrics largely used an inside-sales model whereby salespeople located in the organization’s offices engaged remotely with the customers over the phone. This cost-effective approach originated out of necessity during the early years of Qualtrics when there were insufficient funds for travelling to meet with customers face to face. Although Qualtrics had an effective inside-sales machine and trained young motivated graduates into their sales roles the reliance on an inside-sales model could face limitations when dealing with large businesses for high-value and more complex enterprise deals where personal interactions were critical to closing deals. Qualtrics management was also aware that many competitors invested in hiring seasoned field sales executives and that its inside-sales model might need adaptation when serving international markets on a larger scale and with greater geographic scope.Qualtrics FundingIn 2006 Qualtrics moved into a more conventional office space in Provo. In light of steady revenue growth Ryan convinced his brother Jared to join the company in 2009 to oversee the engineering and product efforts. It wasn’t an easy task as it required Jared acclaimed to be one of the elite engineers in Silicon Valley to quit a senior high-powered job at Google where he had previously helped in setting up the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. Jared had for example worked for several years in Beijing to help run the Google China office. During this period Ryan also warmed to the idea of seeking venture capital funding to support Qualtrics’s next growth phase. Pursuing venture capital funding was a far-reaching decision for the four founders who had treated their equity as gold and strongly preferred to maintain their financial and operational independence. Moreover as the company was not necessarily in need of cash this decision altered its approach to seeking investment. In fact Qualtrics was in such a strong position that it had its choice of experienced investors who would act as a sounding board for major decisions. In 2012 Qualtrics signed a deal with Accel Partner’s Ryan Sweeney (whom Ryan Smith had known for three years) and Sequoia Capital’s Bryan Schreier (whom Jared had known for seven years and was part of the team that had set up and scaled Google’s EMEA operations). Both Ryan Sweeney and Schreier became Qualtrics board members. The two venture capital firms offered to invest $100 million but Qualtrics ultimately decided to scale it back to $70 million. To further accelerate growth Qualtrics raised an additional $150 million in fall 2014 led by Insight Venture Partners Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital. This deal valued Qualtrics at more than $1 billion. Rapid international expansion Ryan had a strong vision of Qualtrics becoming a global firm. However in 2013 only 3 per cent of revenues came from outside the United States with 10 per cent of Qualtrics customers located in Europe. Before Qualtrics expanded to Europe multilingual sales reps would work European hours in the Provo headquarters starting their sales duties early in the morning to bridge the time zone differences between the United States and Europe. This model followed Qualtrics’s philosophy of “nail it then scale it” so when the decision was made to expand internationally there was already a strong base group of customers and referrals ready to go. Initially Qualtrics opened a small office in Dublin in fall 2013. Dublin was an attractive location for Qualtrics because of the city’s technology ecosystem the availability of a multilingual and well-educated workforce and its proven track record as an EMEA regional headquarters location for technology firms such as Google Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter. Believing in the “nail it then scale it” model the Dublin office initially served as an experiment with one person working from the cheapest office that Qualtrics could find to prove the potential in the EMEA market. Around this time Costello a seasoned executive experienced in developing regional operations for software firms was hired to oversee this expansion. Similarly John D’Agostino an experienced executive in growing and leading international sales operations was hired as executive vice president of Global Sales at headquarters. The Dublin office quickly grew so much so that it ran out of space! In May 2015 about 20 months after first locating to Dublin Qualtrics Dublin moved into a large office in a prime city centre location.  At this time Qualtrics employed 700 people most of them at the Provo headquarters and had 60 people working in the Dublin offices. Both the Provo and Dublin offices were ready to scale up: wide expanses of open floor space were ready to be filled with new hires. The Dublin office had capacity for 300 employees. Although Dublin was thus far the only international Qualtrics office Qualtrics management saw opportunities beyond the EMEA region. One of its next moves for example was to set up an office in Sydney Australia. At this time Ryan mentioned: “I feel we’re only 10% of where we can go” and it was his intention to “go big.” Qualtrics was in “hyper-growth mode” and ready to scale and grow aggressively internationally. Ryan and Costello weren’t interested in cautious and slow international growth typical for many other firms. Rather they wanted to capture the potential illustrated by the Dublin office and internationalize across the EMEA region at a highly accelerated pace. It was their target for EMEA to generate 30 per cent of total revenue in five years which would require a yearly growth by many multiples. Ryan was committed to taking a “big bet.”The Next StepsIt was now Costello’s task to deliver on these bullish targets for the EMEA region and he knew that a clever approach was needed to achieve these goals. A couple of decisions had to be made. By May 2015 the Dublin office performed sales (mostly inside sales and field sales) and support activities and it relied on the U.S. headquarters to supply the other value chain activities such as product engineering localization marketing and financial/legal undertakings. However it seemed that the existing structure could quickly become inadequate. To support such a significant EMEA business a largely self-sufficient European business would be required whereby Dublin was the hub with satellite offices in selected countries across the region. This model raised the question of which value chain functions Costello should prioritize in developing and the optimal time for building out these functions. For example although Qualtrics had started to localize its software for some European markets as expansion broadened more country-localized versions needed to be added. Doing so involved not only translation challenges but also technical adjustments. For example within the online platform tailoring the system to a European audience required specific additions such as ensuring the appropriate punctuations for decimal-denominated numbers and Microsoft Excel integrations. Within the current model such localization requests needed to be sent to headquarters as was the case for marketing legal and finance support. Given the growth of the business in EMEA these requests became more frequent. Dublin time was seven hours ahead of the time in Provo Utah thereby requiring extensive efforts to manage the time zone differences. Another activity was recruitment which was currently handled by a local external provider. However given the importance of recruiting the appropriate talent (and much of it in a short time period) questions arose about whether this hiring should be performed in-house. Yet doing so would require significant investment and diverting resources from building out the sales team which was ultimately the key driver for revenue generation. Questions also surrounded the scalability of an intense on-boarding program that often saw new hires spending some time in the Provo offices. Also when setting up the EMEA headquarters Qualtrics saw the value in experimenting with different country markets using small-scale efforts initially to gauge the receptiveness of various country markets to its offering. Costello and his team also had a feeling that large markets and countries that were early adopters of technology would be high-potential opportunities. They noticed that the EMEA market was generally receptive; however certain countries seemed to be easier to crack than others and Qualtrics saw early wins from its initial efforts. In addition certain countries were sensitive about data security and showed some reservation toward SaaS offerings while customers in other countries were price-sensitive and hesitant to pay price premiums. To effectively allocate resources a more selective approach was required that prioritized certain markets. This approach would allow Costello to focus resources and build sales and support teams for countries that showed the greatest potential. The issue was how to prioritize this approach to ensure the most lucrative markets were selected first (see Exhibit 3 for a list of some countries and indicators). Also certain urban areas such as London (United Kingdom) seemed particularly attractive given some significant customer wins and the presence of many large firms within a tight geographic radius. Decisions also needed to be made in relation to the company’s go-to-market approach. For example in Eastern European markets the Qualtrics pricing model positioned in the middle to upper market was perceived by many companies as uncompetitive leading to questions of adaptation. Moreover if Qualtrics envisioned larger and more complex deals with enterprise customers would it be sufficient to rely mostly on a young inside sales team or would it be worthwhile to hire more seasoned sales reps and open offices across Europe to avoid time-consuming travel between Dublin and the European locations? Last but not least retaining the entrepreneurial culture was paramount including in particular the entrepreneurial “scrappiness” and “self-service” culture that was at the heart of Qualtrics. Yet transitioning toward a multinational corporation would increase not only the scale of the business but also its internal complexity which could hamper the flexibility nimbleness and agility needed to continuously recognize and exploit opportunities. This internal complexity also raised the question of how these entrepreneurial cultural values could be deeply embedded within a rapidly growing EMEA business where structures and processes needed to be developed to grow the business and integrate a considerable number of new hires.As Ryan and Costello celebrated the opening of their new office in Dublin Costello was highly cognizant that he needed to quickly decide on and execute Qualtrics’s next steps to pave the way for delivering on the ambitious growth targets for the EMEA region.Exhibit 1: Qualtrics’s target markets Source: “Customer Experience” Qualtrics 2016 accessed January 15 2017 https://www.qualtrics.com/customer-experience/.Exhibit 2: Qualtrics’S national and international expansion Source: Created by the case authors.Exhibit 3: Country indicators for qualtrics’s expansion plans (2014)Note: GDP = gross domestic product; SaaS = software as a service; unless otherwise indicated the information indicated for this sub-region refers to the average of the included countries.Source: Created by the authors using: “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD; “World Bank Databank” The World Bank 2017 accessed January 16 2017 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG; Doing Business Understanding Regulations for Small and Medium Enterprises (Washington D.C.: World Bank) 2013 accessed January 15 2017 www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2014; “Travel Math Calculator” Travel Math accessed January 15 2017 www.travelmath.com/; information provided by Qualtrics management.Endnotes

The Regina Saskatchewan office of 190 employees had held its office Christmas party the previous Saturday and Foster smiled thinking about the evening as her computer came to life. �A lot has happened since the last Christmas party that�s for sure� she thought. �I doubt anyone at last year�s party would have believed what the company would look like one year later.�Her computer chirped as the day�s calendar loaded and displayed on the screen. �Let�s see� Foster quietly said to herself. �Holacracy circle tactical meetings at 9 a.m. 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Meeting at 3:30 p.m. with Scott McGillivray to review the Holacracy implementation status. Going to need a few minutes to get those notes together.� McGillivray iQmetrix�s chief strategy officer had returned from an annual planning weekend where the senior executives typically discussed the coming year�s priorities and expected milestones for the next 12 months. Foster knew that information about the success of the Holacracy implementation that she was leading would have been a major topic of discussion for the five senior executives running the company. �What do I need to say?� Foster reflected on this question for a moment. �They�re going to want to hear that the implementation is done and that we can move on to the next thing. And McGillivray�s going to want to know what that next thing is.� Foster turned and looked out the window at the downtown Regina landscape in the still-dark pre-dawn of the Canadian winter. �What is the next thing?�Foster began to think through her status report: �A year ago I defined the implementation process as ending when all departments and teams had completed Holacracy training key roles had all been assigned within each Holacracy circle and every circle had completed at least one tactical meeting.� A grin spread across Foster�s face reflected in the window. �Funny how that made so much sense a year ago. Are we implemented? If implementation means everyone is aware of what has happened and everyone understands what the basic process rules for Holacracy are then yes we are done and we can move on to other areas of focus. But is that the right way to think about it?�Foster mentally listed the concerns she had about stating that the implementation was complete and that the company could move on. Key areas such as compensation and employee evaluation were still being done as they had been done in the past and were not yet fully Holacratized. During implementation some situations had come up�so-called cracks in the road to Holacracy�that Foster knew she would need to fix at some point. Was the implementation actually over? That was perhaps the real question. �Well� Foster thought �I�ve got a couple hours before I need to put this all into words that make sense.�HolacracyHolacracy was an organizational design that emphasized roles and processes over people. In Holacracy the work of an organization was divided into roles that were accountable for performing explicit tasks and the roles themselves were meant to evolve freely by following explicit processes for change. According to the process rules of Holacracy all people in the organization from the chief executive officer (CEO) to the employee on the front line assumed their roles and once assumed were free to make all the decisions associated with their role and to propose changes to that role as they saw fit. In the language of Holacracy the philosophy was centred on roles not souls and self-management meant there were no manager roles.Holacracy was originally conceptualized by Brian Robertson a software entrepreneur who had started and sold three of his own companies but each time been unsatisfied with how his company had become less efficient as it grew. Robertson spent considerable time experimenting with different forms of traditional organizational designs before realizing that what he was searching for�a way to maintain autonomy flexibility and decision speed in start-up organizations as they grew larger�did not yet exist. Robertson was heavily influenced by the work of philosopher Bertrand Russell and organizational theorist Elliott Jaques. Robertson recognized that Russell who wrote that �everything is vague to a degree you do not realize until you have tried to make it precise� and Jaques who wrote that a tension always exists between the formal organizational chart structure of an organization as it might appear on paper and the structure that actually exists. Robertson�s experience with his own new ventures was that the solution to scaling the start-up culture to a larger mature organization was to create an organizational design based on simple rules for recognizing articulating and creating the tasks that needed to be accomplished and then giving people the authority to adapt their professional roles to do these tasks. This approach made the work to be done explicit and shaped people�s responsibilities to the actual needs of the organization rather than to a preconceived (and likely outdated) vision of what the organization did.Holacracy implementation at iqmetrixImplementing Holacracy at iQmetrix had begun almost a year earlier in the second week of January 2017 and had followed a phased rollout strategy whereby the circles to be included in each phase were selected according to Foster�s opinion about which areas would be most open to and willing to work through a significant change. Exhibit 1 shows the circles that were on-boarded in each of the five phases�the first phase starting in January 2017 and the last phase beginning in October 2017. With each wave Foster had hoped to learn as much as possible in the least intrusive way to iterate and improve on the Holacracy design as it unfolded and to become progressively more effective and efficient in leading employees through the implementation.In hindsight Foster recognized that this strategy was in some ways naive. The concept of changing to a new organizational form�one that was not well documented except in a book by Holacracy�s founder�was not originally expected to be intimidating or ambiguous; in fact many executive members at the time thought the company was already following several Holacratic principles. With this optimism in place Foster originally thought that implementation would be complete once the last circle was holding weekly tactical meetings. However this naive optimism proved misplaced. Shortcomings in the �let�s try this on our own we read the book� approach did not take long to surface. It took longer than anticipated for roles to be created and the circles that ended up being created tended to mimic the organizational structure that had existed prior to Holacracy implementation. As a result Foster had started looking for an implementation consultant in mid-February to assist in the process.After three weeks of searching for and screening potential consultants Foster decided on Karim Bishay an experienced Holacracy coach based just outside San Jose California. Bishay helped to plan the rollout process and participated in it thereby helping to reboot the first phase rollout and set the stage for the second phase that began in March. Each phase of rollout progressed in a similar way. Exhibit 2 shows the three-part launch process for each circle. In the first step pre-launch a survey was sent to each employee asking about their satisfaction with and attitudes toward work; the responses were intended to be used later to evaluate progress. Pre-launch training then began and consisted of a question-and-answer session with an executive and Bishay the master coach and a Holacracy 101 overview conducted in three-hour live sessions in each office�Vancouver British Columbia Regina Saskatchewan Winnipeg Manitoba and Charlotte North Carolina. Training ended with a tutorial for the online system GlassFrog which was used as the project management system for employees to track their work their roles and the work and roles of others under Holacracy. Employees who occupied lead link roles were further expected to watch a training video that outlined the specifics of their roles. In Holacracy lead links were responsible for the administrative tasks of managing each circle. In this role lead links assigned employees to particular roles; allocated resources across various projects in a circle; and established the strategies metrics and priorities for the circle. As such the lead link role was responsible for many of the administrative tasks of a manager in a typical organization.Once the pre-launch activities were complete the actual practice of Holacracy began. For almost all iQmetrix employees (iQers) their first explicit exposure to Holacracy was their first tactical meeting. Most if not all groups in the company already had regular status or progress meetings of some type so for many the tactical meetings were initially familiar at least in form. However tactical meetings in Holacracy had a specific process to follow and required people to become comfortable with learning that new process. It was not immediately comfortable for all people. Once the first meeting was complete and the next one was scheduled each circle was considered launched and check-ins between the lead links and Holacracy coaches with the master coach continued for the next three to four weeks. One month after the first tactical meeting each circle earned a check mark in Foster�s implementation schedule as having entered Holacracy. Each wave of the implementation built on the knowledge of the preceding waves to the point that by November Foster had become confident in her ability to move new circles through the process relatively smoothly compared with seven months earlier. Survey results showed that employee satisfaction satisfaction with Holacracy and beliefs that Holacracy improved the ability to get work done had gradually increased from spring to late fall. One survey question asked whether employees thought that engaging in office politics was important for getting work done; the responses indicated that iQers were becoming more political in their interactions at work. This finding was in some ways unsettling but remained one of the few negative indicators from the survey.Foster noted that what she saw as most predictive of how successful a circle would be in becoming Holacratized lay firmly in the behaviour of the people placed in lead link roles. Foster saw that when the lead link bought into Holacratic practices the implementation was much more successful. Circles that had what Foster considered to be successful implementations tended to have lead links who remained silent leaving space for others to resolve their own tensions in tactical meetings even when obvious comments or answers were apparent. Lead links displaying these behaviours tended to have been with the company for a shorter time compared with those who were more likely to speak over others during a meeting. Newer employees in the lead link role were also more likely to be excited by the prospect and potential of Holacracy leading Foster to conclude that part of the reason for implementation success was attributable to the enthusiasm shown by these lead links. Close to the end of the fourth wave Foster sought out Bishay�s opinion of how well iQmetrix was doing in the rollout. The master coach�s response aligned with her opinion of the overall status and gave her confidence that the process was working and that the others with important coach facilitating and support roles for the Holacracy implementation were getting the job done well. Bishay wrote to FosterIn my opinion this is one of the most successful implementations at this point in the process that I�ve seen. There�s little outright mutiny there�s a very solid Holacracy circle and tactical meetings are running well. There�s also a culture shift happening and people are picking up some aspects really quickly. Also on the middle and lower levels very strong circles and structures have formed that are encouraging and growing leadership on that level. I give it an A�so far and am very confident in iQ�s success with it.By mid-December the last of the circles had completed the launch process and according to Foster�s initial criteria the implementation process was over and the company did not seem to have experienced any cataclysmic repercussions. Employee turnover that year had not significantly changed from the year before. The company had 430 employees spread across 91 circles. The executive team had devolved from being one group of guys (and they were all guys) at the top of the company to having their roles distributed across multiple circles. Each employee had an average of seven individual roles such as client manager database administrator lead link software developer and product architect. Holacracy implementation looked to be complete. Or was it?evaluating the Holacracy implementationAs Foster looked back over the past year she recognized at least three potential problems in the implementation journey. Deciding whether those problems needed to be fixed and how to fix them was occupying a lot of her time. Foster understood that one of the key differences between traditional management and self-management was decision-making autonomy. Holacracy was designed to keep much of the structure of an organization but to eliminate command-and-control activities. �I wonder if it�s an unwillingness to step into the discomfort of actualized autonomy a fear about �what if I make a mistake?�� Two of the problems Foster was observing seemed related to exactly this concern. The first potential problem was apparent confusion among some in the lead link role about their true accountabilities. As described earlier the lead link was the administrator of a circle who set out the circle�s roles accountabilities strategies and metrics. However a lead link role was not accountable for the leadership and decision-making responsibilities that most people naturally associated with the role of a boss or a manager. In a typical company managers provided oversight and employees often deferred decisions upward; however in Holacracy the lead link role was not above the other roles in a circle but rather was a peer with accountabilities only for circle administration. Decisions needed to be made by the employees whose roles and accountabilities were associated with the work. Autonomy and self-management meant that employees made their own decisions and prioritized their own work using their own best judgment.In hindsight Foster came to realize that taking people who had held management positions prior to Holacracy implementation and putting them into lead link roles did not always work as planned. Some of these people turned out to be good at administration and could leave the oversight and decision-making roles to those to whom they belonged. But others had difficulty with this process instead wanting to continue making decisions in areas for which they no longer had responsibility. Two particular forms of misalignment in the lead link role had become apparent. In one the lead link took over the circle�s decision making while in the other circle members abrogated their responsibilities to a willing lead link.In the first former managers acted as though the lead link role was that of a traditional decision-making manager and not that of a circle administrator. It became common in some circles for the lead link to interrupt others in the process of presenting a problem and to begin solving what they thought the problem was. Orders from the lead link typically followed such as �What you�re describing has been an issue for a while what I want you to do is this . . . � which clearly took away the autonomy of the other circle members to present and fix their own problems. While this behaviour would not necessarily stand out in a non-Holacratic company actively managing other people and making their decisions was not a feature of Holacracy.The second type of misaligned behaviour had acquired its own name among those involved with the implementation process. So-called �mom� lead links were lead links who behaved as the active caretaker of the circle. Such administrators wanted to both administer the circle and help circle members with any and all problems they faced. Moms applied pressure to others in the circle to come to them with their problems rather than work through them on their own. Foster did not believe the motivations were necessarily malicious; in many cases the lead link felt badly about how circle members were now struggling with the additional pressure of working autonomously. Moms for example would take notes about others� problems in a meeting and then approach the person afterward to offer to help solve the problem thereby leaving the person feeling that they handled the issue well. Regardless of whether this behaviour was driven by a fundamental belief that other people would not be able to handle problems on their own or not the moms-as-lead-links contradicted the self-management philosophy of Holacracy.The third problem Foster recognized first began appearing in circles that she knew were having difficulty with the transition to Holacracy according to the post-implementation surveys and informal follow-up conversations with people throughout the company. When asking others how the Holacracy transition was going Foster heard variations of a story where some part of the company would be facing a big issue such as massive unplanned service outages or a large customer was found to have talked to a competitor. In some such cases an individual or small group would try to come up with a big overarching solution for the problem. In the past this style of hero management where people swooped in to save the day had been common at iQmetrix and had often been rewarded with promotion for those involved. What was now happening in some Holacracy circles was that in the event of a service outage for example someone would come up with a list of the top 15 reasons why an outage happened and then attempt to design a solution that addressed all 15 reasons. The next step was presenting this comprehensive solution to large groups of people. At this point the situation immediately got out of hand when it became obvious that the big solution impinged on the accountabilities of several different circles and roles in the company most of which had not been involved in creating the plan. Instead under Holacracy people with problems were expected to make small iterative changes by comparing the difference between their desired state known as the ideal state with what they were faced with at any given time and explicitly conceptualizing that gap as a tension. Tensions were then dealt with one at a time until all facets of a problem were clearly defined and addressed. In contrast hero management sought to solve problems by going straight to designing one overarching solution. Foster had already seen for herself that the all-in-one solutions tended to be so broad in scope that they left many individual tensions with compromise solutions. Moreover the people with roles directly affected by the solution would have had neither the opportunity for nor the satisfaction of solving their own part of the larger problem.Senior and influential iQers and executives were slow to stop this type of activity however and this process left many employees both confused and disillusioned about Holacracy. Most employees understood that Holacratic principles were meant to produce iterative change at the local circle level and move away from hero-managed all-encompassing solutions. However reality was not converging with this ideal in some parts of the company. A by-product of the executive practice of condoning hero behaviour was that it reinforced the beliefs of skeptics who felt Holacracy was just the next new thing that would eventually just go away. Thinking about this third problem in this way reminded Foster of the advice a former CEO had given her at a Holacracy conference in Amsterdam the previous May: to have a successful adoption of Holacracy �some people would need to be told to slow down and some would need to be told to speed up.� In other words some people would need to stop making decisions while others would need to start. Foster thought if she could get people out of the mindset of having to create overarching �super solutions� and learn instead to embrace small iterative changes as the way to solve problems then maybe she could consider the implementation period as complete.Foster had increasingly noted something interesting in her meetings with the Holacracy Implementation circle members�people who had roles as Holacracy coaches and meeting facilitators. Starting in the summer of 2017 the meeting facilitators began reporting that employees throughout the company were beginning to say things in their meetings that were supportive of the change comments such as how the Holacracy tactical meetings were actually more efficient than what they had been prior to Holacracy and that it was becoming less uncomfortable speaking up in a meeting. Foster had initially considered these reports to be encouraging and a sign that the implementation was progressing; however in the past month she had begun to have doubts. Finally as Foster started putting her notes together to report on the implementation status she initially intended to say that a positive attitude toward Holacracy was gaining momentum. What she noticed however was that all the examples she had for demonstrating progress were predominantly from tactical meetings. She had few meaningful examples of employees actually using the Holacracy philosophy and demonstrating advanced Holacratic practices in the context of everyday work. Foster�s first thought was that having examples only from meetings was because the people she had talked to were all involved in facilitating those meetings so that was where the observations would naturally be. That explanation did not last long however when she recognized that the people facilitating meetings were also in coaching roles that put them in the front lines of the organization�s circles on a daily or weekly basis. She also thought that it was perhaps a maturity issue and that people would become comfortable with the formal group processes such the tactical meetings and gradually diffuse Holacracy philosophies into the rest of their workday. Perhaps she thought but if that is the case then she would have expected to see examples of this diffusion from the first wave of implementation which had been almost a year ago and she had not. Whatever the cause it was clear that what had looked potentially promising for adopting Holacracy might actually be only a surface adoption. Foster wondered to herself: �Do people think that if they do the one-hour weekly meetings well they are doing Holacracy well? Do they think the meetings are Holacracy? Are people just going through the motions even with good intent?� The recent organizational change had been a significant shift but certainly not the only major change in the young company�s history. �Being in the tech industry means you signed up for an unpredictable environment that changes quickly� she continued �and the typical iQer is pretty resilient to all this so let�s assume that people want to go along but something is getting in the way. What could that be?�next stepsLater that day at 12:32 p.m. Foster took off her headset and locked her laptop; her 11:30 a.m. tactical meeting had completed on time. �Come on Bartlett let�s get some lunch� she called out to iQmetrix�s marketing director Tara Bartlett in the next office. �How was your morning?� Bartlett asked on the way to the elevator. �Pretty amazing actually� Foster responded. �Three hours of tactical meetings and I didn�t once feel like anyone was lost in the process. How was your morning?� �Pretty amazing too. I had a bunch of one-on-ones with the marketing managers to discuss their campaign strategies for the coming year. Lots of questions about if those were the right problems to be concerned with if other campaigns might be more important how they would know if they were done and what they needed in order to move on to the next thing� Bartlett responded. As Foster pushed the elevator button she absently thought �So interesting.

GROWTH IN AFRICAAfrica’s middle-class population tripled from fewer than 5 million in 2000 to 15 million in 2014 which contributed to an increase in disposable income. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was 5 per cent for 2013 compared with a 6 per cent growth rate in East and West Africa showing a promising economic outlook. The number of Internet users in Africa had grown by 3600 per cent from 2000 to 2012 and the penetration of mobile phones in Africa increased from 1 per cent in 2000 to 54 per cent in 2014.THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN AFRICAThe African airline industry was highly regulated by the government and companies needed to follow the rules and regulations set by their home country. In addition when airlines wanted to fly internationally they needed to adhere to the rules laid out in a bilateral air services agreement which specified additional regulations that were unique to each pair of countries.Since 2010 air transportation passenger traffic had grown at an average annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent and was projected to continue to grow at this rate until 2030. This growth rate was slightly higher than the world’s average annual growth rate of 4.8 per cent revealing a significant level of consumer demand. Africa’s international traffic had grown rapidly and the continent was predicted to be the world’s third fastest-growing region in terms of international traffic by 2015. The expansion of the airline industry had contributed to the development of new market opportunities for local African entrepreneurs and businesses. It was predicted that from 2012 to 2032 879000 new jobs would be created throughout the airline industry value chain for the African population.Despite increasing demand the African airline industry still faced several challenges related to infrastructure development. General problems of poor infrastructure in the airline industry were related to a lack of quality human and physical resources a low level of technological connectivity and the absence of adequate transit facilities.The high capital intensity in the airline industry contributed to a low average return on investment of 7.84 per cent. Furthermore the global airline industry median values in 2013 for profit margin return on equity current ratio and quick ratio were 3.10 9.30 1.50 and 0.90 respectively.COMPETITION Precision AirPrecision Air Services Plc (Precision Air) a standard airline company offered its customers quick comfortable and reliable service through the application of a customer-focused approach. Precision Air aimed “to develop and provide superior air transport services that exceeds customer expectations” and wanted “to be the airline of choice.” Its main hub was located in Dar es Salaam and it operated on a regional basis with flights to 10 destinations within and outside Tanzania.Recently Precision Air had been struggling financially and experiencing challenges in earning revenue because of Fastjet’s entrance into the industry. In 2013 Precision Air incurred a loss of TSh30 billion in revenue with gross margins of 18 per cent. In 2014 the company reduced its deficit by 60 per cent with a loss of TSh12 billion and had an increase in gross margins to 28 per cent.Precision Air had recently decreased its fleet size from nine to six aircraft and started suspending unprofitable flight routes. The company also began to offer additional training to staff who lacked the skills required to provide top-quality service. Precision Air also planned on forming more partnerships and joint ventures to increase revenues and improve its financial performance.FASTJET INTERNAL DISCUSSIONCompany BackgroundOn November 29 2012 Fastjet launched its first flight from Dar es Salaam Tanzania to Mwanza Tanzania after acquiring Fly540 a low-cost airline that operated in Tanzania Kenya Angola and Ghana. Two months later Winter was appointed chief executive officer and headquarters were established in London England. East Africa specifically Kenya or Tanzania was considered the best region to launch Fastjet. Tanzania was chosen due to the relatively new Fly540 operations in the country and the Tanzanian government’s welcoming and positive attitude. Kenya was deemed the riskier alternative due to Kenya Airways Ltd.’s considerable influence over the Kenyan government and the associated Civil Aviation Authority.Edward WinterWinter had begun his career as a pilot with British Airways. Subsequently he gained more than 40 years of industry experience both in standard airline services and with the low-cost carrier airline model. He was both the chief operating officer and a founding director of the low-cost airline Go which quickly became profitable with 28 aircrafts. After the sale of Go Winter became the chief operating officer of easyJet a U.K.-based low-cost carrier and successfully expanded easyJet’s operations into Europe. Winter had also served as the chief executive officer of the National Air Services in Saudi Arabia.Upon launching Fastjet Winter had two overarching goals for the company: to become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline and to make reliable and safe air travel accessible to all.The Low-Cost Carrier ModelAs a low-cost carrier Fastjet offered low ticket prices to customers by minimizing expenses. The airline achieved major operational savings by purchasing one type of aircraft used Airbus A319s which reduced spending on spare parts and maintenance. Furthermore Fastjet prepurchased currency and fuel to lower its operational expenses and outsourced engineering and airport passenger handling to provide expert services and to lower its start-up costs. The airline also followed strict hiring policies ensuring that all staff were “clever people” so that exceptional customer service was offered in a responsive manner. Fastjet also cross-trained employees to maximize the company’s investment in its workforce.Fastjet was a “no-frills” airline with a ticket that included just one seat and one piece of hand luggage. Extra charges were applied to any additional items such as food drinks and checked baggage. Despite this pricing scheme 40 per cent of passengers still paid for additional services of some variety.Ticket prices ranged from US$20 to US$170. The earlier a customer booked the cheaper the ticket. This pricing structure allowed Fastjet to maximize the number of purchased seats per flight. This low-cost strategy attracted passengers who had never considered flying to be an affordable option. Approximately 38 per cent of Fastjet passengers had never flown before. In the past they would have travelled far distances by bus or might not have travelled at all.Current PerformanceFastjet’s consistently full flights and high percentage of first-time flyers demonstrated strong market acceptance in Tanzania. In particular Fastjet developed a reputation for reliability and punctuality with cancellations at less than 1 per cent. Fastjet embraced technological trends by developing a highly successful m-commerce platform with M-pesa and Tigo and utilized social media platforms to effectively lower communication and marketing expenses. As a result Fastjet’s African Grey Parrot logo gained significant brand equity.In 2013 yield per passenger grew by 106 per cent from January to December and capacity had increased by 68 per cent. However despite positive feedback from customers Fastjet had continually reported operating losses since its inception (see Exhibit 1). Winter and his management team attributed Fastjet’s losses to its operations in Kenya Angola and Ghana. To free up cash Fastjet terminated operations in these countries on June 24 2014 and began solely focusing on Fastjet Tanzania.To fulfil his goal of having Fastjet become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline Winter wondered whether now was a good time to expand. Before analyzing his options he wanted to determine Fastjet’s financial position (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3).PROPOSED SOLUTIONSTo overcome Fastjet’s recent expansion challenges and financial losses Winter needed to decide whether to expand to Kenya develop a Fastjet base in Zambia or maintain the focus on domestic flights. When considering the options Winter would need to take into account how each option would align with Fastjet’s low-cost model and short-term goals and would position the airline company for long-term success.Option 1: Partnership in KenyaKenya was located north of Tanzania and had a population of 45 million. Kenya was known as Africa’s hub for financial communication and transportation services and had positive economic prospects with a gross domestic product of 4.7 per cent in 2013. As of 2014 1.2 million Kenyan passengers flew annually making Kenya the fifth-largest domestic market in Africa based on seat capacity. This information was promising for Fastjet which expected to increase air traffic by offering low-cost plane tickets to those who currently travelled long distances by bus.Jambojet Ltd. a subsidiary of Kenya Airways Ltd. had recently entered Kenya as a low-cost carrier and planned to focus solely on the domestic market. Winter saw this situation as an opportunity to access the Kenyan market by working with Jambojet Ltd. to offer connecting flights. Although this option meant Fastjet would not need to spend time developing the infrastructure for establishing a base Winter was concerned about the Kenyan government’s strong regulations in the airline industry and how Fastjet should respond.Option 2: Fastjet ZambiaZambia was located southwest of Tanzania and had a population of about 15 million. Compared with other African countries Zambia was economically and politically stable and imposed fewer airline regulations. Although Zambia had a smaller customer base Winter saw the country as offering a great opportunity for entering the market because it did not have a low-cost carrier. He had already been in discussions with the government which was supportive of Fastjet bringing low-cost flights to Zambia.To pursue this option Winter would need to purchase new planes. He was looking to source two A319 models between seven and nine years old which would cost US$40 million each. The Zambia hub would also require a US$5 million investment for marketing and development costs. The costs incurred during the first year would include salaries and wages of US$4.7 million and a fuel expense of US$1.5 million. Winter and his management team estimated that expanding to Zambia would bring in US$11.2 million in revenue in the first year.Expansion to Zambia would also require approval from South African authorities because South Africa was Zambia’s largest market accounting for 37 per cent of total international seat capacity. Although Winter had experience working with South Africa—during Fastjet’s launch in Tanzania—it had been a long and tedious process. He wanted this expansion to happen quickly and he feared he would encounter similar delays with Fastjet in Zambia. Winter wondered how he could leverage his existing relationships in South Africa to speed up the process. Winter was also concerned with the size of the market and whether it would offer enough demand to justify the costly investment in building a new base.Option 3: Focus on Growth in TanzaniaWinter wondered whether it was even a good time to expand to other countries. Although Fastjet had secured US$25 million from new investors he recognized that the group would ultimately need more capital from both institutional investors and local African partnerships to finance the expansions. Considering the 2013 profit margin for Fastjet Tanzania was around −90 per cent he wondered whether he should wait until Fastjet had positive returns before expanding elsewhere. Fastjet Tanzania had made great progress in gaining market share in Tanzania and Winter wanted to continue this growth. To stay ahead of its largest domestic competitor Precision Air Winter aimed to attract more first-time flyers and expand the airline’s market. This plan would include increasing the frequency of domestic flights and expanding domestic flight destinations. In addition he planned to improve domestic infrastructure by working with governments beginning with the Mtwara Airport in southwestern Tanzania. Investing back into the Tanzanian community would showcase strong corporate social responsibility and help Fastjet gain access to parts of Tanzania not currently serviced by air travel. DECISIONAfter analyzing Fastjet’s current position in the airline industry its recent financial performance and the alternatives Winter needed to determine whether he would be able to fulfil Fastjet’s goals. Was Fastjet ready for the next frontier?EXHIBIT 1: fastjet’s six-month INCOME STATEMENTs December 2013 to June 2014 (in US$ thousands)Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: fastjet SIX-MONTH BALANCE SHEETs December 2013 to June 2014 (in US$ thousands)Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: FASTJET SIX-MONTH CASH FLOW STATEMENTS (IN US$ THOUSANDS)Source: Company documents.ENDNOTES

YourStory was a media and technology company focused on helping build an entrepreneurial ecosystem in India by creating and disseminating news stories related to entrepreneurs. While Sharma was filled with optimism about the prospects of YourStory the discussions with the investor had made her realize that there were many challenges to be overcome. Sharma realized that YourStory had no option but to scale up its business far beyond its current size and scope and it needed to do so rapidly. Sharma mentally reviewed her current situation: YourStory has done well over the years and yet there is so much more to do. We are leaders in our niche and yet potential investors are not satisfied. They want us to grow to a much larger size. These discussions have made me question some of the key assumptions that I have always made about YourStory. I have to address the questions posed and design a comprehensive strategy to build the VCsâ confidence in YourStoryâs growth prospects and I should do so within the next couple of weeks to be ready for the next (and hopefully final) meeting for our first round of external funding.BACKGROUNDAbout YourStorySharma launched YourStory in 2008. She had worked in conventional print and television business media for a few years and understood the dynamics of that sector. Sharma remembered the path that led to her creation of YourStory:While working in the business media I realized that when conventional media companies wanted to focus on entrepreneurs they only focused on the large success stories. The smaller younger and high-potential entrepreneurial ventures were left out and received almost no attention or publicity via the conventional media channels; this was not just an Indian phenomenon but happened globally. This was the gap that YourStory focused on. I realized that the traditional media mainly limited itself to âbreaking newsâ while there were so many other interesting stories out there especially related to entrepreneurs and their ventures.Sharma explained why she had named her venture âYourStoryâ: âI firmly believe that if I celebrate your story you will celebrate my story. That thought was the origin of me naming my start-up âYourStory.ââTo keep costs low she initially worked mainly on her own. For nearly seven years she sought no external funding and managed with her own funds. Sharma ran the business frugally conserved cash in all possible ways and kept expenses low. In the first two years the venture struggled. It received nearly no revenues. At that stage the main costs were those needed for generating news content every day and retaining visibility for YourStory in the market. She recalledI had very limited funds then. I could neither hire any employees nor pay good authors on a per-story basis for content generation. That is where my . . . education and ability to write came in handy. For the first three years I was writing most of the content on my own. Keeping my costs under control helped me survive the tough years. By the time the business broke even I had only spent about â¹2 million in cumulative expenses. Things changed once we became relatively well known. By 2015 YourStory had been profitable for three years in a row.About YourStoryâs FounderIn 2003 Sharma obtained a masterâs degree in history from the prestigious St. Stephenâs College in New Delhi. She studied further to obtain a postgraduate diploma in communications management from MICA India in 2004. She worked for about two years as a brand advisor with the Times of India a leading English-language daily in India. Subsequently she switched to television journalism by joining CNBC TV18 an English-language business news channel in 2007. Within two years Sharma rose to become an assistant vice-president there. At that stage she quit her job and plunged full time into starting her entrepreneurial venture in the field of media and communications. Sharma was proud of the awards and recognition both she and YourStory had received in recent years. She statedI won the LâOrÃ©al Paris Femina online influencer award this year. Last year I was ranked among the top five women entrepreneurs in the Indian start-up ecosystem by the Economic Times. Coming from a media group that we compete with directly I especially cherish this award. I was pleased when I heard that YourStory was rated among the Top 500 LinkedIn influencers in the world in 2015. In 2013 [one of my ventures SocialStory] received the Impact Economy Innovations Grant Fund from the Rockefeller Foundation Omidyar Network and Dasra. In 2010 I received the Villgro journalist of the year award. YourStoryâs business modelOver the years YourStory had evolved into many niche businesses all related to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Its most well-known offering was YourStory an online media platform. Under the umbrella brand of YourStory was HerStory an online media offering focused specifically on women entrepreneurs. Sharma had also started SocialStory which was focused on social-sector entrepreneurs. All these brands were active in the online world. They were also used for organizing and sponsoring a variety of events and conferences to promote the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India.  YourStoryBy early 2015 YourStory had become the top-ranked media platform focused on promoting the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. Its main activity was publishing stories related to entrepreneurs and their ideas. It provided coverage to all kinds of entrepreneurs irrespective of their sector scale or stage of life. In recent years YourStory had provided a media platform to a large number of entrepreneurs in the web mobile e-commerce cloud computing social eco-friendly green and creative domains.  YourStory worked with a variety of strategic partners. First it partnered with technology giants such as Microsoft Intel Google Amazon Dell Cisco and VeriSign. The large technology companies benefited because YourStory was able to connect them with a focused audience of technology-sector entrepreneursârisk-takers who were often the first to adapt new technologies programming languages and solutions put forth by large technology giants. Feedback from the early adopter tech-entrepreneurs helped corporations such as Microsoft and Google improve their offerings before releasing them to wider audiences. YourStory charged these large companies a fee in return for allowing them access to its huge and constantly growing database of start-up companies. As a matter of principle YourStory did not charge the start-up ventures for these services.Second YourStory had developed partnerships with venture capitalists private-equity players and angel investors. Some of the big-name investors in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem that had partnered with YourStory included Sequoia Capital Operations LLC (Sequoia Capital) Accel Partners Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. These financial investors were interested in spotting potential unicorns among the crowd of new start-ups. YourStory helped bring these potential investors together with entrepreneurs.  Finally YourStory collaborated with many of the ministries and departments of the Government of India. These partnerships were important because the government aimed to promote an entrepreneurial climate and ecosystem in India. The Government of India had designed many schemes and supportive policies to help start-ups grow and prosper. YourStory disseminated information about these initiatives and helped the start-ups understand where to start and how to benefit from governmental support. Over the years YourStory had developed into an extremely strong brand in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. According to Archana Patchirajan co-founder of MyCityWay âWe really adore the way YourStory.in recognizes technology ventures. Like Mashable and TechCrunch Yourstory.in is âtheâ platform for entrepreneurs in India to showcase their dream to the world.âHerStoryHerStoryâstarted by Sharma under the umbrella of YourStoryâfocused exclusively on the stories of women entrepreneurs leaders innovators and change agents. From her own experience and keen understanding of prevalent social mores Sharma realized that women entrepreneurs found it especially tough to set up and run businesses in India. The HerStory platform gave space and an exclusive voice to stories and issues related to women entrepreneurs. Reflecting the sectors where women were actively engaged in entrepreneurship HerStory had stories and news from technology health arts crafts and social enterprises. It disseminated news related to a variety of government schemes on skill development and funding that were available exclusively to women entrepreneurs.  SocialStoryWhile YourStory provided coverage of all kinds of entrepreneurial ventures SocialStory focused on start-ups in the social and developmental sectors. The stories on SocialStory related to non-governmental organizations and social ventures in the education health environment civic responsibility clean energy culture and traditional handicrafts sectors. The platform provided visibility to entrepreneurs from these social sectors and gave those interested in social entrepreneurship a way to gain information about the people already active in that space and to collaborate with them. EventsYourStory organized many national and international events and conferences that provided networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. Its flagship events included TechSparks MobileSparks E-Sparks EduStars and WebSparks and it partnered and actively participated in entrepreneurial events organized by others. For instance YourStory was a principal partner for the Bangalore Business Literature Festival in September 2015. This event aimed to develop the culture of reading writing and publishing business literature (see Exhibit 1). Entrepreneurial ventures benefited from the knowledge sharing and networking that took place at such events and conferences. For instance Mir Abid Hussain founder of emo2 Inc. said âThank you for the opportunity to present at TechSparks. It was very useful and I connected with a good number of people for [business] development.â Potential investors also appreciated the forum as a place to meet new ventures. For instance Shailendra Singh managing director of Sequoia Capital India statedWe were very happy to partner with YourStory again this year and [always] look forward to participating at their TechSparks events. We find these events draw young enthusiastic entrepreneurs from all over the country and we thoroughly enjoy interacting with them and learning about their businesses. Sequoia Capital is strongly committed to investing in early-stage companies in India and we see this partnership with TechSparks as a wonderful initiative that keeps us connected to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country.The various awards that were given out at these events helped many start-up ventures gain credibility and further visibility. For instance the founder of Vindhya e-Infomedia Private Limited Ashok Giri D. who won a âsociopreneurshipâ award in 2010â2011 stated âThis award not only gave us recognition for the commitment that Vindhya had in its mission but also was able to open doors to many diverse opportunities like prospective customers investors and likeminded social entrepreneurs. This was one of the very few platforms exclusively for socially committed organizations.âApart from large-scale national events YourStory also regularly organized local-scale boot camps entrepreneur meet-ups workshops and other smaller networking events. These were typically shorter more focused networking and knowledge-sharing events that lasted from two hours to half a day and catered to an audience of a few hundred participants at most. YourStory succeeded in attracting sponsors for all its events and its success was dependent on conceptualizing designing and executing focused events that added value for the sponsoring companies. Sharma spent a large part of her time identifying potential sponsors understanding their needs and motivations and co-designing customized YourStory-organized events. She expended a great deal of effort in publicizing the events to the targeted group of entrepreneurial ventures.One of the challenges Sharma faced was that some of the events were organized in partnership with organizations that were direct competitors of YourStory. For example some events were organized by large print media houses such as the Times of India and Economic Times and others by business news television channels such as NDTV Profit and CNBC TV18. While these media organizations were much larger than YourStory they were also present in the online world and therefore they were in competition with YourStory. Despite the apparent contradiction Sharma realized that it was better to collaborate with these competitors on such events because everyone in the ecosystem benefited.Current statusBy June 2015 YourStory had published over 20000 stories about Indian entrepreneurs. It had reached over 60 million readers and had garnered regular readership from over 50 countries. Sharma and her team had hosted over 220 entrepreneur-related events in which over 1.7 million people had participated. YourStoryâs campaigns and networking support had helped numerous start-ups achieve funding and Sharma estimated that YourStory was directly or indirectly involved in about US$550 million of fundraising achieved by Indian start-ups. The firm reached over 4 million people daily via various channels on social media platforms. Its main sources of revenue were from tickets to its events rental fees for exhibit space at its conferences online advertisements registrations on profile pages for start-ups and premium-priced listings on the homepage. YourStory had achieved annual revenue of â¹43 million in financial year (FY) 2014-2015 compared to â¹39.6Â million in FY 2013-14. However increased employee benefit expenses managerial remuneration and other expenses had resulted in a small loss of â¹1.9 million in FY 2015 against a net profit of â¹5.2 million in the previous financial year (see Exhibits 2 and 3). According to SharmaThe YourStory platform reaches over 100 million readers every month. The company has evolved into various content-driven sub-properties managed by our in-house editorial team who work with a network of freelancers that provide us content. We are growing rapidly and seeing good traction in revenue (one of the best among new digital media companies in India). Weâre expecting US$3â$4 million in revenue over the next 12 months. We expect the native content [business-to-business] market to be around US$400 million in the next four years. The majority of the incremental spending is expected to be in digital [media]. We believe that we have a great chance of being one of the largest players in the segment with over 10 per cent market share in the near future.Cost of OperationsThroughout its existence YourStory had maintained an extremely lean setup. For the first three years Sharma had operated out of her own home and maintained only a skeletal staff. YourStoryâs main costs came from employee salaries sourcing news content marketing expenses and information technology. YourStory had grown to a team of nearly 60 employees by 2015. Most of the staff were either journalists or marketers. Employee costs were one of the biggest cost drivers for YourStory. Sharma explained:We have a team of 10 engineers with varied experience who take care of building new products and applications. Our major expense is maintaining the team (mainly salary costs). The editorial or content team is our largest team in terms of both numbers and costs. The cost of content varies from â¹200 to â¹2000 depending on the quality of the article and the influencer rating of the author. We believe that this high editorial cost is justified. We are proud of the fact that over 80â90 per cent of our content is from editorial/independent sources and therefore carries an unbiased message. Our paid-for stories are clearly marked as âsponsoredâ on the website. As such we do not have large marketing expenditure; most of the expense on this is around promoting our events. On average we spend 2â5 per cent of our revenue on marketing.The news content that YourStory presented on its online media platforms was from a variety of sources. These included news-syndication organizations such as Press Trust of India (PTI) or Reuters other news channels the journalists employed by YourStory and freelance journalists and writers. To ensure sustainable profit YourStory had to keep its content costs low especially on a per-story basis; thus it had to be extremely selective about the kind of stories it sourced and the quality of news offered. As an online media platform YourStory had to constantly upgrade and scale up its technology infrastructure and remain up to date with the latest in technology to cater to its ever-growing readership. Because readers were increasingly consuming content on mobile phones and handheld devices YourStory was forced to additionally customize its offerings to suit these needs.competitive Challenges YourStory faced direct competition from a few Indian online media platforms that focused on entrepreneurial stories. Among the prominent competitors was VC Circle Network which was acquired by News Corp in 2015. VC Circle positioned itself as a source of news and analysis on Indian entrepreneurship and followed a premium subscription model on its website. It also tracked innovations in technology; covered news stories about the infrastructure sector; provided an online database about venture-capital and private-equity deals in India; organized conferences seminars and events for entrepreneurs; and engaged in executive training and coaching. Another similar firm was Bangalore-based start-up NextBigWhat which was founded by Ashish Sinha. It positioned itself as an online community of founders of start-ups and product marketers in the Indian technology sector. YourStory also faced indirect competition from a variety of blogs where users shared stories (e.g. Wattpad and Figment) online business news sites and magazines (e.g. Businessweek and WSJ Magazine). It also competed with conferences such as TEDx and TEDGlobal and with sites such as Quora which allowed users to interact in a question-and-answer format. In addition YourStory faced some indirect competition from foreign websites like Mashable (see Exhibit 4) and TechCrunch (see Exhibit 5).Expansion optionsSharma struggled with the question of how to scale up a niche entrepreneur-oriented online media company to reach a mass user base of over 200 million users. Her challenge was to scale up the venture grow its loyal readership and gain market share in an extremely competitive and evolving media marketplace. She realized that she had many alternatives from which to choose.Going VernacularOne of the options Sharma was considering was tapping into the vernacular language market in India. This meant that the English-language stories currently being showcased on YourStory would be translated into various regional Indian languages. Sharma explained:There is reason to consider going vernacular with our services. After all the English language despite being popular in India has a limited reach. Stories in English are typically only consumed by urban educated middle- and upper-class consumers. But there is an entire other part of the vast Indian population that will remain left out if we continue to follow an English-only approach. We have the potential to expand the number of our news consumers significantly if we venture into vernacular language-based services. However [this shift represents] a costly option. First we have to consider the cost of translating our English-language stories into vernacular languages. I recently explored a few technological solutions for automated translation but the results were not entirely satisfactory. At this stage I envisage having to employ teams of translators who would translate our English-language stories into vernacular languages. Additionally there is the cost of technology to ensure that our stories are presented or rendered in a user-chosen language. Also Iâm unsure as to whether we should begin with one or two languages at first and then roll out to all the major Indian languages or go with a âbig bangâ approach on this. Our burn rate on this expansion option will depend on how many languages we choose to provide our services in.Adopting a Hyperlocal FocusYourStory was also considering the option of going âhyperlocalâ with its stories meaning its stories would not be limited to content that appealed to a wide national audience but could instead focus on local stories that appealed to smaller-sized but highly focused audiences in each geographic area. These stories would be about entrepreneurial developments taking place in a suburb city district or state. The appeal would be very strong because the stories were about people in the vicinity of the readers. However the appeal of each story would be limited to a small number of readers. It was possible that each story would only be read by a few dozen or a few hundred readers who belonged to the town or district featured in the story. Sharma described the opportunity:I find going hyperlocal very exciting. Unlike mainstream channels our hyperlocal focus would make us the preferred news outlet for local communities. I believe that people are as interested in news about the developments in their immediate vicinity as they are in larger national and global news. In fact my hunch is that hyperlocal news would have a more loyal and regular readership; this is something that would appeal to anyone funding us. Sharma realized that going hyperlocal was easier said than done. She explained: The first issue is with content. While there is a mature market for development or syndication of content related to national and global stories content for local stories is relatively scant. Also quality of content is very variable when it comes to local news. Our costsâcosts of developing content on a daily basis monitoring quality and ensuring relevance to the unique needs tastes and preferences of hundreds of local communitiesâseem like an insurmountable challenge. We currently have a team of about 60 people engaged with content-related activities. If we continue to follow our existing model we will need 10 times that number of employees to achieve a hyperlocal business. This certainly doesnât seem to be the right way to grow. I know that the market is attractive but we need to find the right business model to service it. Moving from Niche to Mass MarketAnother alternative Sharma considered was moving away from an exclusive focus on entrepreneur-related stories to become a more mainstream news player. She explained that choosing a very generic name YourStory for her business made it âpossible to expand the scope of our business beyond entrepreneurship to any kind of news.â She continued: âI have the opportunity to move in any or even all directions while leveraging the brand. I am considering making available more broad-based content related to entertainment movies and celebrity gossip.âHowever the issue was with the preferences and loyalty of YourStoryâs existing reader base. Sharma worried that going from being a niche player that was fully focused on entrepreneurial ecosystem-related stories to being a generic news site would disillusion the companyâs current consumer base. It would also dilute the YourStory brand that Sharma had built up assiduously over the years. She said âToday I am fortunate to have the goodwill and affection of a core . . . loyal audience. In trying to reach out to a wider audience I donât want to risk losing my loyal customers.â Sharma knew that for her business to scale up massively (without a linear increase in costs) she needed to source stories from users themselves. She was considering developing technology that would allow readers to contribute their stories directly to YourStory. This democratization of content would give readers the power to share their own stories easily with the rest of the world. One option was that Sharma could develop the required technology in house. Another option was to acquire a company that already had such technology available. Sharma had come across one such company: Papyrus Editor (Papyrus) founded by Gaurav Tiwari in 2012. Papyrus had developed a simple online editor that helped authors create e-books using a straightforward user interface (see Exhibit 6).Targeting Other NichesSharma stated that she was also eager to consider other niches that YourStory could expand into:We have a track record of identifying and exploiting niches profitably; we have done so many times in the past few years. I believe that there are many other niches that could be targeted. For instance one niche that I am actively exploring is that of extremely short stories. These stories would typically be three- to four-line news items that could be consumed very quickly by readers. I believe that a lot of our readers are busy people and this service is likely to appeal to them. People could read such stories while on the move or when they took a few minutesâ break from their work. Also such stories would be extremely convenient to consume on mobile and handheld devices. There are many other such niche ideas I am exploring all the time. Yet Sharma realized that targeting niches was not without its challenges adding[Going] after a niche has its challenges. If the niche is really small it will not make us much money. If the niche expands over time competitors will notice and jump in with their solutions. Entry barriers are typically low and hence profits will be affected once competition enters the scene. In general my experience has been that targeting niches has kept the work environment at YourStory very start-up like. We are always in a project mode going after one niche or another. While that has been exciting it can also be very stressful.Focusing on Start-Up JobsAnother idea that Sharma was toying with was to start an online job portal focused on openings in start-up organizations. Because YourStory already regularly interacted with a large number of start-ups Sharma believed that they would be willing to share their job openings on the YourStory portal. She was banking on YourStoryâs goodwill and strong brand to kick-start this new business. She explained: I am hoping that our vast network of contacts in the start-up ecosystem will be useful for the online job portal. Jobseekers know us from our website and from our technology events. That we are focused on start-ups is well known in the market. Jobseekers could look to us as their first choice of information when they are looking for a job with a start-up company in India.  However Sharma was not entirely confident about venturing into a job portal because this was very different from her news-oriented business. Further there were already many different online job portals in India such as Naukri.com and Monster.in. The online job portal business was extremely competitive and would require YourStory to develop entirely new organizational capabilities. ConclusionSharma had to make some quick and decisive moves. Having previously been part of many entrepreneurâVC conversations Sharma realized that the possibility of massively scaling up was what attracted VCs the most especially in the online media and technology space. Growing organically and at a relatively steady pace as YourStory had for the last seven years was not enough; nor was it enough to grow only by grabbing opportunities as they came upâinvestors were looking for proof of a big-picture strategic plan. It was important that Sharma be in control of her businessâs direction. It was equally if not more important to appear to be in control of where YourStory was headed in the coming few years. Sharma was confident about being in the right industry and poised for rapid growth. At the same time she understood that potential investors would translate their initial interest into actual investments only if she was able to demonstrate that YourStory had a coherent comprehensive and consistent story of its own.Exhibit 1: YourStory Meet-ups in MayâJune 2015Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Yourstory Profit and Loss account (in â¹)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = â¹63.88 on July 31 2015.Source: YourStory financial returns (Form AOC-4-031215) filed with the Registrar of Companies Ministry of Corporate Affairs Government of India.Exhibit 3: Yourstory Balance Sheet (in â¹)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = â¹63.88 on July 31 2015.Source: YourStory financial returns (Form AOC-4-031215) filed with the Registrar of Companies Ministry of Corporate Affairs Government of India.Exhibit 4: Profile of Mashable Inc.Source: Created by the case authors based on content from âAboutâ Mashable accessed September 4 2016 http://mashable.com/about; Michael Dunlop âInterview with Pete Cashmore Founder of Mashable.comâ Retire@21 accessed September 4 2016 www.retireat21.com/interview/interview-with-pete-cashmore-founder-of-mashable-dot-com; and âMashable Overviewâ CrunchBase accessed September 4 2016 www.crunchbase.com/organization/mashable#/entity.Exhibit 5: Profile of TechCrunchSource: Created by the case authors based on content from âAbout TechCrunchâ TechCrunch accessed September 4 2016 https://techcrunch.com/about/#about-tc.Exhibit 6: profile of Papyrus editorSource: Created by the case authors based on content from Team YS âYourStory Media acquires e-book creator Papyrus Editorâ November 30 2015 accessed August 1 2017 https://yourstory.com/2015/11/yourstory-acquires-papyrus-editor/; and Disha Sharma âYourStory Acquires e-Book Publisher Papyrus Editorâ accessed September 4 2016 www.vccircle.com/news/media-entertainment/2015/12/01/yourstory-acquires-ebook-publisher-papyrus-editor.

By 2008 ECCAâs two runways required an estimated CA$10 million in capital upgrades and $35 million in additional maintenance costs over the next 10 years. In light of these facts city council had begun to consider whether maintaining ECCA was feasible or if other alternatives would put the land to better use.If ECCA closed city council foresaw multiple prospective uses for the land. For instance Edmonton was experiencing an exponential population growth rate and an anticipated need to supply additional housing for 150000 citizens by 2019 (see Exhibit 2). This population increase would further support trending suburban development which presented a significant financial concern; for every $1 spent on suburban development the City of Edmonton had to invest an estimated $0.80 towards the development of corresponding infrastructure. These combined factors made the 536-acre ECCA land a hot topic citywide and a main focus for city council.In November 2011 city council asked Mark Hall City of Edmonton Land Director to explore various opportunities for the land. The alternatives available for consideration were maintaining ECCA and the status quo by completing the necessary repairs; selling the property to a real estate developer thereby generating immediate revenue for other City of Edmonton projects; or closing ECCA and the City of Edmonton would act as the land developer for a community project.KEY STAKEHOLDERSEdmonton City CouncilAt the time of the ECCA decision-making process Steven Mandel was approaching his last term as the mayor of Edmonton. City of Edmontonâs Land Director Mark HallHall had worked for the City of Edmonton in diverse roles over many years. At the time of the ECCA dilemma he served in the corporate properties branch and was thus aware of ECCA discussions and debates. With Hallâs assistance the city councillors hoped to find a clear and sustainable solution to the challenges presented by ECCA.HISTORY OF EDMONTON CITY CENTRE AIRPORT (ECCA)Throughout its 80-year history ECCA had held as many names as it had roles: The Hagmann Farm Jimmy Bellâs Air Harbour Blatchford Field #2 Air Observer School Royal Canadian Air Force Western Air Command Industrial Airport and Municipal Airport. In 1926 the Edmonton and Northern Alberta Aero Club received a $400 grant to transform a patch of farmland into a runway by cutting down willow bushes and packing down soil. Officially declared an âAir Harbourâ this site saw the first trained pilots graduate from the site in 1927. Two years later Edmontonâs city council authorized $35000 of expenditures for the airfield and Blatchford Field was born. Named after Keith Alexander (âKennyâ) Blatchford who was mayor of Edmonton from 1924 to 1926 and later a member of parliament Blatchford Field became Canadaâs first licensed airfield.During the next 35 years the airport played an important role in commercial and military aviation serving not only the Edmonton region but also destinations within Canada and the United States. In the 1950s however a new generation of larger aircraft required longer runways which a space-confined ECCA could not accommodate. Thus the search began for another airfield site in the Edmonton region. The airport was supposed to be closed in 1963 when EIA was completed. However due to active political opposition based on the ECCAâs historical importance and the value that it held in being located near to downtown the airfield was saved. The airfield operated under different names and mandates with perhaps one of the most important mandates being its role in providing MedEvac services. In 1995 the citizens of Edmonton voted 77 per cent in favour of consolidating scheduled air traffic at EIA and keeping ECCA open to general and corporate traffic. HISTORY OF EDMONTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTPrior to 1955 Edmontonâs primary aviation hub was the airfield north of downtown ECCA which housed a flight school and a military airfield. As Edmonton grew however and because industrial and residential neighbourhoods hemmed in ECCA the city required more land to house a larger-scale airport. By 1955 it was obvious that ECCA was inadequate for the innovative jet airliners which would need two-mile runways and spacious terminals to accommodate over 100 passengers with each flight. A site for EIA was selected near Nisku Alberta and Transport Canada purchased 7600 acres of land for a total cost of $1469657. With an unwritten âgentlemanâs agreementâ the original landowners were allowed to lease back and continue to farm the land until it was needed for further development of the airport. EIA remained Canadaâs largest airport in land area with more than half of its land still under cultivation.EIA had always competed with ECCA. EIA advocates had long desired to expand its network of international destinations. However because of the success and profitability of ECCA in creating convenient business air travel in downtown Edmonton Canadian authorities refused EIAâs expansion due to insufficient revenues and a lack of clear growth strategies. ECCAâs niche market was in direct competition with EIAâs regional travel options and growth plans which led to an enduring dispute between EIA and ECCA.In 1995 however there was overwhelming public support to close ECCA. Fuelled by this public support EIA began the development of a $450 million construction project to upgrade its facilities in anticipation of what it perceived as the inevitable shutdown of ECCA. Expansion plans for the airport included a new terminal for international flights a new site for Air Canada a repurposing of the existing Air Canada terminal for WestJet Airlines Ltd. to accommodate the rapid growth of its regional travel program additional security and screening infrastructure and a new cargo management facility.Although air travel at EIA decreased significantly between the late 1980s and the early 1990s demand increased in the late 1990s. Despite having been constructed to support 2.8 million passengers EIA was actually accommodating nearly 3.8 million passengers. This imposed urgency for the completion of the expansion project. In 2009 EIA anticipated that it was only a matter of time until city council voted to shut down ECCA. The shutdown would require EIA to absorb the entirety of Edmontonâs regional business travel further justifying EIAâs expansion for international travel and large facility upgrades.EDMONTONâS LAND DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRYAt the same time that news travelled about ECCAâs necessary renovation costs and its potential closure land developers had also anticipated Edmontonâs next great real estate opportunity. Following the financial crisis of 2008 a lengthy recession depressed the real estate market into a difficult period marked by value losses increased foreclosures and reduced rental property revenues. The economic downturn combined with an opportunity to develop over 500 acres of land near the downtown core provided land developers with the potential for a large-scale project that could infuse citizens with optimism for the future. With the anticipated first wave of millennials entering the workforce industry experts were predicting a flood of young adults into the city core to live closer to work and to enjoy their preferred downtown lifestyle.It was rumoured that key stakeholders in Edmonton land development including Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. Yorkton Group International Inc. and Melcor Developments Ltd. were submitting large proposals to the City of Edmonton to purchase the entire ECCA land site for redevelopment purposes. One land developer in particular The Katz Group was well known for innovative large-scale projects. Therefore selling the land was a viable proposition for city council to consider.The Katz Group headquartered in Edmonton was one of Canadaâs largest privately owned enterprises. As well as being a successful real estate and land developer also owned diverse businesses including pharmacies and sports and entertainment facilities. Founder and chairman Daryl Katz was a well-known and well-liked local celebrity. The Katz family had made its first fortune in the pharmacy industry owning and operating over 475 drugstore locations across central and western Canada. The Katz Group also owned the cityâs National Hockey League (NHL) team the Edmonton Oilers. With Edmonton being home to the third-oldest arena in the NHL Katz had also planned to build a new arena in the downtown core. With a vision to create a legacy in Edmonton and with plans to rebuild the downtown core and make the city an international icon Katz was an ideal candidate to undertake a major land development project like ECCA.SWEDISH SUSTAINABILITY MODELIn other parts of the world sustainability had been explored with different models of implementation and with differing degrees of success over the years. Sweden a globally acclaimed proponent of sustainable land development was one such example. Following Swedenâs economic boom in the 1990s a strong demand for housing led to a strategy to build inwards rather than outwards. The innovative Scandinavian country thus raised the bar for northern-climate cities with large-scale redevelopments and integrated approaches to harvesting and reusing resources. If successfully completed these ambitious commitments to produce local renewable energy and to reduce energy consumption would produce leading-edge communities that would attract international visitors eager to witness the ground-breaking sustainable initiatives first-hand.Sweden completed the first phase of a 395-acre redevelopment of a harbour-front brownfield site in the city of MalmÃ¶. VÃ¤stra Hamnen (âWestern Harbourâ) an industrial waterfront zone was planned to be fully redeveloped to house 10000 residents and to support a total of 30000 people who would either work or study in the area. The urban development plan included a large expansion of MalmÃ¶ University featured a seaside park and hosted a mobility centre that offered bicycle parking and bio-fuelled cars. Outdoor energy-efficient lighting and accessible public transportation encouraged people to walk and enjoy the boardwalk and public artworks. The area was intended to become Europeâs first carbon-neutral district and to serve as a global example of a sustainable city. Thus VÃ¤stra Hamnen also became known as âThe City of Tomorrow.âDevelopers submitted bids to the city of MalmÃ¶ and of the many applicants more than 20 were chosen to build in VÃ¤stra Hamnen. Selection was based on contractorsâ abilities to meet the goals of the large-scale project: sustainable housing powered by renewable energy attractive and affordable housing and a revitalized brownfield site for economic growth. The successful candidates signed The Quality Programme which listed contract guidelines for building with minimal environmental impact.The housing plan was dense (approximately 20 units per acre) and strategically placed to maximize efficiency. High-rises along the shoreline formed a wind shelter around smaller blocks and courtyards. Most units featured windows and mirrors predominantly as a way to maximize the use of natural light and passive solar energy. Natural materials and energy-efficient or water-saving appliances were also emphasized. Green rooftops captured rainwater for gardens and insulation and rooftop solar panels were used to heat the buildings and provide electricity to the district system.Ecologically the development included a local district energy system powered entirely by renewable energy sourcesâa combination of wind solar heat from seawater and biogas. Electricity was generated by solar and wind energy and hot-water heating was sourced from seawater and solar energy. Buildings were heated and cooled by an aquifer energy storage system that stored heat extracted from seawater. In the summer warm water filled cavities in the limestone underground and cold stored water was pumped up for usage in the district cooling system. In winter a heat pump increased the water temperature. A geothermal system was used to heat and cool the water.The automated waste system had separate receptacles for garbage organic waste and recyclables that connected to an underground pipeline system. Receptacles both inside buildings and outdoors sucked these through an underground pipeline system that ended at a central storage area for municipal waste truck pickup. At the time waste materials were composted but plans for a pre-treatment plant included turning organic waste into biogas to generate electricity and vehicle fuel. However at the time of the project development costs were much higher than anticipated due to the new technologies to meet these high standards and the slowdown in the housing market. Consequently the developmentâs estimated rental costs were $2000 per month for a 1000-square-foot unit compared with $1500 for similarly sized units elsewhere. Offsetting the price difference at least partially was an expectation of 25 per cent lower energy costs in addition to longer building lifespans expected to support higher resale values. FINANCIAL BACKGROUNDThe City of Edmonton located in oil-rich Alberta depended on the strength of the oil market for a significant portion of its economy. At the time of the ECCA decision a financial recession in the United States had dropped the price of oil from a record peak of $147.27 per barrel in July 2008 to less than $60 per barrel in subsequent months leaving the future of Albertaâs oil revenues in a highly uncertain state. For its capital budget the City of Edmonton was dependent on both provincial grants and property tax revenues that were tied to the real estate market and the economy. While most Canadian cities including Edmonton had survived prior shocks to the real estate market the job market and local economy were forecast not to remain resilient if oil prices remained depressed.Financial Comparison of AlternativesCity council faced several financial implications regarding what to do with the large area of prime ECCA land located near downtown Edmonton. Upholding the status quo and maintaining ECCA operations was an attractive option because the city would not be placed in a controversial situation. However maintaining ECCA would come at a steep cost because the city would need to invest tens of millions of capital dollars in the infrastructure over the next few years. Additionally opportunity costs were associated with keeping the airport operational particularly because downtown buildings were restricted in height due to the Airport Protection Overlay a set of regulations that constricted downtown development. Furthermore ECCA was operating a breakeven cost model and was not expected to ever become profitable given its small and restricted scale.The prospect of closing the airport left the city with two primary options: to sell or to develop the land. An immediate sale of the land was expected to generate approximately $250 million. Moreover interested buyers who were more than qualified as potential developers had unofficially approached various councillors and administrators. Therefore the city could plan the sale of the land dispose of the land systematically in a short period of time and expect revenue all within a short timeframe of a year or two. Given the uncertain economic environment in 2011 such a significant cash flow would bolster the city treasury or be used for other much-needed projects that had been postponed due to a lack of financing.A third option existed which was a staged development of the land that would provide residences for over 30000 people. This option however required a significant cash outlay upfront. The cash inflows from sales were expected to occur over 20 to 25 years in an effort by the city to avoid flooding the local market with homes. The investment option would thus be long-term and the city would hold the investment risk which would be subject to unforeseeable real estate demand and price fluctuations.Yet another consideration was the adding of a sustainability dimension to the development plan. This dimension however would involve a cost premium due to both the new technology and the limited number of builders able to commit to such a novel concept. Because consumer demand for a sustainable neighbourhood was unknown the city would here again be left managing the risk.One financial advantage to an infill development (using ECCA land for residential purposes) was a reduction in operating costs because an infill development would be cheaper to service than an expanded suburban development. If the city could divert 30000 residents from new suburbs to the downtown area the reduced need for additional infrastructure development over time would decrease overall operating costs such as snow clearing garbage collection and road maintenance.MOVING FORWARDIn 2008 an interesting factor arose that influenced decision making related to the ECCA development. The City of Edmonton developed âThe Way Aheadâ (see Exhibit 3) a document that proposed Edmontonâs strategic vision over the next 40 years as well as its strategic goals for the next 10 years. âThe Way Aheadâ contributed significantly to city councilâs mind-set for overall municipality decision making. In contemplating the sustainability of ECCA land in particular the projectâs decision making needed to consider the goals of âThe Way Aheadâ document.Although no official offer to purchase ECCA land had been considered by council potential buyers did exist and the expected sale price of the complete parcel would be approximately $250 million. If council pursued this option the immediate and long-term financial impact of the sale on the cityâs budget would be extraordinary for its population of one million. Situated in downtown Edmonton ECCA land could for example be used for a world-class development that could support the co-existence of commercial and residential lifestyles simultaneously. This multi-purpose development could promote many economic benefits such as job creation and increased tourism revenues. This option would also silence the critics of city development as many development industry experts believed that the city was either unqualified or should not be competing with land developers. In 2009 on behalf of ECCA stakeholders the Canadian Business Aviation Association released a report outlining future plans for ECCA and the reasons why ECCA should be maintained as an operational airport. Within this report were plans to reduce noise and light pollution and increase revenues by garnering corporate business interest in utilizing the airport for northern flights to Albertaâs oil sands. Additional plans included the development of a âMayo Clinic of the Northââa healthcare concept intended to create a national centre of excellence for healthcare services in Canada. While these clinic plans alone were promising the persuasive voices arguing to keep ECCAâs MedEvac Services intact presented city council with an ethical dilemma. If MedEvac Services were to be transferred to EIA the increase in patient transportation times to Edmontonâs major hospitals would be dramatically increased. As documented in a report regarding MedEvac Services some of Edmontonâs highest-ranking medical officials wrote letters to city council expressing their opposition to the closure of ECCA. These letters were inspired by the sensitive timely nature of medical care required for MedEvac Servicesâ patients. Between 2006 and 2008 ECCA accommodated an average of 3867 MedEvac Services flights per year of which approximately 350 were deemed âtime criticalâ (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Although it was difficult to estimate some officials believed that between five and eight more patients would die each year should MedEvac Services be moved to EIA.Ultimately the future of ECCA land would be determined by city council which recognized in this situation an immense opportunity for environmental leadership. Hall believed that a plan needed to be formulated that would inspire Edmontonians to seek a brighter future for the city. After months of research and feedback Hall had created a vision for the cityâs future and was ready to make a clear recommendation to city council so it too would deliver a strong future for the ECCA land.EXHIBIT 1: Location of Edmonton City Centre AirportSource: Created by the authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 2: Expected Population Growth of the City of EdmontonSource: Created by authors using data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 3: City of Edmontonâs 10-Year Strategy: âThe Way AheadâSource: City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 4: MedEvac Servicesâ Transport TimesAverage Transport Times from ECCA to Edmontonâs Major HospitalsAverage Transport Times from EIA to Edmontonâs Major HospitalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 5: ECCA MedEvac Services Traffic 2006â2008Total MedEvac Traffic Using ECCA2008 Fixed-Wing and Rotary TotalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.

Ford announced that it would recall more than one million vehicles worldwide as a result of faulty airbags that had failed to deploy upon collision causing multiple deaths. It turned out that Ford had been aware of these faulty airbags but had not taken proactive measures to mitigate potential damage. This information was uncovered by the U.S. regulators who were investigating the multiple deaths in Ford vehicles. Because of the investigation Fordâs share price dropped from US$13.10 to US$12.18 per share on January 17 2018. Smith was trying to anticipate the future of Ford as the holding of the Ford equity represented a significant portion of his investment portfolios. Investors had already started contacting him about the future of the company and the state of their investments. Smith anticipated that given the recent announcement Fordâs share value would drop drastically so he needed to act fast to mitigate the loss of value for his investors. Smith wondered whether Ford could recover from this disaster in the long term and whether its product safety would continue to be an issue and negatively affect its shareholders. While exploring different companies as potential places to reinvest the money Smith wanted to remain in the automotive industry to maintain the portfoliosâ diversification. He had thus explored other companies such as Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) General Motors Company (GM) and Honda Motor Company Ltd. (Honda) as possible alternatives to Ford. FORD MOTOR COMPANYFord Motor Company headquartered in Dearborn Michigan was an American multinational automobile manufacturer founded by Henry Ford in 1903. It was the second-largest automobile manufacturer based in the United States and employed approximately 202000 workers worldwide. The company had been publicly incorporated since 1956; however the Ford family continued to retain 40 per cent of its voting rights. Ford sold automobiles under the Ford brand while its luxury automobiles were sold under the Lincoln brand. Ford specialized in large-scale manufacturing by using an industrial workforce. It had incorporated moving assembly lines into its plant operations and used modern economic and social systems to facilitate mass production. This method of production became known as Fordism and was widely applied to improve productivity within the industry. In addition Ford aimed to maintain a lean inventory by adopting just-in-time inventory management. INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONSGlobal automotive sales had increased by 5.6 per cent in 2016. Asian-Pacific markets had seen the highest growth and volume of automotive sales in 2016. The key contributor to the increase in sales was the Chinese market given its high double-digit growth. In North America the United States had seen a growth rate of 0.4 per cent in 2016 with 17.55 million cars soldâa record number.  It was good news for the shrinking industry in the United States. The slowly improving economy and the increasing demand for trucks and SUVs seemed to finally turn the business around at least for the time being. Global automotive unit sales continued to grow and reached 86.05 million units in 2017. The growth rate of the global automotive industry was expected to be about 3 per cent annually in 2017 and 2018. Sales of electric cars were expected to take up a larger share of the overall market with most of the growth coming from China and Europe. Overall the 2017 year-end conditions were positive with both global and domestic conditions showing improvements. Analysts and consumers expected these positive trends to continue into the near future. The World Bank forecasted global economic growth to increase to 3.1 per cent with advanced economies expected to grow at a more conservative 2.9 per cent. Overall consumer confidence increased; however this consumer confidence was accompanied with the risk of overinflated asset prices and heightened equity prices. The auto manufacturing industry had seen a trend toward electrification and digitalization solutions. In addition autonomous driving was just becoming another key trend expected to continue into the long-term future. In both technologies Tesla Inc. had been a market leader but other major players were also ramping up their investments by partnering with non-traditional technology companies to introduce new car models powered by new technologies. In January 2018 Ford pledged to spend $11 billion on electric cars by 2022 which doubled its original investment estimate. Regional start-ups were also entering the electric vehicle market spurred by the $2 billion that had been invested in these start-up companies. The share of diesel engines in Europe was declining and expected to continue shrinking due to tightening regulations. Besides Europe countries across the world including major markets such as China and India were planning to introduce bans and regulations on diesel cars. As a result automotive companies saw a rise in environmental regulations increasing their overall costs while the increasing cost of fuel had reduced the demand for fuel-engine cars. THE ALTERNATIVESSmith and his team identified Fordâs main competitors to be GM Toyota and Honda. These companies competed directly with Ford and thus represented viable alternatives to the Ford stock. GM was an American multinational corporation headquartered in Detroitâs Renaissance Center. The company designed manufactured and distributed vehicles and vehicle parts and was the second-largest automobile manufacturer in the world and the largest in the United States. GM had a strong position in the U.S. automotive market. The companyâs best-known auto brands were Cadillac Chevrolet GMC Holden and Wuling. Toyota the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world was a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota Japan. Toyota was by far the worldâs leader in the sales of hybrid electric vehicles having successfully applied its mass-production strategy to its line of hybrid electric vehicles. According to Toyota 80 per cent of Toyota cars sold in 1998 were still on the road.  Honda was a Japanese public multinational conglomerate corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles aircraft motorcycles and power equipment. Since 1959 Honda had been the worldâs largest motorcycle manufacturer. Furthermore Honda was the worldâs largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume. In 2013 Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter to the United States. THE ANALYSISThe team at Uria Investment had all of the information available to make their decision. They had the comparative financial informationâbalance sheets (see Exhibit 1) income statements (see Exhibit 2) and statements of cash flow (see Exhibit 3)âfor the four companies as well as the financial ratios (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Smith had also reviewed Fordâs stock price and was taking into consideration analyst forecasts for the stock price as compared with its competitors (see Exhibits 6 and 7). Fordâs stock had fluctuated slightly during 2017 but the closing stock price was within the same range as at the beginning of the year. When Smith initially invested in Ford he believed it would translate into long-term growth and profits for his clients. However as he analyzed the situation Smith was unsure whether Ford could recover from the numerous safety scandals while simultaneously catching up to competitors in terms of innovation.

Cleghorn the chair of the board of directors for one of Canadaâs oldest railway companies Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) received a rather blunt e-mail from Bill Ackman the chief executive officer (CEO) of CPâs largest shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing). In the e-mail in which Ackman stated that âwar is also not inevitableâ Ackman demanded that Cleghorn provide Pershing with two seats on the board of directors and approve the hiring of a new CEO of Ackmanâs choosing. Cleghornâs uncertainty about how to respond to Ackmanâs request was documented in the email he had sent to Ackman that day: âThank you for your email and for your phone message. Let me reiterate that we would like to reach an agreement which advances the best interests of the company. As you will appreciate I will be discussing your email with my board.â Whatever decision Cleghorn made it had to be in the best interests of shareholders.âHISTORY OF CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAYThe Early DaysCP was one of Canadaâs most recognized companies with a history that dated back to the late 1800s. As part of Canadaâs Confederation in 1867 the provinces that joined were promised a transcontinental railway to physically link them with the other provinces from east to west. The railroadâs early construction was fraught with controversy and politics until a group of Scottish-Canadian businessmen formed a viable syndicate and incorporated the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPRC) in 1881. Despite some continued building struggles the last spike of the railroad was driven into the ground in Craigellachie British Columbia in 1885 and the first transcontinental train departed on June 28 1886.Throughout the early 1900s CPRC expanded its business into land sales telegraph lines locomotive construction and steamships and served as the primary transportation network during World War II. The company also focused on expanding its rail network through acquisitions particularly in the United States through the Soo Line in the Midwest and the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Northeast. By 1986 CPRC was Canadaâs second-largest company with CA$15 billion in revenue.The Modern RailroadIn 2001 the five subsidiaries created through various acquisitions by CPRC were spun into separate companies leaving CP as an independent public company. The following decade witnessed continued expansion through track re-building renewing locomotive fleets modernizing information technology systems and focusing on railroad safety; however CP also faced significant challenges during this time. The company was often the focus of takeover rumours including a widely reported rejection of a takeover inquiry from a private equity group led by Brookfield Asset Management in 2007. The company also suffered during the economic recession; in 2009 CP reported operating income of $830 million reflecting a 20 per cent drop from 2008 levels. This decline was primarily due to lower traffic volumes decreasing fuel prices and a drop in both the freight rates and the average length of haul of coal exports. In 2011 severe weather and flooding caused significant train disruptions resulting in an over 13 per cent decline in year-over-year operating income. CP was committed to executing its multi-year plan which aimed to drive volume growth expand network capacity and control costs. See Exhibit 1 for a summary of CPâs key financials for 2007â2011.By 2012 the company had grown to over 16000 employees operating in six provinces and 13 U.S. states across 14700 miles of railway track. The railway transported a wide range of goods including industrial and automotive products food and agricultural products forest products and energy/wind energy products. Customer shipments were handled either through traditional transloading or through the use of intermodal containers depending on customer needs and preferences. The transportation of unit trains (i.e. a shipment of multiple cars containing a single product) was considered more efficient and less complex than mixed-load trains which had to make multiple stops and switch cars in and out of the train. As a result mixed-load trains required more complex scheduling and labour utilization. Bulk products transported primarily by unit trains represented approximately 44 per cent of CPâs total revenues in 2012 with the remainder requiring mixed-train planning and execution.the north american railroad INDUSTRYPrior to the invention of the automobile rail networks represented the sole means of long-distance travel. As such railway operations in North America received significant political attention and continued to be viewed as an essential form of infrastructure.The United StatesThe railroad industry in the United States had faced significant regulation since its origins in the early 1800s. The Interstate Commerce Commission was formed in 1880 to limit the exercise of monopoly power by local rail companies and stabilize the industry through the regulation of freight rates formations and consolidations and service levels. Unfortunately the growth in regulation and resulting pace of approval stifled the industry leading to financial crises and numerous firm bankruptcies from 1960â1980. In 1980 the industry was revolutionized by the Staggers Rail Act which eliminated regulatory control of freight rates in the United States. Canadian firms were forced to respond to the resulting competitive pricing pressure given their significant rail network within the United States.CanadaUnlike in the United States which from 1980 onwards was struggling with industry consolidation in Canada with extensive mergers and acquisitions starting after the repeal of the Staggers Rail Act in early 1980 and gathering momentum in the late 1990s two key players dominated the railroad industry: CP and Canadian National Railway (CN). While rationalization of the rail network in Canada was limited by various regulatory restrictions the effects of regulation were not as severe as the effects of regulations in the United States. The Canadian Transport Commission which was responsible for adjudication and safety regulation was disbanded in 1988 and its functions divided among various new bodies significantly âderegulatingâ the industry and allowing competitive forces to prevail. The Canadian and U.S. rail industries began to merge into a broad North American industry with acquisitions in the 2000s given the significant cross-border assets and alliances between firms. The industry was heavily concentrated with the seven largest Class I freight railroads accounting for 69 per cent of freight rail mileage 90 per cent of employees and 94 per cent of revenues. This concentration prompted governments on both sides of the border to maintain the regulation of anti-competitive railroad conduct. Noteworthy was that CN had made significant acquisitions in the United States and had evolved as a north/south railroad network largely through a major acquisition of the Illinois Central Railroad providing access to Chicago and points south and west; in contrast in 2011 CP had largely focused on a Canadian railroad networkâan east/west network.Canadian National Railway CompanyCN was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government to assume responsibility for a number of small railroads on the brink of collapse. As a Crown corporation CN received government subsidies to support its operationsâan action that was the topic of significant political debate. CN posted deficits from its inception up to the late 1970s which the government absorbed as part of its budget. The company began to rise to profitability after 1978 by divesting non-core freight rail assets including hotels airlines and telecommunication companies. Following deregulation CN abandoned unprofitable rail lines it had been forced to absorb through prior government policies. In 1995 the government initiated the largest privatization in Canadian history at the time by selling all of its CN shares under the CN Commercialization Act. The Act specified that the companyâs headquarters must remain in Montreal Quebec and that no individual or corporation could own more than 15 per cent of CNâs shares. In 1998 CN purchased the Illinois Central Railroad shifting its focus from solely an eastâwest Canadian link to a northâsouth North American railway. The company also embraced âprecision railroadingâ which focused on stringent train scheduling to reduce terminal dwell time and improve asset utilization. For CN this strategy produced industry-leading operating ratios and on-time performance.By 2012 network rationalization focused expansion and operational improvements had transformed CN into a $9 billion company with over 23000 employees making it the largest railroad in Canada. Its focus on precision railroading contributed to a significant decline in the companyâs operating ratio from 75.3 per cent in 1998 to 63.5 per cent by the end of 2011. See Exhibit 2 for a summary of CNâs key financials for 2007â2011.CPâs MANAGEMENT TEAM and board governanceManagement TeamIn 2006 CP announced the retirement of CEO Robert Ritchie after an 11-year term and appointed the then chief operating officer (COO) Fred Green as the new CEO. Green had joined CP in 1978 and had progressed through the organization by assuming roles in operations marketing and sales. He had also served as an officer or director of many of CPRCâs former subsidiaries. In the six years since Greenâs appointment the remainder of CPâs management team had been described as a revolving door with three different chief financial officers and five different COOs. Board of DirectorsCPâs board of directorsâ mandate disclosed that âthe Board is responsible for CPâs long-term strategic direction succession plans for senior officers and risk management oversight.â At the end of 2011 CPâs board of directors consisted of 15 members including current and former CEOs of publicly traded companies railway industry veterans and political leaders (see Exhibit 3). For example board members included the former or current CEOs of some of Canadaâs largest companies such as the Royal Bank of Canada Suncor Energy and Shell Canada Limited. In addition one-third of board members had been appointed Officers of the Order of Canada.The CP board was considered long-tenured with 60 per cent of members having served on the board longer than five years. In December 2011 the board appointed two railroad industry veterans as directors: Tony Ingram the former COO of the CSX Corporation and Ed Harris the former COO of CP. Board governance documents indicated that the board could consist of no fewer than five members and no more than 20 members.canadian corporate governance and shareholder activismCorporate GovernanceA companyâs board of directors was charged with the overall governance and stewardship of the organization and directors were appointed to act in the best interests of shareholders. By virtue of corporate and securities laws shareholders of a corporation had the right to vote on a range of issues affecting the corporation including the appointment of directors appointment of auditors and approval of certain fundamental changes or transactions. When organizations sought approval from shareholders on various proposals they engaged in a process termed proxy solicitation to gather votes in advance of the annual general meeting of shareholders. Shareholders typically voted on these proposals by appointing another party to vote on matters on their behalf (a âproxyâ) in order to streamline the process. The proposals were detailed within the companyâs proxy circular which included the relevant information required by shareholders in order to make an informed vote.âDissidentâ shareholders who wished to challenge management and propose alternative agendas could do so by engaging in a âproxy contestâ to solicit votes from shareholders in their favour. In Canada any shareholder with more than a 5 per cent share ownership of a certain voting class of a companyâs equity could call a shareholder meeting and solicit proxies in support of their agenda. Reporting Beneficial OwnershipShareholders acquiring 10 per cent or more of a voting class of a Canadian companyâs equity were required by the Securities Act to issue a press release announcing the acquisition and to file an âearly warningâ report within two days. Similarly U.S. securities legislation required that shareholders file a Schedule 13D within 10 days of acquiring more than 5 per cent of a voting class of a companyâs equity while also reporting the transaction and providing a rationale for the acquisition. In Canada shareholders were not required to disclose their intentions with respect to the ownership creating potential uncertainty and unwelcome âsurprisesâ for the company.The Rise of Shareholder ActivismActivist shareholders could be defined generally as investors who purchased a large stake in a publicly traded organization with the intent to enact changes and realize a profit on the investment. The first notable wave of shareholder activism began in the United States in the 1980s with so-called âcorporate raidersâ taking advantage of depressed share prices and undervalued assets. By the early 1990s companies had responded by introducing takeover defense mechanisms such as poison pills and golden parachutes resulting in a decline in takeover activity.Given the concentration of institutional investor share ownership among many Canadian companies the level of shareholder activism in Canada paled in comparison to activities at U.S. organizations. Canadian institutional investors typically communicated displeasure by selling shares rather than initiating conflict. Notwithstanding shareholder activism in Canada had gained traction in recent years as evidenced by the increasing number of proxy battles launched against Canadian companies. Approximately 101 proxy contests were completed in the five-year period ending December 31 2012 representing an 84 per cent increase over the 55 contests completed in the prior five-year period. This growth in shareholder activism and proxy contests in Canada could be partially attributed to activist-friendly legislation introduced in 2008 allowing eligible shareholders to solicit proxies without issuing a proxy circular. As such shareholders could solicit proxies by simply issuing a press release or public announcement at any time prior to the proxy submission deadline (which could be as late as the eve of a shareholdersâ meeting).bill ackman and pershing square capital MANAGEMENTWilliam (Bill) Ackman graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1992. Upon graduation he teamed up with Harvard classmate David Berkowitz to launch a hedge fund called Gotham Partners. With a passion for investing and US$3 million in start-up capital the fund achieved significant success throughout the next six years with annual returns of up to 40 per cent. Although the fund began by investing in relatively conservative opportunities the pair became increasingly speculative and ran into trouble in the early 2000s. A highly leveraged investment in a money-losing golf course combined with a probe into improper conduct by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forced the fund to wind down operations and sell off its assets in 2002.Unfettered by the failure of Gotham Partners Ackman launched a new hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing) in 2004. Pershing was described as a research-intensive fundamental value investor typically focusing on long-term large-cap and mid-cap companies. The fundâs style combined value investing and activist approaches to drive company share prices and improve fund performance. The bulk of Pershingâs portfolio was fairly concentrated with the majority invested in consumer goods and consumer services businesses.Over the next few years Ackman garnered significant media attention by engaging in activist behaviour âthat is investing in companies and aggressively pursuing changes such as shifts in strategy or changes in management. In many cases he succeeded in driving changes at his targeted companies with limited effort; however not every activist investment made by Pershing proceeded according to plan. In 2007 Pershing established the âPershing Square IVâ fund and invested $2 billion in shares of retail giant Target Corporation in order to enact changes in strategy and increase the share price. Although the company had partially implemented some of Pershingâs strategic recommendations Pershingâs investment had fallen by 90 per cent by 2009 which Ackman described as one of the greatest disappointments of his career. When the company rejected further proposals by Ackman he launched a proxy battle to appoint himself and four others to the board of directors; however his bid was rejected by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Of the 24 companies Pershing had targeted for active investment Target Corporation was only the second proxy battle initiated by Ackman (see Exhibit 4).By 2012 Pershing had grown to over $11 billion in assets under management and employed 51 people. Since its inception Pershing had delivered more than a 20 per cent annual compound rate of return to investors approximately 90 per cent of which was generated based on activist plays.A Stake in CP RailOn October 28 2011 Pershing filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating that it had acquired 12.2 per cent of CPâs outstanding shares at an approximate cost of $1.07 billion. The filing also indicated that Pershingâs intent was to âengage in discussions with management the board other stockholders of [CP] and other relevant parties concerning the business management operations assets capitalization financial condition governance strategy and future plans of [CP].â The acquisition made Pershing the largest single shareholder of CP shares.In response to the filing Cleghorn issued a memo to all CP employees on October 31 stating âAs with others CP is open to the views of its shareholders. We will speak with Pershing Square to hear their input into our plan already targeted at realizing greater efficiency and improved service reliability.âinitial correspondence and pershing square requestsAfter some initial phone calls Ackman and Cleghorn decided to meet on November 2 2011 to discuss Pershingâs investment objectives. During this meeting Ackman focused heavily on CPâs past performanceâspecifically the firmâs operating ratio. CPâs operating ratio was notably higher than most other Class I freight railroads and had been trending upward during Greenâs tenure. By the end of 2011 CPâs operating ratio was the worst among its key competitors. Ackman asserted that the operating ratio could be reduced to the mid-60s by 2015 but only if a change in leadership occurred. Further Ackman proposed that existing CEO Green be replaced by Hunter Harrison the retired CEO of CPâs Canadian rival CN. At the time Cleghorn indicated that the board supported Green and CPâs existing strategy and the two parties closed the meeting with limited resolution. Over subsequent communications in the days that followed it became apparent that Ackman had two primary objectives: install Hunter Harrison as CEO and secure two seats on CPâs board of directors.Hunter HarrisonHunter Harrison had had an extensive career in the railway industry beginning in 1964 as a carman-oiler for the St. LouisâSan Francisco Railway. The Burlington Northern Railroad acquired the railway in 1980 and Harrison quickly progressed through the organization to the executive ranks. He was appointed CEO of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1993 and COO of CN when it acquired the Illinois Central Railroad in 1998. In 2003 he was appointed CEO of CN and remained in the position until his retirement on December 31 2009. During his career Harrison was named Railroader of the Year (2002 Railway Age) CEO of the Year (2007 Report on Business) Railroad Innovator (2009 Progressive Railroading) and International Executive of the Year (2009 Canadian Chamber of Commerce).As part of his previous employment contract with CN Harrison was bound by non-compete and non-solicitation agreements expiring December 31 2011. In addition his retirement and pension arrangements separately prohibited him from competing with CN until the end of 2014. Notwithstanding Ackman was adamant that Harrison was the only candidate who could improve CPâs performance and help the company achieve its operating objectives.Request for Board SeatsOn November 4 2011 Ackman contacted Cleghorn requesting that the board provide Pershing with two seats on the board for him and a business partner Paul Hilal. The board agreed to interview Ackman for a board seat but declined to consider Hilal given his lack of railway industry experience. This rationale was given despite a lack of railway experience among CPâs board members at the time. Following Ackmanâs interview the board extended him an offer to join the board; however Ackman subsequently refused the offer due to a âstandstillâ agreement he was being asked to sign. On December 13 2011 Pershing filed another Schedule 13D indicating that it had acquired further shares of CP bringing its total holdings to 14.2 per cent of CPâs shares outstanding.Canadian pacific goes publicOn December 30 2011 The Globe and Mail newspaper published an article titled âCPâs Activist Investor Eyes Former CN CEO Mr. Hunter Harrison.â The article represented the first public declaration of intent by Pershing to have Green replaced. In response to the article Cleghorn publicized a letter addressed to Ackman on January 3 2012 to reiterate the boardâs commitment to Green and the companyâs existing strategic plan. He refuted any rumours that the board was considering meeting with Harrison and emphasized the boardâs commitment to engaging in continued dialogue with Pershing (see Exhibit 5).Pershing square fires backThe following day Ackman released his own public letter addressed to Cleghorn countering the statements made by Cleghorn in his earlier letter. Specifically Ackman asserted that Cleghorn had indicated that there was interest in meeting with Harrison that the board was âforcingâ Ackman to sign an exceptional contract in exchange for a seat on the board and that Pershing did have a strong plan to improve CPâs operating performance. He closed by urging Cleghorn to meet with Harrison and board candidate Hilal as soon as possible (see Exhibit 5).Early the following morning Cleghorn received an e-mail from Ackman titled âWar and Peaceâ in which Ackman reiterated previous comments and provided an ultimatum: accede to his requests or Pershing would launch a proxy contest at the next shareholdersâ meeting. As part of this contest Pershing was prepared to âtake the largest public hall available and make a presentation to shareholders and the public about management and board failure over the past 10 years at CP.â His e-mail closed with a not-so-subtle threat: âLetâs avoid having a border skirmish turn into a nuclear winter. Life is too short.â The set of emails between Cleghorn and Ackman were fully reproduced by The Globe and Mail in its article of January 16 2012. What came across in the emails was a sense of heightened emotions between Cleghorn and Ackman.planning his next moveCleghorn was faced with a dilemma. On the one hand he could view the e-mail as an unfounded attack on the company one that he needed to defend vigorously. On the other hand he could view Ackmanâs recommendations as having additional merit and as warranting more in-depth investigation. There were three potential courses of action. The choice made by Cleghorn and his board would be driven by their having to act in a manner consistent with the Canadian Business Corporations Actâto act in the best interests of the corporation. Taking such an action would be a clear expression that the board viewed their role as fiduciary agents of the corporation.Agree to Ackmanâs ProposalOne way to end the issue was to offer Ackman and Hilal two seats on the board (removing the standstill agreement) and commit to replacing Green with Harrison. If Cleghorn were to determine this was the optimal solution then he was faced with how he would recommend these changes to the remaining board members and whether there was a business case to remove Green from the position of CEO. If he agreed to these changes what else would Ackman push for once he was appointed as a board member? Was opening the doors to Ackman without certainty of his voting intentions the beginning of future boardroom battles?Ignore Ackman and Maintain Existing StrategyWith a careful reading of the email exchange between Cleghorn and Ackman it is reasonable to suggest that Cleghorn might consider that Ackman was bullying the board by using threats. Cleghorn based on his most recent upbeat annual presentation to shareholders demonstrated confidence in the companyâs current strategic direction; thus the question he had to consider was whether Ackman had a clear plan to implement the changes he sought. The company was a blue-chip Canadian company with a long and illustrious history and hedge funds such as Pershing had to date largely ignored the Canadian marketplace. Therefore a question that the board should consider was whether Ackman would give up the battle if Cleghorn and the board did not respond to this e-mail or what other measures might be necessary to end his advances. Should Cleghorn return to the media and employ a tactic based on preserving Canadian firms to largely Canadian owners and encourage other shareholders to push back against Ackman? Perhaps strength in numbers was all that was needed.Continue NegotiationsAlthough recent conversations between Cleghorn and Ackman had been made public one of the possibilities for Cleghorn in deciding the best course of action was to continue negotiating privately with Ackman in the hopes of swaying his opinion or at the very least reaching some form of compromise. What would be best for the corporation? Should Cleghorn on behalf of the board offer Ackman some other arrangement to appease his interests while maintaining the stability of CPâs current management team?With the knowledge that he should act in the best interests of shareholders and that Pershing was CPâs largest shareholder Cleghorn had to confront the challenge of determining how to prioritize these competing interests. With Ackmanâs escalating threats and a shareholdersâ meeting expected to occur in the next few months time was not on Cleghornâs side and he needed to resolve this matter quickly.Exhibit 1: Canadian Pacific railway KEy Financial Data (2009â2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 2: Canadian National railway KEy financial data (2009â2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Note: * Not strictly comparable to Canadian Pacific Railway.Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 3: Selected CP Board of Directors Biographies (as at december 31 2011)John E.

(Netflix) was faced with another round of skeptical business press as he attempted to grow his firm in 2017. His 1990s start-up business plan which had introduced the market to the convenience of home delivery of DVDs through the mail had eviscerated the prior market leader Blockbuster LLC (Blockbuster) forcing it to divest itself of thousands of brick-and-mortar video rental stores before finally falling into bankruptcy. Hastings was so successful that Fortune magazine named him its 2010 âBusinessperson of the Year.â This meteoric rise however seemed a distant memory as Netflix focused on its transition to the digital delivery of video content. Digital delivery required mastering new technologies and created the need to acquire or create popular content. Numerous competitors including both established mainstream content producers and digital upstarts were making it difficult for Netflix to recreate its earlier dominant success. The business press had become critical of Netflixâs slowing acquisition of subscribers and its accelerating levels of debt which had reached US$3.4 billion by March 2017.Netflix was faced with the challenge of determining where and how quickly it would invest its capital in order to continue its growth. Though the company had had early success in creating new exclusive content (e.g. television series House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black) this apparent invincibility appeared to be fading as more recent shows (e.g. The Get Down Iron Fist) had been panned by the critics. As Netflix faced increasing competition to acquire exclusive content some of which came from companies with a long history of success in content development both the cost and the risk of failure seemed to be rising. In addition former content suppliers that had previously licensed content to Netflix now viewed Netflix more warily given its growth and apparent ambition to become more than just a delivery platform. Future deals would undoubtedly be more expensive if agreement could even be reached at all. Should Netflix continue to try to be a content producer competing with Hollywoodâs industry leaders? Should it form a partnership with another media company or companies to align everyoneâs incentives? Should it consider moving into other media content areas outside of traditional entertainment? Further there remained the question of how to treat its legacy DVD-by-mail business a former cash cow that had been the subject of controversy both in the market and internally at Netflix. Would the best choice be to sell the franchise and cash out? Netflix needed to decide where when and how to invest so as to ensure its future lest it suffer the same fate as Blockbuster.BACKGROUND: VIDEO RENTAL STORES AND THE RISE OF BLOCKBUSTERTo better understand Netflixâs situation it is useful to understand the industry that existed before it entered the marketplace. Although Sony Corporation (Sony) developed its Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR) in 1976 for U.S. consumers the key development in the growth of home video entertainment was a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court 5â4 decision that found that the Betamax did not violate copyright laws. This was followed by Congress affirming the copyright lawâs âfirst saleâ doctrine and refusing to pass a law proposed by Hollywood studios that would have forbidden the renting or re-selling of movie videotapes. In short order the focus of VCR users shifted from recording broadcast shows onto blank tapes to buying or renting pre-recorded media. The video rental industry in which VCR owners could rent tapes with video content (e.g. movies) was initially dominated by a variety of independent stores that had sprung up quickly in neighbourhoods everywhere. In 1985 David Cook opened the first Blockbuster store in Dallas Texas. Blockbuster brought to the industry an aggressive strategy based on multiple stores and a central database that connected them. These data allowed Blockbuster to more accurately forecast demand for videos and its emerging economies of scale kept its costs lower than that of its competition. By opening stores larger than those run by mom-and-pop operators Blockbuster could offer customers more choices and more copies of popular movies. By 1993 Blockbuster had grown to over 3400 stores an accomplishment it achieved despite some hesitancy by the movie studios which preferred the higher margins on individual consumer sales via outlets like Best Buy rather than the smaller margins available from Blockbusterâs rentals. NETFLIXâS DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION Netflix Knocks Off BlockbusterNetflix lore noted that Hastingsâs desire to found Netflix started with a $40 Blockbuster late fee that he incurred in 1997. As motivating as that might have been the shift from bulky VHS videotapes to slimmer more durable DVDs was also necessary to make a mail-order model feasible. One limitation for Netflix in 1997 was that DVD players were new and expensive and therefore had limited U.S. household adoption. Blockbuster continued its growth of brick-and-mortar stores and also began integrating DVDs into its inventory. In 1999 Netflix hired Ted Sarandos from Blockbuster competitor West Coast Video and he focused on the content side of the business. Rapid growth in U.S. DVD adoption helped both firmsâhalf of all U.S. households owned a DVD player by 2003 and over 80 per cent of households adopted this technology within the first nine years of its introduction. This adoption rate was even faster than that for VCRs which had taken 13 years to reach the same level.Netflixâs pricing evolved from a traditional fee per rental just as in video stores to a monthly subscription model at first limited to a fixed number of DVDs then later evolving into a $20/month price for unlimited rentals. Significantly Netflix had no late feesâcustomers could watch their rentals at their convenience whereas late fees were Blockbusterâs primary revenue source. Netflix also touted the convenience of shopping by mail eliminating both the trip to the store to rent a title and the trip to return it. However Netflix found it challenging to provide an adequate number of high-demand titles to its customers. Its solution was to be an early developer and exploiter of database personalization using a customerâs past rental history to suggest other titles they might like. Though keyed from past rental history the recommendation system was also biased towards titles that Netflix actually had in stock and therefore allowed Netflix to fulfill a greater percentage of orders. In addition its relatively centralized inventory permitted it to stock a greater variety of titles which Blockbuster with its inventory scattered across thousands of individual retail locations could not easily support. Netflix developed good relationships with DVD suppliers who saw it as another outlet for their product and as a hedge against the growing near-monopsonist Blockbuster. Netflix also worked closely on advanced integration with the U.S. Postal Service becoming one of its biggest customers. In 2000 Netflix with its 300000 subscribers was still not profitable. Meanwhile DVD-player adoption had helped fuel Blockbusterâs growth to some 7700 stores. Hastings who earlier in his career had started but later sold the company Pure Software had reported that in 2000 he engaged in negotiations with Blockbuster to sell it interest in Netflix for $50 million: âWe offered to sell a 49-per-cent stake and take the name Blockbuster.comâ he said but Blockbuster was not interested.Blockbuster would attempt to copy Netflix with an online service in 2004 hoping to leverage the availability of its brick-and-mortar stores with the mail-order option and keep the operations integrated. It was ultimately unsuccessful with its online offering however as were other contemporaneous imitators such as Wal-Mart. Netflix grew from 4.2 million subscribers in 2005 to 15 million in 2010 (see Exhibit 2). Although Blockbuster still had 47 million registered customers its eventual demise seemed apparent. Netflix had more than doubled to 32 million subscribers by November of 2013âthe month that Blockbuster announced it was going out of business. NETFLIX FACES DIGITAL DELIVERYWhat Is Digital Delivery?Information goods (i.e. any good that could be represented digitally) could be delivered over a communication network such as the Internet. Initially early Internet content was limited to lower-volume content such as text and then later images and music. Video content with its relatively large file sizes tended to be limited to physical media such as film videotape and discs. However with advances in both network speeds and compression algorithms to deliver content with greater fidelity using less data other options emerged.Traditionally the first step in digital delivery was via downloaded content such as Apple iPod users downloading the complete file of any music they purchased from the iTunes online store. These files were stored on the userâs device and could be played repeatedly thus mimicking physical media such as vinyl records audio tapes and music compact discs which consumers were used to purchasing and owning. Streaming content on the other hand was content that was played on the consumerâs device but stored on a different deviceâtypically a server operated by the content owner or licensee. Streaming required a network connection between the two devices in order to play the content. In this way it more closely resembled listening to music on the radio where the listener needed to have a connection to the content (similar to radio frequency reception) as opposed to owning local copies. Because video typically required much more data than music streaming video required a faster network connection in order to provide a reasonable viewing experience. As a consequence some content owners developed lower-resolution versions of their files in order to reduce their size which then allowed them to stream the content. This also avoided the problem of allowing consumers to possess a digital copy of their content which could potentially be shared or resold. Furthermore the very large file sizes of full movies acted as a partial deterrent to digital piracy (as did law enforcement efforts such as the 2012 closure of the popular website Megaupload). Netflix initially thought the future of digital video delivery would be downloading not streaming. It created a dedicated device (that later was sold and became the Roku box) for this purpose but eventually developed a standalone streaming service which was released as âWatch Instantlyâ in 2008. Early attempts at streaming were low quality and in any event most potential customers did not have the required Internet bandwidth. However seeing the potential of streaming in 2011 Netflix made what would be seen as an ill-fated too-early commitment to the digital delivery model when it announced a decision to split itself between its traditional DVD business (to be re-named âQwiksterâ) and an uncoupled streaming business which required separate customer logins. As it was to be operated as two separate companies with no bundled discounts for those seeking both DVD rentals and streaming availability the new pricing model would mean a 60 per cent effective price hike for existing subscribers who wanted to continue both service types. Predictably the announcement was met with a loss of 800000 subscribers and Netflixâs stock price fell 77 per cent. Although Netflix reversed the decision a month later considerable damage had been done.  This public relations disaster fed into a variety of contemporaneous pessimistic predictions about Netflixâs future. One noted that Netflix shares were in âfree fallâ after the third-quarter mishaps and projected future losses. Another said âcustomers wasted little time in jumping ship.â Despite these misgivings Netflix recovered and continued to grow after 2011 increasing its subscriber count from 23.5 million to over 93 million by the end of 2016 a compound annual growth rate of 32 per cent. REED HASTINGSâS DECISION POINTSDigital Delivery ChallengesRegardless of the mode or degree of digital delivery adoption digital delivery presented Netflix with significant challenges in terms of streaming content acquisition. This was not a problem in the DVD-by-mail delivery model as DVDs could be acquired from distributors and then rented. However acquiring streaming content was both riskier and more expensive.First licensing content was subject to the terms dictated by the content owner. Netflix learned this lesson early on when its original streaming contract with the Starz network expired. Starz would not renew the contract on terms acceptable to Netflix leaving Netflix with a hole in its available inventory. Second the home entertainment market was a very crowded one with 12 streaming competitors to Netflix that had each surpassed 1 million subscribers. One significant competitor was Hulu founded by The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and 21st Century Fox (Fox) in 2007 and later joined by the DisneyâABC Television Group and Time Warner Inc. It operated on a subscription model but also offered advertisement-supported options. Fox streamed content 24 hours a day through Hulu in some cases even bypassing its local affiliates. As of July 2017 Hulu had the greatest viewer engagement of all streaming services measured at 2.9 hours per day (versus Netflixâs 2.2 hours per day) and its content included the shows Casual and The Handmaidâs Tale. Another streaming competitor was Amazon Prime Video. Amazon initially offered its Amazon Prime Video service as a bonus for subscribers to its fee-based Prime membership service. Doing so provided the video streaming service a large number of subscribers at launch. Further the service benefited from Amazonâs financial power and multiple lines of business (e.g. Amazon Web Services). Amazon spent more than $100 million on content in the third quarter of 2014 alone and its portfolio included the television series Transparent and The Man in the High Castle. In addition its Fire TV platform grew with each device it sold (see Exhibit 3 for additional details).Traditional web giants that competed with Netflix included both Google LLC/YouTube LLC (YouTube) and Facebook Inc. (Facebook). While 75 per cent of U.S. Wi-Fi households had a Netflix subscription YouTube had quickly grown into second place in 2017 with 53 per cent penetration and reached more of the coveted 18â34-year-old demographic than any cable network. Its content included the series Escape the Night. Facebook late to the sector had also announced plans to offer new proprietary content and tried to make up for its late start by offering Hollywood studios better terms for their content including sharing advertising revenue and data on viewership the latter of which was an important asset that had distinguished the success of digital platforms such as Netflix. Of course Netflix also competed with traditional home entertainment outlets including Home Box Office (HBO) and Sling TV Dishâs live TV service. HBO had an extensive library of shows to watch on demand via cable and it had an app (HBO Go). It had a large number of subscribers and a strong extended track record of developing very popular original content such as television series The Sopranos and Game of Thrones. Sling TV although it had fewer subscribers than Netflix in 2017 had viewers who were more engaged averaging 47 viewing hours per month versus Netflixâs 28 hours per month.Many of these competitors fell into the category of âcoopetitionâ to Netflix a term that suggests co-operation between competing companies. Netflix licensed content from some of the same companies that formed Hulu but at the same time provided a competing service. Further it relied on companies like Sony which had its own streaming service to carry the Netflix app on Sonyâs PlayStation videogame consoles. Lastly Netflix relied on the availability of bandwidth from cable companies to provide its services to customers; many of these same cable companies (e.g. Comcast Time Warner Inc.) were also content producers with an interest in streaming services and with which Netflix competed.Major news outlets such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix was seen as a rival to firms from which it had previously licensed content and that therefore deals were being cut back. The Wall Street Journal wrote â[Netflix] must keep things cordial with Hollywoodâs traditional studios . . . [and] prevent them from turning to its main competitors Amazon and Hulu.â  It only had the one source of revenue but in its new market it was competing with firms that had much more diverse portfolios and revenue streams.For example if Netflix wanted to acquire some popular new show it most likely would have to borrow money from the bank; if Amazon wanted to acquire it it could borrow money from the Amazon Web Services division (of which somewhat ironically Netflix was a customer). Apple Inc. another financially powerful competitor with $260 billion in cash in 2017 was also investing in content creation most recently poaching two senior executives from Sony TV.As an alternative to licensing third-party content in 2013 Netflix ventured into developing its own original content. It started out with a âhome runâ when it acquired House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey which went on to win three Emmys. Given its lack of a track record at the time Netflix needed to commit to buying the entire season of the show without the option of declining after a pilot episode as traditional media outlets usually required. It also did well with Orange Is the New Black a popular series based on a book as well as the 1980s-style adventure series Stranger Things. However and to illustrate the risks a more recent effort Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny was widely regarded as a flop and Netflix found itself increasingly cancelling original series that did not produce sufficient returns such as Sense8 and The Get Down.In addition there were significant sums at risk in these ventures. Netflix budgeted $6 billion in 2017 for contentâmore than twice its total revenue. This level of spending resulted in $3.4 billion in long-term debt. Critics said that its debt was such that it must continue to add more subscribers just to feed the business model or everything could come crashing down. Whereas Netflixâs streaming content obligations were approximately equal to its revenue in 2011 by 2017 a significant gap had emerged.In-House Competition; the Challenge of IncumbencyOne consistent challenge confronted by all successful organizations facing significant technological change was the allure of their existing incumbent line of business. This took several forms including financial investment in the existing capital infrastructure organizational investment in skills and routines and the risk associated with moving away from a consistent well-understood source of cash flow. Author Joshua Gans termed this challenge âsupply side disruptionâ about which drawing on the academic research of Rebecca Henderson he saidDemand side disruption involves an established firm missing a certain kind of technological opportunity but supply side disruption arises when an established firm becomes incapable of taking advantage of a technological opportunity. Specifically when a new competing innovation involves a distinct set of architectural knowledge established firms that have focus on being âbest in breedâ in terms of component innovation may find it difficult to integrate and build on the new architecture.At Netflix those responsible for the legacy business had successfully argued for its re-investment. The finely tuned industrial-engineered manual process of opening and stuffing the trademark red mailing envelopes was replaced by special-purpose robots that could process 3400 envelopes per hour versus the 680 per hour processed the prior labour-intensive way. This enabled Netflix to reduce the number of distribution centres from 50 to 33. These efficiencies resulted in cutting 75 per cent of its labour costs while retaining a high degree of customer serviceâ92 per cent of its customers received next-day delivery service. Competitors also continued to see promise in the DVD format as Redbox with its trademark automated kiosk vending machines grew from about 100 locations in 2004 to 34000 by 2012. One argument for continued investment in the legacy business was that as recently as August 2015 fewer than half of all U.S. homes had high-speed broadband service and it could be expected that the currently un-served lower-population-density areas might be without this service for the foreseeable future. This lack of connectivity contributed to the continued success of brick-and-mortar video rental stores in these areas. This primarily rural phenomenon in the United States could presage markets in international locations with limited broadband that might also continue to support the DVD format. And when it temporarily split off its DVD business in 2011 Netflix lost a number of its own senior managers.On the other hand Netflix did not face the sort of business cannibalization challenges often faced by traditional media businesses with the advent of a disruptive technology. Netflix for example did not face the loss of advertising revenue as a result of a shift to streaming delivery a potentially significant problem for some of its competitors. Further despite its increased internal efficiencies its traditional DVD-based business faced other costs such as its dependence on the U.S. Postal Service which had recently resulted in a $100-million increase in mailing rates.  Uncertain Future Public PoliciesââNet Neutralityâ and Its Variants In 2003 Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu coined the term ânet neutralityâ to describe a government regulatory principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source without favouring or blocking particular products or websites. It gained in visibility as Internet traffic became more and more concentrated over time with Wired magazine reporting in 2014 that half of all Internet traffic originated from just 30 organizations including Google LLC Facebook and Netflix. The policy required that ISPs not discriminate (e.g. âthrottling backâ throughput speeds) or charge differentially by user content website platform application type of attached equipment or mode of communication. This controversial policy tended to find favour with Internet firms especially those that generated a lot of traffic like Netflix. It tended to be opposed by ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon which argued that by limiting their decision rights the effect of the regulation would be to reduce investment in broadband network services and therefore to stifle innovation. In 2015 the Democratic Party administration in the United States enacted the rules into law effectively making broadband firms âcommon carriersâ like the telephone network. In 2017 the Republican Party administration scaled back the regulation. Netflix similar to other Internet firms originally lobbied for net neutrality as streaming video required significant amounts of bandwidth and limiting ISPsâ ability to differentially charge for this service effectively subsidized the Internet firmsâ activities. By 2017 at least publicly Hastings argued that it was no longer especially important. However the uncertainty about the regulation and its future added risk to any decision-making in the digital delivery market. In addition as the telecommunications sector of the economy grew and prospered it became an attractive area for lawmakers to target for new taxes. In 2017 Canadian legislators proposed but did not pass a 5 per cent tax on broadband charges dubbed by the press the âNetflix tax.â These monies would have been redistributed to traditional communications firms like newspapers that were adversely affected by the rise of the Internet. Traditional media firms lost revenue due to the Internetâparticularly classified advertising but also subscription revenueâas some of their customers shifted use to their Internet equivalents. If broadband revenue would be ultimately subject to additional taxes this could decrease demand for it and thereby hamper the growth of Netflix-like streaming services.HASTINGSâS DECISIONSHastings faced a significant number of business decisions and despite Netflixâs successes he was self-critical and was often quoted as admitting to having made a number of at least in hindsight poor decisions in relation to the technology and home entertainment industries. These included online advertisements on the website starting an independent film production company and buying DVDs out of the Sundance Film Festival (which turned out to offer limited profitability) in addition to the 2011 Qwikster gaffe. In addition he had initially believed that the future would be digital downloading rather than digital streaming and in 2009 Hastings said that there would still be DVDs in 2030 a prediction that looked increasingly unlikely. However despite some of these missteps Netflix was positioned to compete with some of the biggest firms in both entertainment and consumer technology. Hastings himself noted that historically firms facing disruption such as AOL Inc. and the Eastman Kodak Company failed because they were too cautious. But which non-cautious path should Netflix take? Should it continue to create its own content or revert back to being a neutral platform? Should it look to form exclusive contracts with content providers and/or hardware manufacturers to âlock inâ its customers? Did it need to acquire competitors and/or upstream or downstream partners? What was the appropriate role for the legacy DVD divisionâshould it continue to be operated as a cash cow for as long as it was economically viable or should it be sold off so as to reinvest the funds in current operations? Or was it finally time as suggested by analysts who argued the firm was over-valued to sell the company and cash out while it had a high market capitalization?  Exhibit 1: CHRISTENSENâS DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION CONCEPT Harvard Business Schoolâs Clayton Christensen has authored a number of books and articles defining and illustrating what he terms âdisruptive innovationsâ which are new products or services that re-make whole industries generally at the expense of the incumbent firm. This occurs because the incumbent firm does not recognize the threat posed by the innovation due to two main reasons. First the disruptive innovation possesses a different package of performance attributes not all of which are valued by existing customers; therefore the incumbentâs current customers do not initially find it attractive. Second the performance attributes of the innovation that existing customers do value which are often weak in the innovation improve at such a rapid rate that the new entrant can later move up and capture the incumbentâs existing customers.Disruptive innovators typically either enter at the low end of the market or create entirely new markets. Both of these scenarios are characterized as markets not well served by current solutions. Incumbents therefore have a tendency not to take serious notice of the innovation because either they are not losing current customers to it or when they are they are customers who buy low-margin products. Losing such customers has the paradoxical effect of increasing the incumbentâs average margin thus improving its bottom line. As such the financial signals that incumbents receive create Christensenâs âdilemmaâ whereby incumbent firms often do not recognize the threat. In addition incumbents often have difficulty adopting disruptive innovations themselves because as these innovations initially serve the existing customers poorly to adopt them could mean the loss of existing revenues through cannibalization. Conversely new entrants have no current customers to lose removing any hesitation to invest in the innovation.Source: Clayton Christensen The Innovatorâs Dilemma (New York NY: Harper Business 2001).Exhibit 2: Netflix Subscriber Growth (millions) Over TimeSource: âNetflix Subscribers from 2001 to 2011 (in 1000)â Statista accessed November 12 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/272551/subscribers-of-netflix-since-2001/; Jeff Dunn âHereâs How Huge Netflix Has Gotten in the Past Decadeâ Business Insider January 19 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/netflix-subscribers-chart-2017-1.Exhibit 3: Netflix and its Competitors 2017Exhibit 3 (continued)Note: n/a = not available1 âMovie/TV Show Countsâ JustWatch accessed July 1 2017 www.justwatch.com.2 Mark Fahey âNetflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Dealâ CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html.3 Seth Fiegerman âNetflix Nears 100 Million Subscribersâ CNN April 17 2017 accessed July 2017 http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/17/technology/netflix-subscribers/index.html.4 âNumber of Netflix Streaming Subscribers in the United States from 3rd Quarter 2011 to 2nd Quarter 2017 (in Millions)â Statista accessed July 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us.5 Mark Fahey âNetflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Dealâ CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html. 6 Stephanie Pandolph and Jonathan Camhi âAmazon Prime Subscribers Hit 80 Millionâ Business Insider April 27 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-subscribers-hit-80-million-2017-4.

It was 4:00 p.m. on a Tuesday which meant that it was almost time to meet with his executive leadership team. The atmosphere at the head office was always light and easy-going and playing with his dog in the office always seemed to help MacLean mull over strategic business issues. His latest struggle was fraught with opportunity and riskâhe was considering stretching ECL beyond its regional identity.In 2013 MacLean founded ECL a Nova Scotia-based apparel company that sold a range of products from T-shirts and hoodies to dog collars and baby onesies. The company had experienced exponential growth as a small business. Despite having operated for less than four years ECL had already sold more than 500000 products. Its product line was now available in 91 retailers across Canada and had been worn by many high-profile celebrities including singer Ed Sheeran Nova Scotian hockey star Sidney Crosby and members of the rap band Wu-Tang Clan. At 25 years old MacLean was now the chief executive officer of one of Canadaâs fastest-growing business ventures. He had received many accolades for his leadership including being featured as one of the âTop 30 under 30â in Marketing Magazine. For ECL to continue its substantial growth it needed a market with more space. One option was to invest heavily in extending its brand portfolio. MacLean had recently won a lengthy copyright battle over the rights to West Coast Lifestyle (WCL) a nascent sibling brand to ECL which had limited current appeal and relatively small sales volumes in British Columbia and Alberta. He had the chance to develop this brand for bicoastal collaboration or friendly competition but doing so presented the risk of brand cannibalization and identity confusion. MacLean also had the vision of making ECL a truly global brand by expanding into the United States before launching in Japan and Australia. While the U.S. Eastern Seaboard offered a massive market for lifestyle apparel and offered synergies with ECLâs current positioning the logistics of brand-building distribution taxes and tariffs and revising ECLâs organizational structure were roadblocks for getting started. Plus was it realistic to think that ECL could become an imported regional brand that locals were proud of or was ECL already too mainstream and corporate to resonate with non-Canadians? MacLean started the meeting: Lately weâve been trying to do everythingâlaunch new product lines develop West Coast Lifestyle as a separate brand and penetrate the U.S. market. Iâm not convinced that our divided attention is working because we are not seeing enough progress fast enough. Perhaps we should choose one option for growth and focus on it.After two hours of protracted debate MacLean still felt he was in the same position. He wanted to do everything but he knew that choosing one strategy for the time being was likely the right thing to do. The real question was which one strategy to pursue and more importantly how to implement it and roll it out. COMPANY BACKGROUNDIn January 2013 MacLean was a 21-year-old business student at Acadia University in Wolfville Nova Scotia a small student town with a population of less than 5000. Along with eight other students he was enrolled in a class called Venture Creation where the goal of the course was to create a business plan for an invention. MacLean who was rather pragmatic if not rebellious thought âWhy would I create a business on paper when I can start a real business?â With an $800 loan from his father and the idea that locals wanted to wear their maritime pride he created East Coast Lifestyle. He bought 30 hoodies and screened them with the phrase âEast Coast Lifestyle.â He then became active on social media platforms including Facebook Instagram and Twitter to create awareness about his start-up. He sold the hoodies on his front lawnâand sold out on the first day. He reinvested the profits to purchase 60 hoodies the following day and began allowing consumers to pre-order to facilitate inventory management. By the end of the month he had generated $3000 in revenue. At the end of the semester his professor was not overwhelmingly impressed with MacLeanâs successâit was a business plan class not a business class. MacLean decided to continue with ECL after the class had ended. 
During the summer of 2013 MacLean worked part-time at Atlantic Lottery and part-time on ECL selling about 25 hoodies a week. He hired his first employee Taylor Northey as ECLâs creative director. ECL began diversifying its products by also offering T-shirts and tank tops. By late 2013 MacLean was approaching retail chains to carry his product line. Pseudio a regional apparel retailer with 30 stores was the first store to sell the ECL brand. One store manager took 10 hoodies initially and told MacLean that if he could sell those 10 hoodies Pseudio would place them in stores across Canada. Pseudio sold out of the ECL hoodies in 30 minutes. That day MacLean learned about his consumersâ price elasticity when he realized that people were willing to pay an extra $10 in the store for the same product he was selling on his lawn. In May 2015 he graduated from Acadia University and made ECL his full-time job. THE ECL BRANDMacLean consistently talked about the distinctive character of ECL as being simple and universalâit was about being proud of where you are from. To understand East Coast pride it was important to understand some of the history of the region. Historically the major industries of the region were based on fishing agriculture forestry and coal mining. For myriad reasons including fiscal policy and investment decisions being driven by the needs of urban centres in Central Canada the region entered a period of economic malaise in the 20th century. To this date the Maritime provinces remained one of the poorest regions in Canada with lower average wages and lower property values relative to the rest of Canada. As a result Maritimers tended to be rather humble but still felt a tremendous amount of regional pride. Maclean understood these challenges as opportunities: âIâm proud of being from the East Coast where oftentimes we are the underdogs of Canada. People are often required to leave their home to find work.â With ECL people could share this identity wherever they went showing others where they came from and connecting with other people from âhome.â competitionThe ECL brand transcended traditional apparel categories being positioned as a true lifestyle brand that encapsulated surf skate and snow vibes. While lifestyle branding was unique for the region it also positioned the brand against a broad array of competitors. The competitive landscape for lifestyle apparel was diverse with varying niches marketing budgets and access to capital. Regardless the lifestyle apparel business was a lucrative one; margins on apparel goods were typically upward of 70 per cent. In Atlantic Canada ECL was the market leader in regional lifestyle apparel. Other clothing companies that sold Atlantic Canada-inspired designs such as Lost Cod New Scotland My Home and Local Legends generally operated out of one location or solely online. While these brands satisfied the needs of tourists and advocates of buying local they appeared to lack the resources distribution or brand awareness to consider scaling. In addition the positioning of these brands tended to be predominantly geography-based and not inherently tied to a specific fashion subculture. ECL designs and promotions aligned closely with premium consumers of surf skate and snow fashions. This market space was incredibly competitive and saturated occupied by many large U.S.-based apparel organizations that had substantial financial backing. For example Zumiez one of the largest retailers in surf skate and snow clothing and accessories carried more than 400 different brands from Burton and Vans to Nike and Adidas. More generally consumers could choose from countless other fashion brands outside of this space ranging from value brands (e.g. T. J. Maxx) to mid-market brands (e.g. The Gap) to luxury brands (e.g. Tom Ford). According to the 2017 report from McKinsey on âThe State of Fashionâ the global apparel industry was characterized by uncertainty change and a series of challenges that resulted from volatility in global sales based on geopolitics the proliferation of city-based strategies instead of country-based strategies a preference for discounts on fashion the emergence of new apparel categories based on casualization and active lifestyles (e.g. athleisure clothing) digital shopping and fashion e-commerce. ECL PRODUCTSECLâs product portfolio had diversified to include a broad range of apparel offerings. In February 2017 the most popular products were the hoodies ($69) T-shirts ($34) tank tops ($30) hats ($30) and toques ($30). ECL also sold a variety of eclectic accessories including baby onesies flags anchor-logoed bowties stickers duffle bags and throw pillows. The company even collaborated with a local carpenter to make an ECL gnome door. MacLean wanted to continue launching three to five new products per year. In 2017 the winter plan was to release branded socks menâs boxers womenâs tall sweaters and a new style of blankets while the summer offerings would include beach towels and water bottles. Novel products in conjunction with the virtually non-existent discounts offered on products helped rejuvenate and preserve the fresh and premium positioning of the brand.One key differentiator of ECL products was that many of the products were limited editions. With the exception of the anchor-logoed apparel (see Exhibit 1) all other lines were of a limited run. Once a limited-edition product was sold out Macleanâs policy was to never reorder or recreate the line. For example ECL had recently partnered with rapper Ghostface Killah from the rap band Wu-Tang Clan to create a limited-edition Wu-Tang hockey jersey. Only 100 jerseys were produced each with a number from 1 to 100. As a result of its predominantly limited-edition products ECL had experience in launching hundreds of logoed items. PROMOTIONSECL continued to promote its products using guerrilla marketing tactics and a very lean budget. MacLean typically relied on social media with happenstance celebrity endorsements an ambassador program and cross-promotional initiatives to communicate with prospective customers. Instrumental for ECL in communicating with its customers about new product offerings was ECLâs Instagram account which now had almost 600000 followers (see Exhibit 2). Although the products offered varied drastically from year to year MacLean relished the control of communicating the culture of the brand and was personally responsible for ECLâs social media messaging and customer feedback. ECL typically decided which products to brand based on feedback from customers on social media. Celebrity support had been perhaps the biggest driver of exposure for ECL. Although MacLean had never paid for an endorsement he used the social media platform to get gear into the hands of a broad swath of celebrities including Sidney Crosby (and other National Hockey League players) the rapper Classified and pop singer Ed Sheeran. Each celebrity âplacementâ was then actively promoted on ECLâs social media and website. For example MacLean reached out to a social connection that worked with Ed Sheeran who then provided the singer with ECL clothing to wear during his concert. After Ed Sheeran wore a branded T-shirt on stage the item with the help of a social media push sold out online.ECL concurrently ran a brand ambassador program which offered free promotional items and commission on products sold in exchange for various local promotional activities for the brand. This influencer program was initiated from a simple Instagram post looking for student brand ambassadors asking where each prospective brand ambassador was from; ECL received more than 10000 responses. Over several days MacLean and his team narrowed the list to 50 students; each had between 5000 and 150000 Instagram followers and regularly posted about ECL. The brand ambassadors also received a discount code to share with their followers which enabled ECL to track each brand ambassadorâs effectiveness. For each sale that brand ambassadors closed they received between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in discounts. ECL had also run a series of cross-promotional campaigns. In 2014 MacLean received a call from Alexander Keithâs Brewery (Keithâs) a 200-year-old brewing institution located in Halifax Nova Scotia regarding a campaign to target a more youthful demographic with a T-shirt giveaway in specially marked Keithâs bottle packs. Keithâs paid for all of the T-shirts upfront and gave ECL a royalty on each case of beer sold. MacLean went on to secure a cross-promotional deal with Captain Morgan Rum on a probationary three-year term. ECL also gave back to the local community that had supported the companyâs growth by launching special co-branded collections with Wounded Warriors and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation sponsoring local sports teams with apparel and offering gear to groups aligned with surf skate and snow. ECL recognized that to get people to buy into a regional brand the brand should do something for the region. DISTRIBUTIONECL sold its products through three primary venues: four ECL retail locations an e-commerce-enabled website and various other retailers. ECL operated a flagship retail store on the Halifax waterfront which was near the Seaport Farmersâ Market the Halifax boardwalk and the disembarkation point of cruise-ship passengers. The flagship store had a staff of four employees. ECL also sold its products at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport in a shop run by six staff members to reach travellers seeking an East Coast souvenir. ECL had recently set up a kiosk that employed four people at Dartmouthâs Mic Mac Mall Atlantic Canadaâs largest shopping mall.  ECL even used a âpop-upâ shopâa truck and trailer containing a broad array of merchandiseâthat travelled around the Maritimes with a team of four employees and sold its products at various festivals from May to November. ECLâs e-commerce platform accounted for 30 per cent of annual sales. Online customers were primarily Canadians with sales from every province. What MacLean always found interesting was that the majority of online sales were not from the Atlantic region but rather from Alberta and Ontarioâa not-so-subtle nod to the East Coasters who worked far from home. ECL used various manufacturers to satisfy customer demand and outsourced the majority of its products to fulfil bulk retailer orders. However some products maintained their Canadian roots. For example the classic hoodies were made in Toronto while many of the T-shirts were screen-printed in Halifax.  Although ECL had been expanding its own retail operations the ECL stores still comprised a small portion of the overall retail sales. ECL relied heavily on its retail partnerships to maintain the majority of its sales volume without having to deal with traditional retail management issues and costs. MacLean ensured that all products soldâwhether online or in partner-retailer locationsâwere priced identically to mitigate potential channel conflict.When ECL was first launched it stocked its product for any Canadian retailer that was interested in carrying it. However with many small retailers concurrently selling knock-off lifestyle products (e.g. âCape Breton Lifestyleâ) ECL made the strategic decision to withdraw all products from the hodgepodge of retailers and to sell through only two retailers: Pseudio (in Atlantic Canada) and Below the Belt (in Central and Western Canada) which meant that ECL had its products in 91 stores. While the Canadian retail operation followed a specific structure the three small U.S. retailersâtwo in Rhode Island and one in Floridaâreceived product only because they explicitly asked for it. All three had discovered ECL through Instagram and wanted to try out their inventory. However by October 2016 when each store received 50 more units to sell they had moved only one or two units per week and all U.S. stores still had inventory from their original shipment.THE GROWTH OPTIONSWest Coast LifestlyeFrom day one MacLean wanted to make people proud of where they were from on a worldwide scale. This insight led to the development of a sibling brand in 2014 for Canadians in British Columbia and Alberta: West Coast Lifestyle. At the time of launching the start-up MacLean could not afford to trademark both ECL and WCL so other businesses blossomed in the region with a similar name and aesthetic to ECL. MacLean had to fight trademark issues for a year and was ultimately successful with his lawsuit making him the rightful owner of WCL. In 2017 WCL was relaunched with new logos through both online and in-store locations of Below the Belt. While WCL products were now carried in 35 stores in Western and Central Canada the resources available to invest in ECL were not available for WCL. MacLean explained that to this point he worked on WCL only 10 per cent of the time. One of the primary challenges with WCL was that the same formula used by ECL had not âunlockedâ the regionâs potential. Products moved at a glacial pace relative to their Atlantic counterparts. In addition West Coasters were potentially less inclined to identify with the coast as a region. Albertans for example did not typically see themselves as being on the coast because they lived in a landlocked province. MacLean felt that WCL had tremendous potential in terms brand development. However simply using a boilerplate or standardized ECL model by substituting mountains for anchors was unlikely to do the job. Geographic ExpansionBesides brand development and new product launches MacLean grappled with geographic expansion ideas. He wanted ECL to become a global player in the lifestyle apparel category. The most logical step was the U.S. Eastern Seaboard whose population of more than 115 million dwarfed Atlantic Canadaâs population of less than 5 million. He had grand plans to eventually capture the hearts and minds of consumers in other countries that had rich surf skate and snow subcultures and were located on a seacoast including the east coasts of Japan (with a population of 10 million) and Australia (with a population of 15 million). While ECL had shipped to 55 countries to date through its online store the logistics of stocking suppliers and brand-building outside of Canada was truly foreign. At the time ECLâs U.S. presence had been built from the requests of a handful of small retailers who had ECL products that were not moving. MacLean had no overarching strategy or rollout in place for expansion. First of all it was unclear how ECL could develop a deal with an established retail partner. Professional salespeople were available who were trained to approach U.S. retail chains that had brand alignment with companies such as ECL including Zumiez PacSun and Urban Outfitters and these salespeople did not cost much upfront. However for every chain that the salesperson signed the salesperson received a rather hefty percentage (10â15 per cent) of all products that were sold through the chain. This commission was on top of the 60 per cent margin that retailers often demanded to justify carrying the product. At that point it would be very difficult for ECL to be profitable at launch considering the import taxes it would need to pay to take product into the United States. While ECL might have hit the ceiling on Atlantic Canada other domestic growth opportunities were available. For example ECL could develop its retailer presence itself opening a series of small stores and kiosk locations to earn full margins on its products. MacLean was unsure how this idea might affect his existing retail partners and was leery of investing in assets that were not the traditional strength of ECL. ECL could also make its products available to other retailers in Canadaâthe demand was certainly there. The trade-off was the cost of potentially mainstreaming the brand too much and thereby diluting the uniqueness of ECL and what it meant to offer limited-edition apparel. MacLean could also make other global decisions such as expanding the brand ambassadors network to a global scale and using a social media influencer network and online sales to sell directly to consumers without brand building. Another international option had recently presented itself. An organization in South Korea which had a rich surf skate and snow culture with coastal identification had approached ECL with the opportunity to license the brand on a one-year contract trial basis. In this scenario ECL would mitigate much of the expansion risk and cost to access a new consumer base in exchange for even lower margins and less brand control online. This option did lead MacLean to consider a hybrid of leveraging the brand ambassadors program as a franchise initiative to mitigate risk and grow quickly but he was skeptical of the implications of a novel business model. MOVING FORWARDMacLeanâs quandary came down to one question: How should ECL strategically expand? The ECL and WCL brands were trademarked and incorporated globally and both were assets with broad appeal and public relations momentum. The perspective that ECL could grow in many different directions was exciting for MacLean but also concerning given ECLâs lean organizational structure (see Exhibit 3). Because he had invested so much of his own time and resources into the business and felt that he truly understood his customers the prospect of risk and giving up control was daunting. Around his office MacLean kept free promotional items from Hurley and from Burton American West Coast companies that thrived after their expansion into Canada. MacLean wanted to reverse that trend bringing some Canada to the world in a way similar to what Herschel had done for bags and what Westbeach had done for snowboard apparel. Could an Atlantic Canadian brand resonate in a city such as Los Angeles with WCL or in Miami with ECL? Americans clearly had a sense of pride that MacLean could tap into but he wondered whether a Canadian brand could authentically fill that void. MacLean wondered whether East Coast states such as Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire New York Florida Georgia and the Carolinas would react favourably to the brand. ECL had always been an Atlantic Canadian signal of strength humility and warmth that could easily start conversations about where people were from. It was exciting to think about what this lifestyle business could evolve into.

It was April 2017 and the hotel perched on Lion�s Head mountain in Cape Town South Africa was perfectly positioned to catch the last westerly rays of sunlight. Ellerman House was a common stopping-off point for travellers returning from safaris throughout southern Africa and in this respect Gordon�s trip was no different. She had just returned from a whirlwind tour through the best new safari camps in southern Africa. However Gordon�s trip was not for rest and relaxation; she was there to gather up-to-the-minute intelligence on the safari industry.As the chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of Extraordinary Journeys (EJ) a provider of custom luxury African safaris she was �on inspection��that is visiting safari camps to test them for future clients. This also involved meeting the camps� owners and managers and networking with other safari professionals. This was the part of the job that she truly loved and no matter how busy she was at home Gordon carved out time to come to Africa at least twice a year. Notwithstanding the 21-hour flight she had a knack for shrugging off fatigue and jet lag to embrace 5:30 a.m. starts and 16-hour days while she was there.Founded in 2009 EJ was a leader among a new breed of fully customized safari tour operators that sought to upend the more common group-tour model. As demand for custom safaris grew EJ�s revenues had grown rapidly increasing at a 60-per-cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2016. However by mid-2017 Gordon was beginning to think that this rapid growth would be difficult to maintain in the face of mounting competitive pressures. Every few months she was seeing advertisements from a new competitor in her industry. While some of these were entrants with scant resources others were backed by private-equity funds and million-dollar branding campaigns. These competitors were advertising to her potential clients and in some cases overtly attempting to drive down prices and profit margins. This suggested a troubling increase in competition that would threaten incumbents. At worst these changes could threaten the growth and market position she had enjoyed for the past eight years.Gordon sipped her drink and looked across the Cape Town cityscape. She knew her South African competitors had offices downtown and she wondered if they were still at work pondering the future of the safari industry.SAFARIS: A BROADER VIEWIntroduction to SafarisThe word safari came from the Swahili word for an overland journey. While the term had used to predominantly refer to a big-game safari it had evolved to refer to �travelling usually in vehicles into unspoiled or wild areas for . . . game viewing.� One estimate suggested that at least 4.5 million international tourists visited Africa in 2015 to go on safari. Primary destinations for safari goers were often well known. For example tourists flocked to see the great migration in Tanzania�s Serengeti National Park. There approximately 1.5 million wildebeest migrated clockwise throughout the region in search of grasses that grew after the seasonal rains. Other top safari destinations included Kruger National Park in South Africa the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya the Okavango Delta in Botswana and Victoria Falls on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe (see Exhibit 1).Safari ActivitiesMost visitors went on safari for anywhere from four to 14 nights. When not on safari travellers to Africa also went to major cities such as Cape Town in South Africa or beaches such as in Zanzibar in Tanzania. The most popular safari destinations tended to offer big-five game viewing: lions buffalo giraffes leopards and rhinoceros. Most safari goers planned to stay at either a camp or a lodge. At a lodge travellers found a permanent building that typically had amenities such as full-time electricity hot water and perhaps air conditioning or a swimming pool if the location had a warm climate. On the other hand travellers at a camp found more rustic amenities such as fabric-walled tents. However ultra-luxury camps like Chinzombo in Zambia with amenities such as indoor bathtubs private plunge pools and hand-carved sinks blurred the lines between upscale camp and lodge.The most popular even emblematic safari activity was to participate in game drives which involved driving in a modified Land Rover or Toyota Land Cruiser to see wild animals.�Another common activity was a walking safari where guests hiked in search of game with well-qualified scouts and guides. Alternative activities were typically offered based on the price range of the lodge or the type of travel the lodge was oriented towards. For example more luxury-oriented lodges tended to offer horseback riding or mountain biking while specialty lodges might have offered support for birdwatching or canoeing. American Safari TravellersIn 2017 the upscale safari market was composed of both luxury and adventure travellers who stayed in higher-end camps and lodges. Within this space the average spend for EJ clients was approximately US$8000 per person excluding international airfare. Almost all EJ clients were American and industry estimates suggested that approximately 110000 Americans travelled on a luxury safari each year.For these American travellers an African safari tended to fall into the �bucket list� trip category. In other words most travellers did not plan to return to Africa; rather they hoped to accomplish their safari aspirations so that they could check the trip off their list of lifetime travel goals. As such potential travellers chose whether to go on safari relative to a number of factors and alternative destinations. For example the outbreak of Ebola in 2014 caused many travellers to divert the trips they had planned for 2015 to other worldwide destinations such as India Peru and Patagonia. Despite occasional short-term changes in supply and demand the luxury safari industry had grown quickly since the end of the financial crisis. Safari demand depended heavily on both the current condition of the economy and the current state of the US stock markets. In good economic times safari bookings and prices tended to increase dramatically. For example in the luxury segment between 2010 and 2017 growth averaged an estimated year-over-year CAGR of 10 per cent. However if the stock market performance were to slow or reverse the rapid growth could give way to a stagnating or even contracting industry.Safari industry STRUCTUREThe safari industry in particular and the luxury travel industry in general tended to function in three distinct layers of operation: (1) tour operators (2) destination management companies (DMCs) and (3) safari camp managers (see Exhibit 2). Because the safari industry had historically been fragmented throughout the value chain few if any companies dominated the industry. In 2017 the largest firm Wilderness Safaris made up no more than 9 per cent of the DMC and camp management industries. No other tour operator was thought to serve more than a small fraction in the luxury market.Layer One: Tour OperatorsPotential US-based travellers hoping to plan a customized safari had a range of choices when selecting a tour operator. There were at least a dozen highly visible firms with more established brand names as well as dozens of other smaller companies (see Exhibit 3). Travellers were able to consult with different firms and request quotes from a number of tour operators to find the best deal or the best match for their particular interests. However most clients did not shop as extensively as might have been expected because of the high time commitment of working with a safari specialist to generate a custom itinerary. Custom safari tour operators could be thought of as travel agents with extremely specialized knowledge of African countries types of safaris guides lodging options and a range of other topics. Tour operators earned their gross profits in the form of sales commissions from safari camps and lodges. These commissions typically ranged from 12 per cent to 25 per cent of the gross trip price excluding airfare. These relatively high commissions for African safaris attracted a consistent stream of new entrants because commissions for tour operators in other comparable markets such as Patagonia India and New Zealand averaged less than 15 per cent.Safari commissions worked in much the same way as a wholesale price markup. For example if a camp had a listed price of $1000 per person per night then tour operators typically charged clients $1000 and then paid the $800 wholesale price to the hotel. They then kept the remaining $200 as gross profit. Wholesale rates were not available directly to consumers so individual travellers paid approximately the same amount whether they booked with a tour operator or directly with the safari lodge.Tour Operator SuccessTo be successful tour operators needed at least three key resources. The first related to industry knowledge such as knowing the best safari properties knowing how to work with suppliers and knowing what customers wanted. CEOs were expected to have gained this knowledge through experience as a tour-operator sales agent or a safari camp marketing representative or at a DMC. While people with the required industry knowledge could have been hired from rival safari companies owners and managers needed sufficient experience to manage this process. The second resource was an appropriate amount of capital. To make a successful entry and remain competitive a new firm needed an estimated $1 million�$2 million to create an office hire an experienced team and build a marketing and a branding campaign. The third resource was the skill to manage the marketing and branding campaign which was critical to developing awareness and trust in potential clients. Successful �safari-preneurs� needed to manage online direct-to-consumer marketing engage in direct mailing and get mentions in top press outlets like Travel + Leisure and Cond� Nast Traveler.Layer Two: Destination Management CompaniesThe second layer of the safari industry was DMCs. Tour operators worked directly with DMCs to put together the difficult operational logistics of a custom safari within a specific region�for example the Serengeti and nearby areas in Tanzania and Kenya. DMCs were based in the geographic region they served and hence acted as the on-the-ground service for safari clients. They helped tour operators book the difficult and/or time-consuming elements of the trip such as arranging local car transportation or chartering planes. For example travelling to a safari camp might require a charter flight that would be difficult to book directly such as an eight-seat Cessna aircraft that needed an experienced bush pilot for a dirt landing strip. Camps were often far from each other on dirt tracks or bush roads. This made arranging and coordinating between the camps for each custom trip difficult and dependent on specialized knowledge. DMCs filled a gap in skills and capabilities between tour operators and safari camps and lodges. DMC activities were typically white-labelled so the client saw DMC services such as ground transportation luggage transfer and local troubleshooting as natural extensions of their tour operator and not branded as the DMC itself. DMCs typically had little pricing power in their operating region. As direct suppliers to the tour operators they competed by offering a mix of good service and a reasonable price. In competitive markets like Kenya the Serengeti and South Africa DMCs that unilaterally raised prices or stopped providing service for certain properties would find that tour operators had moderate switching costs and were able to find another DMC. The DMC industry was highly fragmented although in some specific geographic regions such as Botswana one firm such as Wilderness Safaris� DMC could have a relatively large market share and exercise some degree of market power.While most DMCs were independent some DMCs were part of vertically integrated companies. For example andBeyond a large vertically integrated safari DMC and camp manager also had a competitive tour operator subsidiary in the United States.Layer Three: Safari Camps and LodgesIn 2017 there were over 300 luxury or high-end camps and lodges throughout Africa. Prices for luxury safaris ranged from moderate to sky-high. Typically daily fees for a safari were all-inclusive and included room meals and safari activities. The fees per person per night for a mid-range safari started at approximately $350 and continued to in excess of $3000 per person per night for ultra-luxury experiences (see Exhibit 4). The business of managing safari properties was highly specialized and capital intensive. Traditionally the industry was highly fragmented and firms that owned lodges and camps were small. From 2000 to 2017 the industry slowly began to consolidate. Some firms especially those that catered to high-end luxury clients began building international brand reputations that allowed them to grow in new directions. For example Singita which managed six safari lodges as well as private guest houses was highly regarded in the industry. Its brand was built on a reputation for uncompromising quality and attention to detail. This overall level of quality had led to nearly 200 awards for its properties service level and wildlife conservation efforts including Cond� Nast Traveler�s 2015 award for the number-one hotel in the world. On the back of this reputation Singita had pushed partially into the tour operator space by allowing consumers to book their safaris directly. This allowed Singita to charge full retail price and therefore retain the portion of gross profits that would normally have gone to tour operator partners. Its booking office handled the difficult details of getting travellers to their camps. However Singita generally provided booking services only for its own properties and travellers generally preferred to visit a number of different safari camps on their journey.EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEYSElizabeth Gordon 35 was born in Nairobi Kenya to an American family that had been involved in the safari industry since her father founded Park East Tours in 1965. For 35 years until her family sold the business in 2000 Park East Tours was a leader in the planned-departure group safari business in Kenya and Tanzania. Its primary customer base was college alumni groups. As a lifelong safari industry insider Gordon had visited every major safari country and stayed in over 100 safari camps and lodges. After college she worked as a manager at a number of safari camps in Namibia which helped her gain a new ground-level perspective on the safari industry. She later worked as a consultant in New York City and as a property investor focused on short-term vacation rentals in Buenos Aires Argentina.In the late 2000s however Gordon began looking for a new entrepreneurial opportunity in the travel industry. After looking at safari industry trends she recognized that the older planned departure approach to group safaris had lost its appeal to a new generation of travellers. Prior to the mid-2000s African safaris whether upscale or more down-to-earth were usually conducted as part of a group. Group sizes ranged from a dozen travellers to 50 or more and the pre-planned format allowed for lower prices and easier transportation options. However as travellers became more adventurous and the number of flight options increased clients increasingly sought more customized experiences. In an effort to modernize the safari experience Gordon founded EJ in 2009 to cater to the fast-growing segment of American travellers that wanted customized safaris with elements of both luxury and adventure. Customization allowed her to better match customer interests to the actual trip itinerary. Due to EJ�s extensive on-the-ground research at safari camps throughout Africa it excelled at the process of matching customer interests to safari camps that complemented clients� personalities. One of Gordon�s key guidelines was to send clients only to destinations where either she or one of the 20 EJ employees had stayed. As the demand for custom safaris grew EJ�s revenues had increased dramatically. EJ had grown at a blistering pace averaging a CAGR of over 60 per cent. From 2009 with revenues of $200000 and no full-time employees EJ had grown to projected 2017 revenues of over $12 million with 21 employees.Extraordinary Journey�s Strategy�The Extraordinary Journeys method of trip planning starts the minute we pick up the phone to answer a client inquiry� Gordon said. �The process that we use to create safaris for clients�from the first call until our clients return home�is focused on 360 degrees of trip planning and execution. We want both creativity in trip planning as well as a Ritz-Carlton-level attention to detail at every step of the process whether it is a $7000 safari or a $70000 safari.�A core principle of Gordon�s trip planning philosophy was that matching client interests to both safari lodges and the overall travel itinerary was the most important part of her safari specialists� (i.e. her sales team�s) job. In other words the sales team never directed clients towards high-priced accommodations simply to get a higher commission; the goal was to always match client interests budget and tastes to the best trip that matched these criteria. �The sales team is as empowered as possible to use their deep industry knowledge� Gordon said. �I don�t require them to follow any set itineraries or choose properties with which we have higher gross margins. We do a lot of training to ensure the sales team is up to date but I hire my team because they are smart and I make sure they think for themselves.� She cited two examples of her philosophy: a Hollywood star travelling with family was best served by a low-key family-owned property whereas two honeymooners on a modest budget stayed at economical bush camps before they splurged on two nights at the luxurious Singita Pamushana Lodge in Zimbabwe.Thus far Gordon had guided EJ�s rapid growth based on three primary strategies: (1) a public relations (PR) campaign targeting high-end travel publications (2) referrals from past clients to their friends and (3) repeat bookings from past clients. Each of these strategies had led to a growing brand reputation. EJ had become known for its high-quality customer service and creative safari planning. Thanks to the PR campaign and the support of its most loyal customers EJ had received coverage from the Wall Street Journal Travel + Leisure Departures and National Geographic Traveler. Gordon was awarded Travel + Leisure�s A-List travel agent status four times and in 2016 EJ won Travel + Leisure�s Best Safari Outfitter in the World award coming in second for the magazine�s annual World�s Best competition.LOOKING FORWARDAs the last blushes of sunset faded from the clouds over the Atlantic Ocean Gordon realized that she had one of the greatest luxuries of all�a few free minutes to think about the strategy of her company. Between the long days on safari and a few hectic months back at her office in New York this was her first chance in a long while to sit and think about the future of EJ. She recognized that to maintain her market position she needed to invest capital and even more effort into her company (see Exhibit 5). She was considering at least three options to leverage EJ�s existing resources: a direct marketing approach a PR approach and an optimization and efficiency approach. Unfortunately her available time to devote to a new project was limited and she was only able to engage in�at most�one new project for the foreseeable future. Marketing StrategyThe first option she was considering was to conduct a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign. Considering its rapid growth it was surprising that EJ had never undertaken a marketing campaign. Recently however Gordon had reached out to a number of advertising agencies and specialized marketing companies. There were a few possible marketing channels to explore and she knew that she would need to operate in a number of these channels to be successful. These opportunities included using direct online marketing through Facebook and Google direct mail campaigns search engine optimization and advertising in high-quality magazines that catered to a wealthy audience. While the advertising agencies promised big results Gordon was uncertain about these as advertising for safaris was very competitive and relatively expensive. For example dozens of firms advertised safaris on Google and Facebook which drove up the cost for all competitors. Likewise direct mail campaigns were expensive to mount due to high fixed costs for graphic designers and content development as well as high costs to print and mail. However the benefit of an advertising-based approach was that the average cost to acquire a new customer could be determined over time. After Gordon determined this information the advertising campaigns could be increased or decreased over time to fit the available resources in her sales team.Altogether Gordon estimated that to test the profitability of an advertising strategy she would need to spend at least $100000 and likely closer to $150000. Due to high fixed costs for graphic design coding and agency fees a lower spend would simply waste resources and limit the ability to draw conclusive results. From her research she estimated that it would cost at least $800 to acquire each new customer. Relative to the other two proposed strategies Gordon thought this marketing-based strategy would almost certainly provide a quicker payback period.Public Relations StrategyThe second strategic option Gordon had outlined was to dramatically increase her commitment to PR and brand building. In 2009 she had signed a contract with a New York City-based PR firm and she had renewed this annual contract each year since. At the beginning she had seen a great deal of success from the relationship. For example she had been covered by the Wall Street Journal in 2010 and Departures the travel magazine only available to holders of the American Express Platinum charge card in 2012. These articles boosted both EJ�s reputation and revenues. Gordon estimated that they had paid back her investment many times over. However recently she had begun to see weaker results from the PR firm. She suspected that it was due to the fact that the firm had picked up more lucrative clients and that more tour operators were competing for the limited attention of journalists editors and bloggers who covered the safari industry. To continue competing for press attention Gordon knew that she would have to dramatically increase the size of her contract to at least $100000 a year and possibly higher. The added costs would help pay for the types of perks that drew media attention such as exclusive events in Manhattan airfare for journalists to Africa and the sponsorship of luxury events that would attract travel journalists and potential safari clients.The main difference between the type of earned media coverage gained through PR exposure and the paid exposure gained through advertisements was that PR gains were riskier with a possibly higher payout and a longer-lasting boost to reputation. For example spending $100000 in an advertising campaign could lead to results that were largely consistent throughout the months or years of the campaign. In other words each quarter would probably have relatively consistent profits. However investing $100000 in PR could lead to either an all-but-wasted effort or a mention as a top safari provider in Cond� Nast Traveler which could quickly generate millions in revenue and have the long-tail reputation effects of being linked with a pre-eminent luxury travel brand. These long-tail effects included less obvious outcomes such as higher search engine prominence (due to the way Google assigned rankings based on firm prominence). This approach had the longest payback period and the highest risk. However the leads it generated were likely to be higher-quality leads that were not a burden on the sales team�s time and effort. It could also raise EJ�s visibility within the tour operator industry.Optimization StrategyThe third strategic option was to engage in an optimization program for her firm�s operations. While this program would not be oriented towards increasing revenues it would hopefully contribute to increasing profits through cost reductions and increased employee efficiency. As EJ grew at a 60-per-cent annual rate from 2009 to 2017 the systems put in place to manage both the sales process and sales support were often designed as temporary rather than long-term solutions. For example there was little formalized knowledge management and much of the firm�s critical knowledge of safari properties DMC owners and safari camp managers resided informally with individual employees. Knowledge was transferred ad hoc by requesting information in meetings or via group-chat threads. Gordon hoped to formalize this proprietary knowledge through an internal database that would make the information more easily accessible. Another ongoing issue was improving communication between sales agents and sales support staff who were internally called ops managers. Gordon�s vision of having the best customer service necessitated hiring more ops managers than was standard for the industry. They handled trip and booking details client communications and client administrative work. EJ used one ops manager for every two sales agents which was higher than the industry average. But even with a seemingly robust system in place EJ employees were busier than Gordon would have liked. She firmly believed in keeping her employees to a 40-hour workweek but had had a difficult time achieving that target with the sustained growth over the past few years.To improve efficiency Gordon envisioned custom-built customer relationship management (CRM) software that would automatically create customer travel documents and engage in automated client communications. This would save ops managers and sales staff from having to create a number of semi-customized client documents potentially saving hours of labour from every client inquiry and booking. She knew a capable software engineer who had estimated a cost of $100000 to build the content management system (CMS). This approach came with a number of risks such as the software not performing as expected or employees not finding value in the software. On the other hand Gordon believed that she could expect at least a 5-per-cent boost to employee productivity as well as other benefits such as improved client experience; increased employee retention; and lower stress for her as the executive who typically had to step in to solve problems.The DecisionThe safari tour operator industry had become more competitive in previous years. The increased pressure had not yet begun to affect EJ�s meteoric growth but Gordon believed that all signs pointed to difficulties ahead. She wondered how the safari market would play out over the next few years. Should she spend her hard-earned capital by investing in a new strategic project for EJ? If so in which possible project should she invest? As she thought about these critical issues Gordon looked over the lights of the Cape Town cityscape and briefly enjoyed one of the greatest job perks in the world�travelling for business to some of the most beautiful and unique places on the planet.Exhibit 1: Map of Common Safari DestinationsNote: Rep. = Republic; Dem. = Democratic; countries and national parks mentioned in the case are noted in larger font sizes.Source: Created by the author using a map from The World Factbook s.v. �Political Africa� accessed August 1 2018 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/political/pdf/africa.pdf.

It was March and neglecting the bright spring day outside Kelly Shawn director of marketing sat in her office but could not concentrate. Client Jamie Croce’s words lingered in Shawn’s ear: “The Bristol project needs to be launched by Thanksgiving Day. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects we plan to develop. Please make sure everything is on schedule.” However according to the current original equipment manufacturer (OEM) project-development model both the project schedule and the project’s quality were at risk of not meeting Croce’s request. Shawn stepped away from the laptop and looked out the window at the palm trees moving gently in the breeze. She took a deep breath. It was time to rethink the next step in the plan.COLIN CORPORATECOLIN CORPORATE (COLIN) was founded in 1946 after the end of the Second World War—a critical period for the U.S. economy. The business started out manufacturing electronic dry irons. Its original corporate owner Chris Martin paid significant attention to product quality and customer service. Soon after COLIN was founded its dry iron products gained wide recognition. For 70 years COLIN had been recognized as the number-one brand of garment care products including dry irons steam irons and garment steamers. The garment steamer was a new product category having been developed only in the past 20 years. With improvements in people’s living standards the garment steamer became more and more popular because it was convenient simple to use and could remove wrinkles from fabrics without touching the clothing which eliminated the risk of scorching. The garment steamer product accounted for 30 per cent of COLIN’s total sales and 50 per cent of the company’s total profit (see Exhibit 1).COLIN had a flat organizational structure. The interdepartmental relationships ran in parallel. Under the general manager of the company were seven senior vice-president positions: sales marketing finance research and development (R&D) operations supply chain and quality. These senior vice-presidents led their respective teams to perform their functions (see Exhibit 2).COLIN had its own industrial design and R&D group and had 20 years’ experience in garment steamer product development; however COLIN did not manufacture the products it developed. The garment steamer manufacturing was outsourced to OEM suppliers in mainland China. Each year COLIN developed approximately 10 new garment steamer products. The product development lead time for a new product with a medium degree of complexity was approximately 10 months: two months for the design quotation supplier selection and design finalization; two months for tooling fabrication; two months for production of the first component article product qualification tests and certification; two months for the component and assembly pilot and production; and a final two months for product shipment to the distribution centre and to retail stores. During the entire development period the COLIN project team at the U.S. headquarters were in intensive communication with both the OEM suppliers and COLIN’s subsidiary corporation project team in Zhongshan Guangdong Province China. The OEM suppliers COLIN selected and co-operated with had vertical manufacturing ability which meant they could complete the entire manufacturing process in house from the manufacturing of the component parts to the assembly of the finished goods. In this way the product quality could be controlled to the highest degree. When a new product needed to be developed COLIN’s R&D team created the design internally then the sourcing leader sent the design drawings to the OEM suppliers for their production price quotation. In general COLIN selected the supplier based on factors such as cost quality speed of delivery and service.COLIN also developed some original design manufacturer (ODM) projects sometimes working with existing OEM suppliers and sometimes with other finished-goods suppliers. When a customer needed a new product but COLIN’s internal design resources were occupied or the product was targeted at an open price point (OPP) internal development did not provide any cost advantage and COLIN would then move into ODM development model. Annually COLIN’s work was made up of approximately 70 per cent OEM projects and 30 per cent ODM projects (see Exhibit 3).The Bristol projectAccording to Shawn the Bristol project was one of COLIN’s most promising projects. It could finally resolve the most common customer complaint about garment steamer products: steam did not last long under low temperatures. With the currently available garment steamer products when the set-up temperature was low steam would begin to drip after one minute; when the set-up temperature was high there was a potential risk that the hot steam could damage clothing. The Bristol product was designed to use dual heater plates but a single heater system which avoided incurring a large cost and maintained a constant steam under low temperatures. COLIN had a patent on this new technology.The Bristol was targeted at a unit price of US$109 which made it a mid-priced product although its function would be superior to similarly priced products offered by COLIN’s competitors. If the Bristol could be launched according to plan in fiscal year 2017 it would lead to estimated sales of $20 million which was very high for the first year of a product’s launch.Shawn led COLIN’s retail market team and knew that consumers always wanted to see different and special products. She had been employed at COLIN for eight years; she worked the first two years in the sales department and then moved to the marketing department. In an attempt to meet customers’ changing needs garment steamer brands were constantly innovating—offering new functions new materials new technologies or a new appearance. Retailers such as Kmart and Costco annually reviewed the new products available. Any underperforming products were replaced by new products that offered better sales potential. Shawn commented that “If our company cannot deliver new product on time and the [currently available] product doesn’t perform well then our display shelf will be distributed to our competitors. We can see severe competition and how important it is to develop the new product on time.”Kmart was one of COLIN’S major retail customers. Purchasing manager Jamie Croce from Kmart was a very meticulous person: We plan to test sales in 500 stores. According to the test sales result we will determine whether to promote this product nationwide—in 2500 stores. We will leave the aisle shelf available to Bristol. The company’s website will introduce Bristol one month ahead of its in-store availability. We will also use Twitter Facebook to recommend this product. This is one of the most important garment steamer projects for us this year; anything going wrong will not be accepted.Achieving the development agreement with Kmart on the Bristol project was a milestone but Shawn had no time to celebrate. She felt that a tough journey had just started. One of her major concerns was the project timeline. Customers she communicated with about the Bristol project raised some critical-to-quality (CTQ) product factors such as steam volume and temperature which had all been revised. Kmart’s new-product internal review procedure was also very slow. Shawn had spent six months following the Bristol project’s progress which had recently been moving forward according to schedule.For the Bristol products to enter the market quickly Kmart required a one-month shorter launch time than for other OEM projects. Reducing the timelines by one month was a big problem as product development included many tasks: product design supplier selection component confirmation qualification and certification and mass production of the components and finished goods. In the end a shorter production development time would also affect product quality. If COLIN abandoned the Bristol project the discussion and collaboration with Kmart over the past six months would be lost and would become meaningless. Furthermore losing the project would affect the subsequent year’s total sales. However continuing with the project meant that the product might not be delivered on time which could lead both COLIN and Kmart to lose their reputations with customers. COLIN would also be penalized. “It is really a difficult choice” said Shawn.Shawn considered all the possible solutions such as seeking a supplier to complete the design so that COLIN could omit the first component article. Using the ODM supplier which was usually very fast could save time compared to going through the OEM project-development procedure. Alternatively could she identify opportunities to save time in the current OEM procedure? Could any tasks be worked on in parallel? Shawn felt she could not resolve this situation by herself; she decided to hold a Bristol project meeting and to consider the comments of other department leaders regarding how to complete this project on time.Current OEM project execution at COLINCOLIN currently had no dedicated project manager in new-project development. The Bristol project was being managed by a product manager from the marketing department (see Exhibit 4). Shawn’s team had four product managers: Sally Daniel Christa and Robert. Sally and Daniel had been with the company for 10 years and they worked well on project management. Christa and Robert had been with the company for three years and one year respectively and they were not as professional in their project management work. For example Shawn had attended a project meeting held by Christa and one of the engineers Kevin had argued with Christa. Kevin had doubted Christa’s project timeline and said he was too busy to complete Christa’s project design on time. Robert had also complained in front of Shawn about the project team he was leading. Sometimes the quality engineer and the design engineer differed on an issue and they were quick to argue with each other during project meetings. Their conflicts slowed the decision-making processes and affected the projects’ timelines.Under the current organizational structure product managers needed to spend much of their time doing product introductions maintaining customer relationships conducting market research and supporting the sales functions. They did not have enough time to perform their project management role. Delays in COLIN’s new-product development had become common. In the previous year COLIN had developed 12 projects and seven projects had been delayed. Some projects had been delayed due to the product manager’s overcommitment to a customer and some were delayed due to technical issues. The project timeline tracker had also not been developed very well. Sometimes when a project was developed to the middle stage someone suddenly discovered a task that needed to be done but had not been listed in the project’s timeline tracker. These problems led the project’s development time to exceed the time estimated in the original plan. In addition due to time zone differences when OEM suppliers in China encountered problems and their queries needed a response from the U.S. team they could not always receive a timely response and this led to more delays.COLIN’S OEM project management lacked a common set of expectations regarding processes (for example using weekly meetings or email communication to manage projects); instead the management format for each project depended on the project manager’s personal style. Some project managers were very proactive providing comments and suggestions and following the progress of projects’ development closely; but some project managers relied on other team members to allocate their time to work on projects and exhibited a weaker influence on project execution. Project timelines did not have buy-in from all team members and did not represent the progress of projects accurately.The quality of OEM products also varied. Among the engineering team some engineers had worked with the company for more than 20 years. The products they designed had fewer problems and their projects progressed relatively smoothly when moving to mass production. Some of the younger engineers however lacked design experience. The products they designed typically encountered more problems during the development stage which led to more customer complaints after the products were sold.Shawn and the R&D director Frank Pennings were both aware of these issues and they considered making changes to the current project management and product design processes; however other tasks always seemed to occupy their attention and they had not yet had sufficient time to think deeply about the next steps for improving the processes.COLIN’s suppliers and customersALICE CORPORATION (ALICE) one of COLIN’s major suppliers was located in Xiamen City Fujian Province China. Besides providing OEM and ODM garment steamer products to COLIN ALICE was also proactive in developing co-operative opportunities with other major garment care brands such as Koninklijke Philips NV (Philips) and the Bosch Group (Bosch)—the two leading brands in Europe and Mexico respectively—and Akai—the leading brand in the United States. These brands were COLIN’s direct competitors in the garment care business.COLIN also had a business segment that provided private-label products to large retail customers who had their own brands. For example Kmart had its own brand Natural which included clothing small home appliances and other household products. Kmart had no design team or manufacturing factory. Instead its private-label products were all supplied by business partners or ODM suppliers. The private-label business represented 5 per cent of COLIN’s business. COLIN purchased ODM products from its own suppliers and then supplied these private-label products to supermarkets or big retailers.Shawn had recently heard that representatives from Kmart and ALICE had been meeting to explore the possibility of Kmart purchasing its private-label products directly from ALICE; however Shawn was not overly concerned. In the past another of COLIN’s customers had gone to COLIN’s supplier to buy private-label products directly; however two years later the same customer had returned to COLIN. Shawn was confident that COLIN could provide customers with a one-stop solution because of its comprehensive capabilities in R&D project management supply chain management and customer service. Customers that worked with COLIN needed only to clearly communicate what they wanted and COLIN would take care of everything. However customers that went directly to the ODM suppliers needed to spend much time discussing product specifications and CTQ requirements following up on the product development progress performing quality audits for each shipment from suppliers and dealing with customer service and complaints regarding product quality. If customers compared only the unit cost then going directly to the manufacturer plants would lead to savings; however if they considered the total cost and service efficiency COLIN was the more reasonable choice for private-label products. BUREY CORPORATION (BUREY) another supplier that had long co-operated with COLIN was located in Zhongshan City Guangzhou Province China. BUREY had a world-class operating facility and could provide large quantities of high-quality products within a short time. During its long co-operation with COLIN BUREY had always maintained a high service level. Since it had a substantial manufacturing capacity and consistent high-quality performance BUREY also provided private-label products to Kmart. However these private-label products were basic models only not innovative products. Compared with ALICE BUREY was weaker at R&D. It lacked core patents and competitively innovative products. BUREY mainly completed the manufacturing process in accordance with the customer’s design.The Executive MeetingShawn held a two-hour meeting to discuss the Bristol project and invited her colleagues from R&D sourcing quality and marketing. She began by reviewing the background of the Bristol project the customers’ CTQ factors the expected launch time and the current difficulties. She then asked the team to provide their comments.The R&D director Frank Pennings was the first speaker: We need to consider the Bristol project very carefully. We should make sure we have enough time and resources to complete this project. If we just speed through this project and push the timing even skipping some necessary steps it will be very risky for product quality. In recent years our NPI [new product introduction] timing has been getting shorter and shorter meanwhile product quality is becoming more unsteady. Use Orono as an example. Usually a garment steamer new-product development needs around 10 months. But Orono only took eight and a half months under pressure from the customer. Although we launched that project on time we received a complaint about a dripping issue soon after it launched. In order to resolve this issue we had to improve the design rework the finished goods and compensate the consumer. Our spending has exceeded US$500000 for this quality issue. We cannot develop a project  similar to Orono at whatever condition. The Orono project Pennings mentioned was developed in 2014; in order to meet a customer’s timeline request the project was rushed to market. At the beginning the marketing department had a very positive forecast for this project and the sales potential was good but almost within a day Orono encountered customer complaints. Sales marketing sourcing quality and engineering—all departments—were pulled in to this emergency. Even today the customer service team continued to receive complaints from end users about the Orono product dripping issue. “Let’s think about whether  we move ahead or put a hold on the Bristol project” Pennings emphasized. Shawn responded to Pennings’ opinions promptly:Although the Orono project was not developed successfully we have held several meetings to talk about it and summarized its failure reasons such as lacking customer CTQ [elements] lacking a full qualification test; communication with suppliers was not clear. Now if we develop the Bristol project we can just refer to the lessons we learned on the Orono project. This year our new projects’ quantities are not so high. If we give up the Bristol project now the new product contribution to sales will be below our target. In addition our competitor Akai has already posted advertisements on what they will launch—a new garment steamer with constant steam. As far as I know it is similar to our Bristol project. If we don’t launch Bristol this year some end users who want to buy our brand will move to Akai. This will be harmful for our brand and our sales. COLIN has been a market leader for a long time. We don’t want to be a follower.Sally voiced her concerns: “If we decide to move on the Bristol project how can we select the proper supplier? Are we going to use OEM or ODM for this project? Can we meet the launch deadline?” Shawn found that the meeting was filled with questions and she tried to steer the discussion to resolving the deeper issues.Simon Suffert the senior sourcing manager spoke up:Could we ask ALICE and BUREY to quote on the Bristol project? Let’s see their proposed timeline then make a final decision. BUREY has done some private-label business with Kmart; ALICE has also developed many ODM projects with us before. Their capability is trustworthy. We can rely on them to do ODM design and our engineer can take responsibility for the qualification and certification. If that works I have full confidence that ALICE and BUREY can meet the project timeline. The Newport project was developed in that model and the timeline was shortened by about one month. Pennings reminded Suffert The Newport project was quite simple; the steam volume was not adjustable. That product didn’t need to move. It was an OPP [opening price point] product. Bristol is an MPP [medium price point] product. It has four wheels and is the first product that can supply constant steam under low temperatures. If we choose to go with ODM we cannot control the detail design and the risk of quality problems will increase.Sally commented:Supplier selection needs to be considered together with the project development model. If we decide to go with ODM and shorten the lead time we may go with ALICE. They already had a product with a constant steamer feature on sale in the U.S. market for a year. The product connects with power and achieves a pre-set temperature and the steam brush will release constant steam. Our patented feature is that our product has a button to control the steam on and off. Regarding the operational experience COLIN’s patent will be superior to ALICE’s patent. But ALICE’s product is also acceptable as we learned during market research.Shawn who was sensitive to the project’s timeline responded:If ALICE has already had a similar product for sale and has a patent to shorten the Bristol timeline and meet our sales target why don’t we just leverage their patent? Our patent hasn’t been applied on a physical product yet. Wouldn’t doing so just represent a higher risk? If ALICE could just change the product appearance to Bristol and share the existing components from their current products wouldn’t that be a good way to speed up the time to market?Pennings who was reluctant to choose the ODM option commented: If we go with ALICE’s patent in order to share the service part we would have to change our design direction for the next round of new products and still use ALICE’s patent for our constant steam product series. If this happens we will be in a very passive position. If ALICE choses to implement a price increase next year we would be forced to accept. And if we go with ODM but give ALICE our patent there is no doubt that we will grow our competitor. But if we insist on using our own patent with the OEM option we can easily move to other OEM suppliers if ALICE has any cost or service issues.Although COLIN’s dual heating plate patent had not yet been applied on a physical product the application of the new technology would still take time. Based on his technical experience Pennings was confident that COLIN could realize this process on the Bristol project in the standard 10 months’ development time. Luis Almanza from the quality department had his own view:In the past we have only run the ODM option with the OPP product and the sales were relative small. According to the sales forecast Bristol’s annual sales will be over 200000 units. We should pay high attention to the quality risk. As I heard although ALICE’s product has been selling for a year they sold only about 2000 units. This small quantity cannot prove any product quality reliability.Final DecisionListening to the heated discussion Shawn fell quiet. In what direction should the project go? She needed to come to a decision as soon as possible. The meeting had lasted almost two hours and still no agreement had been made. How should COLIN move to the next step? Shawn looked out the window of the meeting room at the bright spring day outside. She took another deep breath.Exhibit 1: COLIN CORPORaTE’s Income Statements 2015–2016 (in US$ million)Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: COLIN corporate’s Company structureNote: VP = vice-presidentSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: COLIN Brand garment steamerSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: COLIN corporate’s Project teamNote: R&D = research and development; QE = quality engineer.Source: Company files.

The tasks of an operations manager at an LSP were to plan and review the daily distribution fulfilment. Kiessling operated a terminal that offered various logistics services such as hazardous�materials warehousing contract logistics procurement logistics just-in-time services and in-night express services. The in-night operations permitted the company to exploit the synergistic effects of using the terminal both in the day and at night. There were separate tours for two large automotive original equipment manufacturers that used the in-night service to supply their repair shops and showrooms with spare parts. However the major share of distribution was bundled consignments from various consigners in the automotive agriculture and construction industries. The majority of consignments were business-to-business (B2B). Furthermore sensitive deliveries such as pharmaceuticals horse-breeding sperm records and laboratory samples were carried in the in-night network.In April 2017 Brandl had just returned from a three-week leisure trip. As he arrived at his office one Monday morning he was approached by one of his staff. Since the previous Thursday a large consigner Blum NFZ Teile (Blum) had stopped feeding consignments to the in-night service network from its largest sales area in Regensburg (Ratisbon). Blum being an important consigner at the time was the target of a corporate acquisition from one of its competitors. After the acquisition was finalized in December 2015 Blum had planned to continue with the service provided by Kiessling�s in-night network although in the long run in 2018 it planned to insource in-night distribution. However since the previous Thursday some delivery tours had run idle early on due to missing volume from Blum. The use of these tours had decreased significantly. As a result revenues were estimated to drop �750 per night while operational costs remained at a constant high level.As a first reaction Brandl checked the tour delivery times and volumes in the Transportation Management System (TMS). The TMS held all the timestamps and geographic coordinates from delivery and visualized the tour after the fact on an online map. What he saw was indeed alarming. Blum had been a major consigner up to this point. There was a service level agreement in place which included a two-month period of notice for cancelling the agreement. Blum operated five sales areas in Kiessling�s service area. Four out of five sales areas fed in-night consignments into the in-night network. The Regensburg sales area was the largest one feeding about one third of Blum�s consignments. From the past year�s TMS data a first estimate of the devastating consequences was made: The total number of consignments was estimated to drop by 40 per cent per night and the total number of delivery stops was estimated to drop by 26 per cent. Different tours and zip codes were affected differently.Due to the tight time schedule operating in-night distribution was always challenging. Even small interruptions could cause the system to lose its balance and produce unfavourable results such as delayed delivery or unsecure deposited consignments. Over the years there were smaller challenges which were fixed locally. Whenever there was an issue with unbalanced tours tours running idle over a longer period or tours being delayed for many days in a row Brandl and his staff found some small adaptations to rebalance things in a smooth and smart way. However this time the challenge was no local issue. The cancellation of service by Blum shook the whole distribution and revenue of the in-night express operations. As a result Blum had to come up with a plan to adapt the distribution system by the end of June 2017. How could Brandl adapt the Kiessling in-night operations to overcome this massive turmoil and adapt to the new situation?Background: In-Night LogisticsIn-night logistics was a transportation service characterized by delivery at night. It was different from overnight logistics which was characterized by parcel delivery the next morning. Overnight service providers performed the line-haul from the origin terminal to the receiving terminal at night. However transhipment of parcels at the receiving terminal and distribution to recipients were performed the next morning. This procedure had the advantage of face time with the recipients and secure confirmed receipt. In contrast in-night service providers (INSPs) performed the line-haul in the evening transhipment roughly around midnight and parcel distribution and delivery at night. Customers benefited from in-night services by having the delivered parcels already available at the start of business. This was a competitive advantage whenever parts were necessary at the start of production or spare parts and tool were required for a handyman�s daily tour. Lack of these parts could result in delayed production harvest or departure and hence disrupt a production schedule and cause tardiness and idle times. In-night express was a special case of courier express and parcel (CEP) service. It could be considered a premium logistics service due to its high-service level speed and guaranteed delivery.Another unique characteristic of in-night logistics was receiptless delivery. Usually no one was available to accept a delivery and sign for the delivery so a receipt was not issued. Instead the driver scanned the parcel. By doing so both a timestamp and the geographical coordinates of delivery were saved. There were a variety of delivery options offered to customers including security boxes provided by the in-night service provider and customer facilities such as garages repair shops and private locker boxes. Even a car trunk could serve as a depot. If the depot was not a provided security box the driver took a photograph of the delivered parcel at the destination for the sake of liability. As a result of this variety the driver needed access to the chosen delivery option: keys transponders chip cards access keys for combination locks and so on. Every driver carried about 200�300 keys every night. This practice posed a tremendous liability for drivers in terms of customer deposit places. Receiptless delivery and the keys to customers� deposits and sites were of utmost importance in performing in-night express services.The standard process of in-night express was straightforward. Consignments were collected in the afternoon. One consignment (shipment) could comprise one or many parcels addressed to the same recipient. Usually the consigner paid postage per consignment subject to the total weight of all parcels and distance. INSPs used a deadline of 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m. depending on their proximity to the central hub. Thereafter the consignments were bundled at the regional origin terminals and line-hauled to the national central hub. At the hub the consignments were sorted by their receiving destination and transhipped to the receiving terminal. Line-haul vehicles arrived in the receiving regional terminals and were unloaded to utility vans for distribution. Finally consignments were delivered to recipients until the early morning. This network configuration was called a hub-and-spoke network (see Exhibit 1). Hubs were used in transportation to consolidate and split truckloads. This practice was meant to save direct lines running between every terminal in the network. Similar to conventional cargo carriers INSPs needed to operate networks covering the distribution area without blank spots on the map. Every consignment was handled four times: (1) regional collection; (2) line-haul from the origin terminals to the hub; (3) line-haul from the hub to the receiving terminals; and (4) regional delivery. An exception was consignments that were sent within service areas. These orders remained in the origin terminal awaiting delivery at night. The whole national territory was divided into a series of service areas. Every district was assigned to one partner in the in-night network who performed the collection and delivery. Franchisees were regional logistic service providers running a regional terminal in the assigned service area. The assigned service area was further partitioned into fixed tour areas. There were many approaches to partitioning a tour area into several smaller districts. A widely used practice was called �districting.� When consistency was an important consideration the practices of districting partitioning or fixed tour problems could be used. In 2017 in-night express was already highly consolidated in Germany with few national in-night networks. In Germany only nox NachtExpress (nox) Night Star Express (NSE) European Service Logistics Association (ESLA) and transmed Transport had dedicated in-night networks (see Exhibit 2). In terms of the number of consignments the market leader was nox followed by NSE. The other in-night services were mostly premium options offered to private customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Due to this small number of equivalent logistic services and the premium service level customers were willing to pay a good margin higher than for other CEP services. This was also the case for corporate customers in the B2B segment which was mostly served by those INSPs running dedicated networks. Since 2010 several mergers and acquisitions had taken place fostering the market�s consolidation.In 2011 the German company LPR GmbH Logistik the Austrian company Lagermax AED and other European express service providers started to connect their existing in-night express networks. The co-operation was named the European Service Logistics Association (ESLA). In 2017 the ESLA network operated in 24 European countries by undertaking 832 tours per night and 430 tours per day on average. In 2016 the investment fund Special Situations Venture Partners (SSVP III) acquired 100 per cent of TNT Innight a subsidiary of the Dutch TNT Express. Later TNT Innight became nox. In February 2017 nox acquired CAT Deutschland the German subsidiary of the French CAT Group. In April 2016 Trans-o-flex started in-night express delivery operating its own hub-and-spoke network with its own vans. This Austrian INSP concentrated on temperature-sensitive parcels and offered industry solutions for pharmaceuticals. In 2017 Trans-o-flex was acquired by the Amberger family and Schoeller Holding (see Exhibit 2).Most INSPs used utility vans with only one person�the driver�for distribution. Since there were no vehicle-specific speed limits for this vehicle class they operated at the same speed as passenger cars. This was a competitive advantage over using trucks. Also because each INSPs used only one person the size and weight of consignments were usually limited accordingly. However the limiting resource in distribution was time. There were penalties charged within the in-night network if partners repeatedly failed to deliver a given high quota of on-time consignments. The on-time quota was planned and decided centrally. Since INSPs considered themselves to be premium service providers the on-time quota was usually between 99 and 100 per cent. The operating costs of a utility van were mostly fixed since there was a contracted charge per night with the subcontractors. The operating cost per night and vehicle were estimated to be roughly �272 (see Exhibit 3). In local distribution using small vans with a total weight less than or equal to 3.5 tonnes the personnel cost accounted for 60 to 70 per cent of the total distribution cost. Thus variable costs were relatively small compared to fixed costs.It was common practice to engage subcontractors for the distribution. Subcontractors brought their own vehicles and employed drivers. They had one tour area assigned per vehicle and received a daily contracted compensation for their territories. Every fixed tour area was assigned to one subcontractor�s van. The total working time per driver and night was around 9 hours�from 11:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. During working hours the subcontracted drivers waited for the inbound line-haul assumed consignments addressed to their district loaded their vehicle and delivered all consignments. Usually one tour had about 35 to 50 consignments and between 25 and 35 stops. The planning activities of an INSP were manifold: Strategically the INSP needed to locate its terminal and arrange its service area within the hub-and-spoke network. Subcontractors needed to be selected and employed. Further the service provider needed to make a decision about its degree of operational flexibility. This meant somehow defining which processes were going to be flexible and which processes would better remain consistent over time. On a mid-term tactical level an INSP designed its fixed tour areas which remained fixed for some time. Smaller local changes could take place in order to adapt to new circumstances keeping the majority of the plan robust. The subcontractors and their drivers were then assigned to the tour areas. In order to achieve high familiarity and local knowledge the assignment remained consistent for as long as possible. On a day-by-day planning level the tours in every tour area were routed. Routing meant computing a desirable order of stops that minimized the total duration of delivery. In case of any disruption the operator needed to �fight the fire.� Depending on the level of flexibility there could be some switching plans ready for execution. For example a driver could take over a designated part of another driver�s tour in a flexible way in order to achieve overall punctuality.Background: in-night distribution in Regenstauf GermanyKiessling was a member of a multinational in-night express network. There were several other partners and franchisees across Germany. In practice being part of this network meant feeding consignments into the system and receiving consignments from other partners and franchisees.Brandl was the operations manager at Kiessling responsible for the in-night business. Therefore he was concerned with customer acquisition and transport operations in the Kiessling terminal in Regenstauf. Regenstauf was located north of Regensburg in Eastern Bavaria in the south of Germany. It was close to the borders of the Czech Republic and Austria and within one kilometre (km) of the A93 motorway (German Autobahn). The Kiessling terminal operated a service area that included more than 440 zip (postal) codes comprising the municipalities of Regensburg Passau Landshut Straubing and Weiden (see Exhibit 4). The largest city in the area was Regensburg with about 146000 people. The in-night distribution was organized into geographical districts (i.e. territories or fixed tour areas). There were 29 vehicles and tours each having an assigned tour area. Every tour area was a cluster of several zip codes. In Germany five-digit zip codes had been in use since 1993. For historic reasons every tour area had a three-digit identifier which had no semantic value anymore. However the TMS required a three-digit identifier; hence the information technology (IT) department kept the numbers anyway. Most drivers had been subcontractors for Kiessling for years and were familiar with their tours customers and duties. They knew all the shortcuts dangers difficulties hidden customer depots and localities of frequent addressees by heart. Subcontractors received a fixed contracted charge per tour and night independent of the daily volume weight or delivery time. The average charge was negotiated in long-term contracts and depended on average stop number and density as well as the general ease or intricacy of a delivery area. For example a delivery area having curvy narrow roads bad winter road maintenance or that was simply far off any primary highways was considered intricate. The subcontracted drivers arrived between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. at the Regenstauf terminal with their utility vans to await the inbound lines. When an inbound line arrived it was unloaded and the parcels were transhipped by the drivers themselves.Consignments had a destination address including a zip code. Since shippers fed their consignments into the system using electronic data interchange there were many different names spellings and errors in data fields such as �addressee� �street� and �place� which were string type fields. Nevertheless the 5-digit zip codes were usually correct and therefore of great organizational value. Data integrity and validity was always an issue one that was common to the whole CEP industry. For example identifying addresses was difficult due to different spellings and names of the same address such as �KfZ Dillinger� �Dillinger KfZ Werkstatt� �Autowerkstatt Dillinger� and �Automobile Dillinger.� These four names could all semantically mean an auto repair shop having the family name Dillinger. For this reason distinctive data attributes such as the geographical coordinates and zip code were the primary information used for planning and routing.The consignments arrived in the Regenstauf terminal using any of four different inbound routes. The first inbound route was a line-haul from the central hub which was located close to Frankfurt am Main. This line-haul arrived around 1:00 a.m. but could be delayed until 3:00 a.m. The one-way travel distance from the terminal to the hub was roughly 300 km. Usually there were two vehicles on the line. These two were the same drivers and vans that brought the outbound consignments from collection to the central hub. In the case of too little capacity there was a third stand-in vehicle located close to the hub subcontracted by Brandl. In rare cases there were further stand-ins subcontracted by the hub operator. The second inbound route option was a direct line that arrived from a handful of other terminals such as Augsburg Berlin and Stuttgart. The third inbound route option was a line-haul from the regional hub (rather than the central hub) which was reserved for southern Germany and was located close to N�rnberg (Nuremberg). There was only one line-haul on this link. The fourth inbound route was a direct line-haul from Blum.On arrival the drivers jointly unloaded the arriving vans and sorted the consignments into their vans. Depending on when the last inbound van arrived distribution started around 2:30 to 3:15 a.m. The expected time of departure was 2:45 a.m. Drivers had a recommended optimized route that had been calculated by an in-house-developed routing tool. The computed schedule was displayed interactively on a smartphone and both the optimized tour and the actual driven tour were documented. The tour areas varied in size (see Exhibit 5). The average size was 675 square km. Differences in size were due to different approaching times to get there in the first place different density of stops and different productivity of drivers.A usual stop was processed as follows: stop at address find parcel in van find secure depot at customer site open depot with physical or digital key insert parcel in depot scan parcel and depot barcode. If drivers considered the depot unsecure or were not sure about the right place they took a photograph. The stop was finalized by locking the depot and restarting the van�s engine.The final stop had to be completed by 8:00 a.m. However there were also a few premium 7:00 a.m. deliveries which were usually addressed to general repairs workers who ordered the spare parts they needed to take with them on their own day tour. Nevertheless from time to time tours could not be completed on time for various reasons: bad weather and road conditions causing delay; too many stops adding up so that tours were infeasible; difficulties and therefore wasted time finding a customer depot; and inexperienced stand-ins being less familiar with the district customers and process. Brandl had to explain any delays on behalf of Kiessling because the company had to reach a high quota of on-time delivery. There was a severe penalty for every delayed parcel beyond a given threshold. On average all tours finished on time around 7:30 a.m. However there were some returning problems in the distribution. Most problems occurred in the summer due to peaks in volume and in the winter due to bad weather and poor road conditions. Problem: Losing a major consignerUntil April 2017 Blum had operated its own delivery tours in the daytime to supply repair shops and showrooms with auto parts. For in-night delivery Blum outsourced the in-night express service with Kiessling. Consignments were ordered by the Blum sales areas in Regensburg Amberg Passau and Weiden. The fifth sales area Straubing did not feed consignments into the system. All the consignments were directly shipped from the Pilsen Czech Republic logistics centre to Regenstauf using a designated vehicle. In December 2015 Blum was acquired by a major competitor. This acquisition was a horizontal fusion. Both companies were wholesalers of automotive spare parts for the utility sector operating in Germany and other European countries. In December 2016 Brandl was informed that the acquirer would continue to work with Kiessling until December 2017 and in-night distribution would be moved in-house starting from January 2018. The newly-merged company planned to exploit existing synergies. Blum had already performed daytime distribution and was able to serve most repair shops or showrooms more than once a day. However in April 2017 the Regensburg sales area suddenly cancelled the service agreement and the other sales areas were to follow. After some negotiations Brandl got notice of the cancellation at the end of April 2017. As a result he had to come up with a plan to adapt the distribution system by the end of June 2017. First Brandl decided to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Blum share of total volume and stops in order to find out how much room for re-optimization there would be after June (see Exhibit 6). Roughly 40 per cent of total volume and 26 per cent of total stops were expected to be lost. This share varied across the fixed tour areas due to different customer structures urban and rural infrastructures and the Blum sales areas. The Blum share was analyzed. The consignments were aggregated to stops and stops were categorized into three types: (1) Blum (2) mixed and (3) other stops. �Blum stops� were stops where only consignments from Blum were delivered. At �mixed stops� both Blum and other consignments were delivered. All stops receiving one or many consignments from anywhere but Blum were labelled as �other stops� (see Exhibit�6).Brandl knew he had to come up with a set of changes to implement by the end of June�in two months� time. Otherwise his in-night express division would lose its margin and its strong position in the area. However making changes in the distribution system was difficult. How many stops would remain in existing tours after the Blum volume was lost? Would the drop factor decrease increase or remain unchanged? The art of computing good tour areas was difficult due to the uncertainty in the daily volume and the location of recipients. How many of the 29 tours should remain? If Brandl significantly increased the tour area of remaining tours would the subcontractors be able to operate their tours economically or would they re-negotiate the rate per tour? Would larger tours having a lower density of stops be feasible at all?Alternative courses of actionAfter two days of collecting data talking on the phone with Blum and conducting plausibility checks Brandl knew there would be no way back. Blum was going to cancel and all other things staying the same approximately 26 per cent of the revenue from in-night services was going to leave with this consigner. Brandl called for a small team to plan the change including Brandl himself IT customer service and external consultants. In their first meeting the decision alternatives were laid out.Greenfield Planning (Option 1)The team would use historical data and exclude all consignments from Blum from that data. In this first approach they would need to plan the distribution from scratch: fixed tour areas possible changes in disposition selection assignment and re-negotiation with the subcontractors. Districting as a bridge between strategic and operational planning would stay the paradigm of distribution planning.Re-Optimization of Existing Fixed Tour Areas (Option 2)Some tour areas worked well because the drivers were familiar with them; others did not work well for different reasons. The team would need to look into all tours assess their use and come up with smaller local changes that would improve them. For example tours could be merged or split up between other tours. The borders between neighbouring fixed tours could be shifted to improve productivity and use. The overall goal was to decrease the total number of vehicles in order to save some money. Therefore the team needed to identify tours that could be dropped and fill the blank spots on the map by dividing it among the neighbouring tour areas.Introduce Variable Routing and Drop the Districting Paradigm (Option 3)Using software variable routes with no fixed tour area was optimized flexibly on a daily basis. There would not be any tactical districting anymore. As soon as the daily volume and destinations were known the daily routes were computed. Drivers would not have assigned fixed tour areas any more but would receive an optimized route on their smartphones every day. This optimization problem was commonly called the vehicle routing problem. An advantage of daily routing was that it could be determined based on the exact known volume and destinations.Change the Terminal Structure (Option 4)Until now all consignments had been shipped to the Regenstauf terminal first. This was a problem as consignments to the western areas passed by their destination and were carried back. Other consignments took a detour to Regenstauf which was not the direct way from the hub to the destination. The terminal structure could be made the subject of a greenfield network optimization. The variables to be optimized would be the number and location of additional terminals or cross docks. The team could think about using more than one terminal or at least two or three transhipment points (cross docks) somewhere in the west and south. This alternative would decrease detour mileage and increase the time available for distribution.decision timeBrandl argued in favour of re-optimized fixed tour areas (option 2) which was supported by customer service. Fixed tours had many advantages in terms of consistency while the daily routes within the tour remained flexible. Also from Brandl�s point of view the fixed areas were mandatory due to the fixed assignment of customer keys. For reasons of liability swapping keys was a difficult and time-consuming issue. The in-house IT administration while not countering Brandl�s argument argued that the in-house solution had already been capable of online routing. Therefore option 3 was not too big a technical issue for them. The TMS routing engine could exploit the higher degree of freedom to compute better daily routes. Hence full flexibility in daily routing would lead to lower costs because the vans would be better used and travel times would be minimized. It was pointed out that the main issue was the late time of departure. Since all drivers needed to wait for the last inbound van all tours could be late on high-volume days. One of the consultants argued that this issue could be tackled by pre-sorting the consignments onto the line-haul vans in the central hub and routing them to three cross docks across the service area. As a result the expected time of departure could be scheduled earlier and the distance from the terminal to the tour area could be shortened. Customer service was concerned about the willingness of drivers and the flexibility of other personnel to accept major changes. It was assumed that drivers would favour a re-optimized solution over a greenfield solution. Despite this argument Brandl remembered that local re-optimization in the past had led to a suboptimal division of tour areas. Therefore this turmoil could be the chance to get rid of all the old structures and start fresh. He expected to see better results from this option in terms of minimizing cost. Nevertheless everyone agreed that some changes were necessary and that they would need to find a good configuration that worked consistently from July onward. This solution should somehow balance the optimality of costs (minimize the number of tours per night and the travel time per route) and consistency over time (reinforce the familiarity of drivers and limit the systematic changes to a sufficient level).The team members first needed to decide which alternative to choose and then develop a plan for executing the chosen course of action. Due to the tight time schedule they needed to plan and implement a solution fast.Exhibit 1: In-Night Hub-and-Spoke Network Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Overview of In-night service providers operating in GermanyNote: � = EUR = euro; �1 = US$1.07 on April 21 2017.

No other cost item has greater influence on their profitability and on freight rates as these costs will be passed on to the customers eventually. How will the costs develop in the coming years? To answer this question an understanding of the subcontractors� costs is necessary. These include the typical fixed costs for the provision of the various truck types (realistic depreciation rates and residual value rates moderate rate of return on the capital employed motor vehicle taxes and insurance costs). In addition variable costs need to be considered (fuel consumption repair and maintenance costs and tolls assuming the average daily routes and driving hours in the domestic logistics networks).

Every day his department saw a high volume of work requiring the completion of payments through medical insurance which was needed for patients� administrative discharges from the hospital. Qureshi looked at the lineup of patients� relatives and friends waiting to make payments and pondered why the hallway was so crowded. �Roy you wanted to solve a managerial issue as an intern. Here you go! Why don�t you address this issue?� Firoz asked the summer intern Sudipendra Nath Roy as he gestured toward the people waiting. �There are more cashless patients [patients with medical insurance] these days in the hospital and as the TPA [third-party administrator] office is closed after 5 p.m. it is creating this influx Sir� replied Roy. For the next few weeks Roy tried to understand the various tasks and functions of the health administration department and the effects of these tasks and functions on patients waiting for administrative discharge.BOMBAY HOSPITAL INDOREBombay Hospital Indore was a premier private trust hospital serving 21 clinical disciplines and four allied disciplines. The hospital situated in the vibrant city of Indore in the state of Madhya Pradesh was an example of India�s state-of-the-art medical care facilities. Since its establishment in October 2003 the 600-bed hospital had relentlessly delivered multi-specialty tertiary care in central India primarily serving the region�s middle and upper-middle socio-economic classes. Bombay Hospital Indore had established a reliable quality care brand that served both in-patient departments (IPDs) and out-patient departments 24/7. The hospital�s �quality care� brand was bolstered by formal recognition from the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers and from various quality recognitions in medical forums: in 2013 it was named the best hospital in the non-metro category western region in ICICI Lombard CNBC TV18 and IMRB�s India Healthcare Awards and in the same year it received a Healthcare Excellence Award for the best multi-specialty hospital in Indore from World Wide Achievers. These achievements further reflected the hospital�s quality of health service delivery. CASHLESS PATIENTSBefore being administratively discharged IPD patients first needed to clear their hospital bills either through cash payments or through their medical insurance company. As the medical expenditure borne by patients was mainly an out-of-pocket expense admitted patients often had medical insurance that could help pay for unforeseen medical expenditures. India had two types of medical insurance: reimbursement and cashless. For the former patients paid the bills out of pocket and subsequently arranged reimbursement from their medical insurance company. For cashless medical insurance patients provided their insurance cards and the hospital administration coordinated payments directly from the medical insurance companies through their respective third-party administrators (TPAs). Bombay Hospital Indore facilitated cashless medical insurance claims by coordinating and maintaining ties with various medical insurance companies and their TPAs. Cashless medical insurance was vital for many Indians as without such insurance a large percentage of Indian patients would be unable to afford quality health care. The hospital�s health administration department personnel colloquially referred to patients covered by cashless medical insurance as �cashless patients.� The General Insurers� Public Sector Association (GIPSA) a conglomerate of four major public sector insurance companies had pre-approved certain medical procedures as special insurance packages. For instance some of the common insurance packages covered surgery to remove the appendix for the treatment of appendicitis and bypass surgery to treat heart conditions. Nearly 40 per cent of all Bombay Hospital Indore patients underwent treatment that was covered under GIPSA packages.TPAs were organizations that acted as both intermediators and facilitators for the cashless payment process between the medical insurance companies and hospitals. TPAs functioned under the aegis of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and were the points of contact for the health administration departments seeking approval for the medical expenses incurred by the cashless patients. MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGERoy analyzed the entire patient payment process in an attempt to understand the specifics of how the health administration department coordinated with TPAs for covering the medical expenses of cashless patients. The health administration personnel were involved in two different tasks. First once a physician announced the medical care of a patient was complete and the patient was ready to leave the hospital a medical discharge document was created and sent to the health administration department together with the incurred bill. An assistant nurse usually batched the medical discharge documents and delivered them to the health administration desk. The health administration staff upon receiving the batch of medical discharge files would send a text message to each patient�s designated contact person (usually a relative or friend) informing them to bring any additional required documents such as insurance policy documents or ancillary bills incurred during the treatment period. After a patient�s contact person delivered the documents the administration staff processed the medical discharge files and entered the relevant information on a web portal hosted by the corresponding TPA. This first process was termed the Submission of Documentation to TPA for Final Approval. The TPA approval process often took a long time which was outside the hospital administration�s control. Therefore patients� contact persons generally left the health administration department and waited outside but near the hospital. Once the TPA approved the expenses the health administration department staff sent a second automatic text message through the hospital management information system (HMIS) to the patient�s contact person and included instructions regarding further documents required to complete the payment process. These documents might include the pre-approval of a medical insurance claim or information related to the patient�s medical history. After receiving the requested documents from the patient�s contact person the health administration staff proceeded to complete the second process which was termed the Discharge Documentation process. This process included updating the HMIS with payment details regarding the specific TPA-approved amount and generating the administrative discharge permission. If the TPA authorized only a portion of the medical expenditure the patient�s contact person needed to pay the balance in cash. Although the time for the second process was almost identical for all patients the processing time for the first process could vary especially when patients opted for treatment plans listed by the GIPSA. Processing an average of 30 administrative daily discharges efficiency in the two administrative processes was crucial as any delay could lead to a lower bed turnover and hence lower revenue. Therefore because delays in the TPA approval were beyond the control of the health administration department there was great incentive for identifying operational improvements in the medical and administrative discharge process.GATHERING DATA AND the PROCESS ANALYSISRoy had analyzed the process and observed that a patient�s contact person needed to arrive at the health administration department for the two processes at two different times as the TPA approval was required between the two processes. Roy had also through screening the medical records and the HMIS sampled a few consecutive days� worth of data on the discharge process for the cashless patients. Time-stamps for both process 1 (i.e. the Submission of Documentation to TPA for Final Approval) and process 2 (i.e. the Discharge Documentation) were readily available enabling Roy to calculate the various processing times. Roy calculated the average time for the two processes and two types of cashless patients: GIPSA and non-GIPSA patients. The health administration department at Bombay Hospital Indore had two designated staff members who handled the two types of cashless patients; one handled only the GIPSA package patients and the other handled only the non-GIPSA patients. The two employees were efficient and hard-working and they worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every weekday. Generally TPAs also operated during the same office hours. Roy summarized his findings in a process flow diagram that showed the average time required for each process (see Exhibit 1).Following Qureshi�s suggestion Roy crunched the numbers to determine whether the current design was sufficient to handle each day�s workload. Astonishingly he saw that with the two employees no one should need to wait for service! This finding was in contrast to the reality of daily hospital operations where patients were constantly waiting to be processed. Roy thought �Where did I go wrong? Was it related to the uncertainty in arrivals? For sure we should need a third staff member to reduce the wait or at least not have designated staff.� Looking at his numbers Roy was convinced that he was on the right track but he decided to touch base with Qureshi to get some feedback.PRELIMINARY IDEASRoy�s ideas to improve overall operations and in particular patient waiting time focused on (1) pooling the two dedicated staff members�one who handled GIPSA package patients and the other who handled non-GIPSA patients�to have both handle the two types of cashless patients and (2) adding a third staff member.He conveyed the first idea to Qureshi who responded skeptically: From my experience when patient parties observe more than 10 people ahead of them they are very likely to file formal complaints about our service quality! So at most 10 per cent of the time there can be more than 10 people receiving or waiting for service. Therefore it simply is too risky to merge the two lines. Roy remained unmoved as he believed that pooling the resources might help but he was unsure whether it would be sufficient to ensure the minimal risk of an upset patient party. He moved on to the second idea to which Firoz quickly retorted �Substantiate your claim if you suggest another recruit!� Roy knew that he needed to double-check his numbers and rework the analysis because without a sound analysis and solid numbers he would never convince Qureshi.EXHIBIT 1: PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM FOR bombay hospital indore�s HEALTH ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENTNote: GIPSA = General Insurers� Public Sector Association a conglomerate of four major public sector insurance companies that pre-approved coverage for nearly 40 per cent of the medical procedures conducted at Bombay Hospital Indore; TPA = third-part administrator through which insurance companies covered medical expenses for patients whose medical procedures were paid directly to the hospital.Source: Created by the case authors.

Six years earlier in December 2011 de Silva had founded SFC with the vision to help non-profit organizations (NPO) and students. His goal originated from his early life experience having grown up in a neighbourhood affected by social issues such as gang violence and drug-related crime and from the frustration related to attaining work experience for even an entry-level position. SFC exclusively hired students to help them gain professional experience while also helping NPOs tap into the energy and ideas that Canada�s youth could offer. On September 1 2017 de Silva was excitedly preparing his team based in Kingston Ontario to work on projects for the sixth consecutive year. He was happy to reach this milestone but wondered whether his for-profit firm which was dedicated to providing consulting services to NPOs would be feasible over the long term given the current and potential market the skills and resources required the presence of competitors its past financial performance and the recent success and failure of new project acquisitions. De Silva had to ensure that the long-term business model would be feasible; moving forward with a venture that was not feasible over the long term could damage his professional reputation and waste a great deal of time and money.The Canadian Non-Profit IndustryNPOs were corporations that existed for purposes other than to generate profit. In terms of percentage of total work force Canada had the second-largest NPO sector in the world with over 170000 organizations approximately half of which were registered charities. All NPOs had various benefits in common such as tax exemption status; however only registered charities could issue donation receipts for income tax purposes. Charities generally fell into the following categories: advancement of religion (e.g. churches) relief of poverty (e.g. food banks) advancement of education (e.g. universities) and other purposes that benefited the community (e.g. libraries). Specific examples of NPOs included social recreational and hobby groups (e.g. the Canadian Automobile Association) amateur sports organizations (e.g. the Pan American Games) and festival organizations (e.g. the Toronto Caribbean Carnival).The total annual operating budget for the Canadian charitable sector was around CA$228 billion with a little more than half of that amount for wages and benefits. A charity�s operating costs were typically broken down into program costs (i.e. services provided to beneficiaries) administrative costs (e.g. salaries other than for fundraisers office supplies Internet access website hosting and others) and fundraising costs (i.e. costs directly attributed to raising funds such as marketing printing mailing and salaries for fundraisers). Given the extremely crowded sector fundraising costs had almost doubled over 10 years from 18 cents to 35 cents spent to raise one dollar. Third parties such as Money Sense magazine graded and ranked charities based on how much of the raised donations went toward programs rather than administrative and fundraising costs adding pressure on charities to fundraise more efficiently. Charities could also be scrutinized by the Canada Revenue Agency for inefficient fundraising and risked losing their charitable status. Although the non-profit sector employed 2 million people approximately half of Canadian charities were run entirely by volunteers. The total time contributed by Canadian volunteers was equivalent to half a million full-time jobs. The Canadian charitable sector drew an estimated $246 billion in annual revenues with about two-thirds coming from all levels of government. Almost all government funding (90 per cent) came from provincial bodies. When considering only so-called core NPOs (i.e. excluding hospitals universities and colleges) government funding accounted for one-fifth of total revenues whereas almost half of all revenue was generated from sales of goods and services. Other sources for core NPOs included membership fees (16 per cent) donations from households (12 per cent) and investment income (5 per cent). Some NPOs also generated revenues through social enterprises which were separate for-profit entities. The social sector was large but it was also very fragmented with 80 per cent of charities generating less than $500000 annually and only 0.5 per cent generating more than $1 million annually. The top 1 per cent commanded 60 per cent of total revenues. Donations came from three main sources: individuals (e.g. annual giving monthly giving and wills) corporations (e.g. employees giving to match corporate programs sponsorships check-out charities and cause marketing) and foundations (e.g. public and private charities whose purpose was to fund other charitable purposes). While donations could be monetary some were in-kind donations such as office supplies and canned food.A View of the Market for Non-Profit ConsultingIn Canada the management consulting services market was estimated to be worth $12 billion with almost 10 per cent of consulting services going to NPO clients. De Silva wanted to better understand the consulting market for NPO clients so his team conducted a survey of Ontario NPOs in which he asked what services they thought they would most benefit from (see Exhibit 1). After de Silva and his team compiled the survey results they discovered that more than one quarter of respondents found fundraising and fund development most beneficial with marketing and communications cited by approximately 25 per cent of respondents and partnerships selected by 15 per cent as most beneficial. The survey also asked NPOs about their satisfaction levels with consulting firms if applicable. About 80 per cent of respondents were very satisfied or satisfied with consulting services and only 20 per cent remained neutral.Although de Silva knew that global consulting firms such as McKinsey & Company had social sector practices he chose direct competitors that specialized in NPOs to define SFC�s target market. It was more strategic and defensible to build and grow a brand that was specialized rather than one that was generalized. SFC had more than 10 direct competitors in the Greater Toronto Area alone (see Exhibit 2). Most firms offered a broad range of services including marketing and communications strategic planning and fundraising; others specialized in areas such as corporate citizenship or human resources. NPO clients varied in type (e.g. social services education health arts and religion) and size (i.e. from local to national).De Silva examined three firms in particular: The Goldie Company (Goldie) was the longest-running consulting firm for NPOs. KCI Ketchum Canada Inc. (KCI) was the largest one. Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits (Endeavour) worked only on a pro bono basis. Although Goldie was the oldest firm with over 50 years of service KCI was also a seasoned firm with over 25 years of service. Endeavour which had only 10 years of service was highly localized to the Toronto area. In contrast Goldie had four offices across Canada and KCI had seven offices in various locations from Vancouver to Halifax. The senior leadership teams at KCI and Goldie were very similar consisting of staff with decades of NPO experience and professional accreditations such as the Certified Fund Raising Executive (CFRE). Endeavour was entirely volunteer-run and had a younger and less sector-experienced team. Goldie�s main point of differentiation was its decades of fundraising experience. For example the company had once helped a small hospital foundation raise $10 million within two years. KCI positioned itself as a �thought leader� in the sector and boasted the largest NPO data bank in the country with billions of dollars raised by its clients. Endeavour set itself apart from professional firms with its free volunteer-run services.SFC�s Business ModelBased on SFC�s business model the company charged its NPO clients a fee for developing innovative marketing strategies that helped them raise more funds and awareness. SFC developed these strategies by first collecting information about the client and its external environment through interviews surveys and secondary research. To do so SFC used a five-C�s research approach: company customer collaborator competitor and context (see Exhibit 3). SFC then analyzed the information using quantitative and qualitative business frameworks such as the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and used insights to identify and prioritize the main problems faced by the NPO. Strategies to address these problems were accompanied by implementation plans and measures of success. Brainstorming and using business best practices were some of the ways that SFC developed and vetted strategies. In addition to long-term projects that ran between five and eight months on average SFC also offered a workshop that lasted two to three hours over a few weeks. The affordable workshop was offered for a fee of $300 to $400 and was essentially a scaled down version of a long-term project that was priced at $2500 to more than $10000.SFC�s business model differed from competitors who had many years of NPO experience and credentials such as the CFRE. These firms typically provided expertise on traditional fundraising methods such as grant proposals and monthly giving programs. They often lacked experience however in youth-oriented trends social media and engagement which were key trends for the NPO market. Although some pro bono firms such as Endeavour provided a wide range of services they could not match the dedication and expertise in strategic marketing provided by professional firms such as SFC.SFC had the skills and knowledge to uniquely help NPOs raise more funds and awareness by drawing on the complementary skill sets of its team members who were undergraduate commerce and graduate Master of Business Administration students. The undergraduate students� strength was in youth-oriented trends and engagement and facility with social media. These strengths helped NPOs connect better with youth who used online channels to spread awareness. Awareness could lead to support relationships and donations. Undergraduates were also knowledgeable about fundraising and sponsorship through their student clubs which sought corporate support to fund their events. For example the Queen�s Marketing Association Conference was Canada�s largest such conference attracting over 150 students from across Canada and sponsorship from corporations such as Unilever Nestl� S. A. and International Business Machines Corporation. However undergraduates lacked years of professional consulting experience and were not as dedicated to their roles or to the company as more senior team members were given the students� temporary involvement.The lack of professional experience among undergraduate students was addressed by partnering them with the MBA students who usually had some professional experience for mentoring of their younger colleagues. The MBA students also drew on their business experience to help NPOs with discovery sessions (e.g. asking the right questions to understand the NPO�s current situation) market analysis (e.g. understanding donors and NPO competition) problem identification (e.g. understanding why a NPO was not achieving organizational goals) and measuring success (e.g. establishing short- and long-term key performance indicators to determine how well strategies were working).With this business model SFC�s team of more than 100 members had worked on over 60 projects with more than 60 clients from London to Ottawa including organizations as small as Youth Diversion in Kingston and as large as the Ottawa Senators Foundation. SFC built its client list mostly by acquiring new customers with John Paul dedicating more than half of his weekly hours to this activity. Due to the Canadian anti-spam Legislation e-mail marketing became more challenging and slowed business development substantially. Some help came from existing customers who referred SFC leading to 10 per cent of new projects. About the same number of projects were new projects from previous customers. The number of projects from referrals or repeat clients would have been higher had it not been for the high turnover rate among executive directors at NPOs including SFC's clients. Director turnover occurred at about one third of all SFC�s clients annually. Executive directors at NPOs were key decision makers in securing projects for SFC. With their turnover John Paul spent extra time tracking them to their new organizations or building relationships with the new directors. This extended the sales cycle significantly.SFC was chosen as one of Canada�s 10 Most Remarkable Small Businesses by The Globe and Mail among over 120 organizations that were nominated.SFC�s Financial PERFORMANCEBeginning in 2014 SFC saw increasing revenues leading to a profitable year in 2015. However the next year reverted to a negative cash flow. After launching a promotional workshop service in late 2013 de Silva expected higher revenues from long-term projects which materialized in 2015. That year long-term projects accounted for 84 per cent of total revenues versus 76 per cent in 2014. In 2016 however the workshop service represented 100 per cent of total annual revenues.SFC�s main expenses consisted of travel costs such as gas parking hotels and meals; payments to consultants and to the managing director; administrative costs such as office supplies meeting expenses computers cell phones and printing; and other miscellaneous expenses such as promotional costs and banking fees. SFC�s income statements from the previous three years showed travel expenses increasing substantially from 2014 to 2016 as a percentage of total expenses which was based on de Silva�s increased business development efforts and meetings with clients. Similarly administrative expenses increased. However payments to consultants decreased substantially in 2016 as de Silva took on more consulting responsibilities with the smaller projects (see Exhibit 4). SFC�s Success in Client AcquisitionIn June 2015 de Silva emailed Kingston area NPOs pitching SFC�s low-cost high-value marketing workshops on branding corporate sponsorship and social media. Each email had the same basic content but was personalized to each NPO. To help make future workshops more effective he included an online survey for the NPO executives with questions such as: What topics would you most like to see covered? What is the ideal length of time for a workshop? He also included a link to an article about SFC that depicted the organization as a source of value rather than just a costly service. Juanita Colbert the executive director of a rural Kingston essential skills organization called Pittsburgh Township Literacy & Skills (PTLS) made the effort to contact SFC to confirm that she had completed the survey and offered to forward it to other NPO executives which de Silva greatly appreciated.Two months after initial contact de Silva�s average time between contact points he learned that PTLS was seeking funding from existing donors to pay for consultants to develop a marketing strategy and plan. This was SFC�s specialty so he eagerly expressed interest in bidding for the project and scheduled a call. The next day de Silva spoke with Colbert for about 30 minutes to get a better understanding of her organization and its needs. As he did with all discovery types of calls de Silva prepared for his discussion by reviewing the NPO�s website and social media feeds. He also prepared one of his five-C�s framework documents (see Exhibit 3) which included a set of questions for a structured approach to the call. His curiosity often helped him pursue various different paths of questioning depending on the prospective client�s answers to de Silva�s questions.De Silva learned that PTLS was having difficulty getting clients and meeting government quotas. If this issue continued the NPO could lose its Ontario government funding and could be forced to shut down. He asked what they were doing to get new clients. Colbert explained that they mainly relied on referrals from other agencies including the Ontario government initiative Job Skills which offered free job search support. For example when a Job Skills client expressed an interest in a position but lacked basic skills required for that job the applicant was referred to PTLS or other similar agencies. PTLS also used promotional posters flyer inserts in local newspapers online advertising Facebook and its website for marketing purposes. Other topics covered in de Silva�s call included whether enough potential clients were available the reasons why a client would choose PTLS over a competitor the organization�s marketing budget and other relevant matters. De Silva also used the meeting to explain how SFC could best meet the needs of PTLS. He talked about SFC�s consulting process being based on research and analytics how it differed from other firms by having a team of undergraduate commerce and graduate MBA students and how SFC�s founding stemmed from de Silva�s growing up in a socially disadvantaged neighbourhood. He explained how his background helped him relate to the important work PTLS was doing.After the meeting he emailed Colbert thanking her for her time and mentioned that a project proposal would be sent to PTLS the next day. He reviewed his meeting notes and felt that the organization�s best approach would be interviewing current clients to understand what had brought them to PTLS how they like PTLS so far and whether they would recommend the NPO to others. He wanted to get a more well-rounded understanding by also interviewing employees volunteers and partners as well as conducting secondary research on the NPO�s surrounding area including infrastructure and demographics.De Silva included in the proposal an estimated project time frame and breakdown of 100 total people hours which included 45 hours for research 20 hours for analysis and 35 hours for strategy and implementation formulation. PTLS�s budget for the project was $500 including sales tax. Although this was far below market rates he saw this project as useful experience for SFC. The proposal was forwarded to a private funder for approval but after three weeks had passed without a decision de Silva contacted Colbert for an update and forwarded her a relevant article about essential skills trends in Ontario. A short time later SFC�s proposal was approved and de Silva called PTLS to discuss next steps. Colbert first explained to de Silva why SFC was chosen among all bidders on the project. She liked his personal story of growing up in a socially disadvantaged neighbourhood and felt that his personal connection to social causes would make him relate better to PTLS and its clients who came mainly from backgrounds similar to his. She also thought his company�s name conveyed a specialty of working with social causes. Colbert was impressed by de Silva�s questions and his efforts to listen and understand PTLS�s needs and current situation. She was glad he avoided suggesting a social media solution for PTLS before he fully understood the organization.Colbert also informed de Silva that the project�s budget had been increased five-fold to $2500 which de Silva would use for three $300 honorariums one each for three students who would each work about 10 to 15 hours on the project. The rest would be invested into SFC. Less than a year after the project was completed Colbert was excited to report that SFC�s strategy had already led to a 76-per-cent increase in program registrants which made de Siva proud of his team�s work.SFC�s Failure in Client AcquisitionDespite previous success gaining new clients and projects de Silva and SFC began struggling to secure clients and projects. On March 23 2016 for example de Silva received an email with a request for proposal (RFP) from Virginia St. Bernard a manager at Gananoque Public Health (GPH). GPH was seeking a social marketing consultant to help the organization better reach and engage young adults age 18 to 29 who lived in apartments condos and other multi-unit dwellings (MUDs). She found SFC�s service provider listing on the online job posting website CharityVillage which referred to itself as �Canada�s favourite site for non-profit professionals.� The goal of the project was to turn young adults into advocates for smoke-free housing after 38 per cent (roughly 1 million) of Ontarians living in MUDs were exposed to second-hand smoke from neighbouring units. In contrast 80 per cent of MUD residents had indicated a preference to live in smoke-free housing which was in very short supply. GPH attributed the short supply of smoke-free housing to landlords and property managers who either believed that it was illegal to institute a smoke-free policy or were concerned about the vacancies that a smoke-free policy would create. GPH felt that tenants were unaware that they could express a preference for smoke-free housing or that they did not want to wait until smoke-free housing became available.To achieve the project�s goal GPH was seeking a consultant who would use a �cascading influence model� to develop a social marketing strategy in collaboration with a working group that included GPH staff and a focus group of young adults called planners. The model�s six to 10 planners would apply a social marketing strategy to have 10 to 200 young adult advocates engage and raise awareness among Ontario�s young adults. GPH suggested that additional channels could be used as part of the strategy including online housing search platforms such as Kijiji and large housing providers such as Homestead.The project included four major deliverables: 1) a social marketing planning framework to lead the working group throughout the project; 2) facilitating the working group and project through in-person meetings conference calls shared online spaces and emails; 3) a social marketing strategy that included messaging channels and potential partnerships; and 4) a written report documenting the process findings and recommendations for next steps.GPH defined the ideal consultant�s background as follows: 1) proven knowledge of social marketing principles and practices ideally in public health; 2) extensive experience in multi-stakeholder group facilitation; 3) proven knowledge of young adults as a target market; and 4) ability to complete projects on time on budget and within specifications. To complete the RFP the prospective consultant needed to include four key items: 1) a resume that demonstrated meeting or exceeding the background requirements noted above; 2) a detailed plan and description of how the deliverables would be achieved; 3) the total cost and breakdown for the contract; and 4) two references preferably from the public health field.After reviewing the RFP de Silva submitted questions to St. Bernard on three different dates. On March 24 he asked how it was determined that the �cascading influence model� was the right approach and whether GPH was open to other approaches. She replied that the model had been used by GPH and other public health organizations for years. Although GPH was open to new ideas it felt that the model was best for this situation. On April 6 de Silva asked whether GPH would recruit the planners whether space would be provided for the in-person meetings and whether those meetings would only take place in Gananoque. St. Bernard replied the next day to confirm that GPH would recruit the planners and that 10 people were already interested. Meeting space would be provided in Gananoque but the meetings could also be located in Belleville if necessary. On April 9 de Silva asked how the RFP requirement for �a detailed plan and description of how the deliverables will be achieved� differed from the required deliverable of �a social marketing planning framework to lead the working group throughout the project.� On April 10 St. Bernard replied as follows: �The plan to achieve the deliverables is the plan on how to achieve the social marketing plan. We are looking for an explanation of how you plan to achieve all the pieces of the project. One of the pieces is the social marketing planning framework.�On April 13 the RFP�s deadline de Silva submitted SFC�s proposal highlighting key SFC accomplishments that directly addressed GPH�s needs (see Exhibit 5). He offered to discuss the proposal and address any questions. The project cost breakdown was $19000 for consulting fees $1000 for travel costs (including gas and hotel expenses) and $2600 for sales tax. Of the total fee 10 per cent was due on acceptance of the proposal and another 10 per cent was due upon completion of the social marketing planning framework. The remaining 80 per cent was due upon submission of the final deliverables which was targeted for mid-September. The project leaders would be de Silva and an MBA student from Queen�s University who had over eight years of provincial health care management experience. The plan for her salary and working hours was not finalized by the RFP submittal date.The contract was expected to be awarded on April 22 but de Silva had not received a response to his RFP by April 23 so he assumed that SFC was not selected for the contract and asked St. Bernard for feedback on the RFP for future reference. Four days later St. Bernard confirmed that another agency was a better fit with GPH�s objectives and had been awarded the contract. Although feedback was not normally provided St. Bernard sensed that SFC could use some feedback as a provider in its early stages. She stated that many of the other proposals were significantly longer with more detail about their relevant experience. They suggested plans for the new public health program using descriptive examples of similar previous work. Further most of the applicants did not contact St. Bernard prior to the deadline but still seemed to understand GPH�s needs. Other than SFC�s questions she only received a question about budgets. She said there was nothing wrong with asking questions but some of the questions de Silva sent made her believe he was unclear about what GPH needed. She also felt that his tone was �curt� or �aggressive� when he asked how one of the deliverables was different from one of the RFP requirements. St. Bernard also seemed to disapprove of de Silva questioning the �cascading influence model� approach given GPH�s many years of experience in public health communication and behaviour change theory.Next steps for SFCAfter six years of efforts to build and develop his venture de Silva was suddenly uncertain about SFC�s future. Was the long-term business model feasible? Given the current and potential market did SFC have the skills and resources required to compete? De Silva was under pressure to determine whether SFC had a future.Exhibit 1: Social Focus Consulting survey resultsWhich consulting services are most beneficial to Ontario�s non-profit organizations?Source: Created by the authors using data from the company�s survey.Exhibit 2: Competitor consulting firms in the Greater Toronto AreaSource: Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits SAMPLE Project Application and Instructions November 2015 accessed April 8 2018 https://endeavourvolunteer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Client-Application-Form-2015.pdf; �Our Services� Fundamentals accessed October 16 2017 https://www.fundamentals.solutions/our-services.html; �Clients� Fundamentals accessed October 16 2017 https://www.fundamentals.solutions/clients.html; �Services� Peacock accessed October 16 2017 http://peacockinc.ca/services/; �Clients & Testimonials� Peacock accessed October 16 2017 http://peacockinc.ca/clients-testimonials/; �Services� The Offord Group accessed October 16 2017 www.theoffordgroup.com/services/; �Clients� The Offord Group accessed October 16 2017 www.theoffordgroup.com/clients/; �Mendicant Group� Mendicant Group accessed October 16 2017 mendicant.ca; Mendicant Group �Our Work: Client List� Mendicant Group accessed October 16 2017 https://mendicant.ca/clients.html; �KCI Ketchum Canada� LinkedIn accessed October 10 2017 www.ca.linkedin.com/company/kci-ketchum-canada; �Clients� Ketchum Canada Inc. accessed October 17 2017 http://kciphilanthropy.com/lang/en/#panel-5-b; �Services� Harvey McKinnon Associates accessed October 17 2017 www.harveymckinnon.com/services/; �Our Clients� Harvey McKinnon Associates accessed October 17 2017 wwwharveymckinnon.com/about-us/our-clients/; �Our Services� The Goldie Company accessed October 18 2017 http://thegoldiecompany.com/our-services/; �Case Studies� The Goldie Company accessed October 10 2017 http://thegoldiecompany.com/case-studies/; �Welcome to an Agency with Benefits� Blakely Journey accessed October 30 2017 http://blakelyjourney.com/#talk-to-us; �Our Work� Manifest Communications accessed October 17 2017 http://manifestcom.com/change/our-work/; crawfordconnect Introducing crawfordconnect June 2017 accessed April 8 2018 crawfordconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cc-Brochure-June-2017.pptx.Exhibit 3: Social Focus Consulting Five-C�s framework (Selection)Company PerspectiveChallenges?GoalsMission Vision Values?Programs and Services?Level of impact?

One year later as the COVID-19 pandemic raged demand had fallen to half of its previous level and airlines faced tough challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic was a new and severe crisis. The responses of airlines and their alliances depended on the fundamental economics and structure of the industry. To devise new strategies for their futures global airlines had to consider the economics and market structure of their industry. Would the fundamental economics of the airline industry be forever affected? Would the industry return to a �new normal� at some point? The GLOBAL AIRLINE INDUSTRYThe global airline business had historically been highly regulated and safeguarded by domestic governments who saw airlines as national entities. In the 1970s and 1980s a wave of deregulation paved the way for increased consolidation and the formation of airline alliances known in the industry as �constellations.� Three such alliances connected their members across the globe: Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam. Member airlines of these constellations shared passengers with each other when making connections across different countries. This connection was part of a hub-and-spoke system in which major airports served as hubs connecting the localities around them.Economics of AirlinesThe profitability of an airline typically depended upon a small number of key cost and revenue drivers which the industry used specific formulas to track (see Exhibit 1). The key revenue drivers were capacity load factor and passenger yield. The unit of analysis for measuring capacity of a given flight was referred to as seat kilometres which calculated the number of seats multiplied by the distance flown. Available seat kilometres (ASK) on a flight represented the number of total seats. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) represented seats filled with paying passengers. The ratio of RPK over ASK determined the load factor of the flight which referred to the capacity use for a particular flight. When aggregated over time and across the flights of an airline these measurements allowed industry analysts to calculate the overall size and load of an airline company�s business. A high load factor in an airline�s traffic performance was usually correlated with higher operating margins and returns on sales (see Exhibit 2).Airlines had to balance capacity and load factor in the deployment of their fleet and pricing of their flights. In 2018 American Airlines Inc. (American) flew 454 billion ASKs. In comparison Delta Air Lines Inc. (Delta) flew only 424 billion ASKs. However Delta had a load factor of 86 per cent compared to American�s load factor of only 82 per cent. Therefore Delta recorded a net profit of $3.9 billion compared to American�s net profit of only $1.4 billion. To maintain a high load factor Delta often decreased capacity. In 2012 Delta�s chief executive officer declared that �capacity discipline is our key lever.� That year Delta cut capacity by 7 per cent on its North Atlantic routes. As a result its load factor improved and its unit revenues increased by 9 per cent. The final main driver of revenue for an airline was passenger yield. This yield was measured as the revenue per passenger per kilometre. Passenger yield was strongly determined by the route being flown. Airlines competed heavily for the most profitable routes most notably flights between Western Europe and North America which were popular with business travellers.In addition each route had varying levels of competition which would affect pricing. In 2019 the airline constellation Oneworld controlled 71 per cent of the flights from London�s Heathrow Airport to New York�s John F. Kennedy International Airport mainly due to British Airways controlling many of the slots available for flights to and from London. Similarly the airline constellation SkyTeam had a large market share in the airline route from Paris France to New York United States whereas Star Alliance controlled the route from Frankfurt Germany to New York United States. In each case these routes served as cross-Atlantic pipelines that funneled traffic from destinations that lay behind or beyond one of the hubs.The key cost drivers for airlines were labour fuel and advertising. The largest cost that airlines typically faced was labour which accounted for approximately 40 per cent of total costs in 2018. In years where prices were particularly high fuel could overtake labour cost as the largest unit expense. In 2018 fuel accounted for 24 per cent of total costs. The volatility of fuel prices led to large differences year-to-year in overall cost structures (see Exhibit 3). Ticketing and promotion also represented a large share of costs. Major airlines were dedicated to reducing marketing costs by cutting commissions introducing online booking and establishing their own online reservation systems. With widespread use of the Internet for booking air travel airlines were devoting larger amounts to advertising online in an attempt to increase their load factor. One notable example of a global airline�s financial information was United Airlines�the largest member airline in the Star Alliance constellation. In 2018 the airline earned over $2 billion in net income (see Exhibit 4) and recorded over $44 billion in total assets (see Exhibit 5). Mileage Loyalty ProgramsTo promote customer loyalty and develop future business airlines used mileage programs in which passengers could accumulate points toward future travel. Over time the airlines began selling some of their mileage points to credit card companies which in turn offered them as promotion to their customers. Consumers could earn travel miles by using the credit cards and use them toward the purchase of flight tickets. Recurring customers and business travellers could benefit from their loyalty status by receiving lounge access and free upgrades. Each airline had its own type of frequent flyer program. Within an alliance use of these programs was often shared by the member airlines who would accept each other�s travel miles.The economic benefit of mileage loyalty programs depended on two key factors. First loyalty programs provided airlines with a way to connect with and retain their most loyal customer base. Second loyalty programs provided a source of liquidity that could be used during times of uncertainty. Each credit card company paid the airlines for the miles accumulated by customers using their card. In return airlines accumulated liabilities in the form of unclaimed miles. Most accumulated travel miles were claimed within two years but redemption was largely unpredictable which added a layer of risk to loyalty programs.The form and operation of loyalty programs varied considerably. However the traditional form was best exemplified by the partnership between the airline Delta and the American Express credit card. The partnership began in 1996 and was extended for 11 years in 2019. The main benefit of the partnership was renewed investment in Delta�s SkyMiles credit card. In 2018 Delta estimated the annual benefit from its partnership with American Express at $3.4 billion. With the new deal this annual benefit was expected to increase to approximately $7 billion by 2023. In contrast to the traditional partnership of Delta and American Express Air Canada took a novel approach by spinning off its loyalty program Aeroplan into a separate corporation. The newly independent company went public in 2005 under the name Groupe Aeroplan. In 2008 the company was renamed Aimia and began investing in the loyalty programs of other airlines including Aerov�as de M�xico S.A. de C.V. (commonly known as Aerom�xico) and AirAsia Berhad. However after 13 years of separation from its own loyalty program Air Canada decided to repurchase the Aeroplan business from the independent company Aimia in 2018 (see Exhibit 6).Regulated Competition in the Global Airline Industry Air travel was a huge industry operating on a global scale. In 2019 the 290 member airlines in the International Air Transport Association together transported over 4.5 billion passengers and had total operating revenues of $838 billion. At that time revenues had been growing at 3.2 per cent per year and projections were for more of the same. Company performance in the airline industry was cyclical based on changing consumer demand and the price of inputs particularly labour and fuel.Soaring fuel prices in the early 1990s during the Gulf War caused many airline companies to suffer considerable losses. Overall the industry lost $16 billion from 1990 to 1993. However the next five years were profitable. Similarly the industry experienced a downturn after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center but consolidation and higher passenger yields again led to robust profitability by the 2010s. Airlines introduced a slew of fees for services and often made millions of dollars in profit on just ticket change fees. Another industry boon in the late 2010s was a decline in fuel prices. By 2019 the future of the global airline industry seemed strong although a down cycle was looming as the economic expansion that was evident in those years began to slow. Regulation and DeregulationSince its birth in the mid-20th century the commercial airline industry had been regulated by national governments in a multitude of ways. For the most part routes had to be approved and licensed by government agencies prices were set by negotiation between governments and by national authorities foreign ownership was restricted in national airlines and airlines were restricted to flying only to and from their home countries. International rules such as cabotage restricted airlines from operating domestic flights in countries other than their home base. In other words a German airliner was allowed to fly from Germany to the United States and back picking up passengers at each end-point but was not allowed to fly passengers between two cities in the United States.Starting in the United States in 1978 and spreading to the European Union (EU) in 1993 a wave of deregulation and liberalization loosened restrictions on pricing and routes. With the creation of a single European aviation market EU airlines were permitted to fly to and from all international destinations within the EU region. However travel to and from non-EU countries was still subject to bilateral negotiations between individual European countries and the non-EU country. The rules of cabotage remained in effect for the important trans-Atlantic and Asian routes.Beginning in 1992 the governments of the United States and the Netherlands signed an Open Skies bilateral air treaty that allowed US airlines to fly without restrictions to Dutch cities and the reverse. The treaty also granted KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest Airlines Corp. full antitrust immunity to pursue an alliance although they were not allowed to merge ownership. By 2016 the United States had made similar agreements with 120 other countries. Among the benefits that countries received in signing an agreement with the United States was permission for US national airlines to set their own routes and pricing between countries.But US airlines still could not fly within the EU or within any other countries. An Open Skies agreement still did not grant US carriers the right to cabotage in the foreign country�s domestic market. However by forming an alliance with a domestic partner in the EU or any country a US carrier could connect more effectively to the domestic route structure operated by the foreign airline.National Ownership and Antitrust The traditional form of alliance in the industry had been one of loose ties between two partners with no equity cross-participation. There were a few exceptions such as British Airways and Delta which were likely to take an equity interest in their partners. One of the important features of these alliances was that they enabled the partners to overcome some of the restrictions imposed by national regulations.Although many industries had seen the decline or elimination of so-called �national champions� in the 1980s and 1990s this did not happen to the same extent with airlines. In many countries national airline companies were either state-owned or protected by the government. In Europe even after the creation of the single European market in 1992 the rule was generally that no foreign investor was allowed to own more than 49.9 per cent of the capital in a national airline. In the United States the threshold was even lower�no more than 25 per cent foreign participation. Airlines were widely regarded as national assets.Starting in the 1990s pairs or small groups of airlines were able to form joint ventures (JV) which differed from typical JVs in other industries that involved joint equity ownership. In an airline JV the partners would be given antitrust immunity by the two governments allowing them to coordinate prices and capacity on a specific route and share profits. The structure thus acted like a typical JV but was purely a contractual arrangement with the all-important antitrust immunity at its root. Outside of those JVs the partners were still expected and required to compete with each other.The three major global airline constellations�Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam�did not implement this degree of coordination and therefore did not need formal antitrust immunity. However the alliance members were careful to follow antitrust regulations. On major routes the alliance groups could conceivably be anti-competitive and would then be subject to being blocked by antitrust authorities. For example in 2019 the partnership of Delta and Air France controlled 93 per cent of the Paris France to New York United States routes; the partnership of Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Singapore Airlines controlled 83 per cent of the flights from Frankfurt Germany to New York United States. Even without directly seeking antitrust immunity like other airline JVs the three major alliances still had to deal with many regulatory barriers. For example Oneworld had to satisfy the US Federal Aviation Administration before formalizing the alliance between American and British Airways. Originally the two airlines were forced to keep their mileage programs separate for North Atlantic routes. Additionally the authorities demanded that the partners give up 267 of their slots at congested Heathrow Airport a condition which they were not ready to accept.On routes requiring a connection alliances appeared more likely to be pro-competitive. Alliances had the potential to offer more frequent flights and shorter connections for secondary destinations at a reasonable price. A study conducted in 2000 by the University of Chicago concluded that average fares on international routes on non-aligned airlines were 25 per cent higher than fares on airlines that were allied. A more recent study by the International Air Transport Association in 2012 also confirmed the price advantages of increased airline co-operation for consumers on certain routes. Rising Competition from the Middle EastIn the 2010s several state-supported airlines based in the Middle East emerged in the industry. Etihad Airways (based in Abu Dhabi) Emirates (based in Dubai) and Qatar Airways Company (based in Doha) soon became competitors to the major global airlines. State subsidies allowed the Middle Eastern airlines to purchase planes and increase capacity at an unprecedented rate. These carriers also had access to cheap fuel and their home base was strategically located between the United States Europe and Asia. They specialized in long flights between the regions with a stop in the Middle East. Personnel stationed in these home countries benefitted from low personal income taxes. Etihad Airways and Emirates were two of the fastest-growing network airlines in the world. In 2011 Emirates passed United Airlines as the largest global airline based on capacity. Qatar Airways Company and Etihad Airways were ranked 10th and 13th in size respectively in the world in 2014.Other than Qatar Airways Company which joined the Oneworld constellation in 2013 none of the major Middle Eastern airlines were members of alliances. Etihad Airways and Emirates did form other types of partnerships�they made minority investments in various airlines to create their own constellation. By 2015 Etihad Airways Partners included six airlines: Etihad Airways Alitalia SpA Air Berlin PLC Air Serbia Air Seychelles Jet Airways Ltd and Darwin Airline SA. In theory these investment partnerships could include airlines that were already members of the alliance constellations. However Star Alliance regulated this feature through change-of-control clauses in its governance policies which did not permit members to become part of an investment partnership.The Future of the Airline IndustryIndustry ConsolidationDespite a complex web of regulations the global airline industry had steadily moved toward long-term consolidation. In the 2000s and early 2010s consolidation was apparent both in Europe and in North America. In the United States Delta merged with Northwest Airlines Corp. United Airlines merged with Continental Airlines and US Airways merged with American. In Europe British Airways merged with Iberia Air France merged with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Deutsche Lufthansa AG acquired controlling shares in Swiss International Air Lines AG Austrian Airlines AG and Brussels Airlines. Sometimes these mergers affected the membership of their respective alliances. For example Continental Airlines left the SkyTeam constellation and joined Star Alliance after the merger between Delta and Northwest Airlines Corp. while Continental Airlines completed its own merger with United Airlines.Airline constellations also continued expansion by adding members to their alliances. As additional airlines joined existing constellations overlap increased in route structures of members which affected how incumbent members perceived the application of new members to their alliance. For example when Singapore Airlines entered Star Alliance the financial consultants of Thai Airways International Public Co. Ltd. wondered about the effect of its current role as the Star Alliance airline that connected European hubs with Southeast Asia. The consultants estimated that Singapore Airlines being added to the group could cost their airline $10 million annually in lost revenues from code sharing in flights with Deutsche Lufthansa AG. In addition Singapore Airlines was the most powerful regional rival in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless the membership was approved by the group and the rival airlines continued to operate as partners.Entry and exit from airline constellations was governed by terms of their membership. For example to be accepted for entry in Star Alliance an airline had to demonstrate its ability to meet the alliance�s standards. Existing members voted on new memberships just like they did on other major strategic issues. Originally Star Alliance had operated under a one-airline one-vote rule; however as membership grew the organization introduced tiered voting. In 2019 voting shares of members in Star Alliance depended on the size of their business. By 2020 the structure of the airline industry had stabilized after decades of reorganization. Star Alliance had become a mature alliance organization with a stable membership and a well-developed set of rules and processes and was the largest of the three major airline constellations which followed similar strategies and comparable structures. The market shares of these groups were similar and mergers between domestic airliners seemed to have reached a point beyond which further consolidation would be barred by antitrust regulations.Potential Changes in the Hub-and-Spoke ModelSince its inception Star Alliance had made it its main focus to optimize the hub-and-spoke network of the airline industry which it saw as a key benefit. However beginning in 2015 point-to-point flights became increasingly popular especially ultra long-haul flights (LHFs). By definition ultra LHFs referred to flights that travelled over 14.5 hours without connections. These point-to-point flights reduced total travel time significantly compared to the hub-and-spoke system but they also resulted in cost savings for both travellers and airlines. Due to their higher ticket prices LHFs were less attractive to personal passengers but more popular for corporate travel. By 2019 Qantas Airways Limited�s flight from Perth Australia to London United Kingdom claimed an average load factor above 90 per cent.With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the advantages of LHFs became increasingly evident for two reasons. First unlike with the hub-and-spoke system point-to-point networks allowed airlines the choice of flying only the most economically viable routes without health and safety concerns from layovers. This had been the strategy of low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines Co in domestic markets. Internationally however a trip to the other side of the globe required a stop to refuel. Intermediate stops were also hubs and flights could connect with other incoming flights at those hubs. Second by the late 2010s new planes were being developed for non-stop ultra LHFs. For example the Boeing 787-9 and the Airbus A350-900 aircraft were particularly fuel efficient and therefore made LHFs more commercially viable than ever before.However despite these advantages LHFs still had two major limitations. First due to the long-distance nature of their routes the profitability for airlines was even more vulnerable to extreme fuel prices fluctuations. Second fatigue posed a serious health threat to passengers flight crews and pilots on these routes. Challenges AheadBy 2020 the global airline industry was at a pivotal point in its history. The rise of powerful airline constellations created a dominant hub-and-spoke system that connected member airlines across the world. However as the world was hit by the novel COVID-19 virus these very connections were being threatened and the industry was once again forced to adapt. Would the airline business return to normal after a few years? Would LHFs replace the hub-and-spoke system? How large would the business travel segment be in the future? Would industry consolidation continue to take place or would national governments take back more control over their domestic airline carriers? Many of these questions were heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic which was expected to decrease revenue by 50 per cent and net profits by $84 billion in 2020 (see Exhibit 7). By the end of 2020 the airline industry was in a critical juncture in its short history. An industry once dominated by heavy regulation and complex global constellations was now scrambling to readjust to rapidly changing consumer demand.Exhibit 1: Formulas for Analyzing Airline EconomicsNote: ASK = available seat kilometres (calculated as flight kilometres _ number of total seats); RPK = revenue passenger kilometres (calculated as flight kilometres _ number of occupied seats); load factor = ratio of RPK to ASK; PASK = passenger revenue per ASK; CASK = unit cost per ASK; unit operating income = operating income per ASK; unit net income = unit operating income minus taxes and interest.Source: Tom Stalnaker Khalid Usman Aaron Taylor and Grant Alport Airline Economic Analysis: 2017�2018 Edition Oliver Wyman: Marsh & McLennan Companies 2018 accessed December 14 2020 www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2018/January/Airline_Economic_Analysis_AEA_2017-18_web_FF.pdf.Exhibit 2: Load Factor Return on Sales and Capacity of Global Airlines 2018Note: ASK = available seat kilometres; return on sales measured as operating income � revenue.Source: Prepared by the case authors with data from �World Airline Rankings 2018� Flight Airline Business 2018 accessed December 14 2020 www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/World-airline-rankings-2018.pdf.Exhibit 3: Cost Structure of Major Global Airlines (in US$)Average Costs per FlightAverage Pricing per Flight for Select RoutesNote: ASK = available seat kilometres; km = kilometres.Source: Steve Saxon and Mathieu Weber �A Better Approach to Airline Costs� McKinsey & Company July 13 2017 accessed December 14 2020 www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/a-better-approach-to-airline-costs#; Flight Airline Business World Airline Rankings 2018 2018 accessed July 14 2020 www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/World-airline-rankings-2018.pdf; prepared by case authors searching with the �Origins and Destinations� function for final data on routing shown on tickets for flights from Jan 1 2019 to Dec 31 2019 between JFK and CDG GRA and LHR from the �Market Intelligence� Sabre accessed July 14 2020 www.sabre.com/search/origins+and+destinations/.

Before changing its name to Aimia in 2008 the company was known as Groupe Aeroplan which was a spinoff from Air Canada created on May 5 2005. The initial public offering raised approximately CAD$250 million for Air Canada and relieved the airline of all mileage liabilities. However it also separated the company from its most loyal customers.This was the first major instance of an airline separating itself from its loyalty program and few companies have ever chosen to follow this model. From its inception Aimia branded itself as a �loyalty and travel consolidator.� Although Air Canada�s loyalty program constituted a large portion of the company�s business it did partner with and provide loyalty services to various other airlines. These airlines included Aerov�as de M�xico S.A. de C.V. (Aerom�xico) and AirAsia Berhad. The services Aimia provided included loyalty program strategy design and operations consulting. These services were an attempt by the company to expand outside of simply being a holding company for Air Canada�s loyalty program Aeroplan.The strategy generally resulted in poor financial returns. Aimia�s median annual return on equity from 2005-2018 was �3.8 per cent. After 13 years of separation from its loyalty program Air Canada decided to repurchase Aeroplan from Aimia in 2018.The terms of the deal were complicated and involved several different parties. First Air Canada agreed to pay Aimia CA$450 million in cash which was used by Aimia mainly to repay outstanding debts. In return by taking back its loyalty program Air Canada assumed roughly CAD$1.9 billion in miles liability. Second Air Canada received two payments amounting to CAD$1.2 billion from Toronto Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. This money came in two forms: CAD$822 million was paid directly as cash and CAD$400 million was structured as pre-payments for future monthly miles payments. Third Air Canada received an undisclosed payment from Visa Inc. along with a partnership commitment until 2030. In December 2018 Air Canada�s acquisition passed regulatory barriers and the airline was reunited with its loyalty program. In April 2020 following the sale of its Aeroplan business Aimia underwent a corporate transformation rebranding itself as an investment holding company. In July 2020 several years after Air Canada�s acquisition of Aeroplan Aimia remained a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company had a market capitalization of approximately CAD$300 million and 95 million shares outstanding. The company�s main assets comprised a 49 per cent stake in the loyalty program consulting service Kognitiv a 49 per cent stake in Aerom�xico�s loyalty program and a 20 per cent stake in AirAsia Berhad�s loyalty program. In April 2020 Aimia was also considering the acquisition of Mittleman Brothers LLC a mutual fund with US$317 million in assets under management. Well into 2020 the corporate strategy of Aimia and the future of its 450 employees remained uncertain.

(AREUFIT) assessed her company’s position in the evolving health services market. Stuart had grown AREUFIT from a sole proprietor start-up to its current position as the Philadelphia region’s award-winning provider of preventive health and biometric screenings corporate health and disease prevention programs and wellness services with annual revenues approaching US$1 million (see Exhibit 1).Stuart had spent the last three years working with an outside consultant in preparation for the next stage in the life cycle of her company. For any founding chief executive officer (CEO) having determined a new future strategic direction represented a personal and professional crossroads. As Stuart recounted “I love what I do and I love going to work. It’s not a burden right now and I don’t want to get to that point so this is the time for exploring options.” When a competitor approached her with an offer to buy AREUFIT Stuart knew she had to make some tough decisions while remaining true to her values and business practices. She wanted to preserve the company and culture she had built protect her key employees and ensure that the brand reputation of AREUFIT would endure.The personable high-energy Stuart understood that uncertainty in the health care industry was a constant factor driven by changing regulatory and economic conditions. However the emerging importance of big data analytics the escalating costs of technology investment the increased threat of competitors eyeing the regional market and a sense of having achieved key personal and professional milestones led Stuart to reflect on AREUFIT’s future and her role in the company. AREUFIT HEALTH SERVICES Inc. COMPANY HISTORYAREUFIT was a privately held corporate wellness services firm that helped employers in the Greater Philadelphia market develop and implement employee wellness programs. It had been providing preventive health screenings wellness services and health education programming since 1992 long before “wellness” became part of employee benefits packages. The company was especially proud of its ability to deliver high-quality customized service packages designed to help clients reach their short- and long-term preventive health and wellness goals. AREUFIT had won and retained contracts with a diverse portfolio of high-profile clients in the Philadelphia market. AREUFIT was a product of the volatile health services industry. Established as a sole proprietorship in 1992 and incorporated in 1996 AREUFIT started by accident. Having pursued a graduate degree in exercise physiology Stuart supported herself by managing an outpatient exercise program for a Philadelphia hospital. Unsure of the potential insurance impact from sweeping health care reforms proposed by Bill Clinton the US president at the time Stuart’s employer reacted with deep budget cuts and the corporate wellness program was abruptly eliminated. However companies had begun to value wellness services as meaningful employee benefits so Stuart began accepting contracts from her former clients. As she recounted “one gig led to another” and offered her a way to finance and complete her doctoral degree.Risk-taking and financial bootstrapping characterized AREUFIT’s start-up. Initial capitalization from friends and family including a $2500 loan from an uncle enabled AREUFIT to make its first significant equipment purchase. While Stuart was taking part at an event a health insurance executive saw how poorly the company’s mobile health van was being managed and offered Stuart a contract to take over the van in 90 days. Stuart accepted and told her small crew “we’re going to fake it until we make it.” As the wellness industry became more mainstream AREUFIT expanded its product line augmented its preventive health screenings with health education components and facilitated connections to technology partners.The 2008 financial crisis forced AREUFIT to get “lean and mean” to survive the decline in clients. Stuart reflected on this time and said “I would never have made these changes if the financial crisis hadn’t forced us to work differently and the fact is we’ve never gone back to the old ways.” Under this lean model AREUFIT employed six full-time lead staff and up to 40 part-time and contract workers brought on to address the seasonal fluctuations of the business (see Exhibit 2).AREUFIT’s LEADERSHIP: CEO Jeannine Stuart Stuart completed her undergraduate degree at Ursinus College and earned a master’s and doctoral degree in exercise physiology from Temple University. Lifelong interest in sports wellness and community engagement was evident in Stuart’s professional and personal life. A former marathon runner and avid supporter of Philadelphia pro football and baseball teams Stuart also formed partnerships with a wide variety of non-profit organizations that promoted health and wellness. She taught kinesiology for many years at West Chester University as an adjunct professor and had been active with community volunteers in Medicine.Stuart built a business that reflected her passions and her personality. She moved AREUFIT’s offices from an office complex in Malvern Chester County to a farmhouse in West Chester Pennsylvania restored to be a comfortable casual family-culture workplace. She built a culture of autonomy and incentives indicative of the role her lead staff and employees played as key company assets. In 2012 and again in 2016 AREUFIT won recognition from the American Psychological Association (APA) as a Pennsylvania Psychologically Healthy Workplace. APA recognized AREUFIT as a national Honoree in 2018. In addition Stuart was awarded the 2007 Small Business Development Center of PA Entrepreneurial Achievement Award. CORPORATE WELLNESS SERVICES INDUSTRY BACKGROUND The corporate wellness services industry was an outgrowth of changes in insurance economic demographic and socio-cultural trends. As a relatively new industry it experienced significant growth from 2013 to 2018 as many businesses purchased wellness programs to try to contain rising health care costs. To cite one factor in response to the obesity epidemic many businesses implemented biometric screening services. According to a 2017 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) 25 per cent of companies surveyed reported that they had increased their wellness program benefits in the previous year with this trend expected to continue through 2023.A wide variety of products and services that fell under the general category of corporate wellness included programs such as smoking cessation bundled measurements such as health risk assessments or education classes on nutrition exercise and stress management.RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE THE NEW NORMALAs the cost of health care continued to rise employers continued to view the preventive potential of corporate wellness programs as a possible solution to reducing company health care costs.According to the Center for Disease Control’s National Health Interview Survey “. . . the prevalence of obesity among US adults aged 20 and over increased from 19.4 per cent in 1997 to 31.4 per cent in January–September 2017.” With the rise in obesity the number of associated health consequences also increased. One way to facilitate health promotion was through employee health management programs (EHMPs) defined as “. . . ongoing organizational activities designed to promote the adoption of personal behaviours conducive to maintaining and/or improving employee health.” Specifically the growth of EMHPs resulted from various factors including increased health care costs enhanced performance among employees increased competition globally and domestically and modified technological processes toward more automation. Since the 1980s EHMPs (also known as workplace wellness programs) offered fitness health promotion and wellness campaigns.  The Society of Human Resource Management had recently conducted its annual survey of employee benefits among US employers. Of the companies surveyed “. . . three-quarters (75 per cent) of employers offer wellness resources and information and/or a general wellness program.” According to the survey only 62 per cent of these employers provided general wellness programs specific to their employees. The efficacy of industry services largely depended on employee participation rates. Particularly related to AREUFIT’s mission only 41 per cent of the surveyed companies offered annual health risk assessments and 30 per cent provided on-site health screening programs. Although this information was not region-specific this data showed that there was a growth opportunity to partner with organizations that provided risk assessments and on-site health screenings along with other preventive and educational programs.Profit was expected to rise as businesses expanded the scope of their corporate wellness programs and offered more services convenience and possibly even access to data of their employees. Advances in technology coupled with personal wearable fitness devices such as the Apple watch and Fitbit were emerging as possible disruptors. One method of counteracting their influence was the creation and implementation by wellness services providers of workplace healthy lifestyle programs that offered comprehensive educational organizational and environmental activities for employees and their families. TECHNOLOGY CHANGING DATA COLLECTION AND ACCESS Technology used to measure an individual’s wellness information independent of situations where they were patients or undergoing prescribed treatments was categorized as person-generated health data (PGHD). A 2017 survey of 2000 employers revealed that among their employees 35.0 per cent currently used wearables and 48.6 per cent were considering purchasing wearable devices for wellness within the next year. The survey also found that 60 per cent of users prioritized the usability of the mobile application as a deciding factor. Major criteria that promoted favourable adoption of wearables included connectivity with wellness vendors long battery life and an employer-facing dashboard with a view of usage and performance. However the survey concluded that PGHD at the time lacked “. . . a clear theoretical basis a set of data models and empirically derived strategies for integrating tools and data into existing clinical applications.” FROM NICHE TO NATIONAL: COMPETITORS SEEK EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIESAn IBISWorld industry report indicated a low to moderate level of market share concentration in the corporate wellness services industry. In 2018 the top four companies were expected to account for less than 25 per cent of industry revenue. Reflecting the diversity of products services and types of providers the industry was highly fragmented.  Commonly many corporate wellness companies targeted market niches such as non-profit or public-sector organizations. Beacon Health Options Inc. for example focused its effort on providing behavioural health and wellness services to active duty members retirees and their families through the United States Department of Defense’s TRICARE program.Among the national market most companies were comprehensive wellness providers who partnered with other organizations. Their services included health risk assessments health fairs health education programs and other wellness programs. Major industry players were national companies such as Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. and Mobile Health Management Services in the private sector. Similar to AREUFIT Wellness Corporate Solutions LLC. provided consultative services to companies to develop their own wellness programs for their employees. Mobile Health Management Services Inc. was a nationwide provider of occupational health particularly for initial health employee screenings and drug test administration. Government funded agencies such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. and Pennsylvania’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) offered limited wellness services. Medical organizations such as CVS Pharmacy and Acme Markets Pharmacy were also active in the wellness industry. Various insurers also had a significant impact on the prospects for the wellness industry.AREUFIT’S FORMULA FOR REGIONAL DOMINANCEAREUFIT had a significant presence in Philadelphia and the surrounding five-county region as well as in the adjacent states of New Jersey and Delaware. As the fifth-largest US city Philadelphia offered an attractive expansion target for national companies looking to grow. As a small firm AREUFIT had been able to accommodate employers of all sizes. AREUFIT’s client list included Philadelphia-based organizations from small companies with 25 or fewer employees to large companies with 17000 employees. Another distinctive feature was AREUFIT’S practice of sending cross-trained and professionally certified employees not subcontractors to their client workplaces. Through investing in cross-training AREUFIT created a flexible staff that was able to fill needs in a variety of environments from a mobile vision screening lab to biometric screenings. AREUFIT pioneered mobile health screening vehicles in the Philadelphia marketplace. Since 1996 AREUFIT helped its clients identify vehicles for purchase vetted and oversaw vendors for the retrofitting process managed the maintenance of the vehicles and provided professional staff and management of vehicle operations. AREUFIT provided evidence-based health education tailored to meet specific client needs. The company offered face-to-face biometric reviews and health coaching health education displays and awareness campaigns and workplace seminars developed and delivered by a team of health educators. A sampling of educational services AREUFIT provided demonstrated the company’s wide range of audiences expertise and revenue sources. For example one service was teaching fifth graders about the dangers of smoking funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Chester County Health Department. Another service was providing cancer education to Chester County businesses funded by a Pennsylvania cancer education grant. Yet another service was providing vision care education to registered nurses and children in the Philadelphia school district.To augment its core competencies of preventive health screenings and education and provide the wellness “platform” employers increasingly required AREUFIT formed alliances with national data groups such as StayWell Health Management Active Health Management and WellWorks for You. AREUFIT provided essential data collection on cholesterol body mass index glucose and other areas and worked with its partners to analyze the data and create an information portal. If clients opted for additional tracking AREUFIT monitored their participation in preventive health actions such as mammograms health examinations and vision check-ups. Stuart believed that AREUFIT had a lock on the Philadelphia regional market. The CEO summed up the company’s strengths as follows: Preventive health screenings and education and the full-cycle management of the mobile health screening vehicles. What makes AREUFIT so good at what we do is we’re responsive we’re local. I think this space is very different from other parts of the country. Businesses in Philly really like to do business with other local companies.VOLATILITY IN THE WORLD OF WELLNESSSeveral key external forces that had significant impact on the wellness services industry included changes in insurance coverage uncertainty about regulations advancing technology and a lack of industry definition.Insurance in the Age of the Affordable Care ActIn the 1980s the health insurance industry shaped how corporate wellness programs were defined. More recently consolidation in the insurance industry concentrated the power insurers held. In the regional Philadelphia market three dominant companies—Independence Blue Cross (IBC) UnitedHealth Group and Aetna Inc.—replaced as many as eight previous insurers.  As AREUFIT’s CEO Stuart reflected on her years in the industry: The insurance companies are now out of the wellness business from a client marketing perspective. They claim the Affordable Care Act [ACA] put too much pressure on their profits. In response to perceived threats of the ACA they eliminated the service of helping their clients establish wellness programs. IBC as an example used to provide an account executive to help their subscribing companies identify a wellness services provider. When Independence Blue Cross cut the mobile van services and eliminated the wellness department as a cost-saving measure in 2016 their corporate clients were given a stipend to contract with wellness services providers on their own.This shift in decision-making and cost allocation disrupted the market for wellness providers. Human resources executives had another responsibility added to their already burdened departments. Competing wellness service providers had to strategically focus their services and their key differentiators to win contracts from individual companies. In addition it became more critical to attach a return on investment (ROI) figure to wellness programs. Self-insured companies with 1000 or more employees could often see a correlation between wellness dollars spent pharmacy claims improved employee productivity and lower absenteeism because they knew where their health care dollars were being spent. For small and mid-size employers even when C-suite executives may have felt that a wellness program was the right thing to do without a clear ROI figure it became increasingly difficult to justify the fee-for-services model of contracting with a wellness provider.Regulations and Tax RevisionsVarious government agencies—such as the United States Department of Labor US Department of Health & Human Services and US Department of the Treasury—provided guidance on the development and administration of wellness programs. Companies also had to comply with provisions from the ACA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 particularly those related to non-discrimination and privacy. The Internal Revenue Service issued a “Chief Counsel Memorandum clarifying that case rewards under a wellness program are always taxable as income and cash fringe benefits . . . are never excludable from income.” As Stuart summarized “There are so many regulations that you would have to just dedicate a team to making sure that you are always in the forefront” of regulatory requirements.Technology and DataBeyond the use of wearable technology web-based tracking and data collection were important factors within the wellness industry particularly since corporate partners sought an ROI for offering the programs to employees. Online platforms were difficult and costly to develop. As a result each company maintained proprietary control of the infrastructure. Even health insurance has gone more and more digital enabling subscribers to log on to their account to input an individual wellness survey.Lack of Industry DefinitionAlthough there were various forms of certification and professional training available and some regulation was in place Stuart expressed her frustration that “. . . anyone can call themselves a wellness provider” and provided the example of “. . . an individual who lost 30 pounds and wants to take you on their wellness journey.”  Stuart spent a great deal of time educating prospective clients about the genuine qualifications of her employees. Especially after cost surfaced as a key factor it was time consuming and difficult to convey the value underlying the higher price that a professional organization like AREUFIT charged. Another significant contributor to the difficulty of measuring ROI for employers was the lack of consistency in data collection measurement and analysis.THE DECISIONStuart had to make a decision: grow or exit. Ultimately her decision was shaped by her combined professional and personal tenets:I’m a firm believer in staying true to your core competencies because if you stray from them I believe that you lose your product. I have been working for the past 26 years to position my business. I've met some of my own personal goals and I feel like I kind of want to move on to the next thing though I’m not sure what it is. The climate today is what I based a succession plan on but the market is not now what it once was and I have no idea what it will be five years from now.EXHIBIT 1: FINANCIAL OVERVIEWNote: COGS= Cost of goods sold; All numbers are on a cash basis; *Expenses include: advertising automobile expense professional consulting dues/subscriptions educational expenses insurance (health WC auto GL) payroll expenses employee benefits printing postage subcontract office overhead travel/tolls entertainment wages and utilities.Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: ORGANIZATIONAL CHART FOR AREUFITThe professional AREUFIT staff consists of health educators exercise physiologists registered nurses certified paraoptometric technicians massage therapists health coaches medical technicians interns CPR/First Aid instructors and support staff.Six employees are salaried employees.

As part of its sustainability agenda Standard Chartered had launched a community project in 2012 called Silver Lining which aimed to support elderly Singaporeans in meeting their financial and health care needs.Five years later Singapore’s social and community landscape had changed significantly and it was time to review the impact of Silver Lining. As the head of community engagement and sustainability Winnie Tan was responsible for ensuring that Standard Chartered was at the forefront of corporate giving. She sought to strengthen Standard Chartered’s outreach and effectiveness in order to balance generating growth and returns with minimizing negative effects on the environment health and safety of the local community. How could Silver Lining evolve to remain locally relevant? How could Standard Chartered rationalize the need for continual funding for community investment? STANDARD CHARTEREDStandard Chartered was part of an international banking group with more than 84000 employees and 150 years of history in the world’s most dynamic markets. The group derived the majority of its income and profits from Asia Africa and the Middle East which also represented some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Standard Chartered opened its first Singapore branch in 1859 and in October 1999 was one of the first international banks in the country to receive a qualifying full bank license.The bank offered a full suite of services for retail and small and medium-sized enterprise clients; these services included deposit taking wealth management services overdrafts personal loans credit cards auto financing and mortgages. The bank offered corporate and institutional clients services in trade finance cash management lending securities foreign exchange debt capital markets and corporate finance. The bank also provided private banking services through its private banking division. Standard Chartered’s brand promise “Here for Good” underpinned the organization’s commitment to ensuring the sustainable growth of the markets and communities in which it operated.STANDARD CHARTERED’S COMMUNITY INVESTMENT EFFORTSStandard Chartered’s purpose statement “Driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity” set the tone for the bank operations which aimed to create long-term value for its shareholders and society. The bank’s community investment strategy had two priorities: global sustainability and community investment. Global sustainability in youth health and education guided the bank’s worldwide community investment efforts. For instance its flagship charity Seeing is Believing was focused on treating or preventing avoidable blindness unlocking new opportunities and bringing economic and social benefits to communities. The Singapore office was a key fundraiser in this global initiative (see Exhibit 1). The bank’s community investment projects needed to be locally effective and relevant. This was important as the bank’s footprint covered vastly diverse communities across Asia Africa and the Middle East. The bank took on various initiatives to encourage its employees’ active engagement and contributions to local communities. For instance every Standard Chartered employee was entitled to three days of employee volunteering (EV) leave which was recorded (and therefore auditable) on the company’s human resource system. The company intranet hosted EV schedules best practices and a support network to catalyze employee-led initiatives. Top managers actively participated in all facets of the program and key project leaders in the workforce were also recognized as part of their annual reviews. This naturally led to a successful employee engagement program which enabled team bonding within and across various business and support functions. In 2016 Standard Chartered saw its employees devote 3605.5 volunteer days to support the local community—a 12-fold increase over 2007 when 290 volunteer days were recorded.Standard Chartered used a partnership model for all of its community initiatives as it recognized both its own areas of strength and those areas where it needed support from partners. As a financial institution the bank was an inherently good risk manager and governance steward. However it lacked the operational knowledge and the understanding of social and community issues at the grassroots level that were needed for community project implementation. Employee volunteering was a key tenet of the bank’s sustainability agenda; volunteers were full-time employees who applied their time experience and expertise to causes they were passionate about. Hence partnerships with the right social service organizations were critical elements of success. The bank was able to rally fundraising from key stakeholders who could support the projects.Singapore: The Local CommunitySingapore had experienced rapid growth over the past few decades developing into a city state with a high literacy rate and a good standard of living. However the rapid development and population expansion had not come without a cost. While an open foreign labour policy had initially contributed to growth in Singapore’s productivity it had also led to an increasingly competitive job market a greater strain on public resources and an inflated housing market. Furthermore due to the high cost of living couples were less willing to have children and fertility rates continued to decline despite the Singapore government’s incentives to encourage childbirth. Over the past few decades Singapore’s fertility rate had declined rapidly and stood at 1.16 births per female in 2017. The combination of a declining fertility rate and increasing average life expectancy due to advancements in health care meant that Singapore faced the pressing issue of an aging population. The proportion of Singaporeans aged 65 and above was set to increase significantly from almost half a million in 2016 to approximately 900000 people by 2030—around 20 per cent of the estimated population. By 2018 the number of Singaporeans aged 65 and above would be equal to the number of youths aged 15 and below. In addition the country’s resident old-age support ratio showed a generally decreasing trend of about 30 per cent from 7.4 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2017. A shrinking workforce and increasing costs for seniors’ health care could pose risks to Singapore’s economic development. SILVER LININGThe LaunchFollowing its incorporation in Singapore in 2012 Standard Chartered recognized the critical implications of an aging population in Singapore and shaped its community investment to focus on the theme of health specifically health for the local elderly population aged 65 and older (see Exhibit 2). The Silver Lining project comprised various fundraising and community engagement initiatives that supported elderly Singaporeans especially those living alone and with household incomes of less than SGD1500. Key initiatives under the project included improving the quality of these seniors’ lives by providing medical care daily necessities and food rations.The initial launch of Silver Lining focused on providing financial support and making health care accessible for the elderly population. However at the time of the launch not many corporations were addressing issues related to the aging population in Singapore and there was no existing approach that Standard Chartered could use as a point of reference. To ensure that the project was a success Standard Chartered partnered with organizations with relevant expertise and knowledge in order to leverage their complementary strengths. Such partnerships allowed Standard Chartered to carry out various initiatives to touch the lives of the elderly community; these included festive celebrations befriending sessions food distribution home refurbishment projects and health care support (see Exhibit 3).effects and SuccessesFrom 2012 to 2017 Standard Chartered invested over SGD1 million and involved over 5000 employee volunteers to reach out to elderly people in Singapore. By 2017 Silver Lining had touched the lives of more than 8000 seniors and Standard Chartered had received two awards (Corporate Platinum and Gold) from the social services agency Community Chest the fundraising and engagement arm of the National Council of Social Service that engaged the community through volunteer work and social service programs. Providing critical medical services medical screenings and food rations for the needy were some of the direct outreach initiatives the bank had undertaken in partnership with local voluntary welfare organizations. A participant in the Stepping Out into Active Life program at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)—someone who suffered from heart problems asthma arthritis and hypertension—commented that the program had helped her to stay fit as it ensured that she was doing her exercise every day.The employee volunteering element in Silver Lining also helped Standard Chartered deepen employee relationships and instill a community-giving spirit among employees. Standard Chartered saw improvements in employee retention and camaraderie as employees had a shared sense of purpose and derived fulfillment through these activities. The bank increasingly saw projects that were initiated from the ground up by employees themselves and this was a distinctive element of the bank’s community initiatives. Standard Chartered also gained intangible benefits such as a strengthened reputation as a firm that was committed to corporate giving. As the public became increasingly conscious of corporate community investment efforts Standard Chartered’s social causes resonated well with the community.Overcoming Past ChallengesChoosing the Right PartnersOne notable partnership success was Standard Chartered’s partnership in 2012 with TTSH. The TTSH and Standard Chartered Stepping Out into Active Life partnership benefited more than 1200 elderly people and involved more than 1500 Standard Chartered volunteers over a span of three years (see Exhibit 3). TTSH which provided holistic and integrated patient care already had programs for seniors in place and had a wealth of experience and knowledge about caring for seniors and operating initiatives related to their needs. The financial and human resources Standard Chartered provided enabled the program to reach out to a larger group of elderly people.Encouraging and Educating VolunteersTan knew that the success of Silver Lining required the support of both the organizations and employee volunteers. Although the number of volunteer sign-ups across the organization had increased some employees needed to be encouraged to consider volunteering with the elderly as they were concerned about communication barriers and a lack of common interests. The younger generation in Singapore was not as comfortable conversing in Chinese dialects and this created a communication barrier for some elderly people who were only comfortable conversing in dialects. Standard Chartered sought to overcome these challenges by conducting orientation workshops where employee volunteers were given tips on communicating with and caring for seniors especially those with disabilities. Standard Chartered also developed a dialect translation mobile application (app) in 2014 to help volunteers communicate and build a rapport with the elderly participants. The app which was also available for public use contained common phrases for various dialects grouped into five key categories: greetings conversation food health and recreation. Silver Lining at a Crossroad2015 was a watershed year: the Singapore government and other organizations introduced initiatives such as the Pioneer Generation Package and the Silver Support Scheme. These provided the elderly population in Singapore with comprehensive health care benefits at a national level (see Exhibits 4 and 5). The Singapore government also committed SGD3 billion to promoting successful aging by improving social and health care infrastructure. As health care supports for the elderly became institutionalized Silver Lining needed to re-evaluate the way it operated so that it could continue to offer meaningful services. Standard Chartered was at a strategic crossroads and had to address three key issues.KEY ISSUESAn Increasing Number of Elderly with Mental Health IssuesAs the population in Singapore began to age a worrying trend that emerged was the increasing number of elderly people with poor mental health. Mental health as defined by the World Health Organization was “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential can cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and is able to contribute to her or his community.” Tan noted that one of the main causes of poor mental health was increased social and emotional isolation among the elderly especially those who lived alone. Statistics showed that in severe cases some elderly people even resorted to taking their own lives. In 2014 126 seniors aged 60 and above committed suicide—an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2000. Although the rising trend of mental health issues among the elderly was pertinent most organizations did not actively target it as they deemed it too complex. Despite their enormous impact on the affected persons and their caregivers mental health issues were difficult to diagnose and it required a great deal of financial and human resources to provide care and services for these people. Tan recognized that this was an opportunity for Silver Lining to channel its resources to this underserved segment while staying aligned with its main objective of supporting the elderly. Tan sought to leverage the expertise of a partner who would be well-versed in supporting socially isolated elderly clients. To maximize the effects of the project with limited resources Standard Chartered decided to focus its efforts on constituencies that had a significant proportion of senior residents. Other factors it took into consideration included the density of the elderly population and the average household income of different geographic areas in Singapore.Building Thought LeadershipAnother option Tan explored was the notion of building thought leadership. As part of its existing commitment to sustainability Standard Chartered had joined Company of Good (CoG) in 2015. CoG was a platform under the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre that sought to empower businesses to give better and more holistically through a “4 I” framework that emphasized investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 6). CoG’s platform had a far-reaching effect on organizations and had developed a network of over 200 members since its inception in May 2015. In addition to empowering companies it helped organizations to collaborate and tap into each other’s highly diverse areas of expertise—which ranged from financial services to food and beverages—to achieve a greater combined impact. This presented a huge opportunity for Tan who had planned to contribute to leadership and mentorship in the CoG member community. By leveraging CoG’s network to share Standard Chartered’s best practices and frameworks she sought to inspire and assist other companies in contributing to the local community. For instance Tan could share how Standard Chartered had managed to build a strong employee volunteer culture through company policies and strong support from the management.Achieving a Multiplier EffectAs Singapore’s economy flourished the number and complexity of issues faced by the aging population also increased. It was clear that the efforts of a single organization were insufficient to bring about a significant change. Thus Tan sought to rally the resources of multiple organizations with similar community engagement objectives to maximize the effects of a combined effort.One project in particular caught Tan’s eye. Samsui Supplies and Services (Samsui Supplies) a subsidiary of Soup Restaurant Group Limited and a member of CoG had used its expertise in the food and beverage industry to run a sustainable food delivery program that could provide up to 1.8 million meals per year to beneficiaries. The elderly population was a sizeable proportion of these target beneficiaries. Standard Chartered considered investing in Samsui Supplies’ central kitchen which was located in Changi Prison. The kitchen—part of Samsui Supplies’ food delivery program—engaged 30 inmates who would prepare up to 6000 meals per day for distribution to nursing homes and volunteer welfare organizations. The inmates who were selected by the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises and Samsui Supplies were provided with culinary training that equipped them with skills required for integration back into society. If Standard Chartered took on this investment this tripartite collaboration could make use of the partners’ respective strengths and resources to deliver a sustainable long-term benefit to the local community. By investing in a social enterprise project and bringing it to scale quickly to maximize its benefit Standard Chartered would be able to meet the objectives of Silver Lining and create a win–win situation for all parties involved.MOVING FORWARDAs of January 2018 developing Silver Lining so that it remained relevant was still an ongoing process in terms of both business rationale and social needs. Tan needed to uphold Standard Chartered’s strong reputation and growth while doing good; she understood the delicate balance between effectiveness and resources and she sought to justify the firm’s community investment efforts. What should Standard Chartered continue to do that would provide the greatest benefit to its various stakeholders? What measures could be taken to encourage more organizations to partner with Standard Chartered to enhance the Silver Lining project?EXHIBIT 1: SEEING IS BELIEVINGSeeing is Believing was Standard Chartered Bank’s flagship global community investment program to tackle avoidable blindness.Standard Chartered Bank had for more than a decade helped more than 150 million people in Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America to tackle avoidable blindness and visual impairment. Through partnerships with leading international eye-care organizations such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness it had improved access to eye care in communities where help was most needed.Why Eye Care?Blindness was a common global problem that affected 36 million people worldwide. With proper cost-effective interventions 80 per cent of blindness could be prevented or treated. However eye-care problems were currently being underserved by charity organizations.

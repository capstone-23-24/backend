YourStory was a media and technology company focused on helping build an entrepreneurial ecosystem in India by creating and disseminating news stories related to entrepreneurs. While Sharma was filled with optimism about the prospects of YourStory the discussions with the investor had made her realize that there were many challenges to be overcome. Sharma realized that YourStory had no option but to scale up its business far beyond its current size and scope and it needed to do so rapidly. Sharma mentally reviewed her current situation: YourStory has done well over the years and yet there is so much more to do. We are leaders in our niche and yet potential investors are not satisfied. They want us to grow to a much larger size. These discussions have made me question some of the key assumptions that I have always made about YourStory. I have to address the questions posed and design a comprehensive strategy to build the VCsâ confidence in YourStoryâs growth prospects and I should do so within the next couple of weeks to be ready for the next (and hopefully final) meeting for our first round of external funding.BACKGROUNDAbout YourStorySharma launched YourStory in 2008. She had worked in conventional print and television business media for a few years and understood the dynamics of that sector. Sharma remembered the path that led to her creation of YourStory:While working in the business media I realized that when conventional media companies wanted to focus on entrepreneurs they only focused on the large success stories. The smaller younger and high-potential entrepreneurial ventures were left out and received almost no attention or publicity via the conventional media channels; this was not just an Indian phenomenon but happened globally. This was the gap that YourStory focused on. I realized that the traditional media mainly limited itself to âbreaking newsâ while there were so many other interesting stories out there especially related to entrepreneurs and their ventures.Sharma explained why she had named her venture âYourStoryâ: âI firmly believe that if I celebrate your story you will celebrate my story. That thought was the origin of me naming my start-up âYourStory.ââTo keep costs low she initially worked mainly on her own. For nearly seven years she sought no external funding and managed with her own funds. Sharma ran the business frugally conserved cash in all possible ways and kept expenses low. In the first two years the venture struggled. It received nearly no revenues. At that stage the main costs were those needed for generating news content every day and retaining visibility for YourStory in the market. She recalledI had very limited funds then. I could neither hire any employees nor pay good authors on a per-story basis for content generation. That is where my . . . education and ability to write came in handy. For the first three years I was writing most of the content on my own. Keeping my costs under control helped me survive the tough years. By the time the business broke even I had only spent about â¹2 million in cumulative expenses. Things changed once we became relatively well known. By 2015 YourStory had been profitable for three years in a row.About YourStoryâs FounderIn 2003 Sharma obtained a masterâs degree in history from the prestigious St. Stephenâs College in New Delhi. She studied further to obtain a postgraduate diploma in communications management from MICA India in 2004. She worked for about two years as a brand advisor with the Times of India a leading English-language daily in India. Subsequently she switched to television journalism by joining CNBC TV18 an English-language business news channel in 2007. Within two years Sharma rose to become an assistant vice-president there. At that stage she quit her job and plunged full time into starting her entrepreneurial venture in the field of media and communications. Sharma was proud of the awards and recognition both she and YourStory had received in recent years. She statedI won the LâOrÃ©al Paris Femina online influencer award this year. Last year I was ranked among the top five women entrepreneurs in the Indian start-up ecosystem by the Economic Times. Coming from a media group that we compete with directly I especially cherish this award. I was pleased when I heard that YourStory was rated among the Top 500 LinkedIn influencers in the world in 2015. In 2013 [one of my ventures SocialStory] received the Impact Economy Innovations Grant Fund from the Rockefeller Foundation Omidyar Network and Dasra. In 2010 I received the Villgro journalist of the year award. YourStoryâs business modelOver the years YourStory had evolved into many niche businesses all related to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Its most well-known offering was YourStory an online media platform. Under the umbrella brand of YourStory was HerStory an online media offering focused specifically on women entrepreneurs. Sharma had also started SocialStory which was focused on social-sector entrepreneurs. All these brands were active in the online world. They were also used for organizing and sponsoring a variety of events and conferences to promote the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India.  YourStoryBy early 2015 YourStory had become the top-ranked media platform focused on promoting the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. Its main activity was publishing stories related to entrepreneurs and their ideas. It provided coverage to all kinds of entrepreneurs irrespective of their sector scale or stage of life. In recent years YourStory had provided a media platform to a large number of entrepreneurs in the web mobile e-commerce cloud computing social eco-friendly green and creative domains.  YourStory worked with a variety of strategic partners. First it partnered with technology giants such as Microsoft Intel Google Amazon Dell Cisco and VeriSign. The large technology companies benefited because YourStory was able to connect them with a focused audience of technology-sector entrepreneursârisk-takers who were often the first to adapt new technologies programming languages and solutions put forth by large technology giants. Feedback from the early adopter tech-entrepreneurs helped corporations such as Microsoft and Google improve their offerings before releasing them to wider audiences. YourStory charged these large companies a fee in return for allowing them access to its huge and constantly growing database of start-up companies. As a matter of principle YourStory did not charge the start-up ventures for these services.Second YourStory had developed partnerships with venture capitalists private-equity players and angel investors. Some of the big-name investors in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem that had partnered with YourStory included Sequoia Capital Operations LLC (Sequoia Capital) Accel Partners Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. These financial investors were interested in spotting potential unicorns among the crowd of new start-ups. YourStory helped bring these potential investors together with entrepreneurs.  Finally YourStory collaborated with many of the ministries and departments of the Government of India. These partnerships were important because the government aimed to promote an entrepreneurial climate and ecosystem in India. The Government of India had designed many schemes and supportive policies to help start-ups grow and prosper. YourStory disseminated information about these initiatives and helped the start-ups understand where to start and how to benefit from governmental support. Over the years YourStory had developed into an extremely strong brand in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. According to Archana Patchirajan co-founder of MyCityWay âWe really adore the way YourStory.in recognizes technology ventures. Like Mashable and TechCrunch Yourstory.in is âtheâ platform for entrepreneurs in India to showcase their dream to the world.âHerStoryHerStoryâstarted by Sharma under the umbrella of YourStoryâfocused exclusively on the stories of women entrepreneurs leaders innovators and change agents. From her own experience and keen understanding of prevalent social mores Sharma realized that women entrepreneurs found it especially tough to set up and run businesses in India. The HerStory platform gave space and an exclusive voice to stories and issues related to women entrepreneurs. Reflecting the sectors where women were actively engaged in entrepreneurship HerStory had stories and news from technology health arts crafts and social enterprises. It disseminated news related to a variety of government schemes on skill development and funding that were available exclusively to women entrepreneurs.  SocialStoryWhile YourStory provided coverage of all kinds of entrepreneurial ventures SocialStory focused on start-ups in the social and developmental sectors. The stories on SocialStory related to non-governmental organizations and social ventures in the education health environment civic responsibility clean energy culture and traditional handicrafts sectors. The platform provided visibility to entrepreneurs from these social sectors and gave those interested in social entrepreneurship a way to gain information about the people already active in that space and to collaborate with them. EventsYourStory organized many national and international events and conferences that provided networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. Its flagship events included TechSparks MobileSparks E-Sparks EduStars and WebSparks and it partnered and actively participated in entrepreneurial events organized by others. For instance YourStory was a principal partner for the Bangalore Business Literature Festival in September 2015. This event aimed to develop the culture of reading writing and publishing business literature (see Exhibit 1). Entrepreneurial ventures benefited from the knowledge sharing and networking that took place at such events and conferences. For instance Mir Abid Hussain founder of emo2 Inc. said âThank you for the opportunity to present at TechSparks. It was very useful and I connected with a good number of people for [business] development.â Potential investors also appreciated the forum as a place to meet new ventures. For instance Shailendra Singh managing director of Sequoia Capital India statedWe were very happy to partner with YourStory again this year and [always] look forward to participating at their TechSparks events. We find these events draw young enthusiastic entrepreneurs from all over the country and we thoroughly enjoy interacting with them and learning about their businesses. Sequoia Capital is strongly committed to investing in early-stage companies in India and we see this partnership with TechSparks as a wonderful initiative that keeps us connected to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country.The various awards that were given out at these events helped many start-up ventures gain credibility and further visibility. For instance the founder of Vindhya e-Infomedia Private Limited Ashok Giri D. who won a âsociopreneurshipâ award in 2010â2011 stated âThis award not only gave us recognition for the commitment that Vindhya had in its mission but also was able to open doors to many diverse opportunities like prospective customers investors and likeminded social entrepreneurs. This was one of the very few platforms exclusively for socially committed organizations.âApart from large-scale national events YourStory also regularly organized local-scale boot camps entrepreneur meet-ups workshops and other smaller networking events. These were typically shorter more focused networking and knowledge-sharing events that lasted from two hours to half a day and catered to an audience of a few hundred participants at most. YourStory succeeded in attracting sponsors for all its events and its success was dependent on conceptualizing designing and executing focused events that added value for the sponsoring companies. Sharma spent a large part of her time identifying potential sponsors understanding their needs and motivations and co-designing customized YourStory-organized events. She expended a great deal of effort in publicizing the events to the targeted group of entrepreneurial ventures.One of the challenges Sharma faced was that some of the events were organized in partnership with organizations that were direct competitors of YourStory. For example some events were organized by large print media houses such as the Times of India and Economic Times and others by business news television channels such as NDTV Profit and CNBC TV18. While these media organizations were much larger than YourStory they were also present in the online world and therefore they were in competition with YourStory. Despite the apparent contradiction Sharma realized that it was better to collaborate with these competitors on such events because everyone in the ecosystem benefited.Current statusBy June 2015 YourStory had published over 20000 stories about Indian entrepreneurs. It had reached over 60 million readers and had garnered regular readership from over 50 countries. Sharma and her team had hosted over 220 entrepreneur-related events in which over 1.7 million people had participated. YourStoryâs campaigns and networking support had helped numerous start-ups achieve funding and Sharma estimated that YourStory was directly or indirectly involved in about US$550 million of fundraising achieved by Indian start-ups. The firm reached over 4 million people daily via various channels on social media platforms. Its main sources of revenue were from tickets to its events rental fees for exhibit space at its conferences online advertisements registrations on profile pages for start-ups and premium-priced listings on the homepage. YourStory had achieved annual revenue of â¹43 million in financial year (FY) 2014-2015 compared to â¹39.6Â million in FY 2013-14. However increased employee benefit expenses managerial remuneration and other expenses had resulted in a small loss of â¹1.9 million in FY 2015 against a net profit of â¹5.2 million in the previous financial year (see Exhibits 2 and 3). According to SharmaThe YourStory platform reaches over 100 million readers every month. The company has evolved into various content-driven sub-properties managed by our in-house editorial team who work with a network of freelancers that provide us content. We are growing rapidly and seeing good traction in revenue (one of the best among new digital media companies in India). Weâre expecting US$3â$4 million in revenue over the next 12 months. We expect the native content [business-to-business] market to be around US$400 million in the next four years. The majority of the incremental spending is expected to be in digital [media]. We believe that we have a great chance of being one of the largest players in the segment with over 10 per cent market share in the near future.Cost of OperationsThroughout its existence YourStory had maintained an extremely lean setup. For the first three years Sharma had operated out of her own home and maintained only a skeletal staff. YourStoryâs main costs came from employee salaries sourcing news content marketing expenses and information technology. YourStory had grown to a team of nearly 60 employees by 2015. Most of the staff were either journalists or marketers. Employee costs were one of the biggest cost drivers for YourStory. Sharma explained:We have a team of 10 engineers with varied experience who take care of building new products and applications. Our major expense is maintaining the team (mainly salary costs). The editorial or content team is our largest team in terms of both numbers and costs. The cost of content varies from â¹200 to â¹2000 depending on the quality of the article and the influencer rating of the author. We believe that this high editorial cost is justified. We are proud of the fact that over 80â90 per cent of our content is from editorial/independent sources and therefore carries an unbiased message. Our paid-for stories are clearly marked as âsponsoredâ on the website. As such we do not have large marketing expenditure; most of the expense on this is around promoting our events. On average we spend 2â5 per cent of our revenue on marketing.The news content that YourStory presented on its online media platforms was from a variety of sources. These included news-syndication organizations such as Press Trust of India (PTI) or Reuters other news channels the journalists employed by YourStory and freelance journalists and writers. To ensure sustainable profit YourStory had to keep its content costs low especially on a per-story basis; thus it had to be extremely selective about the kind of stories it sourced and the quality of news offered. As an online media platform YourStory had to constantly upgrade and scale up its technology infrastructure and remain up to date with the latest in technology to cater to its ever-growing readership. Because readers were increasingly consuming content on mobile phones and handheld devices YourStory was forced to additionally customize its offerings to suit these needs.competitive Challenges YourStory faced direct competition from a few Indian online media platforms that focused on entrepreneurial stories. Among the prominent competitors was VC Circle Network which was acquired by News Corp in 2015. VC Circle positioned itself as a source of news and analysis on Indian entrepreneurship and followed a premium subscription model on its website. It also tracked innovations in technology; covered news stories about the infrastructure sector; provided an online database about venture-capital and private-equity deals in India; organized conferences seminars and events for entrepreneurs; and engaged in executive training and coaching. Another similar firm was Bangalore-based start-up NextBigWhat which was founded by Ashish Sinha. It positioned itself as an online community of founders of start-ups and product marketers in the Indian technology sector. YourStory also faced indirect competition from a variety of blogs where users shared stories (e.g. Wattpad and Figment) online business news sites and magazines (e.g. Businessweek and WSJ Magazine). It also competed with conferences such as TEDx and TEDGlobal and with sites such as Quora which allowed users to interact in a question-and-answer format. In addition YourStory faced some indirect competition from foreign websites like Mashable (see Exhibit 4) and TechCrunch (see Exhibit 5).Expansion optionsSharma struggled with the question of how to scale up a niche entrepreneur-oriented online media company to reach a mass user base of over 200 million users. Her challenge was to scale up the venture grow its loyal readership and gain market share in an extremely competitive and evolving media marketplace. She realized that she had many alternatives from which to choose.Going VernacularOne of the options Sharma was considering was tapping into the vernacular language market in India. This meant that the English-language stories currently being showcased on YourStory would be translated into various regional Indian languages. Sharma explained:There is reason to consider going vernacular with our services. After all the English language despite being popular in India has a limited reach. Stories in English are typically only consumed by urban educated middle- and upper-class consumers. But there is an entire other part of the vast Indian population that will remain left out if we continue to follow an English-only approach. We have the potential to expand the number of our news consumers significantly if we venture into vernacular language-based services. However [this shift represents] a costly option. First we have to consider the cost of translating our English-language stories into vernacular languages. I recently explored a few technological solutions for automated translation but the results were not entirely satisfactory. At this stage I envisage having to employ teams of translators who would translate our English-language stories into vernacular languages. Additionally there is the cost of technology to ensure that our stories are presented or rendered in a user-chosen language. Also Iâm unsure as to whether we should begin with one or two languages at first and then roll out to all the major Indian languages or go with a âbig bangâ approach on this. Our burn rate on this expansion option will depend on how many languages we choose to provide our services in.Adopting a Hyperlocal FocusYourStory was also considering the option of going âhyperlocalâ with its stories meaning its stories would not be limited to content that appealed to a wide national audience but could instead focus on local stories that appealed to smaller-sized but highly focused audiences in each geographic area. These stories would be about entrepreneurial developments taking place in a suburb city district or state. The appeal would be very strong because the stories were about people in the vicinity of the readers. However the appeal of each story would be limited to a small number of readers. It was possible that each story would only be read by a few dozen or a few hundred readers who belonged to the town or district featured in the story. Sharma described the opportunity:I find going hyperlocal very exciting. Unlike mainstream channels our hyperlocal focus would make us the preferred news outlet for local communities. I believe that people are as interested in news about the developments in their immediate vicinity as they are in larger national and global news. In fact my hunch is that hyperlocal news would have a more loyal and regular readership; this is something that would appeal to anyone funding us. Sharma realized that going hyperlocal was easier said than done. She explained: The first issue is with content. While there is a mature market for development or syndication of content related to national and global stories content for local stories is relatively scant. Also quality of content is very variable when it comes to local news. Our costsâcosts of developing content on a daily basis monitoring quality and ensuring relevance to the unique needs tastes and preferences of hundreds of local communitiesâseem like an insurmountable challenge. We currently have a team of about 60 people engaged with content-related activities. If we continue to follow our existing model we will need 10 times that number of employees to achieve a hyperlocal business. This certainly doesnât seem to be the right way to grow. I know that the market is attractive but we need to find the right business model to service it. Moving from Niche to Mass MarketAnother alternative Sharma considered was moving away from an exclusive focus on entrepreneur-related stories to become a more mainstream news player. She explained that choosing a very generic name YourStory for her business made it âpossible to expand the scope of our business beyond entrepreneurship to any kind of news.â She continued: âI have the opportunity to move in any or even all directions while leveraging the brand. I am considering making available more broad-based content related to entertainment movies and celebrity gossip.âHowever the issue was with the preferences and loyalty of YourStoryâs existing reader base. Sharma worried that going from being a niche player that was fully focused on entrepreneurial ecosystem-related stories to being a generic news site would disillusion the companyâs current consumer base. It would also dilute the YourStory brand that Sharma had built up assiduously over the years. She said âToday I am fortunate to have the goodwill and affection of a core . . . loyal audience. In trying to reach out to a wider audience I donât want to risk losing my loyal customers.â Sharma knew that for her business to scale up massively (without a linear increase in costs) she needed to source stories from users themselves. She was considering developing technology that would allow readers to contribute their stories directly to YourStory. This democratization of content would give readers the power to share their own stories easily with the rest of the world. One option was that Sharma could develop the required technology in house. Another option was to acquire a company that already had such technology available. Sharma had come across one such company: Papyrus Editor (Papyrus) founded by Gaurav Tiwari in 2012. Papyrus had developed a simple online editor that helped authors create e-books using a straightforward user interface (see Exhibit 6).Targeting Other NichesSharma stated that she was also eager to consider other niches that YourStory could expand into:We have a track record of identifying and exploiting niches profitably; we have done so many times in the past few years. I believe that there are many other niches that could be targeted. For instance one niche that I am actively exploring is that of extremely short stories. These stories would typically be three- to four-line news items that could be consumed very quickly by readers. I believe that a lot of our readers are busy people and this service is likely to appeal to them. People could read such stories while on the move or when they took a few minutesâ break from their work. Also such stories would be extremely convenient to consume on mobile and handheld devices. There are many other such niche ideas I am exploring all the time. Yet Sharma realized that targeting niches was not without its challenges adding[Going] after a niche has its challenges. If the niche is really small it will not make us much money. If the niche expands over time competitors will notice and jump in with their solutions. Entry barriers are typically low and hence profits will be affected once competition enters the scene. In general my experience has been that targeting niches has kept the work environment at YourStory very start-up like. We are always in a project mode going after one niche or another. While that has been exciting it can also be very stressful.Focusing on Start-Up JobsAnother idea that Sharma was toying with was to start an online job portal focused on openings in start-up organizations. Because YourStory already regularly interacted with a large number of start-ups Sharma believed that they would be willing to share their job openings on the YourStory portal. She was banking on YourStoryâs goodwill and strong brand to kick-start this new business. She explained: I am hoping that our vast network of contacts in the start-up ecosystem will be useful for the online job portal. Jobseekers know us from our website and from our technology events. That we are focused on start-ups is well known in the market. Jobseekers could look to us as their first choice of information when they are looking for a job with a start-up company in India.  However Sharma was not entirely confident about venturing into a job portal because this was very different from her news-oriented business. Further there were already many different online job portals in India such as Naukri.com and Monster.in. The online job portal business was extremely competitive and would require YourStory to develop entirely new organizational capabilities. ConclusionSharma had to make some quick and decisive moves. Having previously been part of many entrepreneurâVC conversations Sharma realized that the possibility of massively scaling up was what attracted VCs the most especially in the online media and technology space. Growing organically and at a relatively steady pace as YourStory had for the last seven years was not enough; nor was it enough to grow only by grabbing opportunities as they came upâinvestors were looking for proof of a big-picture strategic plan. It was important that Sharma be in control of her businessâs direction. It was equally if not more important to appear to be in control of where YourStory was headed in the coming few years. Sharma was confident about being in the right industry and poised for rapid growth. At the same time she understood that potential investors would translate their initial interest into actual investments only if she was able to demonstrate that YourStory had a coherent comprehensive and consistent story of its own.Exhibit 1: YourStory Meet-ups in MayâJune 2015Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Yourstory Profit and Loss account (in â¹)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = â¹63.88 on July 31 2015.Source: YourStory financial returns (Form AOC-4-031215) filed with the Registrar of Companies Ministry of Corporate Affairs Government of India.Exhibit 3: Yourstory Balance Sheet (in â¹)Note: â¹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = â¹63.88 on July 31 2015.Source: YourStory financial returns (Form AOC-4-031215) filed with the Registrar of Companies Ministry of Corporate Affairs Government of India.Exhibit 4: Profile of Mashable Inc.Source: Created by the case authors based on content from âAboutâ Mashable accessed September 4 2016 http://mashable.com/about; Michael Dunlop âInterview with Pete Cashmore Founder of Mashable.comâ Retire@21 accessed September 4 2016 www.retireat21.com/interview/interview-with-pete-cashmore-founder-of-mashable-dot-com; and âMashable Overviewâ CrunchBase accessed September 4 2016 www.crunchbase.com/organization/mashable#/entity.Exhibit 5: Profile of TechCrunchSource: Created by the case authors based on content from âAbout TechCrunchâ TechCrunch accessed September 4 2016 https://techcrunch.com/about/#about-tc.Exhibit 6: profile of Papyrus editorSource: Created by the case authors based on content from Team YS âYourStory Media acquires e-book creator Papyrus Editorâ November 30 2015 accessed August 1 2017 https://yourstory.com/2015/11/yourstory-acquires-papyrus-editor/; and Disha Sharma âYourStory Acquires e-Book Publisher Papyrus Editorâ accessed September 4 2016 www.vccircle.com/news/media-entertainment/2015/12/01/yourstory-acquires-ebook-publisher-papyrus-editor.

The �sun never sets� for China Eastern Airlines with flights in the air at any given time. We have the most advanced and comfortable aircrafts have built a global route network have simplified passenger travel and have improved the on-board service to be more personalized and user-friendly. More importantly we are actively involved in international airline affairs building a global network joining the top airline alliance and developing close partnerships with the world�s leading airlines; [China Eastern Airlines] has gained a commanding voice in the global airline industry.Shaoyong Liu chairman China Eastern Airlines Corporation LimitedFaced with fierce competition from major domestic and international airlines in 2014 Shaoyong Liu chairman of China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (China Eastern) first introduced the company�s �Pacific Plan.� The plan involved a comprehensive upgrade of hardware and software services to enhance the competitiveness of China Eastern�s cross-Pacific routes. Since November 2014 Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts were allocated for long-haul trans-Pacific routes and became the main force of the Pacific Plan. Seizing opportunities brought forward by the introduction of new-generation long-haul aircraft and in-flight Internet network services China Eastern built a new brand image with international influence. From 2014 to 2018 the China Eastern North America team made concerted efforts in expanding its route network and optimizing transit opportunities through �gateway� cities in China and North America. At the end of 2018 China Eastern operated a total of ten North American routes reaching international metropolitan cities including New York City Honolulu San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago Toronto and Vancouver. Among these eight routes seven departed from Shanghai. China Eastern strove to become more global by continuing to extend its influence from Shanghai to the rest of the world.With the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017 a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government what should China Eastern Airlines do to continue to expand its Shanghai-based globalization strategy?China Eastern AIrlines COrporation�History and BackgroundChina Eastern was one of China�s top three major state-owned air transportation companies headquartered in Shanghai. China Eastern first listed its H shares on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the New York Stock Exchange in February 1997. In October of the same year China Eastern issued and listed its A shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This signified the first Chinese airline to list its three securities on three stock exchanges.Air China Limited China Southern Airlines Company Limited and China Eastern dominated 64.6 per cent of the market share in China; the remaining market was shared by smaller airline companies such as Hainan Airlines Co. Ltd.The scope of China Eastern�s business included domestic international and regional air transportation of passengers cargo mail and luggage as well as other airline services. As China�s second-largest carrier by number of passengers China Eastern aimed to exploit potential in the domestic market as it boosted domestic and regional flight frequencies from Shanghai to other Chinese cities.On the international front China Eastern accelerated the pace of international expansion by increasing flight frequencies to international destinations. On June 21 2011 China Eastern joined SkyTeam Airline Alliance (SkyTeam) allowing the company to extend its flight network from Shanghai to 1150 destinations in 175 countries around the world. China Eastern leveraged the SkyTeam platform and route network of member airlines and commenced a code-sharing operation with over 10 SkyTeam member airlines covering 797 routes. China Eastern also sustainably commenced intensive co-operation with SkyTeam members in alliance projects such as SkyPriority SkyTeam Hubs and SkyPort. Furthermore China Eastern also strengthened its partnerships with SkyTeam members such as Air France-KLM S.A. (Air France-KLM) Delta Airlines Inc. (Delta) and China Airlines to continuously develop an international brand with a global influence.Brand DevelopmentCore ValueChina Eastern�s core brand value was �world-class hospitality with Eastern charm.� The company strove to provide globally integrated aviation services and logistics. Through the implementation of its brand operation strategy China Eastern dedicated itself to providing �accurate delicate and precise� quality of service in creating splendid travel experiences for global customers.Brand OrientationChina Eastern built world-class aviation services to ensure its safe operation. China Eastern emphasized the services and experiences it provided to its customers. Adhering to the service philosophy of �customer-oriented and dedicated services� China Eastern introduced the �Eastern Miles� frequent flyer program an incentivized program that allowed its members to enjoy benefits offered by 19 SkyTeam airlines as well as the use of more than 750 VIP airport lounges across the world. China Eastern also promoted marketing campaigns such as �Members Day� and the �818 Big Sale� aiming to develop a strong frequent-flyer member base and customer resources. By the end of 2018 the Eastern Miles frequent-flyer program had reached 39.63 million members.China Eastern steadily increased its service quality and services by vigorously promoting online service integration. Self-service check-in was expanded to 88.11 per cent of locations and the self-service check-in rate in China exceeded 78 per cent. China Eastern was committed to creating a digitalized airline that brought great convenience to passenger travel. Online service system and the luggage inquiry system were developed to enhance the customer�s travelling experience.Brand StyleWith a focus on building an �exquisite elegant [and] fashionable� brand style China Eastern was dedicated to pursuing service quality improvement and providing its customers with safe comfortable and convenient air transport services. The airline aimed to create an exclusive service brand by optimizing customer experiences. China Eastern constantly improved hardware service facilities; for instance it upgraded Shanghai Pudong International Airport�s high-end check-in area and renovated 37 VIP lounges at 13 airports. The Eastern Miles platinum card was introduced to forge a brand dedicated to high-end services.North American Lines and Call CentreOn August 6 1991 China Eastern opened its first trans-Pacific long-haul international route connecting Shanghai to Los Angeles. On June 16 2004 China Eastern extended its flight network connecting Shanghai to Vancouver by introducing the second North American long-haul route. Over the next ten years China Eastern focused its strategy on establishing transportation hubs by opening various international routes for long-haul flights to extend its flight converge. With Shanghai as China Eastern�s core hub five international routes for long-haul flights were added to the network connecting Shanghai with New York City Honolulu San Francisco Toronto and Chicago. In 2014 China Eastern founded a marketing centre in North America to expand marketing channels in the United States. In 2015 the marketing centre expanded its network to include airline routes to Canadian cities. With a focus on enhancing customer value China Eastern developed an international e-commerce platform to expand its sales channel in North America. As of 2015 China Eastern presently had a total of 73 flights flying from China to North America each week. It had become the third-largest carrier in the China�US market and the second-largest carrier in the China�Canada market.Informatization was the �engine� of brand internationalization. China Eastern formed digitized systems for major business services such as international operation control aircraft affairs and management control to enhance the customer experience. On November 17 2016 the North American call centre was established for airline services support and inquiries for North American routes. China Eastern vigorously promoted online service integration such as with their online self-service check-in system luggage inquiry system and abnormal flight information release platform to increase service quality; for example offline cabin meals can be selected through this online system in advance. The airline also developed a mobile marketing and service platform leveraging channels such as WeChat to provide passengers with always connected and 24-7 travel information services.The Pacific PlanChina Eastern aimed to accelerate the globalization process by strengthening its co-operation with partners in the aviation industry. With the goal to further optimize and better serve the North American market Liu rolled out the Pacific Plan in 2014 aiming to expand China Eastern�s route network and enhance the airline�s competitiveness in North America. Considering its customers� needs China Eastern expanded the VIP airport pickup service to Los Angeles New York and San Francisco as well as a series of overseas services cooperation with Delta to jointly implement customer development plan and to enhance service quality for foreign customers.From 2016 to 2018 China Eastern prioritized the Pacific Plan as one of its core marketing strategies with which to strengthen its international brand. The plan was also conducive to the company�s internationalization process. Taking the opening of new routes in North America as opportunities China Eastern expanded its route hub network marketing network and service security network laying a solid foundation for the company�s internationalization strategy. As of 2015 China Eastern had a total of seven gateway cities in North America�Los Angeles New York San Francisco Chicago Honolulu Vancouver and Toronto�providing as many as 73 flights per week enhancing the airline�s trans-Pacific long-haul capacity. Through a series of operations promotions service enhancement and customer development China Eastern�s North American routes became profitable in 2015. In 2016 China Eastern was ranked for the first time as one of the top 500 most valuable brands making Brand Finance�s Global 500 list for three consecutive years.In order to meet the increasingly intense competition in the global airline industry China Eastern actively co-operated with industry partners. In 2015 China Eastern co-operated with Delta as a strategic investor to establish a global strategic partnership. China Eastern actively sought strategic partnerships through joint ventures equity investments and mergers and acquisitions to acquire a global competitive advantage. Moving forward China Eastern planned to continue deepening its partnership with Delta by further expanding the code-sharing coverage and marketing channels. By taking advantage of Delta�s resources and established flight network in the United States China Eastern would be able to expand its own route network and optimize transit opportunities through the gateways of China and the United States. Meanwhile customer experiences related to shared and improved airport resources facilities and services; procedures for travellers; and an established luggage information system would be enhanced through partnership. For example Delta customers would have access to China Eastern�s network of premium lounges while the same would be true for China Eastern customers in Delta facilities. The strategic partnership between China Eastern and Delta would be a win-win enabling both parties to build and share an airline network with global coverage.In July 2017 China Eastern made a strategic investment in Air France-KLM purchasing a 10 per cent stake. The new landscape of the global aviation industry that China Eastern actively participated in had gradually formed and positioned China Eastern as more international than before. The Development of the New York LineSince its development China Eastern�s New York line had remained relatively stable in terms of capacity with significant expansions taking place in 2010 and 2016. Seizing the opportunities brought by Expo 2010 Shanghai China and the relaxation of visa requirements the China Eastern New York line increased its flight frequency from four flights per week to seven. Growth of the New York line�s capacity remained stable between 2012 and 2015. After November 2014 China Eastern extended some of its flight network by introducing the Fuzhou�Shanghai�New York route. Every Tuesday and Thursday direct Shanghai�New York flights were extended to Fuzhou providing more convenience and choices for Fuzhou travellers. Meanwhile China Eastern replaced the old A346 aircraft with new-generation long-haul wide-body aircraft�the Boeing 777 series. In order to meet the growing demand of the market in December 2015 the China Eastern New York line expanded to 14 flights per week (including the Fuzhou�Shanghai�New York route). As of May 2018 China Eastern�s Shanghai�New York four-hour minimum connecting time (MCT) original destination routes had a total of 109 flights monthly representing a capacity increase of 5.5 per cent as compared to 2017 while its six-hour MCT original destination routes had a total of 115 flights monthly representing a capacity increase of 3.2 per cent as compared to 2017.Strategy for Pricing International Flight TicketsThe objectives of China Eastern�s strategy for pricing international flight tickets were formulated to (a) determine optimal pricing to ensure China Eastern�s survival in the increasingly competitive market; (b) gain market share in the global market; (c) maximize the unit margin; (d) optimize operations; and (e) enhance revenue quality. China Eastern pursued a cost-plus pricing strategy which consisted of identifying and totalling all flight costs and then setting air ticket prices at a certain percentage above total unit cost in order to drive profitability. Meanwhile China Eastern took into account the competitive and legal environment in which the company operated. For certain international routes China Eastern pursued a competitive pricing strategy which set the ticket price based on the prices of similar competitors in the market. As the airline industry was highly subject to seasonality during periods of higher demand such as the peak season of summer China Eastern�s pricing strategy was adjusted based on dynamic demand fluctuating daily due to market demand factors and flight capacity. The level of revenue control and ticket pricing was also enhanced with the help of technological means such as megadata and cloud computing. China Eastern had started testing a strategy that leveraged machine-learning algorithms to customize airfare pricing and itinerary results based on collected customer data. The airline promoted informatization as it led to continual enhancement of operational management and the ability to reform and innovate in the competitive business environment.Throughout its development China Eastern continued to focus on extending its reach to the rest of the world and establishing itself as a global airline. China Eastern innovated on all fronts of its business to remain agile to meet the changing dynamics of the global airline market.brand DEVELOPMENT IN the NORTH AMERICAN MARKETSales ChannelWith �world-class hospitality� and �Eastern charm� China Eastern made continuous efforts to modernize sales and branding in North America. China Eastern constructed a marketing service centre and distribution channel in North America to build consumer confidence and trust. Adhering to the service philosophy of �customer-oriented and dedicated service� China Eastern continuously strengthened service software and hardware to optimize the customer travel experience. The establishment of a marketing system in North America brought opportunities for China Eastern. The company comprehensively promoted sales and distribution channels to enhance its ability to secure high-value customers. China Eastern emphasized strengthening co-operation with travel management companies online travel agents and major corporate clients. By taking advantage of the partnership with Delta China Eastern further expanded the code-sharing coverage and strengthened marketing co-operation. Furthermore to effectively broaden direct sales channels in North America China Eastern strengthened its online sales channels via its official website optimized the functions and settings of mobile applications and launched brand marketing through self-owned media.Meanwhile China Eastern strove to promote informatization and digitalization as well as to enhance operational management and control marketing channels. With the fast development of the mobile Internet promoting mobile applications became an important way to increase direct sales improve service and optimize the customer�s travel experience. As a result China Eastern revitalized its online sales channel to ensure appeal to a newer generation of travellers who were more Internet-savvy. In 2017 the airline�s revenue from direct sales increased by 34.3 per cent as compared to 2016 representing 51.2 per cent of revenue while agency fee expenses were continuously reduced. In 2018 China Eastern�s revenue increased to �114.93 billion�a 12.99 per cent growth.Integrated Marketing CommunicationChina Eastern aimed to enhance its brand awareness and reputation in North America. In co-operation with the American Association of Advertising Agencies China Eastern made continuous advertising investments in various sales channels to formulate advertisements and promotional projects. Meanwhile leveraging social media platforms. China Eastern promoted awareness of its brand and enhanced its market influence through various marketing campaigns in North America.The company deepened its partnership with Delta to jointly establish a route in the China�US market. The concerted efforts in expanding the route network in the United States and optimizing transit opportunities through the gateways of China and the United States allowed China Eastern to expand marketing channels in the US and enhance its influence in North American markets. At the same time China Eastern sought partnership opportunities that would increase brand awareness and loyalty generate revenue and support positive community involvement. China Eastern also actively sponsored a number of cultural and charitable events to promote its brand through airline ticket auctionsInternal ManagementChina Eastern established a comprehensive internal control manual for principal departments and branches in North America. It thoroughly reviewed and established the rules and regulations of its New York sales department. Thereafter the company formulated the work manual for its North American marketing centre which standardized the daily operational procedures and management of the business departments in North America.Moreover China Eastern steadily promoted a �delicate� management strategy and strengthened communication between departments and branches. Through establishing integrated management in departments such as sales marketing information technology and operations China Eastern in turn strengthened communication between headquarters and employees so as to optimize business processes and enhance foundational management in the North American marketing department. Furthermore China Eastern pushed ahead to create a harmonious corporate culture and labour relationship increasing employee recognition as well as loyalty towards the company. Employees were held accountable for completing assigned tasks and performing the duties required by their jobs. This in turn firmly fostered a sound atmosphere for continuous improvement in areas such as marketing and sales customer services and safe operation. As an important destination in China Eastern�s global network North America had been a focal point of the airline�s expansion strategy. By leveraging its existing partnerships and expertise China Eastern was able to successfully uphold its �world-class hospitality with Eastern charm� brand during its expansion.CHALLENGESChina Eastern rolled out the Pacific Plan to develop the China�North America sector operating ten trans-Pacific routes to seven gateways in North America. However aside from the brand awareness attained in major gateway cities in the United States and Canada China Eastern�s brand awareness was relatively low among North American cities thus hindering the airline�s ability to capture market share beyond these major cities and limiting steady long-term growth.The airline�s international operations were subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Foreign carriers such as United Airlines Inc. had built a robust flight network in the United States and Canada placing significant competitive pressure on other network carriers in the market. Although alliance with foreign carriers such as Delta allowed China Eastern to increase its ability to sell international transportation services to US gateway cities China Eastern faced competitive pressure from an increasing number of medium-sized Chinese airlines that had actively expanded their flight networks into North America. As more carriers obtained increased access to interior US passenger traffic beyond the traditional US gateway cities international air traffic flight rights and related resources became scarce.. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND DEVELOPMENTThe 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China which took place on October 18 2017 emphasized �going global� and implementing the Belt and Road Initiative. How should China Eastern adjust its international strategy of Shanghai-based globalization?

KLIC was developed by Cinépolis de México S.A. de C.V. (Cinépolis) a private Mexican company owned by Organización Ramirez S.A.. So far KLIC operated only in Mexico.At Cinépolis the core business had traditionally been cinema theatres but the KLIC project was important now because streaming was becoming a bigger and bigger business and Cinépolis suspected that interesting synergies might be found between its theatre business and the new streaming unit. Cinépolis a large multinational might in principle capitalize on its presence around the world to push KLIC internationally.The challenge for Sánchez was to learn from KLIC’s performance in Mexico so far to create a strategy for the product that would make it a success going forward—and perhaps internationally.A BRIEF HISTORY OF CINÉPOLISThough Mexicans loved movies (they were the world’s fourth most avid moviegoers) investing in Mexican movie theatres had not always been an obvious business proposition. At one time the price of admittance was included in the canasta básica (basic basket) of government price-controlled goods. A single union covering the entire movie theatre industry kept labour costs high and the government competed in the space with its own subsidized theatres. But that business ecology changed in 1994 when Mexico Canada and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); price controls on the box office were lifted and the government exited the movie theatre business.Organización Ramírez—founded by Enrique Ramírez Miguel with Cine Salamanca in the Mexican city of Morelia—meant to seize the new opportunity. In 1994 it took the name Cinépolis and began investing heavily in the multiplex model where several screens shared a common roof and a box office. But NAFTA brought foreign competitors. Enrique had an answer to this: his twenty-something grandson Alejandro Ramírez. Enrique sent his grandson newspaper clippings about the arrival of U.S. theatre-chain competitors and a note: “Alex we need you.” Alejandro left his studies at the University of Oxford to become the director of General Operations at Cinépolis in 1996; later in 2004 he became chief executive officer.Under Alejandro’s growth-obsessed management Cinépolis came to own more than half of all movie theatres in Mexico capturing almost 70 per cent of the country’s film-going market. Without price controls time at the movies was affordable to only about one-fourth of Mexicans (contributing to movie piracy) but this was still 33 million people. Mexicans went to the movies almost religiously making the Mexican market surprisingly lucrative—so lucrative in fact that Mexican filmgoers had helped turn Cinépolis into the fourth-largest theatre chain in the world ranked by number of theatres. But other metrics existed: ranked by ticket sales Cinépolis took the number two slot and ranked by average theatre occupancy Cinépolis had become the world champion.The company’s success had spilled over beyond its home base. In addition to theatres in about 100 cities inside Mexico the theatre giant was now in well over 100 cities outside of Mexico spread over 13 countries in the Hispanic world (Latin America and Spain) as well as in the two biggest cinema markets in the world: India and the United States. In 2017 Cinépolis had 5170 screens to its name for a staggering total of 1090942 seats spread across many cities and towns (see Exhibit 1).THE CINÉPOLIS RECIPE FOR GROWTHFrom 1996 under Alejandro’s management Cinépolis had tinkered constantly reinvesting more than 80 per cent of its profits. To make additional investments the company in recent years had taken on debt for the first time (of an undisclosed amount). The company’s mantra was growth and Cinépolis had grown. Dominant in the Mexican market it had only one strong competitor there: Cadena Mexicana de Exhibición S.A. de C.V. (Cinemex) (see Exhibit 2).A Talent for InnovationSome of Cinépolis’ investment went to the construction or purchase of new theatres increasingly outside of Mexico and a significant portion also went to generating technology experience and service innovations which became a big part of the company’s vocation and culture.On the experience and service front Cinépolis amazed those who thought there was not much of anything new you could do with movie theatres. In 1997 the company began building theatres with seating organized on a “stadium” incline so that nobody’s view would ever be blocked by those in front. In 1999 it introduced the more expensive VIP concept: theatres with large fully reclining seats with leg rests that almost became beds and could be “merged” two by two allowing couples to cuddle (customers would get a blanket too) plus catered dinner service. In 2014 it came up with Cinépolis Junior theatres exclusively for parents who went to the movies with small children. These theatres had “puff” seating and contained slides and other amusements where children could expend their energy before the show and during intermission (to give them a break from paying so much attention). On the technology front Cinépolis spent heavily both to transition its theatres to the latest digital formats building new more modern theatres and to refurbish existing ones. In 2004 it began building giant-screen IMAX theatres and it built more of these than anybody in Mexico. Because IMAX theatres were enormously large and costly in 2010 Cinépolis introduced a mid-range alternative: a large 170-square-metre screen for its new Macro XE (Extreme Digital Experience) theatres. And in 2011 it began implementing in some theatres 4DX a Korean technology that enhanced the movie experience by giving viewers jolts in their seats and other physical surprises.Innovative Cinépolis theatres utterly transformed the movie-going experience in Mexico and proved attractive to the country’s relatively affluent moviegoers. If imitation was the best form of flattery then Cinépolis was lavishly flattered as competitors rushed to copy its innovations.Improved experience better technology and outstanding service were important reasons why Cinépolis was enjoying better average occupancy than any movie theatre company in the world but another was analysis which also got its share of investment. Cinépolis had turned its decision-making process for choosing theatre locations into a science studying carefully for example how many people who could afford the movies would be within a 15-minute drive of a newly proposed theatre as well as how many ticket sales a new theatre would cannibalize from other Cinépolis theatres. Its algorithms were so good that Cinépolis now had all of the choicest best-performing locations in Mexico City.The Box OfficeAnalysts were forced to guess at the financials of Cinépolis because the theatre chain—privately owned—did not divulge them. In a 2014 article Forbes did some guessing. According to Cinépolis 119.4 million tickets had been sold in Mexico in 2011 and the industry average price was about Mex$48 per ticket giving a total of Mex$5.7 billion for the year. But the average ticket price at Cinépolis’ VIP theatres was higher than the industry average. Cinépolis claimed to capture 64.5 per cent of total box-office returns. “In that case” said Forbes “its box-office returns might be worth 6202 million pesos.”Cinépolis claimed that 214.6 million tickets had been sold in 2017 in Mexico. Extrapolating from Forbes’ 2014 analysis that would mean revenues of Mex$18.9 billion for Mexico alone. However in 2017 overseas revenues had become significant (see below) whereas in 2014 these represented just 10 per cent of the total.FoodAnd then there was food—the revenue stream with the biggest margin. Cinépolis had innovated there too not only with its catered service but also with gourmet popcorn in a variety of both familiar and exotic flavours.According to Cinépolis its candy and food store was keeping 70 cents for every peso spent at the theatre. Adding this income to the box office “company revenues might be as high as Mex$10.5 billion pesos” the Forbes article stated. Per Mexican ticket then the average revenue was Mex$88.Overseas RevenueForbes was guessing at Cinépolis’ financials based on the company’s Mexican revenues only. That was fine in 2014 when Mexican revenues were 90 per cent of the total but by that year Cinépolis was already aggressively looking to make a much larger footprint in other countries as the Mexican market did not offer too many opportunities for further growth in theatres.Just one year later Cinépolis-owned theatres had increased by 75 per cent in India—an important step towards Cinépolis’ target increase of more than 350 per cent by 2017. Cinépolis was also pushing to grow in Spain the United States and Latin America. By 2017 according to Cinépolis a third of all of its tickets were already sold overseas.Social Media PresenceMexican movie theatre companies seemed to have a special talent for social media. By 2017 of all the major movie theatre companies in the world Cinépolis and its rival Cinemex had the most followers in their main social media spaces—Twitter Facebook and Google+. But Cinépolis was in a class all its own with a combined total of 20492170 followers almost twice the total of Cinemex (see Exhibit 3).KLICDespite all of its success with movie theatres Cinépolis recognized that new winds were blowing and thus decided in 2011 to capitalize on its name its relationship with content makers and its presence in theatres to get into the over-the-top (OTT) content game as well. Its bid to capture a share of the OTT market was KLIC a platform where consumers could rent buy or live-stream content. Though the platform was a small part of Cinépolis the company intended for KLIC to grow.OVER THE TOP: THE WORLD BEYOND THE THEATrEInterpreted broadly OTT content referred to audio video and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product—that is without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television (TV) systems. Netflix Inc. (Netflix)—a company with a tradition of disruptive innovation—had become the world leader in OTT service.The Netflix RevolutionNetflix disrupted the traditional video rental model that had turned Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. (Blockbuster) into the dominant giant. In a defensive move Blockbuster tried to buy the new challenger but Netflix refused the bid and eventually drove the older company into bankruptcy.Netflix’s first idea was to ship DVDs to customers by post saving on bricks-and-mortar costs. But the initial model was pay-per-rent the same as Blockbuster’s with similar due dates. A year later came a second key innovation: the monthly subscription concept. For a monthly fee a customer could watch any number of DVDs with no due dates late fees shipping and handling fees or per-title rental fees. This together with Netflix’s very large catalogue (35000 different films by 2005) resulted in a crushing preference for Netflix by consumers. By 2003 Netflix had turned a profit.In 2007 Netflix went “over the top”—it invaded the Internet-based video-on-demand space. Competitor Hulu and other platforms were already there but Netflix had scale. Its giant catalogue made its streaming service attractive and its subscription model was an obvious match for the new technology.Netflix was disruptive again. It began changing the habits of TV and film consumers (see Exhibit 4) as well as content producers and endangered other established businesses:ComScore reports that 51 million households now receive their television programming through what the industry calls Over-The-Top television. They watch an average of 49 hours of streaming content per month. About a third of these households have dropped cable and satellite programming completely. Looking ahead the streaming services are expected to continue growing rapidly while the cable and satellite numbers decline. Netflix is the biggest driver of this transition. Fully 74 percent of households that stream video watch Netflix. The content giant accounts for 40 percent of all OTT viewing and nobody else is even close.Despite a great deal of competition (others moved into this space including Amazon Video HBO Now and Crackle while original inhabitants such as Hulu hung on) some were expecting that U.S. consumers of Netflix’s streaming service could grow “to over 78 million by 2024.” This guess was based on “the secular trends within the pay-TV industry as consumers increasingly cut the cord in favour of streaming platforms” and thanks to the improved image of the Netflix brand after it began producing its own attractive original content.Spreading abroad Netflix meant to conquer the world. It arrived in Latin America in 2011 and despite the relatively low penetration of high-speed broadband in the region did well there. It had no competitors. That however would soon change.The Mexican OTT MarketIn 2012 Claro a communications services company owned by America Móvil in turn controlled by Grupo Carso S.A.B. de C.V. (Carso) the Mexican conglomerate headed by Carlos Slim Helú (at one time considered the wealthiest man in the world) launched Claro Video as a direct Netflix competitor. Because Carso also owned Teléfonos de México S.A.B. de C.V. (Telmex) and Teléfonos del Noroeste S.A. de C.V. (Telnor) and because Telmex/Telnor served 60 per cent of the Internet broadband market in Mexico with a strong position all over Latin America Carso could get many Latin Americans to try Claro Video by offering the service as a free bundle to Telmex/Telnor broadband customers.Carso businesses were often entangled; Claro Video could be legitimately viewed as a Telmex/Telnor strategy to protect its dominant broadband position rather than as a standalone product. But there was no question that Claro Video was a contender and it had followed the Netflix strategy of producing its own original content (e.g. La Hermandad) in order to lure viewers. In 2017 with Netflix holding onto 63.6 per cent of the Mexican market Claro had managed to carve a 25 per cent stake.The other main competitor in the Latin American market was Televisa S.A. de C.V. (Televisa) the largest TV conglomerate in Latin America with a presence in the United States through its 25 per cent stake in Univisión and a long tradition of content production that had weaved itself into the cultural memory of all Latin Americans. Televisa had been licensing its content to Netflix but pulled it in 2016 and launched its own OTT platform—Blim. A surge of memes on social media criticized Blim as destined to flop a late starter that was too expensive and did not understand millennials. But the mocking game worked as free marketing that put the new service’s name out for all to see and as Blim rushed out of the gates it briefly pulled ahead of Claro Video before settling into third place with 7 per cent of the market in 2017.CINÉPOLIS enters THE over-the-top FRAYAs Netflix landed in Mexico in 2011 Cinépolis decided that it wanted a piece of the OTT market and hired Elizabeth Hopkins to lead the effort. Soon after its product KLIC was launched in early 2014 a Forbes article was headlined “The Cinépolis KLIC Strategy to Defeat Netflix.”Cinépolis expected an edge in synergies between its bricks-and-mortar theatre business and the new Internet venture. Perhaps the product could be launched in the company’s overseas markets too. “We want to fine-tune the business here [in Mexico] first before launching in other countries” Hopkins told Forbes. But she qualified this by saying “The possibility of expanding to other countries is definitely on our radar.”The Mexican ExperienceKLIC’s original ambitions were large. The initial plan was to offer trailers movies TV series and other digital content (documentaries musicals sports fare and film shorts). At a later stage it would add books magazines and video games as well as wallpapers screensavers images and apps. It was even thought that in the long term KLIC might become an Internet hub and a social network. For its first phase however KLIC was launched with a humble dual model: a catalogue of TV series movies and other digital content available on an unlimited basis for a monthly subscription fee plus a separate catalogue of movies that had recently been in theatres available for rent as pay-per-view.Cinépolis soon learned that even with this modest debut it had taken on more than it could handle. For one the content that attracted viewers was so expensive that OTT companies on this model had to wait until they acquired a large user base before they could begin to see profits. This required capital outlays that Cinépolis found difficult to sustain and the user base was not growing as needed due to a psychological and cultural obstacle: Netflix had socialized Mexican users into the view that once they had paid a monthly fee all content on a platform should be available without limits so the dual model (subscription plus pay-per-view) felt to them like double charging.It was hard to communicate to users that some content such as recently released movies or live-streaming events was licensed differently from the rights owners who because of the temporarily high demand for such content insisted on a pay-per-view model. Netflix had avoided such confusion by deciding not to show recently released movies or live-streaming events producing a content catalogue that could be available to consumers in its entirety on a subscription model.Faced with such problems Cinépolis decided relatively quickly that it was best to concentrate more on what it did best: release new movies. Under Marco García de la Cruz who replaced Elizabeth Hopkins in January 2015 as KLIC director the service was rebranded as the place for customers to see recently released films they had missed at the theatre (the overwhelming majority of its listings included what Cinépolis had recently shown on its theatre screens). It added live-streaming events to lure customers to the service: for instance through an agreement with Chivas TV—which broadcast the games of Chivas one of the biggest and most popular soccer franchises in Mexico—it made Chivas games available live on KLIC. It tacked on a curated catalogue of older movies available for a lower price to provide more variety. As a sweetener there were interviews and “behind-the-scenes” content for serious movie buffs. Other than the last item which was offered at no cost everything on the new KLIC was pay-per-view. The subscription model was dropped.Integrating KLIC the Cinépolis life cycle model became as follows: First the movie was shown in theatres and had a 90-day exclusivity window from the premiere. Following this the movie went to KLIC where it was usually sold for a couple of weeks first (electronic sell-through [EST]) and then a rental option was added (TV on demand [TVOD]). Matters would remain thus for three months after which the movie would be dropped from TVOD and remain as EST.This was now an entirely different model than that of Netflix Claro Video and Blim. These other competitors needed huge investments in original content because with a subscription model they were forced to hook users to content available nowhere else and the model was designed with a long horizon to keep users returning—hence the need to produce original TV series (which according to many had consequences even for art in terms of narrative strategy and style). But such investments were so large that a very large user base was necessary for profitability. In 2017 Netflix was still experiencing negative free cash flow due to the huge investments it was making in content creation financed through debt. It expected to recoup this because “the [Netflix-owned] content library can be monetized and amortized over a number of years which should lead to an improvement in profitability over the long run”; however without a doubt this was a very capital-intensive strategy.By contrast KLIC’s capital outlays looked relatively modest. Although it did incur fixed costs to keep its platform running pay-per-view content paid royalties to the content owner—there was no upfront cost. Because of this KLIC could reach profitability with comparatively few users. According to Cinépolis data it already had about one million “registered users” of which about 150000 were “active” users transacting something on KLIC every month. These numbers were nothing compared to those that Netflix boasted but with the right mix and frequency of transactions KLIC expected to be profitable by reaching just 300000 active users (see Exhibit 5).Furthermore KLIC was no longer competing with Netflix. Rather than being a substitute it had become a complement. The Cinépolis numbers bore this out; nine out of 10 KLIC users also had Netflix. The new KLIC however was competing with iTunes. Why would those interested in recent movies not get them from iTunes? After all KLIC was charging similar prices. Cinépolis executives explained that in Mexico the penetration of Apple TV hardware relative to other boxes was quite low. And broadband access to a web page was much more common anyway. KLIC could therefore charge similar prices for its content and still expect a fair number of Mexicans to get recent movies through its service—if only Cinépolis could get them to try it. And that was the challenge.Growing KLICCapturing 300000 active users to achieve profitability may not have sounded like an impossible goal but it was double the number of users KLIC had. And even if KLIC could reach 300000 Cinépolis was aggressive about growth. The company wanted KLIC to thrive and conquer not merely to break even.It was important for Cinépolis to find a way to lure more people to KLIC to turn registered users into active users and to generate more transactions per active user. Naturally Cinépolis was taking advantage of the millions of people who came to its theatres where they would see advertisements for KLIC. Cinépolis also had a loyalty program where theatregoers could gain points redeemable on KLIC. But other opportunities for synergy—or better strategies for existing synergies—between the two businesses likely existed. The challenge ahead was to find a way to exploit these and fine-tune the model.Sánchez was not sure that KLIC was ready for international expansion. What could Cinépolis do to improve KLIC’s performance in Mexico? How should KLIC improve its data gathering on its current users (see Exhibit 6)? Once the model was fine-tuned where should it expand first and how?

This in itself is an interesting development. But Netflix is always analyzing the consumer data it has to further refine its understanding of viewing habits. This data has answered the following questions: How do Netflix users combine watching TV series and movies? What is the mix of the two? Which is more important? When do they watch one versus the other?Typical Netflix users are heavy TV series consumers. They will watch a movie only in the short break between finishing a TV series—which they likely binged on—and starting a new one. The psychology of this seems to be that they need a break from the heavy commitment—or downright addiction!—that a TV series implies. So before they plunge into a TV series again they take it easy with a movie (or a documentary or a stand-up comedy show). Movies on Netflix work as a kind of “intermission” between strong commitments to TV series.Source: Dana Feldman “Over 30M Netflix Members Have New Binge-Watching Routines Pairing TV And Movies” Forbes December 7 2016 accessed January 2019 www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2016/12/07/over-30m-netflix-members-have-new-binge-watching-routines-pairing-tv-movies/#6d4889395411.Exhibit 5: mix of KLIC services and their profitabilityKLIC offers the following three pay-per-view services:TV on Demand (TVOD): This is basically a rental. The user has 30 days to start watching a movie and once they have started playing it they have 48 hours to finish viewing it. During these 48 hours the user can watch it as many times as they want. To view it the user has two options: (1) streaming which means watching it while connected to the Internet or (2) downloading it to their mobile device and watching it online.Electronic Sell-Through (EST): The user acquires the right to reproduce the movie for an indefinite period of time as many times as they want. This applies also to TV series (for which the rental option does not exist). It is tempting to say that the user bought the content but in fact the user has these rights only so long as KLIC continues to have a contract with the content owner. Thus it is more like a very long rental.Live Streaming: This refers to online streaming media simultaneously recorded and broadcast in real time to the viewer. It refers to live events that are watched over the Internet.According to KLIC data with the above mix of transactions KLIC achieves profitability at 300000 active users.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 6: KLIC user data KLIC defines the following user categories:Circumstantial—Flexible with respect to the world of cinema. Not too picky about content or quality. Because they are so flexible they adapt to almost any circumstance for watching movies. They do not look for anything in particular and watch whatever is offered. A consequence of this flexibility is that they can obtain movies through almost any medium.Nesting—These are usually couples with children in school. They do not go to the movies frequently because it is expensive and because having children typically means they must see children’s movies. They prefer affordable entertainment opportunities at home that involve the entire family. Watching movies together at home is fun and generates a good family dynamic. They use several platforms because they want to have a bigger menu from which to choose.Graduate—Has seen a great repertoire of movies. Quite picky about everything having to do with the world of cinema: quality content comfort. Loves loyalty programs. Will not watch just any movie but looks for desired content (thematically). Loves additional and special content about movies and is not easily influenced by what open TV offers because it is a very simple and basic experience. Has multiple platforms for viewing movies because this is the way to get all the specific content this user wants.Trainee—Loves the movies but is not a “film buff.” Is still building a repertoire and is relatively flexible with content. Likes loyalty programs. This user is adaptable to open TV and pay-per-view because they are still building a repertoire. Satisfied with a digital platform and can potentially “mature” to become a graduate.Self-indulgent (Auto complaciente)—Enjoys movies as a way to relax but has no special passion for cinema. Likes to watch movies at home without worrying about a particular theme or genre. Also likes going to the movies but does not do this regularly; this user is just as happy to watch movies at home. In terms of viewing tends to be selfish viewing what they like when they feel like it rather than coordinating with family.exhibit 6 (continued)exhibit 6 (continued)	Source: Company documents.

The management of SaskPower had requested the approval of its 2003 foreign exchange strategy to manage the long-term currency risk exposure in the utilityâs U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower issued US$619 million of debt in the early 1990s with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Canadian dollar had since increased (i.e. the Canadian dollar rate had depreciated) increasing the effective burden of the debt and reducing the utilityâs net income. By the end of 1999 SaskPower had hedged US$112 million through foreign currency swaps. By the end of 2001 the translation value of the U.S. dollar debt had increased to CA$986 million and represented more than 50 per cent of SaskPowerâs long-term debt.A change in accounting practices was implemented in 2001 in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. SaskPower was required to recognize as a gain or a loss in the current year any translation differences in the value of its outstanding U.S. dollar debt resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate during the year. This policy change led to a significant reduction in net income in 2001 followed by a significant increase during the first eight months of 2002. The volatility in earnings had complicated the task of setting rates for electricity and had proved politically difficult to justify. An overarching objective of the proposed foreign exchange strategy was to eventually eliminate all currency exposure in the outstanding U.S. dollar debt.SaskPower: The Company SaskPower was a Canadian power company established in 1929. This crown corporation was owned by the provincial government of Saskatchewan and governed by a board of directors. It was the main producer and supplier of electricity in the province with an installed generation capacity of 4281 megawatts. In fiscal year 2001 SaskPower serviced 432000 customers spread over 652000 square kilometres across Saskatchewan. Around 68.3 per cent of the generated power was sold to industrial users. The companyâs distribution network was also tied to the grids of Alberta and Manitoba and to the U.S. state of North Dakota (although no notable sales were recorded across the border).SaskPowerâs revenues in 2001 were CA$1.126 billion 88 per cent of which came from sales within Saskatchewan. Its expenses were CA$1.097 billion. The cost of fuel and purchased power represented 43 per cent of expenses. Finance charges which included foreign currency translation losses related to the U.S. dollar debt represented 16 per cent. Expenses increased by 10 per cent relative to 2000 driven primarily by a 22 per cent increase in the cost of fuels namely natural gas and purchased power which was required due to low river flows and reduced electricity generation (see Exhibit 1).Origins of U.S. DebtSaskPower was a capital-intensive vertically integrated electric power utility. Asset replacement was required even during slow economic times. Like most crown corporations SaskPower sourced debt through the provincial treasury.In the 1990s Saskatchewan was in poor financial health. Canadian financial institutions showed little interest in buying Saskatchewan debt and the province faced relatively high credit spreads over Canadian treasuries. Therefore the province deemed it advantageous to borrow in the United States where its debt was better received and interest rates on long-term debt were significantly lower. SaskPower made five U.S. debt issues between 1990 and 1993 totalling US$619 million in principal and maturing 10 to 30 years later (see Exhibit 2). The exchange rate at issue averaged CA$1.22 per U.S. dollar or US$0.82 per Canadian dollar and the debt was worth CA$755 million. SaskPowerâs all-in cost of its U.S. debt was much lower than the typical equivalent Canadian dollar debt. On average it was 160 basis points lower or 17 per cent lower than what the Canadian dollar debtâs all-in cost would have been. Therefore the U.S. dollar would need to move up a long way before the Canadian dollar cost of servicing the U.S. debt exceeded what the cost would have been if SaskPower had chosen to borrow in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 2). The U.S. dollar debt carried semi-annual coupon payments. The debt was non-callable and non-convertible. Being primarily held by institutional investors it had little to no market float. Accounting Policy Change and Exchange Rate UncertaintyAt the time the accounting standard that SaskPower followed was the Canadian version of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Foreign exchange translation adjustments that resulted from year-end revaluation of the U.S. debt were amortized over the remaining term of the debt. The Canadian dollarâs value deteriorated for most of the 1990s which meant that the U.S. dollar appreciated in value (see Exhibit 3) creating a build-up of unrealized foreign exchange losses. A portion of these losses was amortized annually although these were non-cash chargesâno additional funds were required until the debt matured. The amortization was an amount of multi-million dollars per year; however it was offset by significant reductions in actual finance charge payments as SaskPowerâs debt declined sharply over the 1990s. The amortized exchange losses were CA$8 million for 1999 and CA$9 million for 2000. At the end of 1999 unamortized foreign exchange losses were CA$97 million.In 2001 SaskPower adopted a new accounting policy in accordance with revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines. The new policy required all foreign currency translation differences to be recognized and recorded as a gain or loss in the current year. The purpose of this policy shift was to bring Canadian accounting practices in line with those of Europe and the United States. This change had a significant effect on SaskPowerâs financial results in 2001 increasing finance charges by CA$31 million and reducing net income to CA$29 million (see Exhibit 4). Repercussions of the accounting policy change were rather fundamental. Stakeholders started questioning why SaskPower had U.S. debt in the first place. Some of the unrealized foreign exchange losses were reversed during the first eight months of 2002. The Canadian dollar increased from US$0.6279 on December 31 2001 to US$0.6415 on August 30 2002 (i.e. the U.S. dollar dropped from CA$1.5926 to CA$1.5588) resulting in a year-to-date foreign exchange gain of CA$15.5 million. Estimates for foreign exchange gains for the year were approximately CA$15 million based on a forecast closing rate of CA$1.00 = US$0.64. However this estimate was highly unreliable due to the recent volatility in the exchange rate the disagreement among foreign exchange analysts on the value of the Canadian dollar and past forecast errors. With each US$0.01 change in the value of the Canadian dollar translating into a change of approximately CA$12 million (increase or decrease) in SaskPowerâs net income possibilities were wide-ranging (positive or negative) for the yearâs results. These foreign exchange gains or losses complicated the setting of electricity rates. In most utilities the total asset base was allowed to earn an approved rate of return referred to as a âreturn on rate base.â SaskPower used a less formal process but still required approval from the government. The process focused on the expected net income that would result from the approved rate adjustment. Finance charges would normally be predictable if they were based on long-term fixed rate debt. However the significant exposure to the U.S. dollar generated large unpredictable swings in net income which could not be accommodated in the rate-setting process.Plan of Action Market sentiment about the Canadian dollar was negative towards the end of 2002 with expectations of additional weakness. There was extensive discussion in the business press of the differences between the Canadian and American economies where the focus was tax policy and general fundamentals. The tone of the discussion on the Canadian economy seemed bearish. Given this outlook and in order to manage the volatility in net income caused by the U.S. debt SaskPowerâs treasury group entertained and then promoted the strategy of hedging all the U.S. debt. Currency swaps emerged as the most appropriate hedging tool. Currency SwapsForeign currency swaps were derivative instruments that allowed an entity to change the currency denomination of its assets (cash inflows) or liabilities (cash outflows). A company for example could swap the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt for equivalent interest and principal payments in another currency effectively transforming the existing debt into a comparable-value debt that was denominated in the other currency. Currency swaps were over-the-counter contracts negotiated between a company and a financial institution. A currency swap could be structured in several forms. For example it could involve the swapping of a newly-issued debt for an equal-value debt in another currency. In this case the counterparties at the outset exchanged the debt issue proceeds for an equivalent amount in the other currency. Then they exchanged interest and principal payments over the term of the debt. A swap could also involve the remaining interest and principal payments on an outstanding debt or it could involve swapping only interest payments.Plain vanilla currency swaps called for the exchange of fixed interest payments in one currency for fixed interest payments in another currency (with or without an exchange of the principal). Currency swaps could also involve the swapping of fixed interest payments in one currency for floating or adjustable payments in another currency. The floating payments in this case would be indexed to a benchmark short-term interest rate in the respective currency. Given the nature of SaskPowerâs assets management considered swapping its outstanding long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar debt for Canadian dollar debt with equal term and similarly fixed interest rates. Hedging OptionsSaskPowerâs management recommended a hedging program to its board of directors as part of the companyâs 2003â2007 business plan. Convinced that the status quo or simply doing nothing was not an option management provided two possible hedging options for the company to pursue in regard to managing its U.S. debt.  Option 1: Lock In All Remaining U.S. Debt NowThis option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk by converting all future U.S. debt payments starting at the beginning of 2003 to fixed Canadian dollar payments. In return SaskPower would give up the upside potential if the Canadian dollar were to appreciate. Even though market conditions had changed drastically since the U.S. debt was issued the hedged all-in costs based on swap rates in December 2002 would have been near the costs that SaskPower would have paid if it had originally borrowed in Canadian dollars (see Exhibit 5).Option 2: Phase-In Hedges Over the Period Remaining Until December 31 2005This option would eliminate the foreign exchange risk before the end of the five-year business plan. SaskPower would be susceptible to currency movements in the interimâthe exposure would decrease as swaps were gradually entered intoâbut could benefit from a strengthening of the Canadian dollar. The key elements of this strategy were as follows:During the phase-in period the companyâs treasurer was to set a target range for the quarterly foreign exchange rate based on a consensus forecast which incorporated forecasts from a number of different agencies. Swaps would then be executed when the market exchange rate (Bank of Canada mid-noon rate) traded outside of the range. For added flexibility the treasurer had the discretion to execute a swap if the exchange rate was within the target range depending on the time remaining in the quarter current market conditions and the amount hedged to date. The unhedged principal amounts of the first three debt issues (maturing in 2003 2008 and 2013) totalling US$207 million would be fully hedged by the end of 2003. Priority would be given to these debt issues for two reasons: dealer spreads were tighter for swaps with shorter maturities; and the hedged all-in costs for these issues at the swap rates in December 2002 would be near the original equivalent Canadian dollar costs for these issues (see Exhibit 5). Thereafter an annual hedging target would be set to ensure that the remaining US$300 million debt issues were covered by December 31 of 2005.Whichever option was chosen SaskPower would structure the swaps in sums of US$25â50 million solicit quotes from multiple dealers and spread the deals over many banks to reduce credit risk. the decisionHaving read the management teamâs recommendations and reviewed the data provided James agreed with management that a course of action needed to be takenâdoing nothing was not an option. He pondered the details of a proposed swap for US$25 million of the 2008 debt issue. The U.S. dollar principal amount would be swapped for CA$35.6 million and the 7.125 per cent coupon rate on the U.S. dollar principal starting with the payment on September 15 2003 would be swapped for an 8.875 per cent coupon rate on the Canadian dollar principal (see Exhibit 6). However to ensure the most effective financial position for SaskPower James had to decide between hedging option 1 or option 2.Exhibit 1: Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year 2001Exhibit 1 (continued)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Breakdown of U.S. Dollar DebtNote:* This is the estimated all-in-cost if SaskPower had originally issued Canadian dollar debt.

It was Monday January 23 2017 and the two were meeting in the board room at the company�s head office in London Ontario to review StarTech�s supply chain strategy:It looks like we hit our growth targets for 2016 reaching $190 million in sales. We are forecasting year-over-year sales growth of 20 per cent for at least the next three years. To support this level of growth we will need to examine our supply chain strategy.Sales revenues at StarTech a manufacturer and distributor of hard-to-find technology products had grown by almost $70 million in the previous four years. However the company�s growth had increased the complexity of the business and Paul wanted to ensure that the aggressive sales targets could be supported through strong operations and an efficient supply chain. Of particular interest was the need to support StarTech�s customer value proposition of product availability within 24 hours with prudent investments in inventory. Paul continued:We make it easy for information technology professionals to identify find get and use hard-to-find connectivity parts by having the right products at the right place at the right time. The key to remaining profitable is balancing product availability with our inventory investments. Conventional inventory management principles do not apply to our unique business model. You have done a good job improving our working capital utilization but we need to look at how and where additional improvements can be made to our supply chain. I would like you start with a review of how we are making product available to our customers through one of our distribution partners as a test case. Let�s focus on cable product line for starters. Specifically what initiatives should we be considering that will ensure high levels of product availability for our end-users? How can StarTech enhance our value proposition to our customer while simultaneously improving our operating margins and inventory productivity? Get back to me with your preliminary recommendations by the middle of February.The Global Computer Connectivity Hardware IndustryInformation technology (IT) hardware such as smartphones servers tablets laptops and similar devices had a constantly changing array of ports and connections used to interconnect charge and attach to peripherals such as external displays networks and electronic storage. StarTech distributed a broad portfolio of products that enabled the IT professional to solve these everyday connectivity challenges.  Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Apple HP and Lenovo created and marketed technology and mobility products and peripheral devices and cables. Large corporations and mass-market retailers including Best Buy Walmart and Target bought directly from OEMs. Peripherals and connectivity parts supporting these devices were supplied by third-party manufacturers such as StarTech. Distributors purchased OEM and third-party products in bulk to sell to regional and local resellers and directly to IT professionals and consumers. These distributors operated as �one-stop shops� for consumers and businesses. To maintain a wide range of product offerings distributors purchased and marketed hundreds of thousands of technology products from thousands of hardware manufacturers and software suppliers selling these products and services to their network of customers. These customers included local and regional distributors and systems integrators who put together technology equipment services for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Distributors typically operated several warehouses each with a different product mix depending on historical and forecasted demand. Some distributors provided same-day shipment for product orders relying on common freight carriers such as the United States Postal Service United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express. As an added service to manufacturers and resellers distributors provided supply chain management services: order management customer and technical support logistics management and other services.For resellers and corporate IT departments the advantages of relying on a distributor was speed of delivery and the ability to place an order consisting of products from a range of manufacturers. Distributors also allowed downstream customers to reduce inventories as products could often be ordered on a just-in-time basis. It was typical for distributors to earn a small profit from each sale and to focus on generating high order volume. For example the gross profit per item sold by distributors could range from 5 to 20 per cent and a distributor could earn net income on sales of 1�3 per cent.StarTech.comAfter a series of new ventures that included running a coin-operated computer business offering a word-processing service and starting a video cassette recorder and movie rental operation Paul Seed and Ken Kalopsis moved into manufacturing and marketing computer peripherals in 1987. Their first product was a dust cover for computers followed by an anti-glare mesh and an anti-static mesh. Stationery and office products firms such as Hay Stationery Company Limited in London Ontario and Grand & Toy Limited started carrying their products. The venture which was later named StarTech.com achieved revenues of $127000 in 1988.  In 2017 StarTech�s product portfolio was composed of nearly 3000 stock keeping units (SKUs) across six product categories with an average selling price of approximately $13. Gross profit margins varied by category but ranged from 20 to 30 per cent. StarTech�s six main product categories were add-on cards and peripherals (e.g. cards and adaptors docking stations and hubs) audio-video connectivity products (e.g. adapters converters extenders and splitters) cables and hard-drive accessories (e.g. external drive enclosures and mobile racks) networking input/output products (e.g. media converters and extenders network adapter cards and Ethernet switches) and server management products (e.g. keyboard video and mouse switches and rack consoles). Prices for its products ranged from under $1 (e.g. small network adapters) to more than $1000 (e.g. server racks) and the products supported more than 200 different technologies. Each year StarTech processed approximately 15 million transactions and new product introductions ranged between 200 and 300 SKUs.Exhibit 1 provides an overview of StarTech�s supply chain. Approximately 80 per cent of the company�s products were sold to distributors such as Ingram Micro Inc. D&H Distributing Co. and SYNNEX Corporation. In most cases StarTech provided inventory on consignment to its distributor customers. A second segment was online direct marketers including CDW Amazon.com Inc. Newegg Inc. and TigerDirect.ca which sold products to consumers or businesses. This segment accounted for approximately 5 per cent of StarTech�s sales. Value-added resellers were the third segment accounting for approximately 12 per cent of company sales. Value-added resellers sold products to end-users as part of installation services or through small retail stores. They were usually owner-operated and were called upon to install or repair computer systems. Direct sales to end-consumers accounted for about 3 per cent of StarTech revenues.Product LinesStarTech�s product line was split between the latest technology products (commodity items) and hard-to-find products that satisfied niche markets and applications and that had been discontinued by other suppliers. Due to the nature of the products StarTech offered sales of commodity items generally resulted from the purchase of another related item (an �anchor� product). For example a customer installing a server might need a rack power supply or network cables. The purchaser of a new monitor could require a signal splitter or convertor. Often an individual connectivity component was a minor but critical element of a larger technology installation or solution so it was very important that it be available for purchase and delivered to the customer in a timely manner. Ensuring that key connectivity products were available in sufficient quantities through the same sales channel at the time an �anchor� purchase was researched or made was a key element of StarTech�s strategy. The second major contributor to sales was the wide variety of legacy products stocked by StarTech. Distributors looking to differentiate themselves from their competitors often wanted to carry the broadest possible range of products so that their customers would not need to go elsewhere to complete their purchases. For example OEM and third-party manufacturers usually capitalized on a three- to four-year window of opportunity for new products. After this window ended and the product had entered the maturity stage interest turned to developing and launching the next generation of products as demand entered the decline stage. StarTech focused on products during the growth stage (e.g. commodity products) and after they had been discontinued (e.g. hard-to-find products) (see Exhibit 2). Approximately 30 per cent of StarTech�s revenues came from its hard-to-find product line. Generally average sales volumes for commodity items were higher than for hard-to-find products but the margins were better for hard-to-find products.Supply Chain The company operated a total of 190000 square feet (more than 17600 square metres) of warehouse space across three sites: London Ontario Canada; Lockbourne Ohio United States; and Northampton United Kingdom. Most products were sourced in Asia and shipped to North American or U.K. warehouses via marine or airfreight (the relatively low weight of StarTech�s products sometimes made airfreight economical). Inventories in company-operated warehouses totalled approximately $30 million. In addition the company owned approximately $27 million of inventory inbound from suppliers in its pipeline.StarTech stocked product on consignment at its key distributor partners referred to in the industry as vendor managed inventory (VMI). Under this arrangement product was owned by StarTech until it was sold. In January 2017 the company had approximately $17 million of VMI in its supply chain. VMI levels varied by customer distribution centre (DC) based on projected demand and customer stocking restrictions such as available space. The general policy was to set inventory levels that provided 24-hour service for each SKU at a service level of 97 per cent availability for A items (high demand) 94 per cent for B items (medium demand) and 91 per cent for C items (low demand). Inventory levels at customer distribution centres were reviewed at the end of each month with a replenishment lead time of one month. Jeff described how StarTech used inventory in its supply chain:StarTech.com uses inventory as a strategic weapon to grow our market share. Using industry data on the market size we set stock in the channel to maintain our targeted customer service levels. Consumers expect access to all of the required accessories and peripherals for their purchase. For example a consumer buying a new laptop may also want to buy a cable to connect it to a printer and a docking station. Availability of our products affects the consumer buying decision and is part of our value proposition. StarTech.com�s objective is to make finding and acquiring required products easy for our customers and our strategy is to provide the broadest possible availability of SKUs for 24-hour delivery. We monitor market pricing levels to be cost competitive but customers buy from us because StarTech.com provides availability for a broad range of products.Working capital utilization was a key metric at StarTech. Before Jeff started with the company in 2013 inventory as a percentage of sales was approximately 50 per cent. Jeff and the operations team had worked hard to improve this metric to 35 per cent but performance was still short of the target of 30 per cent. Preparing for the Meeting with Paul SeedJeff decided to start his analysis by focusing on cable inventories held on consignment at a key U.S. distributor that operated five DCs. Cables were one of StarTech�s largest product categories and were regarded as representative of its main product categories. This particular customer carried 34 cable SKUs with an average selling price from StarTech ranging from $0.90 to $154.92. Examples of StarTech cables can be found in Exhibit 3. Information on each SKU is provided in Exhibits 4 and 5. Jeff commented on the situation:StarTech.com is a product-focused company. The question is how to balance strategic intent with tactical execution of our supply chain strategy which provides two challenges. First how do we capture greater value from our investments in inventory? A significant amount of our inventory is consignment-based and we can do a better job balancing our stocking strategy with sales potential. We have to balance availability with responsible working capital management. Second how can we improve our product life-cycle management process? For example our current approach does not differentiate between commodity and hard-to-find products. We need a strategic approach to product management supported by our supply chain strategy as SKUs transition from commodity to hard-to-find categories.The combination of product offerings that spanned the technology life cycle a broad SKU count a strategy of high availability and a consignment-based distribution model kept inventory management top of mind for Jeff. As revenues continued to grow StarTech�s supply chain strategy had to evolve to ensure high levels of product availability for end-users to build on its relationship with distributors and to simultaneously improve working capital utilization. �Our objective is for sales to continue to grow at a faster rate than our investment in inventory� said Jeff. �I know we can get better at how we manage our supply chain operations.�Exhibit 1: StarTech.com Market ChannelSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: StarTech.com Product Life-Cycle PositionSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Examples of StarTech.com CablesSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: Cable SKUs at DistributorRank: A = high demand; B = medium demand; C = low demand; Y = discontinued.SKU Category: C = commodity item; S = hard-to-find.Average inventory levels provided in number of units.Source: Company files.Exhibit 5: Monthly DemandNote: The standard deviation in the total column is based on the total average monthly demand (i.e. it is not the sum of the standard deviation values at the individual warehouses).Source: Company files.

By 2008 ECCAâs two runways required an estimated CA$10 million in capital upgrades and $35 million in additional maintenance costs over the next 10 years. In light of these facts city council had begun to consider whether maintaining ECCA was feasible or if other alternatives would put the land to better use.If ECCA closed city council foresaw multiple prospective uses for the land. For instance Edmonton was experiencing an exponential population growth rate and an anticipated need to supply additional housing for 150000 citizens by 2019 (see Exhibit 2). This population increase would further support trending suburban development which presented a significant financial concern; for every $1 spent on suburban development the City of Edmonton had to invest an estimated $0.80 towards the development of corresponding infrastructure. These combined factors made the 536-acre ECCA land a hot topic citywide and a main focus for city council.In November 2011 city council asked Mark Hall City of Edmonton Land Director to explore various opportunities for the land. The alternatives available for consideration were maintaining ECCA and the status quo by completing the necessary repairs; selling the property to a real estate developer thereby generating immediate revenue for other City of Edmonton projects; or closing ECCA and the City of Edmonton would act as the land developer for a community project.KEY STAKEHOLDERSEdmonton City CouncilAt the time of the ECCA decision-making process Steven Mandel was approaching his last term as the mayor of Edmonton. City of Edmontonâs Land Director Mark HallHall had worked for the City of Edmonton in diverse roles over many years. At the time of the ECCA dilemma he served in the corporate properties branch and was thus aware of ECCA discussions and debates. With Hallâs assistance the city councillors hoped to find a clear and sustainable solution to the challenges presented by ECCA.HISTORY OF EDMONTON CITY CENTRE AIRPORT (ECCA)Throughout its 80-year history ECCA had held as many names as it had roles: The Hagmann Farm Jimmy Bellâs Air Harbour Blatchford Field #2 Air Observer School Royal Canadian Air Force Western Air Command Industrial Airport and Municipal Airport. In 1926 the Edmonton and Northern Alberta Aero Club received a $400 grant to transform a patch of farmland into a runway by cutting down willow bushes and packing down soil. Officially declared an âAir Harbourâ this site saw the first trained pilots graduate from the site in 1927. Two years later Edmontonâs city council authorized $35000 of expenditures for the airfield and Blatchford Field was born. Named after Keith Alexander (âKennyâ) Blatchford who was mayor of Edmonton from 1924 to 1926 and later a member of parliament Blatchford Field became Canadaâs first licensed airfield.During the next 35 years the airport played an important role in commercial and military aviation serving not only the Edmonton region but also destinations within Canada and the United States. In the 1950s however a new generation of larger aircraft required longer runways which a space-confined ECCA could not accommodate. Thus the search began for another airfield site in the Edmonton region. The airport was supposed to be closed in 1963 when EIA was completed. However due to active political opposition based on the ECCAâs historical importance and the value that it held in being located near to downtown the airfield was saved. The airfield operated under different names and mandates with perhaps one of the most important mandates being its role in providing MedEvac services. In 1995 the citizens of Edmonton voted 77 per cent in favour of consolidating scheduled air traffic at EIA and keeping ECCA open to general and corporate traffic. HISTORY OF EDMONTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTPrior to 1955 Edmontonâs primary aviation hub was the airfield north of downtown ECCA which housed a flight school and a military airfield. As Edmonton grew however and because industrial and residential neighbourhoods hemmed in ECCA the city required more land to house a larger-scale airport. By 1955 it was obvious that ECCA was inadequate for the innovative jet airliners which would need two-mile runways and spacious terminals to accommodate over 100 passengers with each flight. A site for EIA was selected near Nisku Alberta and Transport Canada purchased 7600 acres of land for a total cost of $1469657. With an unwritten âgentlemanâs agreementâ the original landowners were allowed to lease back and continue to farm the land until it was needed for further development of the airport. EIA remained Canadaâs largest airport in land area with more than half of its land still under cultivation.EIA had always competed with ECCA. EIA advocates had long desired to expand its network of international destinations. However because of the success and profitability of ECCA in creating convenient business air travel in downtown Edmonton Canadian authorities refused EIAâs expansion due to insufficient revenues and a lack of clear growth strategies. ECCAâs niche market was in direct competition with EIAâs regional travel options and growth plans which led to an enduring dispute between EIA and ECCA.In 1995 however there was overwhelming public support to close ECCA. Fuelled by this public support EIA began the development of a $450 million construction project to upgrade its facilities in anticipation of what it perceived as the inevitable shutdown of ECCA. Expansion plans for the airport included a new terminal for international flights a new site for Air Canada a repurposing of the existing Air Canada terminal for WestJet Airlines Ltd. to accommodate the rapid growth of its regional travel program additional security and screening infrastructure and a new cargo management facility.Although air travel at EIA decreased significantly between the late 1980s and the early 1990s demand increased in the late 1990s. Despite having been constructed to support 2.8 million passengers EIA was actually accommodating nearly 3.8 million passengers. This imposed urgency for the completion of the expansion project. In 2009 EIA anticipated that it was only a matter of time until city council voted to shut down ECCA. The shutdown would require EIA to absorb the entirety of Edmontonâs regional business travel further justifying EIAâs expansion for international travel and large facility upgrades.EDMONTONâS LAND DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRYAt the same time that news travelled about ECCAâs necessary renovation costs and its potential closure land developers had also anticipated Edmontonâs next great real estate opportunity. Following the financial crisis of 2008 a lengthy recession depressed the real estate market into a difficult period marked by value losses increased foreclosures and reduced rental property revenues. The economic downturn combined with an opportunity to develop over 500 acres of land near the downtown core provided land developers with the potential for a large-scale project that could infuse citizens with optimism for the future. With the anticipated first wave of millennials entering the workforce industry experts were predicting a flood of young adults into the city core to live closer to work and to enjoy their preferred downtown lifestyle.It was rumoured that key stakeholders in Edmonton land development including Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. Yorkton Group International Inc. and Melcor Developments Ltd. were submitting large proposals to the City of Edmonton to purchase the entire ECCA land site for redevelopment purposes. One land developer in particular The Katz Group was well known for innovative large-scale projects. Therefore selling the land was a viable proposition for city council to consider.The Katz Group headquartered in Edmonton was one of Canadaâs largest privately owned enterprises. As well as being a successful real estate and land developer also owned diverse businesses including pharmacies and sports and entertainment facilities. Founder and chairman Daryl Katz was a well-known and well-liked local celebrity. The Katz family had made its first fortune in the pharmacy industry owning and operating over 475 drugstore locations across central and western Canada. The Katz Group also owned the cityâs National Hockey League (NHL) team the Edmonton Oilers. With Edmonton being home to the third-oldest arena in the NHL Katz had also planned to build a new arena in the downtown core. With a vision to create a legacy in Edmonton and with plans to rebuild the downtown core and make the city an international icon Katz was an ideal candidate to undertake a major land development project like ECCA.SWEDISH SUSTAINABILITY MODELIn other parts of the world sustainability had been explored with different models of implementation and with differing degrees of success over the years. Sweden a globally acclaimed proponent of sustainable land development was one such example. Following Swedenâs economic boom in the 1990s a strong demand for housing led to a strategy to build inwards rather than outwards. The innovative Scandinavian country thus raised the bar for northern-climate cities with large-scale redevelopments and integrated approaches to harvesting and reusing resources. If successfully completed these ambitious commitments to produce local renewable energy and to reduce energy consumption would produce leading-edge communities that would attract international visitors eager to witness the ground-breaking sustainable initiatives first-hand.Sweden completed the first phase of a 395-acre redevelopment of a harbour-front brownfield site in the city of MalmÃ¶. VÃ¤stra Hamnen (âWestern Harbourâ) an industrial waterfront zone was planned to be fully redeveloped to house 10000 residents and to support a total of 30000 people who would either work or study in the area. The urban development plan included a large expansion of MalmÃ¶ University featured a seaside park and hosted a mobility centre that offered bicycle parking and bio-fuelled cars. Outdoor energy-efficient lighting and accessible public transportation encouraged people to walk and enjoy the boardwalk and public artworks. The area was intended to become Europeâs first carbon-neutral district and to serve as a global example of a sustainable city. Thus VÃ¤stra Hamnen also became known as âThe City of Tomorrow.âDevelopers submitted bids to the city of MalmÃ¶ and of the many applicants more than 20 were chosen to build in VÃ¤stra Hamnen. Selection was based on contractorsâ abilities to meet the goals of the large-scale project: sustainable housing powered by renewable energy attractive and affordable housing and a revitalized brownfield site for economic growth. The successful candidates signed The Quality Programme which listed contract guidelines for building with minimal environmental impact.The housing plan was dense (approximately 20 units per acre) and strategically placed to maximize efficiency. High-rises along the shoreline formed a wind shelter around smaller blocks and courtyards. Most units featured windows and mirrors predominantly as a way to maximize the use of natural light and passive solar energy. Natural materials and energy-efficient or water-saving appliances were also emphasized. Green rooftops captured rainwater for gardens and insulation and rooftop solar panels were used to heat the buildings and provide electricity to the district system.Ecologically the development included a local district energy system powered entirely by renewable energy sourcesâa combination of wind solar heat from seawater and biogas. Electricity was generated by solar and wind energy and hot-water heating was sourced from seawater and solar energy. Buildings were heated and cooled by an aquifer energy storage system that stored heat extracted from seawater. In the summer warm water filled cavities in the limestone underground and cold stored water was pumped up for usage in the district cooling system. In winter a heat pump increased the water temperature. A geothermal system was used to heat and cool the water.The automated waste system had separate receptacles for garbage organic waste and recyclables that connected to an underground pipeline system. Receptacles both inside buildings and outdoors sucked these through an underground pipeline system that ended at a central storage area for municipal waste truck pickup. At the time waste materials were composted but plans for a pre-treatment plant included turning organic waste into biogas to generate electricity and vehicle fuel. However at the time of the project development costs were much higher than anticipated due to the new technologies to meet these high standards and the slowdown in the housing market. Consequently the developmentâs estimated rental costs were $2000 per month for a 1000-square-foot unit compared with $1500 for similarly sized units elsewhere. Offsetting the price difference at least partially was an expectation of 25 per cent lower energy costs in addition to longer building lifespans expected to support higher resale values. FINANCIAL BACKGROUNDThe City of Edmonton located in oil-rich Alberta depended on the strength of the oil market for a significant portion of its economy. At the time of the ECCA decision a financial recession in the United States had dropped the price of oil from a record peak of $147.27 per barrel in July 2008 to less than $60 per barrel in subsequent months leaving the future of Albertaâs oil revenues in a highly uncertain state. For its capital budget the City of Edmonton was dependent on both provincial grants and property tax revenues that were tied to the real estate market and the economy. While most Canadian cities including Edmonton had survived prior shocks to the real estate market the job market and local economy were forecast not to remain resilient if oil prices remained depressed.Financial Comparison of AlternativesCity council faced several financial implications regarding what to do with the large area of prime ECCA land located near downtown Edmonton. Upholding the status quo and maintaining ECCA operations was an attractive option because the city would not be placed in a controversial situation. However maintaining ECCA would come at a steep cost because the city would need to invest tens of millions of capital dollars in the infrastructure over the next few years. Additionally opportunity costs were associated with keeping the airport operational particularly because downtown buildings were restricted in height due to the Airport Protection Overlay a set of regulations that constricted downtown development. Furthermore ECCA was operating a breakeven cost model and was not expected to ever become profitable given its small and restricted scale.The prospect of closing the airport left the city with two primary options: to sell or to develop the land. An immediate sale of the land was expected to generate approximately $250 million. Moreover interested buyers who were more than qualified as potential developers had unofficially approached various councillors and administrators. Therefore the city could plan the sale of the land dispose of the land systematically in a short period of time and expect revenue all within a short timeframe of a year or two. Given the uncertain economic environment in 2011 such a significant cash flow would bolster the city treasury or be used for other much-needed projects that had been postponed due to a lack of financing.A third option existed which was a staged development of the land that would provide residences for over 30000 people. This option however required a significant cash outlay upfront. The cash inflows from sales were expected to occur over 20 to 25 years in an effort by the city to avoid flooding the local market with homes. The investment option would thus be long-term and the city would hold the investment risk which would be subject to unforeseeable real estate demand and price fluctuations.Yet another consideration was the adding of a sustainability dimension to the development plan. This dimension however would involve a cost premium due to both the new technology and the limited number of builders able to commit to such a novel concept. Because consumer demand for a sustainable neighbourhood was unknown the city would here again be left managing the risk.One financial advantage to an infill development (using ECCA land for residential purposes) was a reduction in operating costs because an infill development would be cheaper to service than an expanded suburban development. If the city could divert 30000 residents from new suburbs to the downtown area the reduced need for additional infrastructure development over time would decrease overall operating costs such as snow clearing garbage collection and road maintenance.MOVING FORWARDIn 2008 an interesting factor arose that influenced decision making related to the ECCA development. The City of Edmonton developed âThe Way Aheadâ (see Exhibit 3) a document that proposed Edmontonâs strategic vision over the next 40 years as well as its strategic goals for the next 10 years. âThe Way Aheadâ contributed significantly to city councilâs mind-set for overall municipality decision making. In contemplating the sustainability of ECCA land in particular the projectâs decision making needed to consider the goals of âThe Way Aheadâ document.Although no official offer to purchase ECCA land had been considered by council potential buyers did exist and the expected sale price of the complete parcel would be approximately $250 million. If council pursued this option the immediate and long-term financial impact of the sale on the cityâs budget would be extraordinary for its population of one million. Situated in downtown Edmonton ECCA land could for example be used for a world-class development that could support the co-existence of commercial and residential lifestyles simultaneously. This multi-purpose development could promote many economic benefits such as job creation and increased tourism revenues. This option would also silence the critics of city development as many development industry experts believed that the city was either unqualified or should not be competing with land developers. In 2009 on behalf of ECCA stakeholders the Canadian Business Aviation Association released a report outlining future plans for ECCA and the reasons why ECCA should be maintained as an operational airport. Within this report were plans to reduce noise and light pollution and increase revenues by garnering corporate business interest in utilizing the airport for northern flights to Albertaâs oil sands. Additional plans included the development of a âMayo Clinic of the Northââa healthcare concept intended to create a national centre of excellence for healthcare services in Canada. While these clinic plans alone were promising the persuasive voices arguing to keep ECCAâs MedEvac Services intact presented city council with an ethical dilemma. If MedEvac Services were to be transferred to EIA the increase in patient transportation times to Edmontonâs major hospitals would be dramatically increased. As documented in a report regarding MedEvac Services some of Edmontonâs highest-ranking medical officials wrote letters to city council expressing their opposition to the closure of ECCA. These letters were inspired by the sensitive timely nature of medical care required for MedEvac Servicesâ patients. Between 2006 and 2008 ECCA accommodated an average of 3867 MedEvac Services flights per year of which approximately 350 were deemed âtime criticalâ (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Although it was difficult to estimate some officials believed that between five and eight more patients would die each year should MedEvac Services be moved to EIA.Ultimately the future of ECCA land would be determined by city council which recognized in this situation an immense opportunity for environmental leadership. Hall believed that a plan needed to be formulated that would inspire Edmontonians to seek a brighter future for the city. After months of research and feedback Hall had created a vision for the cityâs future and was ready to make a clear recommendation to city council so it too would deliver a strong future for the ECCA land.EXHIBIT 1: Location of Edmonton City Centre AirportSource: Created by the authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 2: Expected Population Growth of the City of EdmontonSource: Created by authors using data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 3: City of Edmontonâs 10-Year Strategy: âThe Way AheadâSource: City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 4: MedEvac Servicesâ Transport TimesAverage Transport Times from ECCA to Edmontonâs Major HospitalsAverage Transport Times from EIA to Edmontonâs Major HospitalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.EXHIBIT 5: ECCA MedEvac Services Traffic 2006â2008Total MedEvac Traffic Using ECCA2008 Fixed-Wing and Rotary TotalsSource: Created by authors with data from City of Edmonton files.

As the chief executive officer (CEO) of Fancam Pty Ltd. (Fancam) Le Roux had spent the past month in the United States establishing and strengthening client relationships for his four-year-old business. He had also been having difficult conversations with some of his resellers in the market. Since early 2011 Fancam had sold its innovative high-definition 360-degree crowd images to a number of major sports leagues and events: the National Football League (NFL) the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States; the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) championship; the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby Sevens tournament; the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour Finals in the United Kingdom; and the Indian Premier League cricket league.Fancam’s growth had been driven in part by its network of resellers around the world. Although these sales agent companies had provided access to exciting sports team brands in markets that Le Roux and his South African colleagues were less familiar with the existing channel sales structure had reached a breaking point. Le Roux acknowledged that “it was just too difficult to manage all these people and everyone was always unhappy and they were not making enough money and we were not making enough money.”Fancam’s sales in 2013 had declined by 60 per cent over the previous year and 2014 numbers were still down more than 40 per cent from the 2012 results. Le Roux had a 26-hour trip ahead of him and he needed to make some urgent decisions about Fancam’s strategic channel management and sales strategy including his approach to reseller exclusivity agreements incentives and in-house sales capabilities. The perceived entitlement of some resellers had strained relationships: Le Roux suspected that the resellers felt they had built the business. At the same time some clients were frustrated by apparent inconsistencies between Fancam and its resellers. A major American reseller was expecting an answer this month about exclusive rights to this lucrative market and Le Roux knew how important the United States would be to his 2015 and 2016 targets. The NBA Finals were less than four months away and the new NFL season kicked off in six months’ time. Fancam had experimented with a number of incentives and exclusivity approaches which Le Roux believed had thus far kept the company ahead of its major competitors. As he took his seat for the flight he knew changes were required if Fancam was to continue to lead this emerging industry. Establishing FancamFancam was established in mid-2010 in Cape Town South Africa by three college friends: Tinus Le Roux Schalk van der Merwe and James Taylor. Le Roux had studied civil engineering and then theology and had been ordained as a minister. His interest was in supporting education in disadvantaged communities but he struggled to raise the necessary funds. His entrepreneurial spirit led him out of the church to work first in property retail and then in 360-degree photography. Although he knew very little about photography Le Roux was fascinated by the opportunity afforded by 360-degree pictures for effectively and intuitively communicating spatial information.In 2005 the partners founded Virtual Africa a 360-degree imaging company focused on the South African tourism market. Virtual Africa created 360-degree spherical images of safari lodges and other tourism properties to assist these businesses with their online marketing efforts. In late January 2009 Le Roux saw David Bergman’s panoramic GigaPan gigapixel high-definition image of 2 million people at President Obama’s inauguration at the United States Capitol. Le Roux recalled being able to zoom in deeper and deeper through multiple levels of this image as “awesome” and he immediately ordered a GigaPan Epic Pro robotic camera mount. On July 1 2009 he used the camera mount and his existing camera to create a gigapixel image of Cape Town and Table Mountain which went viral. Le Roux did not like the manufacturer’s user interface so he created the image in a different viewer. Although the image received over 200000 views in the first month the partners did not see a repeat business model from images of tourist attractions and they wondered whether people would be more interested in looking at themselves in high resolution. Le Roux and Taylor considered taking a gigapixel 360-degree image of a crowd at a packed sports stadium: a fancam. The partners recognized that the situation of live professional sports games would not allow the two- to three-hour capturing process required by the GigaPan mount so Le Roux and Taylor re-engineered the mechanical set-up and process to allow an image to be captured in a few minutes. Taylor recalled the process:So at that point we were like okay cool we should be able to shoot this whole crowd in high enough resolution using the mechanical set-up in a short enough amount of time. . . . Then I started thinking this would be really cool if we put it in a sphere because then it would feel like you were standing in the field and were looking around and you could see and just zoom in to everybody. . . . At that stage that had never been done; no one had put those two together to create a full spherical high-resolution image.Through his background as a big wave surfer Taylor had built a relationship with Bob Skinstad a former captain of the South African national Springbok rugby team and later a commentator for the SuperSport broadcasting company. Taylor and Le Roux mentioned the idea to Skinstad at a Cape Town networking event and Skinstad offered to help them with access. A couple of months later Skinstad walked Le Roux and Taylor onto the Newlands Stadium rugby field in Cape Town minutes before the kickoff of the May 22 2010 Super Rugby playoff game between the local Stormers and the New South Wales Waratahs. Taylor described the process that followed:We shot a normal fully spherical image of everything around us—the sky and grass etc.—and then when the stands were full we used a 100-millimetre lens at that stage to shoot a bunch of images went home and started to basically manually put everything together: took a picture and the one to the right of it found a few points that correlated then stitched them then the next and the next level by level.After a week of trial and error limited sleep and some software crashes the pair successfully combined the low-resolution spherical image with the high-resolution fan images to create “this beautiful spherical image that we could zoom in and in and see everybody!” The fancam was uploaded and promoted via email and Facebook so that individuals captured in the image could tag themselves: “say they were there and share their position with their buddies.” The following weekend the pair captured a second fancam image of the Super Rugby championship game at Orlando Stadium in Soweto South Africa. Fancam had created an immersive experience that was beginning to generate high levels of social engagement.While monitoring the people tagging themselves in the fancam on social media Le Roux noticed a tag by Pieter Uys then CEO of Vodacom Group Limited (Vodacom) an African mobile and communications company. Le Roux reached out to Uys via Twitter suggesting that Vodacom could create fancams for the upcoming Tri-Nations rugby tournament between the national men’s teams of South Africa New Zealand and Australia. Uys agreed and a plan was developed for Vodacom to sponsor 10 fancams. The Vodacom fancam deal kicked off on August 21 2010 in front of 94713 spectators at the game between South Africa and New Zealand at the iconic First National Bank (FNB) Stadium. Vodacom subsequently decided to withdraw from a number of its rugby sponsorships due to changing business priorities with the result that the rest of the planned fancams did not happen.Breaking into the United States Market Because the South African sponsorship and social media marketplace was relatively small at the time the partners wondered whether their fancam product would be more successful in the United States. Le Roux and Van der Merwe attended the Sports Marketing 2.0 VIP Summit in Atlanta in October 2010 hosted by Pat Coyle the previous executive director of digital business for the Indianapolis Colts. “Pat was instrumental in getting us connected in the United States” said Le Roux. “Not only did he immediately see the potential but he was kind enough to open his Rolodex to help us get going.” As a result of the contacts they developed at the conference the pair presented the product to the Coca-Cola Company and Comcast Corporation immediately after the conference. By January 8 2011 the Colts had contracted Fancam to create an image for their wild-card playoff game against the New York Jets after a concept shoot at their American Football Conference (AFC) South conference game against the Tennessee Titans the week before. Three weeks later the Pittsburgh Steelers invited Fancam to shoot an image of their AFC championship game against the New York Jets which McDonald’s Corporation had agreed to sponsor. The Steelers also provided fans with the opportunity to purchase “one-of-a-kind panoramic” images from their official photo store; individual fans could have their faces placed on the Heinz Field scoreboard in the images (see Exhibit 1 for a selection of this and other Fancam images). Within another four weeks Fancam had shot its first U2 concert on February 13 and its first Daytona 500 race on February 20. Le Roux was a massive U2 fan. He had shared lead singer Bono’s approach to social gospel and had followed the Irish band’s 360-degree tour plans with interest. He had also reached out unsuccessfully to the band’s South African promoters Big Concerts in late 2010. However a week before U2’s concert in Johannesburg on February 13 2011 Craig Evans head of global operations for the band’s international promoters Live Nation requested a meeting and a proof of concept. Taylor who was capturing the NCAA men’s basketball game between Duke and North Carolina flew back to South Africa on February 9 because no other photographers had yet been trained in the capture process. U2 wanted Fancam to shoot the Johannesburg concert that weekend and the Cape Town concert the following weekend but Taylor needed to be back in the United States to shoot the Daytona 500 the following weekend. Taylor captured the Johannesburg concert photograph and Taylor and Le Roux worked non-stop for four days to deliver the image. Taylor was on a plane to the United States when Le Roux received a call from Evans as U2 was expecting them to shoot the Cape Town concert. Le Roux recalled:I ended up doing that one with a fever of 105° Fahrenheit reverse-engineering what James had done having never before even held a DSLR camera in my life—no less using one to capture 70000 fans. It wasn’t the best picture but we got it done! And I think they saw we could operate and that our hearts were in the right place. Soon after we got a call for 26 shows in the United States—and the rest is history.The partners recognized that to take advantage of these opportunities they needed to recruit and train photographers. Taylor searched the Internet for sports photographers and invited an initial group for three days of Fancam-specific training. By June 2011 the company had contracted 10 photographers as part of the business; they each brought their own minimal set of camera equipment to each shoot along with a Fancam-supplied panoramic head. Back in Cape Town Le Roux focused on building the rest of the organization including a chief financial officer chief operations officer and web interface design and fancam image production teams. By the end of 2011 Fancam employed 20 people in South Africa and had contracted a number of students to check image stitching. The production team worked odd hours to process images that photographers uploaded within hours of shoots in Europe Asia Australia or the United States. Le Roux also facilitated a US$75000 investment from an angel investor which Fancam would use to acquire the computing power required to produce high-quality images. An international live entertainment production company offered to acquire Fancam and although the founders declined the offer the company became both a client and a minority shareholder.The industry and competitorsThe sports ecosystem consisted of at least five components including clubs or teams leagues media brands and fans. The clubs including the players generated the excitement for most fans and received direct revenues from fans and sponsoring brands. The clubs also benefited from indirect revenues distributed by organized leagues which they earned mainly through media and sponsorship deals. Many of these deals were initiated negotiated and managed by advertising marketing and sponsorship agencies which facilitated the commercialization of the industry. By 2014 the global sports events market—defined by A. T. Kearney as all ticketing media rights and sponsorships for major sports—delivered total revenues of $76 billion; it had grown from $46 billion in 2005 and was expected to reach $91 billion by 2017. In 2013 the Europe Middle East and Africa region contributed $33 billion and was closely followed by North America which contributed $29 billion. A recent IEG sponsorship report suggested that sponsorship spending made up most of this market with North America dominating (see Exhibit 2). South Africa’s total sports market reached $1.5 billion in 2013 with sponsorship spending contributing over $600 million.Sport sponsors typically spent as much on activating their sponsorships as they did on the initial rights fees. Activation referred to marketing activities directly linked to individual sponsorships and aimed at increasing the awareness engagement trial purchase and advocacy a sponsor set out to achieve through the sponsorships. In 2013 sponsors spent an average of $1.50 for every $1.00 they invested in rights and 14 per cent of the respondents in one study spent at least three times as much. Public relations (used by 89 per cent of respondents) and social media (used by 88 per cent) were the most common activation channels followed by internal communication (86 per cent) hospitality (81 per cent) and traditional advertising (77 per cent). The same study found that the most important metrics for sponsors were awareness of the sponsorship (indicated by 94 per cent of those surveyed) and awareness of the products service or brand (indicated by 90 per cent)—ahead of attitudes toward the brand (indicated by 84 per cent). Lucien Boyer president and CEO of Havas Sports & Entertainment explained:Sponsorship continues to change. Today it is all about taking a fan-centric approach to creating engagement and that means understanding that all fans are different and that engagement needs to be personalised. Of course the real breakthrough is understanding how to use technology to achieve those goals on behalf of clients. Activation today needs to empower people to interact and enable them to fulfill the experiences they crave. The key is to produce content that is accessible anywhere and at any time not just during an event itself. Through social media that content can engage a whole community because after all social media is now mass media and as powerful as broadcast has been before. Sport has become a social currency and if a sponsor’s activation is engaging enough it will lead to an audience that really becomes involved and doesn’t just read the story. That requires content that is relevant not random and creative enough to hook people into participation.Fancam found that a number of competitors in the marketplace were providing similar gigapixel images. Most of these were photographers operating as individuals who consequently struggled with production time and scale. Following Fancam’s success in 2011 a number of similar companies such as Huggity Ltd. (Huggity) and Blakeway Gigapixel emerged as potential competitors.Since October 2011 Ireland-based Huggity had worked across five continents with over 100 brands including the New Zealand All Blacks Manchester United and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). One of Fancam’s first interactions with Huggity occurred in November 2011 in Dublin where Fancam was shooting a Westlife concert. As Taylor was leaving the arena after the high-definition crowd shot the team from Huggity intercepted him. According to Taylor the Huggity team expressed surprise at “how simple the process was” and noted that they couldn’t come up with that themselves. In May 2013 Huggity received an equity investment from Ireland-based Enterprise Equity Venture Capital of over $800000 part of which would be used to fund 16 additional sales support and relationship management positions in Dublin. By then Huggity was selling through partners in the United States Brazil Australia Norway Poland Turkey and Belgium. Recently Taylor had noticed that Huggity was producing partial spherical images rather than full spherical images—perhaps because the partial images were “a lot easier quicker and a bit cheaper to kick out.” Le Roux noted that Huggity seemed less active in the market and might have scaled back its sales approach. Blakeway Gigapixel was an offering of Blakeway Worldwide Panoramas a panoramic art print business founded by American James Blakeway in 1991. Blakeway positioned its gigapixel images as add-ons to existing panoramic products offering the gigapixel images for free as long as the sport team or business agreed to promote the gigapixel and panorama noting on its website that “Our business is selling panoramas. The gigapixel is a marketing tool.” Blakeway was officially licensed with the NFL the National Hockey League (NHL) the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and the NCAA and it had recently taken gigapixel images of the NHL Winter Classic in Michigan the Coupe de la Ligue Final in Paris and the Cy-Hawk Series football game between Iowa State University and the University of Iowa.Average commissions to industry sales agents or resellers varied widely. Technology firms typically paid 10 per cent of a contract’s value to their field sales teams while broader service-based firms reported paying between 20 and 50 per cent of revenues.Fancam’s clients were mostly team or event sponsors such as Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV GEICO and JP Morgan Chase & Co. which used branded fancams to strengthen their brands’ associations with teams or events. IEG reported that Anheuser-Busch InBev was the most active sponsor of the Major League Baseball (MLB) league and teams followed by insurance and food brands. Within the NFL PepsiCo Inc. was the most active sponsor and insurance and quick-service restaurants dominated the active categories. GEICO and Spalding were the most active NBA sponsors followed by telecommunications and quick-service restaurant brands.By 2015 while the average fancam was delivering 40000 page views (130 per cent of attendance) and each person spent an average of five minutes on the page Le Roux noted that many of the company’s clients struggled to interpret the value of such high levels of engagement. Many clients bought Fancam’s product “because it was cool and digital and social.” Clients signed off on custom fancam website designs which were typically completed a week before each actual shoot. Most clients trusted Fancam with the final images and did not review them before they were made live. By 2015 Fancam generally delivered live images within 24 hours of shooting events although some clients requested the images within 12 hours or sooner. Le Roux argued that these clients who “asked for a real-time version” came to understand that “in the memory business real time doesn’t give them more exposure or engagement than next day.” Taylor explained:From the beginning my priority has been that there needs to be a very very good user experience. If you look at our competitors’ pictures you will see a lot of them have got what we call stitching errors. . . . If you have people cut in half it is not always a good user experience so our images have to be perfect.Spectators buying tickets for public events in the United States agreed to a set of terms and conditions which included granting permission to the event owners to utilize theirname image likeness acts poses plays appearance movements and statements in any live or recorded audio video or photographic display or other transmission exhibition publication or reproduction made of or at the event (regardless of whether before during or after play or performance) for any purpose in any manner in any medium or context now known or hereafter developed without further authorization from or compensation to you or anyone acting on your behalf.International channel managementFancam’s participation in the 2010 Atlanta conference had caught the attention of not only prospective clients but also sales agent companies from Europe and the United States. Le Roux acknowledged that the company initially worked with everyone who enquired to see who could deliver: “We used gut feel knowledge of people to make decisions on these things and for the most part we made good decisions but it was a hell of a lot of hard work.”After a year of operations Fancam had resellers in 11 countries. Over the years Fancam’s resellers sold a varying number of fancy images (see Exhibit 3). Many of these resellers contacted Fancam promising access to appealing sporting venues and teams with which Le Roux and his team did not have existing relationships. Le Roux recalled an early example:We had an agency from Spain contact us saying that they knew some people at Real Madrid who would like to buy it. We said “Fine.” We were not in contact with anyone at Real Madrid and were just trying to stitch these images together get them out learn about service or things like that so “Go for it.”Le Roux was also aware that the team initially lacked confidence: “If someone phoned and said ‘I know the guys at the Packers’ I had to go and look on a map where the Packers were! So how am I going to get to the Packers with this accent?” With most of the company’s potential U.S. clients operating at least six hours behind Cape Town time sales calls often occurred late at night in South Africa.Fancam attracted two main types of resellers: The first type typically had strong relationships with sport teams perhaps due to existing contracts managing their digital print stores or social media accounts. These resellers often sold fancams for special marquee events such as championship or annual rivalry games. The second type of reseller viewed exclusive Fancam rights as a competitive advantage to becoming the agency of record for a corporate brand. The focus of this kind of reseller was therefore on helping brands develop new ways of engaging with customers—with a fancam being one of a range of tools that could be used.Fancam developed training documents and workshops for resellers after those in different markets began to have similar queries and some resellers struggled to follow the agreed procedures. The training included a focus on Fancam’s customer relationship management system which defined a sales cycle workflow to capture and manage prospects needs analysis quotations and sales. The Fancam team in Cape Town hosted weekly status calls and regular strategy discussions with resellers while Le Roux travelled to attend some client sales meetings in person. The head office also collaborated on quotations sales collateral and tailored proposals and pitches for the resellers to use; these included fancam mock-ups and live demonstrations. The training documents also highlighted additional value proposition dimensions that resellers could integrate into their prospecting and needs analysis conversations in the market.Given the uncertainty of market demand Fancam initially allowed resellers to set prices and developed a payment and commission structure to support this. A base rate of $6500 per fancam would go to Fancam and the reseller was able to earn an 80 per cent sales commission on any price above the base rate. No limits were placed on reseller commissions and the reseller was paid after the final client invoice was issued and the project was successfully completed. After a few months the average actual price paid became the new benchmark for other agents. After Fancam missed out on a Super Bowl shoot because a reseller had quoted a price almost 10 times the market rate Le Roux replaced the 20/80 split with 25 per cent straight sales commissions on new deals. Later when some resellers “starting selling stuff below rate card” Le Roux introduced a discounted sliding scale sales commission for exceptional cases which was based on the market conditions and good faith negotiations. Le Roux was seen by his team as a very logical problem solver who considered all sides and was a strong believer in good ethics. A reseller who sold a fancam at a discount greater than the maximum 20 per cent discount available for a package of 10 events would earn a proportionally lower sales commission. For example a 25 per cent discount to the client would result in a 20 per cent commission to the reseller which would reduce to a 10 per cent commission for a 50 per cent discount. An additional volume commission structure was also put in place: resellers who achieved more than $120000 cumulative sales value per quarter received 5 per cent of that value 30 days after the end of the relevant quarter. At the time Fancam formalized a two-tier rate card: first it offered a fancam—which the rights holder could onsell to a sponsor—to a team event or federation at $10000; second it offered a fancam to a sponsor directly at $20000. A 40 per cent discount on these rates was available for events with fewer than 20000 spectators while bulk discounts for multiple events ranged between 10 and 20 per cent. During the initial contracting period with resellers quarterly minimums were negotiated. Le Roux recalled:I would say “Look guys what do you think you can sell?” They would say they think they can sell 10 fancams per quarter so I would say “Okay let’s make your minimum four. Do you agree that something must have gone completely wrong if you can’t deliver four fancams?” And they’d agreed to that as a minimum.The quotas provided the resellers with exclusivity in their country markets. Resellers who failed to achieve their agreed minimums were allowed to continue selling fancams but lost their exclusivity. Any resellers who continued to miss quotas had their representation contract cancelled. For projects or clients that were referred to Fancam outside of a formal authorized reseller agreement Fancam offered a referral commission equal to 5 per cent of the price charged for the fancam.As a global business Fancam included a provision in its reseller contract to manage situations where a client of a reseller in one market expanded its use of fancams to sponsored events in other markets perhaps through a larger deal in its international head office. In spite of the provision and requirement to communicate possible conflicts a recent deal with an international airline client had significantly damaged relationships. The client which was being managed by Fancam’s Australian reseller had purchased a number of fancams in that market and was also considering purchasing a fancam through its Australian reseller for a major United States event it was sponsoring. At the same time Fancam’s American reseller proposed that the event could offer a fancam to the airline sponsor at an inflated rate allowing the event to generate additional sponsorship revenues. When the client responded that it was already planning an event fancam and would be buying it for almost five times less than was being offered in the United States the event executives “had egg on their face were obviously not happy with the Fancam reseller in the United States which in turn reflected badly on us” recalled Le Roux.Strategic alternativesBy early 2015 Le Roux needed to decide on Fancam’s channel management approach. Although the resellers had delivered strong revenue growth and a solid “land grab” market position contributing to the sale of over 350 fancams since 2011 Le Roux was concerned that the growing difficulty of managing resellers was negatively affecting the business. Various strategic alternatives were being considered.Fancam had ended the agreement with its primary reseller in the United States and discovered that the reseller had been subcontracting a second agency to sell fancams at a higher rate. Le Roux had come away from meeting the second agency feeling confident about the senior executive’s ability to deliver and he wondered whether he should offer that agency exclusive rights to the American market. Le Roux was aware of a few other agencies in the United States and wondered whether Fancam should try non-exclusive resellers for this substantial market. Fancam’s reseller commission experiments had delivered mixed results. Although the appealing incentives had grown overall revenues beyond expectations the resellers often earned almost as much as Fancam. Le Roux was “fine not making as much money as I could for a while” but was growing uncomfortable with the sense that resellers were “chasing commission” resulting in an inconsistent value proposition in the market. He also wondered how sustainable this approach would be as some resellers focused on the biggest individual deals possible to the detriment of regular fancams and relationships with clients. Le Roux needed to decide on the most appropriate incentive structure for the single or multiple resellers in each country.During the past four years Le Roux had learned how clients differed across the world. In Europe sports teams typically bought fancams as spectator engagement activations and sponsors in Europe expected the teams to pay for the activations. In the United States teams were able to sell fancam activation on to new or existing sponsors which meant that Fancam and its reseller needed to deal with both the teams and the sponsors. One MLB team had recently suggested that spectator engagement was less of a priority for the team than being able to generate additional sponsorship revenue by including a fancam for a big game in an annual sponsorship deal. Le Roux wondered about the implications of his channel management decision on the brand positioning of Fancam in the market—especially given the hype about data analytics content marketing and the possibility of using Fancam’s technology to more deeply understand spectator behaviour through regular fancams rather than one-off event shoots. Mobile technology innovations including augmented and virtual reality were also attracting attention adding to a more challenging sales environment.After operating through resellers internationally for more than three years Le Roux sometimes felt that he “could sell it better than anyone else.” He wondered whether the time had come to build a stronger internal capacity to take on the sales role directly:We felt that many of these international partners specifically in the Western markets underestimated us because we were from South Africa and felt we couldn’t do business development without them. There was arrogance. . . . We felt disrespected in some of the relationships.As he had a young family in Cape Town Le Roux did not see himself spending most of the year travelling internationally but he did not have anyone else in his team who could play that role. He was also nervous about whether people who did not live every day in the American sports context might miss the social nuances and shifts in fan behaviour and client strategies. He had no doubt however that the current approach to channel management needed to change and that he needed to respond to the potential exclusive reseller in the coming week.Exhibit 1: Selection of fancam imagesSource: Fancam internal documents.Exhibit 2: Regional sponsorship spending in 2014 (IN US$)Source: Adapted from IEG “As Sponsorship Borders Fall Spending Rises” IEG Sponsorship Report January 5 2016 accessed November 5 2018 www.sponsorship.com/IEGSR/2016/01/05/As-Sponsorship-Borders-Fall-Spending-Rises.aspx.Exhibit 3: Summary of number of fancam images sold per reseller per year 2011–2014Source: Fancam internal documents.

(Wal-Mart) had shaped purchasing power for more than a million U.S. workers. Wal-Mart’s economic muscle was so profound that one could assume that the corporation’s wage policies had had a significant impact on the struggle for a living wage in the United States—but did this assumption have any merit? Wal-Mart had set the benchmark for low-cost retail labour practices. Understanding how Wal-Mart set the agenda with wages invited the investigation of a few pertinent questions: What socio-economic forces were in play and what was the environmental context that shaped Wal-Mart’s approach to managing its labour force? What were Wal-Mart’s wage-related practices and how did the hourly rate paid to workers by the corporation affect prevailing wage rates? Finally what were the benefits for Wal-Mart if it pursued a progressive wage rate agenda related to a living wage and what were the disadvantages if it did not? BackgroundThe living wage discussion was not unique to the United States nor was it solely a contemporary topic. In 1906 John Ryan noted professor of moral theology and industrial ethics at the Catholic University of America declared that a living wage was not merely a right but a natural right possessed by any labourer. Ryan asserted that a clear distinction existed between a personal right and a social right and argued that a living wage was not something society owed to a worker or something that should be provided to a worker for reasons related to the common good but rather a condition where the worker was entitled to a living wage as a moral and natural right.For many people in 2017 a living wage had become an idea synonymous with economic justice. The notion of a living wage had its genesis among industrial workers in the United Kingdom in the 1870s when organized labour used the living wage campaign to challenge the prevailing supply and demand policy of the time. This situation influenced the progressive movement in the United States as well as contemporary events involving the minimum wage that transpired in both Australia and New Zealand where the idea of a living wage was embraced by trade unions and minimum wage laws were enacted in the 1890s. The idea of a living wage subsequently spread to the United States and Canada. One definition of the living wage argued that a living wage should be a standard of living substantial enough to ensure that no more than 30 per cent of one’s working income would be spent on housing. Although the precise method of calculation varied with the contextual variables chosen a living wage was calculated by identifying annual living expenses and then translating that information into an hourly wage rate appropriate to the specific geographical context of the worker. Typical annual expenses used in this calculation included food child care medical costs housing transportation miscellaneous expenses for personal care items and income taxes. The hourly wage was further refined after the household was categorized (that is as one adult one adult and one child two adults with one working and so forth).The Living Wage DiscourseThe first living wage municipal ordinance was enacted by the city of Baltimore in 1994 but it affected only a scant 1500 workers. This victory for higher wages resulted from activism by a coalition of interfaith religious denominations labour organizations and community groups. Organized at the grassroots level a combination of 50 Baltimore churches had joined forces with the union of American Federation of State county and municipal employees and various lower-wage workers. This church activism was a response to soup kitchens and food pantries that were full of the working poor. These workers not only needed ongoing assistance from churches in the Baltimore area but were also frequently forced to turn to public assistance (i.e. food stamps and subsidized housing). Opponents of a living wage argued that the practice established a wage floor that caused companies to hire fewer employees. The result of this wage floor would be higher unemployment and a deadweight loss a cost society endured because of market inefficiency. According to this thinking overpaying a worker prevented other low-skilled workers from finding a job. Supporters of the living wage disagreed and argued that higher wages had other benefits such as more satisfied employees a lowered turnover rate decreased recruiting costs improved morale and higher worker productivity. Moreover opponents of a higher wage standard also predicted that many businesses that could not afford to pay a higher wage would have to close or be forced to lay off workers—in short wage increases made it much more challenging for businesses to operate and for low-skilled workers to find jobs. Others pointed out that the federal wage level had not considered regional variations in the cost of living. Some states reacted to this cost of living discourse; by 2014 for example 11 states had indexed the minimum wage standard to the cost of living. There was evidence that instead of causing a reduced workforce paying a higher wage caused employers to cut labour costs in other ways. In the United Kingdom for instance after raising hourly wage rates some employers later reduced overtime pay rates removed premiums for evening or weekend work ended meal allowances or even reduced pension contributions.Some opponents predicted that an increase in prevailing wages would affect the cost of food. It was further suggested that a rise in food prices resulting from the cost of higher wages would vary by industry. One study found that food prices would likely increase overall by about 4 per cent if the federal minimum wage increased by 10 per cent and suggested that price increases in the fast food industry would probably increase the most by about 10 per cent with the same percentage increase in wages.Proponents of a living wage argued that higher wages would grow the economy by creating new jobs. There was a precedent that paying higher wages increased profits and turned workers into consumers with more money to spend but the lessons that had been learned in that scenario in the past were not applicable to 2017’s global context. In the early 20th century Henry Ford had doubled the daily wage of his assembly line workers to what he considered a living wage amid widespread criticism from business leaders and stockholders; the move dramatically reduced turnover and reaped Ford even greater profits while he turned his workers into consumers of the product they produced. Minimum-Wage Workers and the Living WageThe struggles for a living wage and the federal minimum wage movement in the United States were related. Essentially economists and researchers were at odds about whether a mandated minimum wage grew or destroyed jobs. Confusing matters further was the impact that inflation had in eroding wages. In 1968 for instance a US$1.60 per-hour minimum wage was worth $10.56 per hour by 2017’s standards yet the 2017 federal minimum wage standard was $7.25. By 1996 because of inflation the impact of the minimum wage had deteriorated about 30 per cent while simultaneously wages continued to stagnate forcing many low-wage workers onto community and public assistance. Since 2009 U.S. worker productivity had increased while wages declined—and those workers at the lowest end of the pay scale were affected the most. Despite the efforts of some cities and counties economists remained divided over the issue of a $15-per-hour minimum wage. Some argued that the replacement of workers with technology was a bigger issue others stressed the need to proceed incrementally with any wage increases and still others cautioned about the risks to industries that did not pay the rate and provoked a general slowdown in hiring.Contrary to widespread belief minimum-wage workers were not mainly teenagers working their first jobs while still attending school. Besides young people entering the job market minimum-wage workers quite often included part-time workers older workers and women of any ethnicity. Overall in 2012 minimum-wage workers comprised about 2.1 per cent of the hourly workforce—approximately 1.5 million workers. More than 60 per cent of those workers were concentrated in the retail/wholesale leisure and hospitality industries. When hourly workers at or below minimum wage were classified by gender ethnicity and work status it was noteworthy that in every category women greatly exceeded male workers as recipients of minimum wage or below. In 2012 about 5.2 per cent of hourly workers in the private sector were at or below minimum wage compared to 1.9 per cent of public sector hourly workers. Additionally there were differences in workers at or below minimum wage between industries in both the private and public sectors. The percentage of workers at or below minimum wage in the leisure/hospitality industry was especially great when compared to other areas of the private sector and was more than four times greater than the wholesale/retail industry which followed the leisure/hospitality industry in number of workers at or below minimum wage.Local living wage ordinances differed from federal minimum wage legislation in their ability to have an impact on a large number of workers. Most living wage ordinances at the local level were limited in their scope and especially in the number of workers affected. The context was often about companies that had received contracts from a municipality or local government entity or some type of business assistance in the form of grants low-interest loans tax abatements and so on. Thus in huge cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco only a small minority of the overall workforce benefited from local legislation and in smaller towns and rural areas the number of workers affected was inconsequential. In fact these local ordinances had little impact on workers with low skills or those living at the poverty level although there was some evidence that the poverty rate was lower in locations benefiting from the ordinance where city contractors received meaningful assistance. State minimum wage laws often contained provisions to induce employers to provide health insurance holiday pay or even to index the wage to inflation. Many cities developed their own wage ordinances. In Los Angeles in 1997 for instance the Los Angeles Living Wage Ordinance included a provision that allowed employers to put a small portion of the hourly wage into employee health benefits but research indicated that the practice had little effect on persuading employers to provide health care benefits. The ordinance seemed to have reduced turnover and absenteeism but it may also have prompted the employment of a greater number of part-time workers.  By 2001 all locally enacted living wage ordinances in the United States affected only about 100000 workers. Despite this number some people continued to view the living wage movement with optimism. The largely grassroots approach created a sort of national momentum for the concept and living wage activist organizations sought to expand the idea into the national discourse more forcefully. Wal-Mart and the Living WageWal-Mart’s wage policies affected taxpayers (who were ultimately the payers for public assistance programs) and the public sector which faced increased demand for services. Wal-Mart’s low wage employment model did not provide workers with enough income to contribute to meaningful consumer spending and thus became a negative drag on the economy. At a wage of $10 per hour even a full-time worker in the average state made only slightly more than half the income needed to support a family. Americans for Tax Fairness declared that employees who made $10 per hour still needed taxpayer assistance in the form of food stamps and Medicaid to survive.One way to explore the notion of a living wage was to compare what a corporation said it would do regarding compensation to what it actually did. This comparison was essentially a discussion about espoused versus enacted values. Wal-Mart clearly understood the impact this discussion could have on public opinion and on its corporate reputation. On Wal-Mart’s corporate website for instance the section titled “Opportunity & Advancement” positioned Wal-Mart regarding a living wage and provided a detailed reasoned and deliberate exposition of its strategy. Wal-Mart asserted that it offered competitive pay—but especially stressed that the corporation offered upward mobility.  A similar promotional piece on Wal-Mart’s corporate website touted the $2.7 billion the company had invested in higher wages training and education. The website reported that 75 per cent of store managers had started as hourly employees and now earned between $50000 and $170000 annually and that more than 300000 employees had been with the company 10 years or more. This investment included the development of 200 training academies in the United States and classroom and sales training for hourly supervisors and department managers. A website infographic indicated that after one year the project had resulted in over 200000 promotions the conversion of more than 150000 part-time positions to full-time positions and 8000 new department manager positions. Developers expected to serve more than 500000 trainees at the new academies. When it came to compensation Wal-Mart had raised the pay of more than 1.2 million workers at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores in the United States. On the other side of the discussion posted public comments about this information included those by a worker who had inquired about the lack of upward mobility in her department.Wal-Mart had other contextual challenges: over the past few years many stores had gained a reputation for having dirty bathrooms shelves that were either empty or inconsistently stocked checkouts that were tedious or employees who provided a generally unhelpful or unfriendly shopping experience. Even though overall revenue in 2015 showed that earnings were positive sales had plunged for five straight quarters in Wal-Mart stores that had been open for at least a year. Considering that only 16 per cent of stores had met their customer service goals Wal-Mart executives reevaluated their minimalist approach to workers’ pay. 2015 was a pivotal year for Wal-Mart. Under pressure from investors the corporation’s new executive team sorted through analysis related to the company’s slide in sales and the news was unfortunate. Besides the environmental challenges at many of its stores Wal-Mart’s profits were contested by global currency manipulators intense competition from brick-and-mortar rivals and even more intense competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s online juggernaut. Wal-Mart reduced its workforce consistently from 2008 through 2013 even as the square footage of its stores increased by 13 per cent. In February 2015 chief executive officer (CEO) Doug McMillon admitted to employees watching a company-wide video feed that Wal-Mart’s obsession with cutting labour costs had been a mistake and that accordingly the company would be making adjustments. However certain Wal-Mart labour practices seemed ambiguous in intent; for example employee hours were restricted to less than 40 hours per week and 34 hours was considered full-time for in-house practice. These policies meant the corporation did not have to offer benefits such as health care to those employees—a noteworthy practice from the largest private sector employer in the United States with about 1.5 million employees. At $10 per hour the annual salary for those workers amounted to less than $18000. Employees making that annual income could not afford the necessities of life yet their employer had an excess of $480 billion in gross revenues and more than $16 billion in profits in 2016. In 2015 Wal-Mart’s CEO received a salary of $19.4 million—more than $9323 per hour based on a 40-hour week.  	Some commentators suggested that Wal-Mart could easily afford to pay a $15 per-hour minimum wage and asserted that the company’s low wages had been subsidized by the taxpayers who paid for public assistance. Wal-Mart’s wage-related policies affected not only those taxpayers but also the public sector in general which faced increased demand for services. At $10 per hour an adult with one child qualified for both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; in short this family was eligible for food stamps. Wal-Mart’s Walmart 2015 Diversity & Inclusion report committed the corporation to $10 an hour or more for employees as of February 2016. Competing claims about Wal-Mart were not always easy to sort out. Wal-Mart’s announcement in early 2016 that it would raise wages again for its hourly employees was largely met with skepticism. A spokesperson for Making Change at Walmart a labour advocacy group pointed out that following the much-marketed pay raise to $9 per hour in 2015 workers subsequently saw their hours cut and annual pay raise reduced. Wal-Mart’s sheer size and profitability contributed to the public pressure on the corporation to increase its wages. In fact even though a considerable amount of minimum hourly-wage workers in the United States worked at smaller businesses Wal-Mart’s detractors focused on the corporation as one that had engaged in an incredible amount of commerce in terms of sales and paid its CEO a mind-boggling salary yet still refused to pay higher wages so its employees could avoid having to apply for some type of government living assistance.  Wal-Mart’s detractors included many former employees who published articles and commented in public forums. Alleged abuses of employees included Wal-Mart purposefully capping workers’ weekly hours which in some instances ranged from 29 to 39 per week. Work schedules were changed almost weekly in many cases which resulted in chaos for work–life balance when it came to family medical appointments and other life activities common to most workers. Employees were not allowed to leave when their shift ended until the store manager granted permission for everyone to do so after ensuring the store was sufficiently clean. Additionally employees were not allowed to use their cellular phones to call babysitters during this indefinite period. DiscussionProponents who advocated for Wal-Mart to increase its wages pointed out the potential benefits of paying a $15-per-hour wage. Foremost of these was the expectation of a ripple effect of purchasing power throughout the retail industry. Proponents also cited the efficiency wage theory—the idea that paying higher wages than the prevailing rate would translate into loyal motivated workers with high productivity. Wal-Mart had not paid an efficiency wage in the past so a shift to a minimum rate as high as $15 would be a game-changing decision. Significantly Wal-Mart had the economic power to set the retail agenda when it came to wage practice. The corporation’s pay increases to $9 per hour (in 2015) and to $10 per hour (in 2016) were quickly copied by other large retailers including Target Corporation (Target) Ross Stores and T.J. Maxx Companies. Target rapidly followed Wal-Mart’s lead on pay increases in early 2015 and matched the increase to $9 per hour for workers and then in 2016 again matched Wal-Mart with an increase to $10 per hour. According to one source Target’s move reflected strong competition in the retail industry for workers and was a response to union-inspired pressure in some cities across the United States. A Target spokesperson would not disclose how many of its approximately 341000 employees received a raise; however employees who had been making over $10 per hour were entitled to some sort of annual merit raise or pay increase. Yet the move had some downsides for Target: the increased labour costs affected its gross margin projections for 2016 and Barclays analysts downgraded the company’s stock. Further aside from the anecdotal evidence from part-time employees that Target responded to the rising labour costs by cutting the hours of some employees Target was also plagued by union-building activities.  Ross Stores followed Wal-Mart’s lead and matched $1 per hour wage increases in 2015 and 2016 and like Target experienced lower earnings forecasts. The story was the same for T.J. Maxx Companies which included Marshalls and HomeGoods with two pay increases of $1 per hour matching Wal-Mart’s moves. T.J. Maxx Companies CEO Carol Meyrowitz remarked that the move was needed to retain the best talent and to remain competitive. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) had already been paying higher wages than Wal-Mart and Target but it also raised employee wages in 2016. Although not specifically linked to Wal-Mart’s increase with sales up and cardholders on the increase Costco’s chief financial officer Richard Galanti remarked that the move was partly because of the physical nature of many of the company’s jobs and that the company wanted to be known as a premier employer. Like Wal-Mart competitors Target and Costco featured expressions of espoused values on their corporate websites. Target was committed to issues such as sustainability community relations volunteerism diversity and corporate social responsibility. It had an extensive list of benefits and perks available to employees—but what was missing was any reference to the quantity or quality of its compensation for employees and there was no mention of a minimum or living wage standard. Like Target Costco made no direct mention of compensation or a minimum wage standard on its corporate website. Costco too provided extensive information on employee opportunities benefits and career possibilities. In some regions of the United States there had long been clear indications that it was time for Wal-Mart to reconsider wage increases. Over time California and New York two of Wal-Mart’s most profitable markets raised their states’ minimum wage to $15 per hour. One prediction for Wal-Mart was that store sales would increase between $4 and $28 for every dollar spent on payroll at that store. By some estimates the tremendous cost of replacing employees was a bigger issue. Turnover costs at Wal-Mart were estimated to be $4275 per lost employee so improving retention through higher pay was possibly a reasonable approach. In sum Wal-Mart’s wage-related activities had been so important to the U.S. economy that the results of these somewhat tentative pay increases could have far-reaching consequences. Questions and ChoicesDid Wal-Mart’s wage-related practices influence the struggle for a living wage in the United States? There was little doubt this was true for the retail industry which cut across all regions of the country. Wal-Mart’s competitors had quickly matched each of Wal-Mart’s recent pay raises in the context of competing for workers; Wal-Mart’s wage increases must also have been considered trendsetting moves for other typically minimum-wage industries such as hospitality and prepared food. It was significant that some states had recently mandated a $15 per-hour minimum wage over the coming few years.What were the socio-economic forces that influenced Wal-Mart and what was the environmental context? Certainly the living wage and federal minimum wage movements were active socio-economic forces that continued to affect Wal-Mart deeply. Wal-Mart viewed labour as an area for cost-cutting and savings on operations. Labour was not considered a valued resource for the company as evidenced by the manipulation of workers’ schedules to keep them below 40 hours per week—a decision that committed the corporation to a reduced workforce—and by the other heavy-handed labour practices used by some managers. Paying low wages resulted in many Wal-Mart workers applying for public assistance. In the political/legal dimension because the federal minimum wage had proved inadequate for providing workers with a living wage legislation was passed at the local and state levels that mandated an incremental increase in wages over time founded on thinking that favoured a living wage. When Wal-Mart’s wage practices were viewed over time it was clear to the company’s top leadership that the harsh approach to labour management had failed miserably. It was also evident from publicly posted comments by former employees that Wal-Mart’s labour practices had been a source of tension in some stores. The corporation faced two basic choices: it could return to the mainly cost-cutting and compliance-oriented labour practices of the past or the corporation could embrace a culture of engagement and participation with its employees. Because of its impressive cash reserves and continued profitable operations Wal-Mart could likely afford to pay a higher wage even with the huge number of workers it employed. The disadvantages Wal-Mart faced if it continued with its past wage practices included loss of morale and loyalty in its workforce increased union-building efforts criticism from public sources and loss of reputation and serious worker retention problems. The advantages for Wal-Mart if it embraced a paid wage closer to a living wage and pursued labour policies of engagement and participation with employees included better morale higher productivity lessened union activity and higher retention of workers. Regardless of what it chose to do Wal-Mart needed to establish consistency across its stores’ practices. The caveat was a lack of research on the effects of paying an efficiency wage though it was recognized that higher labour costs caused lowered earnings forecasts. This result seemed to be an obvious outcome but those labour costs might also have been offset over time by savings from higher retention and increased productivity. Wal-Mart’s leadership was at a crossroads of strategic choices: how should the corporation proceed? ENDNOTES

Just over a month into her new job Brown was confronted by an internal memo posted by Google engineer James Damore espousing his views on the causes of gender disparities and problems with the company’s diversity programs. Damore’s memo was leaked to the public and he was fired two days later. The chain of events set off one of the most publicized controversies in the firm’s history. The incident brought chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai back from vacation and led to a high-level decision focused on protecting Google’s public image and employees’ well-being. Corporate communication with Damore was brief and the unrest had a chilling effect on what would otherwise have been Brown’s impressive transition as an up-and-coming high-tech executive.Damore’s memo provoked a dizzying array of viewpoints within the company and once public within the media. With the turmoil showing little sign of abating Damore’s memo reminded many women of the hurt they had experienced from discrimination and harassment. The company’s reaction also left many employees who held unpopular views frightened that they too could be targeted. Brown had to find a way to move people past debates over Damore and his memo. It was an opportunity to demonstrate the candour and character that could help her team regain hope set an example for others and build trust in her and in the company. In a circumstance where communication and relationships had become fractured her leadership would now be defined by how she chose her words in the wake of the crisis.DANIELLE BROWNBrown was appointed Google’s new vice-president of diversity integrity and governance in 2017. She arrived on the job just over a month before the Damore crisis broke in August 2017. In 2009 Brown was one of 15 master of business administration graduates nationwide who were accepted into the accelerated leadership program at Intel Corporation (Intel). Showing the versatility that allowed her to excel as a management consultant sales manager and product marketer in her early career Brown rose to chief of staff of global human resources (HR) within four years was appointed chief diversity and inclusion officer just a year later then vice-president of global HR three years after that.Although the Intel appointment was the first diversity and inclusion role in Brown’s career she boasted a record that exceeded the company’s goals for diversity hiring. She had achieved stretch goals for hiring and retention weekly reporting transparent metrics engagement of majority males a complaint hotline and confrontation of offenders. In 2015 when Brown had less than a year in the diversity role Intel’s CEO announced an investment of US$300 million over five years in diversity efforts. Brown’s value proposition was a culture where a “diverse range of perspectives and views” enabled business success. Intel boasted an “open door policy” that encouraged dialogue between employees regardless of their respective levels at times holding executives to account when they ignored concerns of others.JAMES DAMOREJames Damore was a senior software engineer in Google’s search division. He joined Google in 2013 with an extensive academic background in biology and computational biology and a reputation for competitive participation in chess and strategy games. He worked his way up to the project leader level which merited him a salary in the US$300000 range.In June 2017 after what he considered unpleasant experiences with Google’s internal culture and diversity programs Damore began typing his thoughts during a long business flight to China. Titling his memo “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber” Damore wrote in response to invitations from diversity program organizers to provide feedback. He submitted his memo in early July eager to hear a response. When he did not receive a reply Damore posted his memo through internal lists and forums.Early on August 5 2017 online news outlets reported that Damore’s memo had gone “viral” among Google employees the day before. The same day the memo was picked up and posted by a public website; labelled an “anti-diversity manifesto” the memo immediately attracted widespread attention. Damore described his experience of diversity training as one in which he was shamed and restricted from voicing unwelcomed ideas. Google fired Damore on August 7 two days after the leak with no apparent link between the decision to fire him and Brown’s responsibilities as diversity officer.After he was fired Damore attracted an instant following gaining 35000 followers on his Twitter Inc. account and inspiring an organization of protests across the country—which were later cancelled due to alleged terrorist threats. Damore first accepted online interviews with right-wing media outlets to avoid hostility from media unsympathetic to his views.In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Damore complained about the lack of “open and honest discussion” and his experience that employees’ identities were wedded to the company “almost like a cult.” In online question-and-answer sessions Damore expressed his disappointment over being “shamed” by his supervisor before the memo was leaked and he emphasized that his intention was not to attack others but to improve Google’s culture. Damore did not apologize for his memo or for upsetting others and he still believed his views were correct.Manifesto ContentDamore prefaced his 10-page document with a statement affirming that he valued diversity and inclusion recognized the existence of sexism and disapproved of stereotyping individuals emphasizing the need to stay focused on “population level differences in distributions.” In places throughout the memo he also alluded to the possibility of bias and limitations in his perspective and the need for “open and honest” discussion to address gender and ideological issues in the company.Damore began his memo by suggesting that the left and right biases that may be hindering discussion at Google were the “result of deep moral preferences” (a reference to Jonathan Haidt’s well-regarded research on moral foundations). He then proposed several non-socially constructed causes of the gender gap in technology (tech) specifically software engineering focusing on differences in biological and personality traits. He covered a range of purported “non-bias [sic] causes” including prenatal exposure to testosterone differing interest in people versus things levels of the personality traits extraversion and neuroticism (referred to by Damore as “higher anxiety lower stress tolerance” and by psychologists in the positive sense as emotional stability) and differences in drive for status. Based on the differences he discussed Damore concluded that “principled” and “optimizing” approaches to diversity were preferable to “arbitrary social engineering” (hiring quotas). He proceeded to list existing Google practices that he considered “discriminatory” including programs exclusively for “a certain gender or race” special queues and treatment for such candidates scrutiny of insufficiently diverse groups and any practices or goals that could result in inappropriate incentives or illegal double standards. In the next section of his memo Damore reiterated the importance of recognizing ideological biases—possibly veiled left or Marxist-style biases—that he believed “increase race and gender tensions” because they affect how the social sciences are studied and maintain “myths like social constructionism and the gender wage gap.” He identified other consequences of these biases as overprotection of females dismissal of gender issues affecting men and “extremely sensitive PC-[politically correct] authoritarians” who engage in “violence and shaming.”Damore proposed “non-discriminatory ways” to address the gender gap including making software engineering more people-oriented allowing co-operative behaviour to thrive and reducing stress and increasing flexibility in tech and leadership work. With the overall goal of restoring psychological safety and stopping discriminatory practices Damore ended his memo with a range of suggestions to reduce the level of intolerance moralization alienation and hostility including the reduction of over-empathetic support for the suffering and offences of select groups. He believed that discriminating merely to increase representation of women in tech was misguided and costly causing the same poor outcome as failed attempts to address problems with “the homeless work-related and violent deaths prisons and school dropouts.”Immediate ResponseCorporate ResponsesResponses from numerous internal and external stakeholders poured in once Damore’s memo had been posted. Before the memo was leaked to the public Ari Balogh vice-president of engineering and Damore’s supervisor wrote an internal memo stating that “Questioning our assumptions and sharing different perspectives” was an important part of Google's culture but “one of the aspects of the post that troubled me deeply was the bias inherent in suggesting that most women or men feel or act a certain way. That is stereotyping and it is harmful.”The day Damore’s memo was leaked to the public Brown responded in an internal memo to all staff (see Exhibit 1) sayingPart of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct policies and anti-discrimination laws.The day after firing Damore Pichai wrote to employees (see Exhibit 2) declaring We strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.Co-Worker ResponsesCo-worker responses to the memo were openly critical calling for Damore to be fired. According to Damore these were calls for “censorship retaliation and atonement.” Various voices labelled the memo “screed” “pure toxicity” “garbage fire” “bigoted” “misogynist” and “violently offensive.” Facilitated by Google’s collaborative communication platforms attacks directed at Damore and open messages to Brown effectively put both on trial. Leaked posts revealed that many of these communications were from middle-level managers using expletives to describe Damore and the memo refusing to work with his department questioning his competence to sit on hiring committees blaming him for attrition of employees and expressing intentions to silence and banish anyone sympathetic to Damore. Some posts openly disparaged Brown for not issuing a more severe criticism of the memo.Numerous women publicly expressed their disappointment and disgust with Damore’s memo and some were motivated by the controversy to look for work elsewhere. One female employee expressed that the memo was not considerate of women’s views and feelings and that the public response was too focused on freedom of speech issues and a debate about reasons for termination. “To have us all lumped into one sort of category like that” she said “and to have such a baseless claim made about who we are and to have it positioned as fact—as scientific fact—I don’t know how we could feel anything but attacked by that.”Using words like “unlawful” and “hostile” Susan Wojcicki CEO of Google’s YouTube criticized the memo for perpetuating negative stereotypes and unfounded biases that would now be exposed to a new generation hindering efforts to deal with a gender gap that existed in tech but not in other science technology engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. Expressing her alarm over what she believed were unacceptable comparisons between people she posed the question “What if the memo said that biological differences amongst black Hispanic or LGBTQ (lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer or questioning) employees explained their underrepresentation in tech and leadership roles? Would some people still be discussing the merit of the memo’s arguments or would there be a universal call for swift action against its author?”Few media articles covered employees who supported Damore due in part to the employees’ unwillingness to speak out except by leaking messages written by other employees who engaged in defamation and threatened to blacklist those they labelled as “anti-diversity.” However one reporter who spoke to employees anonymously found a range of viewpoints including some that agreed that the culture maintained its control by “shaming dissenters into silence.” The employees noted that the practice of shaming Damore publicly indicated that critics preferred to dominate the public discourse rather than to engage him in direct discussion. Through the anonymous corporate chat application Blind a Google employee complained about the “terrifying” discovery that “if someone is not ideologically aligned with the majority then he’s labelled as a ‘poor cultural fit’ and would not be hired/promoted.” Others applauded Damore’s courage and found it hypocritical to talk about diversity and inclusion and then exclude divergent opinions.To shed light on Damore’s claim that “there were many women who were empowered and that agree with me” Blind conducted a survey of 4000 employees across Silicon Valley. The results showed that 44 per cent of Google respondents were in support of firing Damore a result that placed the response from Google employees in the middle of similar responses from within other tech firms (see Exhibit 3).Public ResponsesThe negative response to Damore’s memo was unreserved. Megan Smith formerly vice-president at Google and at the time a chief technology officer of the United States was glad that Damore’s views were now out in the open to condemn. She called the memo “insidious . . . death by a thousand paper cuts . . . they are misguided they’re destructive to their colleagues.” Former Google engineer Erica Baker criticized Google for allowing an environment in which “racists and sexists feel supported and safe in sharing these views in the company.” Angela Saini science journalist and author of Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong argued that psychological studies showed the “tiniest gaps if any between the sexes including areas such as mathematical ability and verbal fluency” and said that brains could not be distinguished by sex. Cynthia Lee computer science professor at Stanford University believed that Damore’s “quasi-professional” but dangerously “beguiling” scientific arguments were a “red herring” distracting attention away from the “glaring evidence in individual stories and in scientific studies that women in tech experience bias and a general lack of a welcoming environment as do underrepresented minorities.”Multiple outlets expressed their disapproval of Damore’s dismissal. Their concerns were based on the view that he was mainly expressing an opinion about how diversity could be improved based on findings that were unquestioned among those who studied basic gender differences. A few female commentators were less alarmed by the gender differences in tech. Megan McArdle a policy journalist and former technology consultant found that her male co-workers showed a passion for technology that was not often shared by their female counterparts. McArdle was matter of fact about being in the minority around men even though the environment was naturally and regrettably less hospitable when representation was lopsided.A poll conducted by the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University and The Harris Poll found that 55 per cent of respondents said Google was wrong to fire Damore. The respondents were divided within their political groups with 50 per cent of Democrats 56 per cent of independents and 61 per cent of Republicans indicating they were opposed to Damore’s dismissal.Scientific ResponsesShortly after Damore was fired scholars responded vigorously many with lengthy impassioned arguments. Gina Rippon the chair of cognitive brain imaging at Aston University stated that something biological could be overcome with practise and that the biological gender differences were “so tiny that there’s no way that they can explain the kind of gender gap that’s apparent at Google.” Janet Hyde a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin concluded that “there’s every reason to think these gender differences in interests are caused by socialisation factors.” Rosalind Barnett senior scientist at the Women’s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University and Caryl Rivers journalism professor at Boston University cited several scientists in their conclusion that there was little biological evidence for sex differences and that the “anxiety gap” existed not because of biology but because competent women were seen as bitchy judged more harshly and given less credit. Suzanne Sadedin an evolutionary biologist at Monash University called Damore’s memo “despicable trash” criticizing it for being intellectually dishonest about its attacks on female inferiority misrepresenting research on sex differences and failing to provide evidence of influences on performance in tech.Cordelia Fine a psychology professor at the University of Melbourne thought that the memo “made many dubious assumptions and ignored vast swaths of research that show pervasive discrimination against women.” Nonetheless she felt sorry for Damore because his points were “very familiar to me as part of my day-to-day research and are not seen as especially controversial.” Similarly some scholars focused on the validity of the research on gender differences without addressing the effect that science has on perpetuating stereotypes about careers suitable for women. Lee Jussim professor of social psychology at Rutgers University said that the memo got “nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right” and was “certainly not a rant. And it stands in sharp contrast to most of the comments [criticisms] which are little more than snarky modern slurs.” Geoffrey Miller professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of New Mexico stated that “almost all of the Google memo’s empirical claims are scientifically accurate. Moreover they are stated quite carefully and dispassionately.” Debra Soh a sexual neuroscientist called the memo “fair and factually accurate” arguing that there were “sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our interests and behaviour.” Agreeing with Damore Soh noted that “gendered interests are predicted by exposure to prenatal testosterone—higher levels are associated with a preference for mechanically interesting things and occupations in adulthood.”Responses from scholars cited by Damore in the memo were mixed. Richard Lippa psychology professor at California State University called Damore’s summary of psychological differences “reasonably accurate” and Michael Wiederman psychology professor at the University of South Carolina believed that Damore made “reasoned arguments” about why men could be more keen than women to climb the corporate ladder. Catherine Hakim sociologist at the think tank Civitas believed that it was “nonsense” to link career outcomes to psychological gender differences. Jüri Allik professor of experimental psychology at the University of Tartu said that Damore’s extrapolations of personality research to career outcomes were “risky” and that gender differences in his research were “very very small.” David Schmitt psychology professor at Bradley University and founding director of the International Sexuality Description Project affirmed Damore’s conclusions drawing from cross-cultural data on personality differences; however he was hesitant to link personality directly to occupational differences between sexes. Schmitt did emphasize that occupational differences were quite large and that nations that treated women more equally saw larger not smaller differences in personality traits and occupational preferences.Diversity in TechnologyDiversity at GoogleGoogle had grown to more than 75000 employees by 2017. Women made up 30.8 per cent of Google’s overall workforce in 2017; only 2.5 per cent of the company’s employees were black and only 3.6 per cent were Hispanic or Latinx. Though the percentage of women in Google’s workforce had changed little since 2014 (when it was 30.6 per cent) the percentage of women in leadership and tech roles improved between 2014 and 2017 going from 20.8 to 24.5 per cent in leadership and from 16.6 to 20.2 per cent in tech compared with 48.1 to 48.4 per cent in non-tech roles (e.g. HR marketing and accounting). Attrition among women was lower than for men but gains in female representation were being made mainly among white and Asian women. These figures compared unflatteringly to figures from the tech industry and the private sector as a whole; female representation was 36 per cent in tech and 48 per cent in the private workforce overall. Black employees represented 7.4 per cent of tech staff and 14.4 per cent of the overall workforce and Hispanic and Latinx employees represented 8.0 per cent and 13.9 per cent respectively.In view of the relatively flat trends in the overall workforce it was unclear where Google could make improvements whether by addressing internal biases or processes or by working further upstream at the sources of female candidates. Such trends did not seem to accord with the substantial sum of US$265 million it had spent on diversity programs over 2014 and 2015. The company eventually stopped divulging its spending figures.In the wake of Damore’s memo female employees became vocal about the nature of their experiences. Wojcicki one of Google’s first employees shared her experiences in Fortune which had named her the 16th most powerful woman in 2016: I’ve had my abilities and commitment to my job questioned. I’ve been left out of key industry events and social gatherings. I’ve had meetings with external leaders where they primarily addressed the more junior male colleagues. I’ve had my comments frequently interrupted and my ideas ignored until they were rephrased by men. No matter how often this all happened it still hurt.Another woman expressed hurt and frustration over years of getting caught up in internal discussion threads “where men were louder than women on gender-bias and discrimination issues.” She attributed the problem with “discrimination harassment and mental violence” to hiring for a certain male stereotype that was not compatible with a hospitable environment for women.As a federal contractor required to conform to equal opportunity requirements Google had been involved in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Labor that alleged that Google was underpaying women. The day Damore was fired a representative of the Department of Labor testified in court about the ongoing investigation into Google. The department had found “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” at Google and “compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” Within a month Google was served with a class-action lawsuit launched by three underpaid women who said that they were placed at lower job levels and denied promotions and moves that could have advanced their careers.Inclusion at GoogleThe firm’s motto “Don’t be evil” encapsulated the high ideals Google put forth to make the world a better place and to be unbiased and objective it how it handled search results. In the years before Brown’s arrival Google had already embarked on ambitious diversity programming. As early as 2014 Nancy Lee vice-president of people operations wanted to fulfill Google’s original “don’t be evil” mandate by initiating the full disclosure of its diversity figures numbers that “weren’t great” but put Google “on the hook. There’s no turning back.” A spokesperson for Google emphasized that the company was “very committed to an open internal culture” of which “transparency [was] a huge part.” The company was known to operate a wide range of platforms for open expression based on promotion of the idea of “psychological safety” in which employees were encouraged to share ideas without being judged or embarrassed.Google applied considerable measures to improve hiring and promotion processes focused on women and people of colour. These measures included implementing unconscious bias training checking performance review processes and encouraging greater self-nomination. To address the challenge of an extremely low representation of black Googlers the company created an engineering residency for black computer science majors and embedded engineers at historically black colleges. It also worked to foster an inclusive culture by making sure its corporate events town halls and resource groups (e.g. Women@Google and Google Women in Engineering) were welcoming and supportive. Google’s community-based programs included partnerships with figures from Hollywood that aimed to inspire girls to pursue computer science and programs introducing coding to high school students from diverse communities.In an interview he gave after he was fired Damore elaborated on his negative experiences with numerous diversity events including a weekly company-wide meeting (TGIF) mandatory unconscious bias training calls to hold individual managers accountable for their team’s diversity and a weekly e-mail allowing 20000 employees to submit examples of micro-aggressions some of which could implicitly identify the perpetrators. In the lead-up to the Damore memo some employees had taken measures into their own hands openly creating blacklists of those labelled “anti-diversity.” The threat of being reported to human resources did not deter these list-keepers; rather they used the reactionary comments to identify others to add to their lists. It was not apparent from reports how prevalent this behaviour was or how severely it affected the targeted co-workers.Analysts highlighted the irony that despite Google’s moral mission the extreme views of controversial far-right figures were bolstered by the followings they gained on Google-owned YouTube. The video platform was accused of creating “filter bubbles” that drew users deeper into extreme content capturing the attention of disenfranchised groups. YouTube actively limited hate violent extremist supremacist or religious content that did not meet YouTube’s increasingly tough standards. With national politics getting more divisive analysts voiced their concerns that the company having a reputation for liberal views could use its vast power over online searches to contain conservative thought.Sexism in TechIn recent years Silicon Valley and the tech sector had been known to have serious problems with sexual diversity discrimination and harassment—issues that became widely known due to publicized cases at other tech giants such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Twitter Inc.. Women experienced being propositioned for sex dismissed and disrespected and they had to fend off gropes and recover from interruptions by men in meetings. Explanations for this behaviour attributed it to the origins of Silicon Valley in the “male realm” of hardware brotherhoods of young men coming out of college the perception that “genius” was held only by men and the persistent sexist view that women achieved less and were fair game for objectification.High-ranking executives were not immune to the problem. Former Tinder executive Whitney Wolfe was called a “whore” and “slut” by the firm’s marketing chief and unjustly denied the title of co-founder. Donna Harris a venture capitalist who had started out as a systems engineer remarked that her path to success was “littered with rampant sexism mansplaining unconscious bias and some downright ugly discrimination.” A coalition of seven women spearheaded a survey of 210 female peers working in Silicon Valley 25 per cent of whom were responding as top-ranking officers. A significant proportion of these women experienced exclusion disrespect and mistreatment in their workplaces (see Exhibit 4).Legal IssuesIn both the United States and Canada universal rights to freedom of speech generally did not apply in the workplace. Employers had a right to limit the types of speech that employees engaged in at work. Such limitations extended outside the workplace if the employees’ conduct disrupted the legitimate business of the employer. In California employers could “fire workers at any time for any reason as long as it’s not an illegal reason.” Illegal grounds for firing were covered under the National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.Damore filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board the same day he was fired. The unfair labour practice identified in the complaint referred to section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act which stated that “It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.” The section 7 rights under the Act protected employees who engaged in “concerted activities” to improve their pay and working conditions or fix employment-related problems even if the employees were not in a union.Cases governed by the Civil Rights Act were administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Commission. Title VII made it illegal “to discriminate against someone on the basis of race color religion national origin or sex.” Title VII also prohibited employers from “punishing job applicants or employees for asserting their rights to be free from employment discrimination including harassment. . . . Other acts to oppose discrimination [were also] protected as long as the employee was acting on a reasonable belief that something in the workplace may violate EEO laws.”Google’s decision to fire Damore left observers wondering what precise issue resulted in a code-of-conduct violation (see Exhibit 5). Neither party commented on any private employer–employee discussions that may have influenced Google’s decision. Damore described the lead-up to his dismissal this way:There is a dominant ideology at Google and anyone who dissents against that is either shamed or ostracized. And when it became apparent that I wasn’t backing down to the shame they had to fire me. . . . And it [the memo] was actually pointing out several practices at Google that went against the code of conduct. So there are many practices that harass conservatives that have illegal bias against certain groups. And I was simply pointing them out. And much of this is whistleblower stuff where they really should not have fired me for pointing out illegal practices at Google.a question of leadershipRiding high on the experience of success and harmony at Intel Brown hoped that she could continue making an impact as diversity officer of one of the most influential companies in the world. She was now part of a corporate environment that seemed progressive on the surface but was permeated by strong political views and simmering discomfort over the diversity program. With the controversy over the Damore memo at the two-week mark the company had taken a hard line on Damore and moved on. Multiple people had written lengthy opinions about diversity and inclusion—staff the press academics—but Brown’s communication had so far consisted of one short letter. With more than half of Google’s employees against firing Damore what steps should Brown take next to restore trust and promote candour?Exhibit 1: Memo to Employees from Danielle BrownGoogle’s Vice-President of DiversityGooglersI’m Danielle Google's brand new VP of Diversity Integrity & Governance. I started just a couple of weeks ago and I had hoped to take another week or so to get the lay of the land before introducing myself to you all. But given the heated debate we’ve seen over the past few days I feel compelled to say a few words.Many of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our engineering organization expressing views on the natural abilities and characteristics of different genders as well as whether one can speak freely of these things at Google. And like many of you I found that it [the memo] advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I’m not going to link to it here as it’s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses promotes or encourages.Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate. We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul. As Ari Balogh said in his internal G+ post “Building an open inclusive environment is core to who we are and the right thing to do. ’Nuff said.”Google has taken a strong stand on this issue by releasing its demographic data and creating a company-wide OKR on diversity and inclusion. Strong stands elicit strong reactions. Changing a culture is hard and it’s often uncomfortable. But I firmly believe Google is doing the right thing and that’s why I took this job.Part of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct policies and anti-discrimination laws.I’ve been in the industry for a long time and I can tell you that I’ve never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to express themselves—TGIF Memegen internal G+ thousands of discussion groups. I know this conversation doesn’t end with my email today. I look forward to continuing to hear your thoughts as I settle in and meet with Googlers across the company.ThanksDanielle Note: OKR = objectives and key results.Source: Sarah Emerson and Louise Matsakis “Google on Anti-Diversity Manifesto: Employees Must ‘Feel Safe Sharing Their Opinions’” Motherboard August 5 2017 accessed January 31 2018 https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/vbv54d/google-on-anti-diversity-manifesto-employees-must-feel-safe-sharing-their-opinions. Exhibit 2: Memo to Employees from Sundar PichaiGoogle’s Chief Executive OfficerThis has been a very difficult time. I wanted to provide an update on the memo that was circulated over this past week.First let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct which expects “each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment intimidation bias and unlawful discrimination.”The memo has clearly impacted our co-workers some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender. Our co-workers shouldn’t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting they have to prove that they are not like the memo states being “agreeable” rather than “assertive” showing a “lower stress tolerance” or being “neurotic.”At the same time there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again many points raised in the memo—such as the portions criticizing Google’s trainings questioning the role of ideology in the workplace and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all—are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics—we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions.The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree—while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I’d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.I have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there’s a lot more to discuss as a group—including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.Source: Sundar Pichai “Note to Employees from CEO Sundar Pichai” The Keyword (blog) Google August 8 2017 accessed January 30 2018 www.blog.google/topics/diversity/note-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai.Exhibit 3: Survey Conducted by Blind Evaluating Agreement with Google’s Decision to fire James DamoreQuestion: “Was Google right in firing manifesto author Damore?”Source: Created by the case authors using data from Blind an anonymous work talk app provided in Julie Bort “Over Half of Google Employees Polled Say the Web Giant Shouldn't Have Fired the Engineer Behind the Controversial Memo” Business Insider August 9 2017 accessed February 9 2018 www.businessinsider.com/many-google-employees-dont-think-james-damore-should-have-been-fired-2017-8.Exhibit 4: Selected Results from “Elephant in the Valley” survey on discrimination and harassment in silicon valleySource: Trae Vassallo Ellen Levy Michele Madansky Hillary Mickell Bennett Porter Monica Leas and Julie Oberweis Elephant in the Valley accessed February 12 2018 www.elephantinthevalley.com.Exhibit 5: excerpts from Google’s Code of ConductPreface“Don’t be evil.” Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But “Don’t be evil” is much more than that. Yes it’s about providing our users unbiased access to information focusing on their needs and giving them the best products and services that we can. But it’s also about doing the right thing more generally—following the law acting honorably and treating co-workers with courtesy and respect.The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put “Don’t be evil” into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be and should be measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people build great products and attract loyal users. Trust and mutual respect among employees and users are the foundation of our success and they are something we need to earn every day.So please do read the Code and follow both its spirit and letter always bearing in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate and to encourage other Googlers to incorporate the principles of the Code into our work. And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment don’t be silent. We want—and need—to hear from you.II. Support Each Other2. Harassment Discrimination and BullyingGoogle prohibits discrimination harassment and bullying in any form—verbal physical or visual as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at Google or by a Google partner or vendor we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor Human Resources or both. Similarly supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. HR will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.Note: Excerpted from the Code of Conduct in force in July 2017.

My best childhood memories are when she used to be working and humming these beautiful Hindi songs that played on the transistor. I can’t wait to see her delight when she can listen to all her favourite songs at the press of a button.” Saregama’s share price had reached ₹840 but what excited Mehra was the breakthrough Carvaan had achieved with the Indian consumer. Launched in 2017 the Carvaan was a portable music player with 5000 pre-loaded songs from yesteryear. It came with built-in stereo speakers Bluetooth a USB drive and an FM radio. The device balanced the best of technology with the simplicity of just pressing a button. The product had been a turning point for the 117-year-old music giant. As Saregama converted its conventional copyrighted music into high-quality digital formats and made a rare stretch from the business-to-business (B2B) to business-to-consumer (B2C) markets the firm recorded a revenue jump from ₹2.1 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2016–2017 to its highest revenue so far ₹3. 5 billion in FY 2017–2018. The profit before tax also rose increasing from ₹160.65 million in FY 2016–2017 to ₹411.2 million by the end of FY 2017–2018. The first phase of the change had been positive and Carvaan had played an important role in this success. Mehra now envisioned Saregama becoming the new “₹20 billion IP [intellectual property] content company” in the next five years. To make that happen amid the fast technological and consumer evolution Mehra needed sharply defined short- and long-term strategies for Carvaan and Saregama. THE INDIAN MUSIC INDUSTRY: EVOLVING CONTENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICESIndian consumers’ hunger for entertainment was as large and diverse as the country’s population. PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast that the industry’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in India would reach 10.8 per cent by 2021 more than double the 4.2 per cent growth rate expected globally and that the value of the Indian media and entertainment market would grow from US$27.3 billion in 2016 to reach $45.1 billion by 2021. The largest contributor to the Indian entertainment industry was television at 46 per cent (see Exhibit 1); digital content made up 6 per cent of the market and music 1 per cent. The sectors expected to grow were digital content radio music and films (see Exhibit 1). The media and entertainment industry in India was undergoing dramatic changes (see Exhibit 2).Historically music cassettes had replaced vinyl records in the latter half of the 20th century due largely to cassettes’ advantage of portability. However music cassettes were easy to duplicate and were thus prone to the threat of piracy. S.F. Karim a senior consultant employed with Saregama since 1978 explained:With piracy the legitimate music companies started getting hit. My products were copied and sold at cheaper rates in the market because the market vendors didn’t have to pay for royalty taxes or advertising. Counterfeiting came in as the bigger second problem. The look-alike products were doing rounds in the market and consumers were unable to differentiate. When I sold 2 million 18 million were sold by the market vendors. Moreover this escalated the problem of defective returns. Even if I didn’t sell much I started receiving huge stocks of defective as well as unsellable returns most of which were look-alike counterfeit product.Music companies were equally concerned with noticeable changes in the consumption preferences of music consumers (see Exhibit 3).At the same time the music industry became more cluttered as a number of new firms established themselves in the 1980s (see Exhibit 4). Karim shared his observations:Till then [the 1980s] we had a near monopoly but during that time artists started having other options and moved to companies that could give them a better deal. Similarly firms took a conscious decision to choose the artists. Today things have changed: artists are free to record with different music companies because there is no binding agreement.During this period two kinds of music co-existed—film and non-film music. Film music included a large number of popular movie songs which were produced specifically for Hindi and vernacular movies and constituted an integral part of the movies and their consequent popularity. Non-film music included albums released by independent artists and singers. Thus agreements were of two types. Karim explained:To produce music three things are required: lyricist music director and singer. In non-film the music company has control over all three elements. The company takes care of all promotions and the artist according to the agreed terms earns a royalty that is a certain percentage of the total music sales. However in the case of film music the royalty sharing agreement is between the film producer and the music company. Shortly after 2000 competitive players entered the market and a new business arrangement evolved that guaranteed a minimum royalty paid upfront to the producer irrespective of sales. Ghanashyam Aayeer Saregama’s chief financial officer (CFO) explained this model:Earlier acquisition was on a royalty sharing basis so you sank or swam together but T-Series started offering a minimum guarantee which revolutionized the industry. Producers found the guarantee most convenient because they started getting value up front instead of waiting for a longer payback period. Thus music acquisitions became one of the most important sources of funding films. So today music companies now need huge capital both for IP acquisition as well as for managing music promotions.At about the same time in 2004–2005 the digital era became a reality. Aayeer summarized the change:In this period the telecom companies started introducing digital products like caller ring-back tone IVR [interactive voice recorder] and others. The telecom companies thus became the single biggest revenue earner for all music companies. But slowly fatigue set in and revenues earned by the telecom companies came down to one-third of what they were in the 2010s.However new sources of revenue opened with the entry of over-the-top (OTT) service providers like Gaana and Saavn which operated in India much as their counterparts Netflix and Amazon Prime operated in Western markets. These OTT services provided content directly to viewers over the Internet bypassing companies such as cable or broadcast networks which had traditionally controlled and distributed the content. OTT services distributed streaming media that could be conveniently accessed anytime anywhere. Aayeer explained:OTT is an exciting revenue earner for all Indian music players—including Saregama. A variation of the same OTT service is YouTube. It is by far  the largest music service in the world. It brought down the valuation of music drastically. For one stream YouTube is currently earning anything between one paisa to three paise so it is as low as that. But volumes are huge so earnings are big. The OTT service values one stream at 10–12 paise.In this scenario the other major revenue source for the music company was publishing. Aayeer explained: This means when a song recording gets played in your own house it is for your personal use but if you play it in public say in a restaurant or bar then the music is used for public performance which we refer to as “publishing.” This comes with a cost. In addition the song also has composition and lyrics. Some people can pick up lyrics and give it a tune or some people can add different lyrics to the existing tune. But that tune or those lyrics are again owned by the music company. So for that a licence has to be taken. In this sphere we are one of the biggest because copyright of most of the earlier classics and popular tracks lies with us.SAREGAMA india Limited: India’s OLDEST MUSIC COMPANYThe Company’s LineageSaregama formerly the Gramophone Company of India (Gramophone Company) and popularly known as His Master’s Voice (HMV) was incorporated as a limited company in 1946. As the first overseas Indian branch of Electrical and Musical Industries Limited (EMI) of London HMV’s strong initial inroads into production of music cinema and media content transformed the company into an invincible brand. However increased and aggressive competition around the 1980s led the company into large financial losses. In 1985 legendary business doyen Rama Prasad (R.P.) Goenka of the RPG Group took over the financially ailing Gramophone Company. In August 2000 recognizing that digital media was going to be the future the firm ventured into the digital space and launched HamaraCD.com. The company also strategically acquired marketing rights and licensing agreements from established and successful labels in south India: Sangeetha Music (The Master Recording Company) Sargam Music Private Limited Pyramid Audio (India) Private Limited and Sea Records. In addition with a vision to establish itself as a holistic music and entertainment company Saregama acquired 42.85 per cent of Music World an erstwhile RPG Group–controlled music retail chain. In November 2000 EMI sold off its majority stake to the RPG Group due to the government’s restrictions on transfers of earnings by foreign companies and the company was renamed Saregama India Limited. EMI retained a token stake of less than 10 per cent in the company which was later sold in the open market in 2005. The subsequent years were an era of IP acquisition of new and popular music. Saregama entered the acquisitions market by raising funds from the equity market. Between 2000 and 2005 the company expanded into developing television content and also consolidated and merged a number of its international subsidiaries under the auspices of Saregama India Limited. Aayeer traced these years:We had extensive physical distribution so we approached English studios like Warner Universal Paramount and BBC to use our distribution channels. We offered acquisition backed by minimum guarantee to foreign studios. We also went into film production. However these new expansions did not really take off. Thus in 2013 we liquidated our entire distribution network and we licensed the physical distribution rights to Sony. In 2005 Saregama—the custodian of 300000 songs 23000 artists and 50000 contracts with 13 regional offices and four international offices in London New York Kuala Lumpur and Dubai—was fully acquired by RPG Group. However the volatility in the market and the aggressive competition compounded by changing consumer preferences led the firm into a period of financial stress.RejuvenationIn 2011 the much diversified RPG Group was redistributed among the two sons of R.P. Goenka. The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group a consortium of companies managed by the younger son Sanjiv Goenka was formed. Saregama was now part of this group. Goenka knew that success in the new Indian market needed new and more efficient approaches. Hence he turned to consulting firms McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group for advice on how to lead this transformation. Commenting on his vision and plans for Saregama Goenka saidSaregama is being transformed into a Mumbai-headquartered production house generating content for online consumption. With data getting cheaper on every network we are of the view that the demand for content is only going to grow. So from being one of the richest repositories of Indian music of different genres we are turning ourselves into a production house which will also leverage our strengths from the past.11The vision was exciting but it needed a professional leader who could convert the thought into reality. Thus Goenka handpicked Mehra to lead the next phase of the Saregama saga. Mehra took over the reins in October 2014 as the 17th managing director of Saregama. The company had experienced considerable changes in leadership over its century-old lifespan and was an integral part of the ₹210 billion turnover to RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. Mehra came with impressive academic credentials and a track record in business. He recognized that “on the face of it things may not have been good; but the foundation and the structure was there. Saregama owned the biggest treasure in the country. Practically every piece of music recorded in India from the early 1900s was owned by us.” Mehra took on the challenge and decided that music content would be the key strength on which the new Saregama story would be composed. With a systematic approach based on data-driven consumer insights Mehra got the company back on a growth trajectory. On a lighter note Mehra shared his reason for joining the struggling firm: I had immense faith in the strong foundation and the treasure of yesteryears’ music at Saregama. Secondly it helps that to date the only music I listen to is a Kishore or a Rafi or an Asha. I don’t enjoy new music and this helped me connect more naturally. Third is the genuine free hand given by the promoter ready to take a longer-term view. I feel that in order to do something different there will be success as well as failures and my faith in this goldmine of music is unshakable.To date Saregama had experimented with a certain amount of B2C ventures—HamaraCD.com Music World and others—but had remained largely as a B2B player (see Exhibit 5). This was restrictive according to Aayeer: “The company always had a professional as an MD [managing director]. But the past MDs did not really look beyond the B2B market where you are bound by what your business partner or client wants to do.”Instead of remaining with the conventional and traditional approach of running a music business Mehra decided that a different track was needed:What is convention? If you see the United States right now LPs are making such a big comeback. Premium ones like Bob Marley are selling like hot cakes. You need to keep on reinventing but remember that technology has to be slaved to what consumers want. Consumers may not be able to state in exact words what they want. . . . My firm belief is marketing cannot be done sitting in glass chambers. You need to be sitting in your customer’s home. What we often do is we think that our customers are just like our friends. Our friends drive great cars and live fancy; they think 500 rupees for a drink is nothing. But that’s not India. India is something very different right now.With Mehra’s vision Saregama surged ahead on a two-phased journey. Phase 1: Understanding the Indian Consumer’s Needs In the first quarter of 2015 Saregama conducted a nationwide qualitative study across 23 Indian cities to determine the attitude of Indian consumers toward music and how they used it. Mehra shared:When I joined Saregama the one lesson that everyone in and outside the company starting from my direct reportees to other labels in the industry told me “Customers will not pay you anything. B2B deals will happen. You may license your music to streaming applications TV channels and other movies to use your content but in the end customers will never pay.” And for me this was a huge challenge and the reason behind this study.The consumer insights that the company gained were interesting. Mehra summarized them succinctly: It came out clearly that the older people the crowd aged 35 years and older right now are primary customers of a Kishore Rafi Asha Lata Hemant kind of music. That customer was saying that we had made it very difficult for them to consume our music. Our question was Why? The music is there on so many apps. They said they don’t use the apps; they find them too complicated. People who are 35+ and live in Bombay Delhi and Calcutta—they are more tech-savvy. But a 35+ living in Ludhiana Jabalpur Kochi or Munnar—the belts that are B-level cities—are large consumers of entertainment. They are the people who watch StarPlus television shows today. They are my customers who wait for their sons or daughters to come home do an illegal transfer of 10 songs onto their phones and continue to listen to that music only. Mehra shared three key insights that led him to conceptualize Saregama’s possible offerings. The first had to do with how consumers wanted to access music:I met this lady in Kanpur who remarked “Son our time was good: Vivid Bharti [on AM Radio] was played at my place the whole day. I used to cook the kids used to study and my husband did his work.” . . . For me it was as if someone was talking about my life because that’s how I was exposed to music. My mom was a huge fan of the music. Vivid Bharti was switched on all day literally. And I said maybe there is a case out there. Can I package my music in a fashion so that people can listen to it at the press of a button? People want to be in control of tech objects. There was another man who told me “I want control in my hands; I don’t want to be dependent on my son or daughter and beyond that I just want to enjoy.” There’s a dichotomy in that: I want to have control but I don’t want to have full control. This device [the Carvaan] is not expecting you to do something every minute with it. Turn on Kishore Kumar and for the next 36 hours Kishore Kumar will keep on playing back to back randomly without any advertisement or intervention.The second powerful insight had to do with the purpose of music: This was about nostalgia like going back to those days when life was simpler. Life today is too high-strung. At times one just wants to switch off with no complications. Even a washing machine today has 12 buttons; you have to learn them all which mode I operate in. . . . I go and ask for a normal coffee at a shop—they are going to throw in options half of which I don’t even understand. There are so many choices at any given point of time. But I don’t want to do anything—just lean back and relax. Music is about relaxation.The third insight was how to access the target consumer:Because of nuclear families more and more youngsters are staying away from their homes. Hence every anniversary Diwali [festival] or parent birthday you want to give them something. You will not carry sweets for your parents so you will pick a saree [dress] phone or tie. These are very standard gifts that you can give your parents. But you have given it once now what do you do? Retired Indian parents especially those who retired from the public sector overnight become really stingy and stopped spending money on themselves because they were not sure about pension or retirement income. I might not be able to sell to them a 65+ someone because this kind of purchase might be perceived as an indulgence. However it would be a rational thing for a son or daughter to buy as a gift for a parent.Thus the mandate was clear: there was a large population of those who grew up in the 1980s and earlier and now craved music that appealed to them. But they wanted this to be an easy listening experience in the background with minimum intervention or effort needed from the consumer. Phase 2: Crafting the Value Proposition The consumer insights were key to a revolutionary product that was targeted at the unmet need of a hitherto untapped music market. The targeted users were older consumers 40 years of age or older who were fond of music but the targeted buyer was their children. In May 2017 Saregama had its largest product launch of Carvaan a portable digital music player loaded with 5000 evergreen Hindi songs. The product came in six retro colours and looked like a transistor radio from the 1970s (see Exhibit 6). Mehra outlined the defining components of Carvaan: Firstly convenience. You just press a button and music starts; you don’t have to do anything else. No data connectivity no Internet speed no pirated content. The volume is at a particular level; you don’t need to increase or decrease the volume with every song. Second is nostalgia. There’s a reason why this is being packaged this way. The people who have grown up listening to transistors will remember Murphy’s old transistor. Hence this format. Everywhere nostalgia sells. And we are selling nostalgia and convenience. But it is packaged completely differently so that the consumer is seeing the value.The Bluetooth and the USB [port] are critical. This means that whenever your grandson or granddaughter is coming home the Carvaan becomes your Bluetooth speaker. They can listen to their own English music on this only. What is it doing? It is telling a 65-year-old that what I am buying can also be used by my grandchildren. It just makes our product complete. People often wonder why we have given the Carvaan [the capacity to be] a Bluetooth speaker. There was a lot of thinking that had gone behind everything that is in the product a sort of eureka insight.Carvaan was manufactured in China and was priced at approximately ₹6000 per unit with an almost 20 per cent profit margin. Aayeer confessed “Per-unit profitability is not very enticing for a CFO but this per-unit profit multiplied by a large volume gives us a huge profit. It brings you back into the game.” Launched as a B2C product the Carvaan sold 95000 units just in the first quarter.The content fed into the product was backed by a large repository of Saregama business intelligence data generated every month from its content played on YouTube streaming applications telecom TV channels and radio stations. The playlist was developed using a copyrighted randomizing logic. According to MehraEverything that has gone out there is copyrighted and we will make it very difficult for anyone to do this but you may come out with a different structure altogether. But what will they put inside this? Which music? They can’t put Rafi songs; that’s owned by us. They will have to put a newer singer. Who listens to newer singers? Kids. Will kids go for a physical structure? No they will go for digital. We are very clear in our head who our audience is. Next the company launched a Carvaan Mini in October 2017. This was launched in a lower price category and was positioned more as a Bluetooth speaker that was also loaded with 251 of Saregama’s biggest hits. This was priced around ₹2000. “Actually this was a dealer push kind of a product more for the younger consumer who wants a Bluetooth speaker and gets an added advantage of a select few retro songs” said Mehra. Beginning in early 2018 the firm launched regional variants of Carvaan in Tamil Bengali and Marathi and it had plans for more regional variants.The product was positioned as a nostalgia gift product and made use of selective digital media such as YouTube to broadcast emotion-driven commercials. The launch announcements used traditional print media. The product was sold through Saregama’s own 7000-odd physical distribution outlets and on the Amazon portal. Aayeer described the distribution model: We have set up our own fresh distribution network rather than relying on dealers as was the practice in the past. Then it was all on a “sale or return” model basis which actually killed the music business. The dealers did not have any commitments. Whatever was sold they made 30–35 per cent; the rest they returned to the music company. And then came the time when returns were higher than the sales. Now the basic distribution network has been designed in such a manner that our customers are mainly the electronic stores where cash and carry is the criteria for the sale. So currently the sale is strictly on a cash-and-carry arrangement without any return.The company also developed an organizational structure with clearly defined roles to manage the product verticals (see Exhibit 7). WHAT NEXT?The company sold 95000 units of Carvaan in the first quarter of FY 2017–2018 and expected to sell 300000 units by the close of the fiscal year. According to Aayeer “Carvaan has been the single largest turning point for the financial health of the company” (see Exhibit 8). Aayeer continued “This is a huge advantage as it reduces the reliance only on B2B. Secondly it provides a strong financial shoulder to explore more sustainable long-term strategies.” The journey so far had been extremely satisfying but the road ahead was not without challenges. Karim outlined those: For us Indians music will never come to end. Only the form changed. Earlier there was record then came cassette CD then it went digital; now again with Carvaan we have come back into physical format in a different way. Music survived. But what changed is the consumer and their demands. Their demands increased tenfold and keep changing. So one has to be ready with different ways of reaching the consumer.The company made a clear foray into the B2C market by tapping the needs of the older consumer through Carvaan. At the same time Saregama began producing full-length feature films through Yoodlee Films which created a product that was targeted at the younger tech-savvy consumer. Mehra expressed the need for caution:Right now it is a leap of faith. We challenged the common belief of “no one wants to pay for music” with Carvaan and now we want to challenge the perception that the “movie business is a gamble.” We started Yoodlee Films with a structure that would ensure that every movie at least recovers its cost. The movies are made with smart budgets and selective target-oriented distribution. Now we need to make it into a sustainable business model that does not depend on individuals and would come with a certain profit every time.Aayeer spoke to the financial considerations:Growth can be done in multiple ways. It can be through a platform or through content. We realized that growth with a platform is highly capital intensive. On the content side Carvaan has helped us generate capital with which we can look at IP acquisition now. We have already acquired six or seven new film music as this business needs to be with your own money and not on borrowed capital. Lastly despite being a listed company we were somewhat ignored by the investors as they were never impressed with a B2B kind of business; they think of that as an annuity business. Now once they see a product or a line that can really grow the investors see a promise. With Carvaan we have moved into the United States; we are also releasing in Canada Europe and the Middle East. And the investors are showing confidence. In a year’s span the number of scripts which was about 180 touched around 900. While all of this is good news we cannot remain as a one-product bundle. Of course Carvaan has huge potential and will need to be scaled up and innovated but we need more to keep the business moving and growing. Mehra knew that with success came responsibilities. The previous four years had been extremely productive and Saregama was getting back on the track that Goenka would have envisioned for his company. Yet neither Karim who forecasted ever-changing consumer demands and disruptive technological innovations nor Aayeer who wanted concrete and measurable indices of a robust financial health were wrong when they spoke about a multi-pronged strategy. That being the case Mehra wondered how to balance the B2B and B2C growth engines for Saregama. He saw two alternatives:Option A: Saregama could continue to follow the traditional B2B model where the music company directly produced or procured rights to film as well as non-film music and distributed them through the company’s well-established distributor network. This included distribution through various Internet-based media channels and apps. Could this pure content and IP acquisition focus independent of the platform business bring Saregama back to a formidable growth track or was it too conservative?Option B: Saregama could stretch into its newly-found space in the B2C markets with more innovative variants of the Carvaan product. This was an interesting opportunity if the firm could produce more portable and digitally innovative product variants. Mehra also wondered whether he needed to draw phased business plans—move into one segment and then the other—or explore both the B2B and B2C opportunities simultaneously. He saw a vast range of possibilities and combinations of actionable options. The question was How should Saregama strike the right notes?Exhibit 1: Media and Entertainment Industry in India(a) Percentage Share of Media and Entertainment Sub-Sectors (2016)(b) Growth Current and Projected of the Media and Entertainment Industry Source: Created by the case authors based on “The State of the Media and Entertainment Sector in India” Live Mint October 23 2017 accessed May 6 2018 www.livemint.com/Consumer/Gd1QhKIlEb6kotghQ0ameK/The-state-of-the-media-and-entertainment-sector-in-India.html.Exhibit 2: THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN INDIAThe most interesting and unifying form of entertainment irrespective of consumer demographics or medium was music. However the media and entertainment industry in India was predicted to experience a tectonic shift. Between 1.0 and 1.5 million customers had already moved entirely to digital media consumption and an estimated 4 million Indians were expected to be digital-only consumers by 2020. Over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix Hotstar and Amazon Prime were another fast emerging favoured entertainment channel. This was predicted to be the fastest growing platform with an expected revenue from OTT subscriptions reaching ₹5 billion by 2023.The recorded music business in India was expected to double by 2019 to ₹18.9 billion (US$300 million). While legitimate music consumption still accounted for only 1–2 per cent of the total consumption trends demonstrated that Indian consumers were evolving and responding to entertainment that had a new digital address (see Exhibit 3). Mandar Thakur chief operating officer of Times Music India observed:The “typical Indian mobile consumer” still consumes mobile telco-based products like ringback tones and hence those products will have a long tail whilst the “evolved modern Indian consumer” consumes streaming/subscription services is smartphone-heavy usage savvy and will grow the top end of the market.In either case—the preference by the emerging consumer is not of “ownership” but of “rental.”Frank D’Souza partner in the entertainment and media vertical of PricewaterhouseCoopers India explained:The players in the industry needed to move over from being content and distribution focus to see how a unique user experience can be created for the customers. Strategies that will shape tomorrow’s leaders were . . . extending franchise into an experience building direct to consumer destination aligning operations to fan values.Source: “The State of the Media and Entertainment Sector in India” Live Mint October 23 2017 accessed May 6 2018 www.livemint.com/Consumer/Gd1QhKIlEb6kotghQ0ameK/The-state-of-the-media-and-entertainment-sector-in-India.html; Tim Ingham “India’s Music Business Will Almost Double in 2019 – KPMG” Music Business Worldwide April 23 2015 accessed May 6 2018 www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/indias-music-business-will-double-by-2019-kpmg; Frank D’Souza “Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2017–2021” PWC India accessed May 6 2018 www.pwc.in/industries/entertainment-and-media.html; FICCI Media & Entertainment Committee and Ernst & Young Re-Imagining India’s M&E Sector March 2018 14 accessed May 6 2018 www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-re-imagining-indias-me-sector-march-2018/%24File/ey-re-imagining-indias-me-sector-march-2018.pdf; Gaurav Laghate “Indian OTT Market Has a Potential to Reach 5bn by 2023” Economic Times November 20 2018 accessed August 23 2019 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/indian-ott-market-has-a-potential-to-reach-5bn-by-2023-bcg/articleshow/66709416.cms?from=mdr.Exhibit 3: Evolution of the INDIAN cONSuMER’s Music PreferencesThe change in consumers’ music consumption and preferences from the mid-1900s to the present were phenomenal. Music cassettes and CDs had dominated the market in the 1970s. When the digital era arrived two decades later consumers were busy finding and adapting to cheaper and more convenient alternative sources of music. A survey of Indian consumers found that approximately 40 million Indians—two-thirds from urban India and the rest from rural India—were online every day. The most popular activity on the Internet was downloading music (19.38 per cent); if consumers were not downloading and storing songs they were listening to songs online (almost 14 per cent). A large segment of consumers moved from listening to copied content on their portable devices to listening to freely downloadable content. Mehra elaborated: “Digitalization brought in rampant piracy with consumers downloading free content. So revenue started decreasing and music companies found it tough to reinvest and hence quality of content deteriorated.” With no physical barriers illegal music providers proliferated online by registering and re-registering new website names that were impossible to control. However the growth of smartphone use falling data rates and a shift from browser- to application-based consumption helped to control illegitimate music distribution to some extent and promoted legal distribution among end-users across the globe. According to Mehra “In the app world it is easier to control piracy because the firm can go to Google or Apple with legitimate proof that the app has got our content. This helps because then they remove the app completely.” Source: Created by case authors based on discussions with Vikram Mehra (managing director Saregama) Ghanashyam B.

The firm had diverse product offerings in the field of entertainment and a considerable national and international presence. It operated 37 domestic and 39 international television channels and owned a music company (Zee Music Company) and a multi-satellite operator (Siti Cable). The company’s other interests included print Internet platforms mobile applications and film production. It had large-scale operations in both content publishing and digital platforms. In 2010 in partnership with Penske Media Company and United Internet Zee Entertainment Enterprises launched a digital platform India Webportal Pvt. Ltd. In February 2018 Zee Entertainment Enterprises launched an over-the-top (OTT) platform called Zee5. The firm carried out large-scale brand initiatives.Super Cassettes Industries Private Limited doing business as T-Series (local major): Founded in the 1980s and headquartered in Delhi T-Series began as a company selling pirated Hindi film music. It was privately owned by the Kumar family. In the 1990s T-Series entered music distribution and film production. In 2017 it started its YouTube channel by entering into a licensing arrangement with Amazon India. This was hugely successful with over 35 million subscribers and more than 30 billion views. Sony Music Group (international): Sony Music Entertainment India (Sony Music) was now a subsidiary of the Sony Corporation of America headquartered in New York. Sony Music began operating in India in 1997 and was the first record company in India to be 100 per cent foreign owned. The firm was involved with publishing and distributing film and non-film musical content. It also served as the distribution arm for Hindi and regional content for other big music firms such as Zee Entertainment Enterprises Saregama and Warner Music Group Inc.There were also smaller category leaders such as Eros International Media Pvt. Ltd. which was involved in motion picture production and distribution and Sun TV Network Ltd. a large TV production and network player in India’s southern region. There were also subsidiaries of popular media houses such as Times Music India (Times Music) and Times Internet of Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd. Times Music began with music distribution and then launched its own music label (Junglee Music) in 2007.Exhibit 4: (Continued)The Digital Players: Both international OTT players (Amazon Prime and Netflix) and domestic OTT players (Hotstar Sony LIV) were emerging in India’s music and entertainment sector. Smaller and regional players made the market extremely cluttered with low entry and exit barriers. Digital players also included smartphone-friendly streaming services provided by seven local telecom Internet companies—including Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. (JioSaavn Music and Radio) Bharti Airtel Ltd. (Wynk Music) and Times Internet (Gaana)—and international providers such as Apple Music Google Music and Amazon Prime Music. Users could use voice-commanded devices—notably Google Home and Amazon Echo—in addition to smartphones and computers to play their favourite music.Piracy and Counterfeit: There was also a parallel grey market that allowed Indian consumers to download free pirated content; purchase pirated and counterfeit CDs and DVDs at deeply discounted prices; and ”borrow” pirated and counterfeit CDs and DVDs through home-delivery lending libraries.

Songs were sold as single units. Later the live streaming was restricted to a 90 second preview and prices were set at ₹4 per song for an MP3 version and ₹10 per song for HD versions. (HD meant the best quality in hi-fidelity 320 kilobits per second [Kbps] which commanded a premium). Each purchase allowed 10 downloads per song which the user could access on multiple devices. Special packages were introduced such as 5000 songs for ₹1500 and premium albums for ₹449 offered from time to time as promotional offers. The company also launched its own Saregama Classical app (for Indian classical music) and Saregama Shakti app (for devotional songs) with offline listening support for Android (starting from ₹99 per month) and iOS (starting from ₹120 per month) launched late in 2015 and 2016 respectively.The online music store and the apps worked as parallel business-to-consumer (B2C) distribution channels in India and across the globe for Saregama’s digital content. This further supplemented Saregama’s existing business-to-business (B2B) stream operationalized through a plethora of online distribution partners such as Google Play Music Amazon Prime Apple Music and Deezer. Saregama also distributed its music through free live streaming applications like JioSaavn Gaana and Hungama which played free music with advertisements for listeners. Saregama’s content was also distributed through subscription-based alternatives offered by the telecom service providers such as Wynk (Bharti Airtel Ltd.) Idea Music (Idea Cellular Ltd.) and JioSaavn which had optional subscription-based ad-free offers. With global players like Spotify Technology SA planning to launch in India Mehra felt that “Now the end-customers could go back and listen to music legally. On these official applications the quality of audio was far better and every time an end-user was going there and listening to our songs these official applications ended up paying us.” Saregama had worked out licensing agreements with the distribution partners where a certain predetermined amount was paid to the company when a customer listened to a song for more than a minimum duration in these applications. The payments came on a monthly usage basis.Exhibit 5: (Continued)Music Cards: Early in 2016 Saregama ventured into a more tangible space diversifying with pure product offers. The first was Saregama’s “music cards”—music on convenient and portable USB flash drives in a form similar to that of a credit card. The initial four variants of the cards (Shakti; legends; romance/Bollywood; and Jagjit Singh for ghazals popular songs based on Arabic poetry) came with 150 pre-loaded songs. In 2017 Saregama announced the introduction of customized music cards priced at ₹990 tailor-made with personalized photos and 200 songs selected by the buyers and ordered through Saregama’s online store. In 2018 the company marketed 27 variants of music cards priced at ₹690 per unit through its own online music store and third-party e-commerce websites like Amazon Flipkart Snapdeal Indiamart and others.TV Production: Over the years Saregama’s television production arm had steadily churned out television content for regional satellite television channels. The longest lasting association was with Sun TV Network the oldest premium satellite television channel in the southern state of Tamil which launched in 1993. Saregama’s popular ongoing offers on Sun TV included Chandralekha (introduced in October 2014) Roja (introduced in April 2018) and Valli (introduced in December 2012). Saregama’s TV content aired by Sun TV from as early as the 2000s included daily soap operas like Athipookal running from 2007 to 2012 and airing 1272 episodes and My Dear Bootham running from 2004 to 2007 and completing 914 episodes. Later Saregama also produced non-fiction programs for Sony Entertainment Television.Yoodlee Films: Saregama ventured into movie production in 2017 as Yoodlee Films targeting young cinema-loving global Indians aged 18–35. The name Yoodlee was a tribute to singing and acting superstar Kishore Kumar who was famous for yodelling. The name suggested the youthful energetic realistic and relatable positioning of the offer. The movies were planned as smart budget movies for 10–12 city releases for the urban populace. The term smart budget meant that costs were kept low within the range of ₹35–40 million. Saregama was the only production house to share 30 per cent of the profits with the key artists. Production started with a basket of 10 full-length feature films with Brij Mohan Amar Rahe released first on September 1 2017. The films included bilingual projects and real-life stories some of which had national award winning directors and even superstars like Amitabh Bachhan. Yoodlee Films was not focused on competing in the mainstream commercial cinema space and hence was open to TV or digital releases or even releases on OTT platforms. The idea of accessing this untapped market was the fruit of the company’s 2015 market study on music which later led Mehra to aspire to a target of 100 movies produced by Yoodlee in five years (by 2020).Source: Press Trust of India (PTI) “Saregama Launches a New Online Music Store for Streaming and Downloading Songs” Economic Times April 13 2015 accessed May 6 2018 https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/saregama-music-store/46902868; PTI New Delhi “Saregama Launches Devotional Music App” Hindu Business Line January 20 2018 accessed May 6 2018 www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/saregama-launches-devotional-music-app/article8405990.ece; Vikas SN “Spotify Working on India Launch: CEO Daniel Ek” ET Tech March 16 2018 accessed May 6 2018 https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/spotify-working-on-india-launch-ceo-daniel-ek/63324267; “Saregama Launches Music Cards Preloaded with Songs in USB Drive” Media News 4U April 28 2016 accessed May 6 2018 www.medianews4u.com/saregama-launches-music-cards-preloaded-songs-usb-drive; “Saregama Chandralekha on Sun TV Completes 1000 Episodes” Media News 4U February 2 2018 accessed May 6 2018 https://tvnews4u.com/saregamaschandraleka-sun-tv-completes-1000-episodes; PTI “Saregama Gets into Film Production with Yoodlee Films” Times of India July 19 2017 accessed May 6 2018 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/saregama-gets-into-film-production-with-yoodlee-films/articleshow/59663479.cms; PTI “Yoodlee Films Announces the Line-Up of Upcoming 10 Releases” India Today August 2 2017 accessed May 6 2018 www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/yoodlee-films-announces-the-line-up-of-upcoming-10-releases-1008668-2017-08-02.

He had a continuous fatigue-laden cycle: study very late get a few hours of sleep go to classes and repeat. Needless to say Kalbfleisch developed something akin to a coffee obsession as a university studentâdue in part not only to his area of study but also to his focus on achieving academic excellence.Kalbfleisch often faced long lines waiting for coffee at school but he felt the habit was necessary if he was going to keep doing late-night study sessions. He wondered if there was a better way to get the quality coffee he craved without having to endure the typical wait-times at a premium coffee shop. Making premium coffee at home did not work for him as he liked to drink his coffee while he worked which was rarely at his residence and travel mugs negatively affected the flavour of his cherished brew.âThereâs no doubt Iâm a coffee snobâ said Kalbfleisch. âItâs a passion of mine and many others but I simply canât find the combination of portability and premium quality coffee available anywhere in the crowded coffee products marketplace.â As Kalbfleisch began to design the travel coffee press that would meet his needs he realized he had a worthwhile business idea but needed funding to make the business a reality. In 2015 he wondered what form of funding was available to him. Would crowdfunding be a realistic way of raising the money he needed for this venture?Home Is Where The (Good) Coffee IsnâtSeveral methods were available for making coffee at home. The first traditional drip coffee was invented by Melitta Bentz in 1908. The process of making drip coffee involved drawing hot water from a reservoir and letting it seep through a waiting pocket of ground coffee drawing out the flavour of the beans through a paper or mesh filter and into the pot below. This method was popular largely because of its efficiency not because of the quality of the finished product. The maker could brew an entire pot of coffee in minutes with little effort but the taste of this coffee was poor to those who valued quality coffee.In the 1990s John Sylvan created a new type of coffee brewing similar to the drip coffee maker; this type of brewing became known as Keurig. Sylvan worked as a low-level marketing manager before inventing Keurig. Among his unofficial responsibilities was collecting money from his co-workers to pay the coffee vendor. He admitted it was like his full-time job most days. Not only did the chip-in system create headaches the coffee itself was lacklustre. On the rare occasion a co-worker got the coffee-to-water ratio right the half-full carafe would sit on the burner for hours getting stale and bitter. Sylvan envisioned a single-serve coffee system that would eliminate his trivial day-to-day coffee money shakedown and so the Keurig was born.In his quest to create a new brewing method Sylvan actually gave himself caffeine poisoning by taste- testing 30â40 cups a day. Unlike the drip models already on the market Sylvanâs machine was designed to brew single cups using sealed capsules of ground coffee. The Keurig process involved plastic capsules or pods of coffee grounds that when punctured released shots of nitrogen that kept the coffee from oxidizing. When a plastic capsule was closed into the Keurig brewer needles pierced its foil top and plastic bottom. The brewer then pumped in hot water turning the capsule into a miniaturized version of the filter basket found in a traditional coffee maker. This accelerated process took just 45 seconds to produce a steaming cup of coffee. Aside from being extremely time efficient a Keurig also saved users clean-up time. All they had to do was insert another pod into the machine and wait 45 seconds for another hot cup of coffee.  For those who valued the flavour of their coffee above all else the French press was the method deemed to generate the purest flavour possible. Making coffee using a French press involved boiling water to precisely 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius). Whole coffee beans were measured and coarsely ground and the newly ground beans were placed into the press and gently shaken to settle them into place. Finally half the required amount of perfect-temperature water was poured evenly over the grounds. This step was called the bloom. Hot water forced the ground coffee to release trapped gases leading the coffee to expand and release wonderful aromas for coffee purists to enjoy. During the bloom a thick crust of coffee grounds also formed. After 30 seconds the grounds were stirred gently for five seconds and the remaining half of the water was poured into the press. The lid was placed on the French press with the plunger pulled all the way up and the coffee was left to steep for four minutes. When the time was up the plunger was pressed all the way down to filter the grounds from the coffee which was poured immediately to avoid bitterness. The aroma the French press created and the view of the coffee oils floating on top were cherished by those who took pride in their coffee. When drinking a pressed coffee it was typical to actually taste the tiny bean particles. The reason the French press reached a higher flavour threshold was the absence of a paper filter which absorbed much of the oil in the grounds. Instead of soaking this up the press added tiny bits of coffee grounds to the coffee which actually percolated flavour. Steeping as opposed to filtering also increased the rich flavour. Ultimately the Keurig machine was far more efficient at coffee production but it undoubtedly lacked the high-value flavour that a French press was capable of producing.More Money More ProblemsAfter founding Keurig in 1992 Sylvan and his partner Peter Dragone hashed together prototype after prototype working in small offices and doing most of the taste testing themselves. For the first few years they drew no salaries and they were turned down for funding by scores of venture capitalists. For years their meetings with potential investors ended in various lectures as to why their invention would never catch on. Often they would be kicked out of the offices in which they met. After years of continuous rejection they found a Minneapolis-based investor called Food Fund which agreed to contribute US$50000. Subsequently MDT Advisers raised US$1 million for the company. An increasing number of investors yielded an increasing number of opinions. Sylvan disagreed with the majority of the investorsâ strategies and he did not take well to receiving direction from those outside the day-to-day operations of the business he was so passionate about. In 1994 after three years and a lot of energy passion and commitment Sylvan was forced out and demanded the company buy his stake which totalled US$50000. In fiscal 2017 Keurig was expected to make US$2.5 billion in revenues.Some Disassembly RequiredKalbfleisch sought high-quality coffee on the go. He tried travel French presses but found that the freshness suffered as the grounds remained in the bottom of the coffee spoiling the taste by the time he had taken it to school. Discovering no product on the market to suit his exacting requirements he began applying his knowledge of thermal fluids engineering to design his own all-in-one travel coffee press. As a child Kalbfleisch had been curious about how everyday objects worked. He would often take his toys apart to learn about the mechanisms that made them run. He was also a big fan of Lego like most future engineers and he often opted to build his own creations rather than follow the instructions. In high school Kalbfleisch learned how to use 3D modelling software through a technical designing course which helped to foster his interest in product design and eventually led him to become an engineer. During his undergraduate education Kalbfleisch took a year off to complete an internship at Ehvert Mission Critical an engineering consulting firm that specialized in the design of data centres. The small firm was owned and operated by a mechanical engineer who took an interest in developing Kalbfleischâs talents. This positive experience showed Kalbfleisch that an engineer with no formal business training could own a business. While working in data centres Kalbfleisch was amazed at the inefficiencies in the heating and cooling equipment of otherwise high-tech buildings. This led him to pursue a masterâs degree in thermal fluids engineering where his goal was to learn to develop more efficient solutions for heating and cooling. The curriculum in the masterâs program was heavily experiment-based; students built and tested many prototypes while making improvements along the way.When Kalbfleisch began his first foray into designing his coffee product his goal was to press fresh coffee within the travel mug itself. The unique design feature of separating the coffee beans from the liquid such that the maximum amount of flavour would be extracted while the beans were kept separate from the coffee itself seemed to Kalbfleisch a worthy way to differentiate his product from those that were currently available in the market. Accomplishing this design goal would insure a great-tasting brew with a consistent taste to the last sip. Kalbfleischâs product concept now called the Pascal Press would be the only product on the market with this separation feature. Combining his tireless pursuit of coffee perfection with the universityâs capacity to develop physical prototypes contributed greatly to Kalbfleischâs ability to design the worldâs best travel coffee press.Once Kalbfleisch had a rough draft of his design it was time to build a prototype. The experienced he had gained through his education made the process relatively quick and a prototype was made and perfected by September 2015. Constructed out of CA$20 worth of plumbing material the prototype visually showcased the plunge feature of his design so that anyone could easily see the unique process Kalbfleisch had created.Kalbfleisch met with a professor at Western Universityâs Ivey Business School and discussed the potential of Pascal Press. At the time Kalbfleisch had no intention of starting a business but the meeting exposed him to the possibilities and rewards of becoming an entrepreneur and selling his product. The professor suggested Kalbfleisch join the Propel Entrepreneurship Centre (Propel) a student-focused support group at Western University to develop his business. He joined Propel in mid-October 2016.In early December Kalbfleisch began designing and manufacturing his second major prototype using the machine shop provided through his school program. This resulted in an upgraded version of his product concept late in January 2017. By then Kalbfleisch had received a $2000 grant from Propel for a patent search and other forms of development support that enabled him to continue refining his vision. In spite of these various streams of financial support Kalbfleisch recognized that he had further work to do before he would have a product that could be manufactured and sold to consumers. Traditional sources of capital funding were difficult to obtain because the business to this point had achieved no sales. Kalbfleisch had the uncomfortable sense that his venture had effectively stalled. He needed money to further develop a product he believed strongly would be popular but he was unable to generate any sales without having a finished product. The idea that all his hard work and passion might go unrealized left Kalbfleisch desperately looking for new financing alternatives.Twoâs Company Three Thousandâs A CrowdAt that time some of the support staff at Propel suggested Kalbfleisch should consider crowdfunding his venture. He had heard of this relatively new entrepreneurship phenomenon where new business product concepts could effectively be pre-sold to those visiting a site as a means of effectively bridging the productâfinance gap that had previously prevented new products from reaching the marketplace. Anyone with a product concept could pitch it on a crowdfunding platform and if enough pre-sales were achieved the funds were released to the entrepreneur who could then use them to finish and deliver the product to those who had purchased it.Several popular crowdfunding platforms had emergedâincluding Kickstarter PBC Indiegogo Inc. and GoFundMeâall of which were designed to address the productâmarket gap Kalbfleisch was experiencing with Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set about learning how they all worked so he could determine which platform was the best fit. The concept of crowdfunding initially began in 1997 when the British rock band Marillion funded a previously cancelled tour of the United States by pre-selling tickets online to a group of hard-core fans. The success of this innovative method of financing tours and then record productions inspired the creation of the first online crowdfunding platform ArtistShare in 2000. Shortly thereafter more platforms began to emerge and the crowdfunding industry grew consistently each year. Crowdfunding made use of the vast networks and accessibility of social media to bring entrepreneurs and their ideas for new products together with the prospective buyers of those products. Traditionally capital funding sources for new products were limited by the orientations and preferences of small groups of investors who decided themselves whether a new product would be successful or not. Among the key virtues of crowdfunding was that it dramatically reduced investment risk by demonstrating through presales whether there was sufficient market demand for a new product. It also greatly expanded the pool of buyers from whom funds could be raised resulting in a greater volume of valuable products in the marketplace. In addition it was important to note that people who pledged money to crowdfunding campaigns would not actually pay for the products unless these had secured enough pre-orders to make production feasible. Perhaps most importantly crowdfunding greatly reduced the barriers involved in becoming an entrepreneur. By 2009 crowdfunding had emerged as a popular option for entrepreneurs to gain exposure funding and secure validation for their ideas. Revenue in the crowdfunding industry tripled from US$530 million in 2009 to US$1.5 billion by 2011. The explosion of crowdfunding cushioned the blow dealt by the decreasing availability of other funds such as small business association loans.According to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundationâs 2016 index of start-up activity data the number of new entrepreneurs rose in 2014. It increased again in 2015 boasting roughly 550000 new ventures every month. The number of women starting businesses hit its highest level in almost 20 years (40Â perÂ cent) while minorities and immigrants represented a significant portion of new entrepreneurs (28Â per cent).Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter generated revenues by taking a percentage of the funds raised usually 5 per cent of the funding total as well as payment processing fees of 3â5 per cent. Fees were taken only if the funding venture was successful. If the target was not reached no fee was taken and pledgers were not charged. To encourage investors to pledge their money many crowdfunding projects were reward-based. Pre-buyers participated in the launch of a new product and some received additional purchase benefits or pricing discounts. (Re)Search And Ye Shall FindKalbfleischâs approach to crowdfunding as a means of advancing his venture was typical for him. He broke down and analyzed everything he could about the subject such that he knew exactly what he would have to do to maximize his chances of success. One of many insights he gained from this research was that developing a pre-launch marketing campaign would be crucial to success. Kalbfleisch learned that he needed to create excitement and anticipation for his product prior to launching it in order to secure crowdfunding support. He knew most forms of marketing would cost moneyâwhich he did not haveâso instead Kalbfleisch posted images of his constructed prototype on free online forums such as Reddit and began to slowly build up a following. Kalbfleischâs pre-launch goal was to identify and locate his target market based on reactions to his posts. He quickly learned that tea lovers had no interest in his product concept whereas the majority of coffee fans showed instant enthusiasm for it. His posts soon became among the top-ranked on the forum and Kalbfleisch took this as validation of his idea. He sought feedback on these posts and continuously modified and reposted his design to seek additional ideas from forum users. For example one user suggested a spill-proof lid which Kalbfleisch incorporated into his final design. He also began collecting email addresses in preparation for his Kickstarter launch. Kalbfleisch used the recognition he had cultivated on various online forums and directly contacted relevant blog sites to solicit their support in spreading awareness of his upcoming Kickstarter campaign. By the month before his campaign launch Kalbfleisch had gathered over 1100 email addresses which he intended to use as the base of the communications efforts for his Kickstarter campaign. After consulting with his selected production partners in China Kalbfleisch estimated that he needed approximately $80000 in capital to cover the tooling required to manufacture the Pascal Press. Kalbfleisch set the Kickstarter campaignâs goal at $40000 to be raised within a 30-day period. He believed that a lower goal would encourage more pledges from buyers and prove to traditional sources of capital that his idea had sufficient traction with the masses making them comfortable with providing the $40000 difference.Kalbfleisch had reviewed many successful Kickstarter campaigns but even after doing so he was not fully confident about which incentive structure would work best for Pascal Pressâs Kickstarter campaign. âI had an immense amount of feedback and input from my online discussion groups as well as my own research and it wasnât clear at all what would work in terms of getting someone to cross the threshold of interested supporter to actual customerâ he said. He set up a proposed incentive structure: the first 200 pledgers would receive 20 per cent off their press as an âearly bird specialâ and remaining buyers would receive 10 per cent off their purchase. Another vital detail to determine was the right price for a Pascal Press. The initial proposed production run of 2000 units would result in a cost of $12.50 per unit. Kalbfleisch would also have to pay for the tooling costs which were estimated at $55000â$60000. Kalbfleischâs instinct was to simply use his costs as the basis for an acceptable price for Pascal Press: âAs long as thereâs a reasonable profit per unit Iâm comfortable with it though I am curious as to other possible pricing approachesâ he said.  Ultimately Kalbfleisch intended to utilize a wholesale distribution system where coffee houses and other retailers would purchase his product with an eye to marking it up and selling it to their customers. Kalbfleisch wondered whether he should offer a deal to his Kickstarter buyers selling the initial production run for what would effectively become the wholesale price. He also wondered what his overall distribution approach should be. He had more or less assumed that the traditional manufacture-wholesale-retail approach was best for Pascal Press but he wondered if selling on Kickstarter was proof that a direct-to-consumer approach might be more valuable. He also had to consider whether he should try to sell through wholesale and onlineâand what the implications of those approaches might be.The Kickstarter campaign launch was only a few days away and it was becoming clearer to Kalbfleisch that some important decisions that would greatly influence the success of Pascal Press still needed to be made.

Samsui Central Kitchen (SCK) Samsui’s flagship corporate social responsibility (CSR) project provided 1.8 million meals annually to various long-term care facilities for the elderly and was especially crucial because the existing SCK facility was reaching maximum capacity and stakeholder buy-in would be needed to expand it. Ang strongly believed in Samsui’s ambition to embed CSR in its core company strategy. Having achieved his initial objectives for the central kitchen he set his sights on expansion to impact more beneficiaries in the company’s home base of Singapore. He wondered how to quantify the impact of SCK’s CSR initiatives in a clear and simple message in order to communicate the impact to various stakeholders and justify the further expansion of SCK. Samsui’s BACKGROUNDIn 2013 Samsui was set up by Soup Restaurant Group Limited (Soup Restaurant) to spearhead Soup Kitchen’s CSR efforts as part of its “drive to do good.” Soup Restaurant had started in 1991 as a restaurant operating out of a single shop-house in Singapore’s Chinatown with only six employees and six dining tables. The restaurant sold various herbal soups and home-cooked Chinese dishes at an affordable price-point to mass-market consumers. Soup Restaurant had since expanded to 17 restaurants across Singapore and Malaysia with a franchise in Indonesia. The company had been listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange since 2007 and operated an entire portfolio of brands and verticals in the food and beverage (F&B) sector. The products ranged from prepared condiments and sauces to frozen supermarket food (see Exhibit 1).A major reason for Soup Restaurant’s decision to set up Samsui was to enable better tracking of key process indicators and the resources needed for these activities with the goal of doing sustainable good. In 2016 Soup Restaurant received the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Award for Small and Medium Enterprises. The following year the company was recognized as a Champion of Good by the NVPC.Ang and the rest of Samsui’s management team decided that the company’s philanthropic efforts should not be restricted to one-off projects and events preferring sustainable and long-term initiatives. Given Samsui’s extensive experience in the F&B industry as well as the experience of its parent company Samsui decided to leverage its knowledge of the food value chain to help charitable organizations. Traditionally charitable organizations could not leverage economies of scale to negotiate lower prices for ingredients and they often lacked distribution networks for logistics. But Samsui had strong bargaining power in its relationships with suppliers due to the collective clout of Soup Restaurant when purchasing ingredients. Samsui also had distribution networks in place that it could leverage for the transportation and logistics of ingredients and cooked meals. This competency-based approach ensured that Samsui focused on its core expertise of food manufacturing which culminated in launching the “Makan Project” in 2013. Makan was a program that delivered better quality food to 20000 underprivileged recipients in homes and care centres. The initial 30000 meals were prepared in the existing central kitchen of Samsui’s parent company during downtime periods when excess production capacity could be utilized. As the program’s popularity increased Samsui explored ways of expanding this CSR initiative by increasing the number of meals provided to beneficiaries. Consequently Samsui decided that setting up a new central kitchen was necessary with the existing kitchens already running at full capacity. Samsui’s decision to pursue strategic CSR was exemplary. Industry experts had criticized the philanthropic CSR approach on the basis that CSR should encompass more than just philanthropy volunteerism and eco-friendliness. This view was echoed by research from McKinsey & Company which argued that companies typically took a too inward-looking perspective of CSR efforts and viewed CSR as a distinct program in a company’s operations. In contrast Samsui relied on its core competencies instead of reinventing the wheel to bring about social benefits in an innovative way that allowed it to create a sustainable initiative in the form of SCK. It could thus be argued that Samsui’s approach was ahead of its time in respect to its Singaporean peers.However there was a clear need for a framework in the decision-making process for CSR. When Samsui was just starting out new CSR projects could be quickly ideated materialized and tested to determine whether they met the expected objectives and were sustainable. However the absence of a formal and rigorous framework that considered the implications and viability of an initiative conflicted with Samsui’s ambition of embedding CSR into its core company strategy. Given that Samsui had limited resources as a relatively small enterprise it was prudent to avoid initiatives that were merely well-meaning but not profitable. Otherwise Samsui would risk creating an assortment of uncoordinated and unfocused CSR activities that would become unsustainable. Therefore it was imperative for Samsui to create effective key performance indicators to benchmark its performance and the achievements of the company. This was especially important because Samsui was engaged in CSR projects that were no longer small in terms of time operational scope and capital commitments despite Samsui’s limited resources. The most recent addition of a flagship SCK had cost the company $1 million in capital. Ang shared Samsui’s preference for working with like-minded program partners such as Standard Chartered Bank. In addition to collaborating with Samsui to build SCK Standard Chartered Bank had its own program—the Silver Lining—aimed at improving quality of life for the elderly. The program launched in 2012 involved the bank’s employees engaging with seniors through various community initiatives. BETTER FOOD NEEDED AT Long-Term Care FacilitiESThrough market research Ang found that the food served in Singapore’s long-term care facilities for the elderly had been the subject of criticism by industry experts. The two main criticisms were the lack of nutrition and the lack of variety. Many care facilities ran their own kitchens with mixed results. The issue of lack of nutrition had been well-documented with the most common nutritional problems for residents in long-term care facilities being weight loss and associated protein-energy malnutrition. The prevalence of these two factors among the elderly in these facilities in Singapore ranged between 23 and 85 per cent. The lack of variety in the food served in these facilities had been attributed to outdated kitchen equipment and time constraints resulting in limited menus with the same cooking methods and ingredients used repeatedly. In a 2016 study it was found that a quarter of long-term care facility residents did not enjoy the food provided while a third complained that they were unable to find their favourite food among the offerings.Both the lack of quality and lack of nutrition were issues that necessitated intervention. These factors could lead to adverse effects on the health and quality of life of long-term care facility residents. Malnutrition had been found to compromise their quality of life leading to chronic disability functional decline increased health care costs and possibly even death. A lack of food choice could result in inadequate food intake leading to weight loss and a suboptimal body mass index suggestive of malnutrition. As such it was imperative to find a major company prepared to tackle the root of the problem by providing nutritious food to improve quality of life for the residents. Globally autonomy of choice had been reported as one of the main reasons for improved food intake in long-term care facilities which could also indirectly tackle the malnutrition issue. The level of satisfaction with food service had increased up to 30 per cent after long-term care facility residents were offered the power to choose from a menu. Therefore providing a range of food choices was considered the key to providing adequate nutrition in the form of a balance of carbohydrates proteins and vegetables. Ang felt that given Samsui’s unique position in the F&B industry it was well placed to tackle the issue by providing a variety of food to improve the quality of life for the elderly.MARKET SIZeBased on the NVPC training program Ang realized that the first step was to estimate the number of meals for long-term care facilities. The first of two key figures to be used in estimating the number of meals was Samsui’s targeted market share of 30 per cent in Singapore by 2031. Based on Ang’s calculations Samsui’s current market share was closer to 17 per cent. This estimate was based on a linear projection over time and the first-mover advantage SCK’s project had in serving the relatively closed market of the long-term care facility meals industry. The second key figure was the total number of beds in institutional care centres which was projected by the Singapore Ministry of Health to be 17000 by 2020. The figure represented growth of 85 per cent from 2010. Ang assumed that the number of beds would increase in a linear trend during the forecasted period as opposed to the exponential growth seen from 2010 to 2020.Ang also projected that the supply of beds in long-term care facilities would increase to meet demand which was driven in part by the lack of quality home care options. Approximately 2 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and over stayed in long-term care facilities compared to an average of 6–8 per cent in Northern Europe and Australia. SAMSUI CENTRAL KITCHEN’s PROJECT Samsui’s flagship CSR project was the SCK project. It was intended to provide employment skills training to individuals in need. The SCK project was launched in October 2017 by Samsui and the Standard Chartered Bank of Singapore with the support of Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) a government organization that provided the matching service between the trainees and Samsui. The project had been touted as the first social service system in Singapore. It was a collaboration between the public sector private sector and social enterprises leveraging their respective strengths and resources to deliver sustainable long-term impact on the community. The current facility was staffed by 30 trainees and produced 1.8 million meals annually. The trainees would prepare meals to be served to beneficiaries at various non-profit organizations. Samsui’s menus were approved by dieticians and nutritionists before being rolled out. Through this project Samsui aimed to provide a greater variety of nutritious food options to increase the overall satisfaction of care health and quality of life for residents.  One immediate impact of the launch was SCK’s increased capacity with an almost 500 per cent increase from the 365000 meals previously delivered by Samsui. The impact on food quality was also palpable according to the recipients of the meals. James Tan chief executive of Touch Community Services (one of the beneficiaries of the kitchen) said that the food was delicious and that it helped to get good quality food at good prices. Trainees who worked in the kitchen were also offered jobs with Samsui upon completion of their training. Even if these trainees chose not to work with Samsui they would have picked up some useful skills for employment opportunities elsewhere. Ang also noted another less apparent impact of the SCK project: by outsourcing food operations the long-term care facilities could free up workers and related resources for other activities. This enabled the facilities to focus on their core strength of providing quality care.SAMSUI’S PLAN FOR EXPANSIONIn 2018 the capacity of SCK was 1.8 million meals per year. This could meet the needs of approximately 2465 long-term care facility residents annually which was a fraction of the 17000-capacity requirement set by the Singapore Ministry of Health for 2020. Ang saw an opportunity for Samsui to make use of its comparative advantage to meet the needs of even more long-term care facilities and residents. Samsui would be able to negotiate better prices for food ingredients and make use of its inherent knowledge in food production to provide a greater social good.A key challenge faced by long-term care facilities was providing nutritious and varied meals at a cost-effective price point. Options included setting up a kitchen within the long-term care facility and engaging third-party food caterers. Ang noted that setting up a kitchen was expensive. Using third-party food caterers was also not ideal because caterers had little experience and ability to address the dietary requirements of the residents often resulting in bland and unvaried meal plans. In contrast SCK aimed to provide sufficiently nutritious and varied meals without being prohibitively expensive.Ang felt that with Samsui’s team of professional chefs and the ability to purchase bulk ingredients from wholesalers SCK could provide an extensive balanced menu to long-term care facilities with high-quality ingredients and at a lower cost than other available catering options. The meals offered included local favourites tweaked to match the dietary requirements of the residents. For example Samsui chefs developed a low cholesterol version of laksa by using anchovies and fresh milk.SAMSUI’S NEED FOR a DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKGiven that the existing SCK facility was reaching its maximum capacity Ang knew that investment from the parent company “Soup Restaurant Group” would be needed for expansion. The first SCK was built at a cost of $1 million. Because Soup Restaurant was a publicly listed for-profit organization it had to be accountable to stakeholders and shareholders. Ang needed to ensure that the group’s commitment to doing good was sustainable. Samsui had joined NVPC’s Company of Good program in 2016 as a founding member. This program aimed to empower businesses in Singapore to contribute in strategic sustainable and impactful ways. NVPC advocated the “Four I’s” framework—investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 2). Ang reflected on how Samsui’s focus on doing good had been incorporated throughout the company’s business processes. During the recruitment process for new employees personal qualities such as integrity and willingness to do good for the community were highly sought. Samsui selected its employees for CSR initiatives based on the employees’ strengths and interests. The employees were also rotated among the various CSR activities to increase their exposure to varied experiences. Ang was thus able to build a culture of strong employee participation and volunteerism. Lee Chee Hua a chef participating in a CSR program to cook meals for the beneficiaries shared his thoughts: “When I participated in the programme I realized that ageing is a path that most people have to go through. Seeing the joy on the faces of the people we serve brings much satisfaction to me.”The learning experience from partnering with NVPC also prompted Ang to consider whether Samsui should use the Four I’s framework to benchmark its performance and achievements. Ang felt that the impact of the model could be further enhanced. Knowing that Samsui as a small-to-medium enterprise had limited resources it was important to avoid initiatives that were well-meaning but not profitable. Therefore Ang needed to conduct a more in-depth analysis. He needed to find options for evaluating the SCK project’s impact in a more formal and rigorous manner. Measuring impact quantitatively was important to ensure buy-in from key stakeholders including Samsui’s employees management and shareholders.SOCIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENTBy reviewing existing literature on the topic Ang identified two key tools that could be used effectively to evaluate the SCK project: the balanced scorecard and social return on investment (SROI). The balanced scorecard could clearly highlight the program’s objectives and the steps Samsui needed to take to meet those goals. However the balanced scorecard could only provide a subjective form of measurement. It was unable to quantify figures such as social outcomes and impacts. In contrast the SROI was an adaptation of the return on investment formula used by traditional investors to assess a company’s success. The SROI framework could measure and report a broad concept of value that extended beyond financial terms and enabled an organization and its stakeholders to see a more complete picture of the benefits from their investment of time money and other resources. Mathematically the basic formula could be expressed as follows: SROI = Present Value of Benefits ÷ Present Value of Total Investment. Ang knew that he needed some concrete numbers to gain stakeholder support for the expansion of SCK to reach more beneficiaries. The SROI formula could help provide those figures. However to estimate the SCK project’s impact using the SROI framework Ang needed to first complete four key steps.Step 1: Theory of ChangeThe first step was to identify the underlying theory of change (ToC) which was an overview of the relationship between interventions and expected effects or outcomes. That overview would map the chains of causes and effects. The ToC would highlight the transition from the current state to the final state via the intervention method (see Exhibit 3). At the current state food offerings at long-term care facilities lacked nutritional value and variety which led to a lower quality of life (QoL) for the residents. The World Health Organization defined QoL as “the individuals’ perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns.” There were several domains operating under the QoL umbrella. In respect to the SCK project the focus was on the domains of physical health and psychological health. The intervention method was providing meals with greater nutritional value and greater variety. Greater nutritional value would tackle the physical health domain whereas greater variety of food would increase food choices and address the psychological health domain. Step 2: Impact MappingImpact mapping was achieved using a logic model. The model examined various resources (i.e. inputs) used to conduct activities. The activities were measured in outputs which consisted of direct quantitative and qualitative summary measures obtained from the activities. Ultimately the outputs led to outcomes or social externalities that occurred within one to three years. The outputs also led to long-term benefits for stakeholders which were attained within 7 to 10 years. The impact map was fundamental to an SROI analysis. Using the developed ToC as the underlying concept the impact map ascertained the social impact of an intervention. Ang developed the impact mapping for the SCK project based on his own reading (see Exhibit 4).Step 3: Data CollectionThe data collection process comprised three progressive steps: (1) selecting indicators (2) identifying financial proxies (valuation and monetization) and (3) collecting data. In selecting indicators the developed ToC relied on secondary research to build the case for the need for intervention. To measure whether the outcomes set out had been achieved indicators could be selected to ascertain whether a change had occurred. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators could be used to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. The indicators chosen should be S.M.A.R.T.—specific measurable attainable relevant and time-bound.Indicators had to be chosen to measure the changes brought about by Samsui’s intervention. Many found the process of translating outcomes from social welfare interventions into measurable results challenging. Consequently both quantitative and qualitative indicators were used in tandem to illustrate several aspects of Samsui’s SCK intervention. This served to provide a more holistic perspective of the outcomes achieved. A quantitative indicator of saving for example would be the resource saved by outsourcing meals to Samsui. The quantitative indicator of these opportunity costs which were incurred by preparing meals in-house was used together with surveys of long-term care facility operators and service staff. One key consideration for Samsui was whether the indicators could be reasonably measured. Having chosen suitable indicators monetary values were attached to the outcomes to estimate the social value to different stakeholders. To do so financial proxies had to be chosen. Financial proxies helped to reach the desired indicator and estimate the social value of non-traded goods to different stakeholders. The financial proxies chosen had to be close to the desired indicators. For example a monetary value was calculated for a long-term care facility freeing up resources by outsourcing to Samsui on a per meal basis. This calculation was based on the difference between the existing industry average food price versus Samsui’s food price (see Exhibit 5). Data for each of the indicators chosen had to be collected based on research and existing sources (i.e. internal stakeholders and external sources). This step was done using reasonable efforts to evaluate the change that resulted. Two key variables were identified that could significantly alter the calculation of SROI: (1) the number of meals sold to long-term care facilities and (2) the difference in Samsui’s food price versus industry average. Other model assumptions were also used for the SROI analysis (see Exhibit 6). The calculation also involved estimating the SCK project’s deadweight; that is how much of the outcome could be achieved without intervention? No deadweight was assumed for the outcome of “residents having a greater variety of nutritious meals.” This change was unlikely to happen without Samsui because no other meal provider was offering a similar standard of nutrition or variety in 2018.Step 4: SROI Modelling In the final step the social benefits were summed up and discounted. The value of outcomes were discounted to the same period as when the investment costs were incurred. Subsequently the ratio of the summed benefits to the present value of the investment was calculated. Because SROI was a ratio it was meaningless on its own. It had to be compared against a benchmark such as competing companies within a given industry or Samsui’s own past performance. Alternatively both comparisons could be done. To compare the SROI against other Samsui performance would require another study. MOVING FORWARDBefore Ang could explain to the board members his plan to scale up the SCK project to double the current capacity he needed more evidence to demonstrate the current project’s achieved impact. He approached SG Enable an agency in Singapore dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities for a possible partnership pertaining to the possible location for the second SCK project and additional workforce that was inclusive of persons with disabilities. Ang was eager to continue doing good. The time of his meeting with the board members was fast approaching and he needed numbers for his presentation.EXHIBIT 1: KEY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS OF SOUP RESTAURANT GROUP*Note: *Soup Restaurant Group Limited owns Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd.

Made in America: Harley-Davidson� President Donald J. Trump praised the motorcycle company�s executives and union leaders on February 2 2017. When he left the meeting at the White House that day Matthew S. Levatich the chief executive officer (CEO) of Harley-Davidson Inc. (Harley-Davidson) was impressed by the Trump administration. The meeting had occurred less than two weeks after Trump had released his America First foreign policy which could help or hurt the struggling but iconic company that had become a symbol of American ideals and U.S. manufacturing know-how. �The big opportunity for Harley-Davidson growth-wise is in Asia and a lot of the work with the Trans-Pacific Partnership addresses some of the barriers that are in the way of our growth in Asia� Levatich had said in a television appearance in April 2016. However many things had changed since then and in May 2017 Levatich had to ascertain whether to pursue that big Asian opportunity. America First and Tweet-based Policy makingAccording to an official White House statement the Trump administration through the America First foreign policy was committed to a foreign policy focused on American interests and American national security. The President understands how critical it is to put American workers and businesses first when it comes to trade. With tough and fair agreements international trade can be used to grow our economy return millions of jobs to America�s shores and revitalize our nation�s suffering communities. This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers. President Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).In the immediate aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election several multinational CEOs had fallen victim to damaging social-media posts (tweets) from the President of the United States� @POTUS Twitter account that had cost their companies billions of dollars in lost market capitalization (i.e. the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares). Other companies had needed to change their existing plans which were seen as being inconsistent with America First. The Ford Motor Company (Ford) for example had planned to build a new assembly plant in Mexico but cancelled this plan on January 3 2017 and redirected the investment to Michigan in response to a tweet from @POTUS. This setback among others contributed to Mark Fields�s departure as CEO of Ford on May 22 2017. Some experts claimed that he had �bungled Trump.� Other companies had similar experiences; for example tweets from @POTUS erased in a matter of hours billions of dollars in market capitalization at both Toyota Motor Corporation and General Motors Company.CEOs in other strategic industries such as aerospace and defence contracting also felt the wrath of @POTUS on Twitter. On December 6 2016 minutes after the CEO of the Boeing Company (Boeing) had been �reported to have expressed doubt about Mr. Trump�s plans on international trade� President-elect Trump wasted no time tweeting �Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control. Cancel order.� While several factors may have led to the decline of Boeing on that day the damaging tweet erased $1 billion from Boeing�s stock market value and caused a spike in the volume of shares traded. This pattern of �stock-price-moving tweets� was a factor for Boeing and also for Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed Martin) which lost $1.2 billion in market value in the aftermath of yet another @POTUS tweet on December 22 2016: �Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35 I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.� Was this use of social media a new way for the White House to strategically influence the U.S. business community by circumventing the mainstream press and trained journalists? Was it forcing companies to align their business decisions with government policy or even to display blind allegiance�a stance that had been optional in relation to previous administrations? In recent years the White House had generally taken counsel from these CEOs and had taken a laissez-faire approach rather than actively interfering with business decisions. However this laissez-faire approach was becoming far less typical in early 2017. One thing was certain: the new approach was adding to the uncertainties associated with policy making and it was very potent. CEOs who were often compensated based on their companies� stock performance and who seemed at odds with the current administration saw their companies� stock prices plunge in a matter of hours. The tensions between the White House and the U.S. business community were building to an unprecedented level. In this new context of highly unpredictable and volatile domestic priorities what should the CEO of a U.S. multinational do regarding international expansion? Harley-Davidson established in Milwaukee Wisconsin in 1903 had a long history. Levatich was fairly new to his role having been elected president and CEO on May 1 2015. He had to consider his options for reversing the trend of a year-long sales decline generated mostly in the United States (see Exhibit 1) and a downward-trending stock price caused by the aging of the company�s main U.S. customers who were �overwhelmingly white male and middle-aged.�However as a well-trained business executive and a Harley-Davidson veteran since 1994 he probably realized that international trade which was often associated incorrectly with the loss of U.S. jobs to other countries had been targeted as the enemy. In the context of the America First policy international expansion had clearly become politically incorrect. On Inauguration Day two weeks before Levatich�s meeting at the White House the U.S. international trade policy environment had turned away from globalization and its main trading partners (China Japan Mexico and European countries) raising concerns around the world. On January 23 2017 making good on a campaign promise Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) an agreement that had been aimed at boosting trade and reducing thousands of tariffs among 12 nations. U.S. participation in the TPP would have benefited Harley-Davidson and many other U.S.-based multinationals in several industries. The TPP had been signed by President Barack Obama on February 4 2016 after five years of negotiations and the use of fast-track authority. Trump had promised to also renegotiate NAFTA based on the assumption that these trade deals were not sufficiently beneficial to the United States. While many of his supporters were rejoicing many CEOs and economists voiced concerns and distanced themselves from Trump. The tensions between the White House and the U.S. business community had reached a new height.the Global Context and Harley-Davidson�s Internationalization For Levatich and Harley-Davidson the end of U.S. participation in the TPP negotiations was bad news. The TPP could have saved Harley-Davidson millions of dollars by reducing if not eliminating high tariff barriers in Malaysia for example. According to the International Trade Centre import tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles were also high in Thailand and they were 100 per cent (that is they doubled the price) in India where Harley-Davidson had built plants first in Gurgaon in 2009 and then in Bawal in an effort to avoid this type of prohibitive tax. The former chair of the asset management division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Jim O�Neill had coined the term BRIC to describe the economies of Brazil Russia India and China. Harley-Davidson�s major step into these promising and fast-growing emerging BRIC markets had been aimed at offsetting lacklustre U.S. sales following the 2008 global financial crisis. In fact the company�s internationalization plans included several strategic options ranging from direct exports to foreign direct investments such as building plants overseas or taking at least a 10 per cent capital stake in a foreign partner. Almost a century earlier Harley-Davidson had been the largest motorcycle maker in the world distributing motorcycles in 67 countries through 2000 dealers. However the majority of its sales were on U.S. soil and Harley-Davidson�s prosperity was dependent on the U.S. economy and its loyal customer base. During and after World War II world markets became increasingly interconnected. To support this important evolution of the global economy agreements were formed such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade signed by 23 nations in 1947; and the World Trade Organization was created in 1995 and grew to include 164 member states in 2017. In the 1960s and 1970s Harley-Davidson had suffered greatly because of both poor product quality and international competition from Europe and Japan. Product quality became an issue especially after 1969 when the company�s motorcycles division was purchased by American Machine and Foundry Inc. a popular sports equipment manufacturer. The situation improved only after the Reagan administration imposed a 45 per cent tariff on imported motorcycles with engines of at least 700 cubic centimetres (cc)�a tariff that was in effect for four years between 1983 and 1987. In the 1990s Harley-Davidson emerged from its dark period as a strong innovator and a globally competitive U.S. motorcycle manufacturer. Its innovations included fuel injection and drive belts (instead of greasy chains) featured on all models and a V-Rod engine that was designed in collaboration with Porsche and featured liquid cooling. These innovations drove sales and earnings into high gear; the main focus of the management team was to increase production every year. Until 2001 with a booming U.S. economy and stock market Harley-Davidson was still primarily focused on the U.S. market. However managers had become complacent and over reliant on their domestic market. Their wake-up call came when the 2007 U.S. market decline was followed by the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2011 Harley-Davidson motorcycles were made in the United States assembled in India and Manaus Brazil (since 1999) and distributed in 86 countries through 1400 dealers most of whom were located outside of the United States and away from the old riders�the so-called real bikers. During the period from 2011 to 2015 exchange-rate trends made it easier for European companies to compete based on cheaper prices as they entered the U.S. market. The value of the euro decreased by more than 30 per cent during this period as the U.S. dollar strengthened rising from $1.48 per euro on April 25 2011 to $1.05 on March 9 2015. This trend persisted with an exchange rate of approximately $1.15 per euro in 2017. Additional challenges and headwinds were surfacing and needed to be addressed by Harley-Davidson�s leader.Harley-Davidson: An America Icon Facing SIGNIFICANT HeadwindsLeadershipLevatich became the CEO of Harley-Davidson on May 1 2015. In more than 20 years at Harley-Davidson the 53-year-old Levatich had experienced many changes. He had deep roots in manufacturing management and had honed his business skills on the job and through his formal education. His biographical statement on Harley-Davidson�s website described a well-rounded executive with direct exposure to international trade and the global economy:Matt Levatich serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Harley-Davidson Inc. Levatich joined Harley-Davidson in 1994 and held positions of increasing responsibility in the U.S. and Europe including President and Chief Operating Officer of Harley-Davidson Motor Company Vice President and General Manager of the Motor Company�s Parts and Accessories business Vice President of Materials Management and President and Managing Director of MV Agusta.Prior to joining Harley-Davidson Levatich held positions in engineering and in manufacturing management with FMC Corporation and Albany International Corporation. He holds an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He received his graduate degree in engineering management and MBA in marketing finance and organizational behaviour from Northwestern University (Class of 1994). In addition to serving on the board of directors of Harley-Davidson Inc. Levatich serves on the board of directors for Emerson a global manufacturing and technology company based in St. Louis and on the executive advisory board of Northwestern�s Master of Management and Manufacturing Program.Based on his seasoned business background Levatich knew that his performance would be measured according to Harley-Davidson�s stock price behaviour over time. His 6400 employees worldwide and shareholders were watching his every move. He also knew that the Harley-Davidson brand typically appealed to customers who wanted to feel free and bold and who wanted to make a (loud) statement. These characteristics epitomized not only the American spirit and ideals but also deep human values that were shared by many around the world.Stock Price Performance On December 31 2014 four months before Levatich became CEO Harley-Davidson stock a typical measure of a CEO�s performance was trading at $60.35 adjusted for both dividends and splits. When Levatich celebrated his second anniversary as CEO on May 1 2017 Harley-Davidson�s stock price was trading at $54.75. Over the same period the S&P 500 index the benchmark typically used to compare the performance of any publicly traded company with the overall market had increased by 16 per cent from $2058.90 to $2388.33. During the first quarter of 2017 investors� confidence had been boosted in �anticipation of a pro-growth policy [of] massive tax cuts infrastructure spending and deregulation� in a phenomenon known as the Trump rally which was deemed to be the second-best investment rally since that following John F. Kennedy�s presidential election. However the rally did not help reverse the downward trend of Harley-Davidson�s stock price. Operational and Strategic ChallengesSince 2014 competition had intensified sales and net income were decreasing and customer needs were changing. As he took over as president and CEO Levatich needed to do something quickly to address and possibly reverse these disturbing trends. But what could he do? What strategic option could he focus on in the complex and uncertain environment that he and his company were experiencing?To get Harley-Davidson stock prices rising again Levatich would need to think analytically and strategically and to consider the global business landscape�including strategic options such as adaptation standardization and execution on a global scale. He was familiar with his company�s outlook and long-term strategy (2017�2027) which had been articulated around five objectives: (1) build 2 million new Harley-Davidson riders in the United States; (2) grow Harley-Davidson�s international business to 50 per cent of its total annual volume; (3) launch 100 new high-impact Harley-Davidson motorcycles; (4) deliver a superior return on invested capital for Harley-Davidson Motor Company; and (5) grow the business without growing its environmental impact.Levatich would need to think through analytical frameworks�and very quickly. At the same time he would need to carefully assess the implications of any international expansion plans. Could an announcement that Harley-Davidson was building a new plant overseas in an attempt to avoid high tariffs cost him his job? If a punishing @POTUS tweet were to be posted after such an announcement could the company afford to lose billions in market value and some of its U.S. customers? Would Harley-Davidson�s union leaders revolt and call for a massive strike in the U.S. manufacturing facilities that supplied the overseas assembly plants? In addition to being aware of the America First foreign policy Levatich also knew that other government policies such as the anti-pollution program were costing his company millions of dollars per year. In 2016 Harley-Davidson had agreed �to pay a $12 million civil penalty for selling devices federal regulators say allowed riders to put too much pollution into the air.�CompetitorsInternationalInternational competition originating from Japan (Honda Kawasaki Suzuki and Yamaha) and Europe (BMW and Ducati) had started to hurt Harley-Davidson in the 1960s and these motorcycle makers were continuing to compete for riders. In March 2016 Mintel Group Ltd. a global market research company surveyed 500 18-year-old motorcycle owners on the brand of motorcycle they would be most likely to purchase next. In key results while Harley-Davidson was the top brand those surveyed would consider buying the brand came second in a ranking based on current percentage of ownership (see Exhibit 2). The Mintel report noted:Where Harley�s cache surrounds relatively expensive cruisers the four Japanese manufacturers have built their reputations on smaller reasonably priced models including sports bikes and also off-road bikes. These brands also produce large cruisers often at prices more competitive than those sold by Harley-Davidson. In a hypothetical match-up in which bikes were stripped of all identifying brand elements and judged solely on their build and price there is a reasonable likelihood that the share belonging to the four Japanese brands would be higher; BMW and Ducati bikes along with those from�Harley tend to sell at a premium. Even as it stands in Mintel�s survey Honda already competes with Harley to be the most commonly owned motorcycle brand.DomesticEven with a 53.1 per cent share of the market for motorcycles with engines of at least 601 cc Harley-Davidson was under increasing pressure in the form of significant price discounts from Polaris Industries which sold motorcycles under its Indian brand. However Levatich had refused to engage in a price war and expected more sales even while his industry was becoming more competitive and his loyal customer base was shifting.Customer ShiftsFor generations particularly in Hollywood movies and TV commercials the typical Harley-Davidson customer had been a rebel�the unshaven �bad guy� outlaw and irresistible villain. �While no other motorcycle manufacturer enjoys the instant name recognition of Harley-Davidson it�s also true that the recession hit Harley harder than it did any other motorcycle brand� one article noted. However since the 2008 financial crisis sales to typical Harley-Davidson customers (e.g. white males) had been declining. The Interbrand agency which had measured brand value or equity for more than 20 years and attributed values to brands based on financial statements associated market dynamics and forecasted future earnings reported the following disturbing statistic in 2009: �According to Interbrand Harley-Davidson experienced the biggest drop in value. The �legend�s� value dropped by 43 per cent to $4.34 billion which is most likely connected to the 66 per cent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the last year.��Since 2009 Harley-Davidson had been forced to shift toward a new (younger) generation of riders since the �real riders� who made up the company�s traditional customer base (i.e. white males 45 years old or older) were aging and declining in numbers. That shift had happened over decades. In 1987 the median age of Harley-Davidson customers was 35 and had risen to 47 by 2007. A full 60 per cent of the company�s customers were baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. In 2015 the number of U.S. baby boomers was 74.9 million down from its 1999 peak of 78.8 million; this generation was expected to number 16.6 million by 2050. Harley-Davidson had been trying to build a more diversified customer base in the United States by attracting more women African American and Hispanic customers. As such it had started to court women as riders through garage parties a marketing effort that was showing some positive results.However millennials tended to prefer experiences rather than possessions such as motorcycles. They sought differentiation and customization associated the Harley-Davidson brand with their grandparents and could not afford luxurious motorcycles. Based on this information Harley-Davidson changed its product mix selling 6.4 per cent fewer Touring motorcycles which emphasized comfort and load capacity and instead selling 4.7 per cent more Cruiser motorcycles which emphasized styling and customization. It maintained the existing percentage of Sportsters which emphasized performance; worldwide retail sales for this product declined by 1.6 per cent between 2015 and 2016. In 2016 62 per cent of Harley-Davidson�s retail sales were generated in the United States compared with 38 per cent in international markets an increase of 22 per cent over the previous decade. This trend was clearly confirmed between 2006 and 2016 in terms of domestic motorcycle shipments decreasing from 273212 to 170688 whereas international motorcycle shipments increased from 75984 to 95694 for the same period (see Exhibit 3).Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products exported from plants in Pennsylvania Missouri and Wisconsin were distributed in 97 countries. While international retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in 2016 increased by 2.3 per cent over 2015 this increase was offset by a 3.9 per cent decrease in U.S. retail sales in 2016 as compared to 2015. In the U.S. and international markets combined Harley-Davidson�s retail sales were down 1.6 per cent (see Exhibit 4).The new U.S. president was pushing an America First foreign policy agenda and the company was experiencing lacklustre quarterly results including decreases in revenue (down 14.28 per cent) net income (down 25.58 per cent) and earnings per share (down 22.08 per cent) compared with the same period in 2016. Harley-Davidson�s CEO needed to address a pressing dilemma: to expand internationally or not. It was decision time.Exhibit 1: HARLEY-DAVIDSON INC.

(Niantic) learned of the phenomenal reception of his company’s newest augmented-reality mobile game Pokémon GO he must have been pleased. Not only had the game far surpassed internal company projections it had quickly become the best-selling mobile game of all time. Nevertheless Hanke was forced to deal with cheating applications (apps) and websites that told players where to find rare Pokémon allowed their mobile phones to appear to be in different locations around the world and let them immediately advance to higher levels in the game. It became Hanke’s mission to shut down these third-party developers so that the game could continue to develop according to his vision.In late August 2016 Niantic announced that it was shutting down the cheat sites because they were overloading the company’s servers and giving some players unfair advantages. “We continue to work to ensure the integrity of the game and the health of our servers by blocking unauthorized access and at times by banning offending accounts” Hanke wrote on the official Pokémon GO blog. “This includes blocking bots and data scraping operations and banning end-user accounts associated with those activities.”Many players were outraged by the changes and flooded the App Store with enough one-star reviews to bring Pokémon GO’s overall rating down to two stars. The backlash intensified when Niantic removed its own “steps away” feature which told players how far away Pokémon were. The combined effect was that players were left in the dark particularly in rural areas where Pokémon were few and distant. Without maps to guide players to remote locations players quickly tired of the game’s repetitive mechanics.Some of the game’s most ardent players worried that the game was getting worse instead of better. Meanwhile Pokémon GO’s popularity began to drop almost as fast as it had risen causing some observers to speculate that the game would be gone before the end of the year.BackgroundNiantic Labs: A Google CompanyIn 2011 Google Maps veteran John Hanke was asked to lead a new “ubiquitous computing” division within Google Inc. (Google) called Niantic Labs. “At the time that we started Niantic wearable computing was really just kind of coming onto the scene” Hanke explained. “So we were thinking about what is the post cell phone world going to look like what kinds of devices are people going to use [and] what kind of services would be enabled by these new kinds of hardware?” However at its core Niantic was about advertising. “There’s tremendous opportunity there for businesses that might want to change the behaviour of people to get them to go places they wouldn’t normally go to.”The first product launched by Niantic was a mobile app called Field Trip. Users of the app could walk around in the real world and view information about landmarks near them including photographs historical details and hours of operation. Content was supplemented by more than 300 partners such as museums tourist information centres and tour-guide services. Field Trip also launched on Google Glass a heads-up display mounted on futuristic-looking reading glasses.Augmented RealityAugmented Reality (AR) displayed artificial images on top of reality while virtual reality (VR) involved creating an entirely artificial reality. AR devices were either head-mounted hand-held or spatial. Head-mounted and hand-held AR was achieved through “see-through” technologies such as glasses (e.g. Google Glass) or a camera lens (e.g. smartphones) that combined optical inputs with electronic inputs.Google Glass was an early attempt to commercialize AR and it “exploded with the kind of fuss and pageantry usually reserved for an Apple iSomething” noted the New York Times. “From its unveiling in 2012 it was considered the Gadget yearned after by everyone from nerds and chief executives to chefs and fashionistas. It was the must-have toy that was going to set the gold standard for a new class of wearable computers.”Only it wasn’t. At the time what seemed like the perfect step toward AR was excoriated by tech reviewers for its abysmal battery life software bugs and invasion of privacy. Its $1500 price tag also meant that only a wealthy few could acquire the high-tech toy. “You can’t always predict these things” said Hanke. “Maybe that’s the trend lesson. The fundamental trend may be valid but you know there are going to be fits and starts along the way and maybe that was one of them.”Although a commercial failure Google Glass found new followers long after it was discontinued. Boeing aircraft technicians used it to help access critical data while their hands were occupied with assembly and medical doctors used Google Glass to connect specialists in remote locations to assist with operations or diagnostics. Dr. Peter Chai of the University of Massachusetts Medical School observed that “Consumers weren’t ready for Google Glass but the medical community has given it a second life.” As commercial interest continued to grow Google announced plans for an “Enterprise Edition” popularly referred to as Google Glass 2.0.In 2016 Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) launched a $3000 “mixed reality” headset known as HoloLens. Initially slated to be a consumer device similar to Google Glass it received most of its initial interest from commercial customers. “We totally underestimated the commercial interest in this thing” admitted Chris Capossela Microsoft’s chief marketing officer. Commercial customers included building supply retailer Lowe’s Companies Inc. Case Western Reserve University the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Saab Automobile AB and the Volvo Group (Volvo). Among the applications under development (see Exhibit 1) was HoloTour an “immersive combination of 360-degree video spatial sound and holographic scenery [that] lets you feel like you’re really there.” The technology allowed companies such as Skanska AB a real estate developer to create “the world’s first holographic real estate leasing center.” Microsoft also partnered with Volvo to improve the customer buying experience by encouraging customers to “explore the ins and outs of their potential purchase changing features colors and other options” without having to leave the showroom.Ingress: The Birth of Augmented-Reality GamingHanke’s idea for AR games was born of the frustration of seeing his children glued to television and game consoles instead of playing outside. Yet he knew that videogames were compelling “because games are the things that got me into programming and I didn’t want to take that away.” He elaborated: Why can’t you build a gaming experience that takes place outside—that uses mobile phones or mobile technology? So we put our heads together and we worked on prototypes. I hired some people from Sony from Disney from Electronic Arts and we started thinking about Can we build a game that takes place in the real world? We actually built paper prototypes tried various combinations of rules and explored ideas. That ultimately turned into this game called Ingress.Launched in 2013 when Niantic was still part of Google Ingress was an augmented-reality location-based game that overlaid a fictional world on the real world using a combination of mapping and mobile camera data. Ingress was never intended to reach a mass market but was designed as a platform for augmented-reality gaming upon which Niantic could build other games. Hanke explained:We wanted to create something that was more targeted at gamers because we felt like we could make something that as early adopters they would appreciate and use even if it wasn’t perfect even if the technology wasn’t perfect. . . .We build it around data some of which came from Field Trip. So historical markers and public art are the places that are the key points of interest that you interact with in Ingress and in Pokémon GO. These things are all kind of built on one another.Ingress players were members of one of two factions that sought to capture “portals” corresponding to real-life locations such as monuments stores and landmarks using data from the Field Trip app. Although Ingress could be played alone the social part of the game proved to be its greatest attraction. “Collaboration and strategy planning . . . ended up being the core of the game” explained Hanke.Ingress proved far more popular than anyone at Niantic expected eventually surpassing 13 million players. Many extolled the health benefits of outdoor gaming a key feature that the development team had not considered. Ingress could be played while walking mountain climbing cycling or running. One 82-year-old woman walked more than 1000 kilometres playing the game. In online forums players shared weight-loss testimonials and described how Ingress had renewed their interest in sports and outdoor activities.Although ensuring that company servers could handle the Internet traffic generated by the game proved more challenging than originally anticipated Niantic was able to scale up sufficiently to prevent major outages.AR gaming also created new revenue-generating opportunities. As Ingress grew in popularity advertisers began paying Niantic to have their stores turned into portals as a way to attract new customers. For instance in France the Paris-based commercial property developer Unibail-Rodamco’s shopping malls were used as portals. Soon Ingress spread across the globe winning over fans as far away as Japan where many employees of the Pokémon Company took up the game.Pokémon GOPokémon a contraction of the words “Pocket Monster” was launched in Japan in 1995 as a video game for the Nintendo Game Boy portable console. It featured the adventures of a boy who travelled the countryside collecting monsters and training them for battle against other Pokémon trainers. The game’s early success spawned a number of sequels manga (comic books) and anime (animated films).On April 1 2014 a Google Maps software engineer Tatsuo Nomura created a prank in which Pokémon would randomly appear on Google Maps. To catch Pokémon users simply clicked on them. Although the Pokémon prank was not a game in the true sense some Ingress users commented in online social forums that Google should create an AR Pokémon game similar to Ingress. These comments inspired Hanke and his team to pitch the idea of an AR game to the Pokémon Company which owned the Pokémon franchise.Hanke flew to Japan to meet with senior executives at the Pokémon Company conveniently located several floors below Google’s offices in downtown Tokyo. At the time Hanke was unaware that the CEO of the Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara was an avid Ingress fan as were numerous Pokémon Company employees and their families. When they heard that Niantic was interested in developing a Pokémon game they embraced the project even before Hanke could pitch it to them.Hanke believed that Pokémon was “uniquely well-suited” to Niantic’s AR gaming platform. “If you think about the lore or focus it’s about the trainer” he explained. “And this is depicted in the animation series and in the video game. The trainer goes out into the woods goes out into the world and searches for Pokémon.”Around the same time Niantic Labs was nearing the end of its three-year term as a semi-independent division within Google and the company needed to decide whether to spin it out or have it join another Google division such as the Android Mobile division. However because Hanke wanted Niantic’s gaming platform to be available for other mobile ecosystems such as the Apple Store he was able to convince Google that it made more sense for Niantic to be independent.Niantic Inc.In October 2015 Google spun off Niantic with $25 million in series-A funding (see Exhibit 2). Hanke brought with him 70 employees selected from a team that had once numbered more than 2000. Although Hanke had enjoyed his tenure at Google like many talented Google employees he had become disillusioned with the bureaucracy and oversight that limited his ability to innovate and create new products.A lot of it is administrative people management which is fun to some degree but when you get into HR [human resources] reviews a lot of it is just helping people with their career which I know is good but it doesn’t have a lot to do with the product innovation which was the thing that originally interested me.Although the newly independent Niantic continued to support Field Trip and Ingress its main focus was the summer 2016 launch of Pokémon GO. Nevertheless Hanke admitted that without Ingress Pokémon GO would not have been possible. “The whole infrastructure that the game runs on is the second-level technology stack that was built from Ingress.”Pokémon GO Launch DayOn an unseasonably cold July 6 morning John Hanke CEO of Niantic boarded the San Francisco Bay Ferry for his daily commute to Niantic’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Everyone on the Niantic team was excited about unveiling their newest mobile game Pokémon GO. Although they anticipated some minor glitches they felt ready for any fluctuations in demand as they dedicated their entire worldwide quota of machine time to the U.S. launch.Niantic had already launched Pokémon GO in Australia and New Zealand without problems. North America was next followed by Europe and finally Asia. “A staged country rollout [would] keep things under control” Hanke asserted. Then as the numbers for North America started rolling in the team panicked. A few hours into the launch Niantic had already used up its global machine quota. Servers became overloaded and began crashing as users complained of bugs and interruptions. If the team didn’t do something in a hurry the entire launch would be in jeopardy. Hanke frantically called Google CEO Sundar Pichai. When he couldn’t get through he sent an emergency email. “Please send reinforcements!” he wrote.Pichai directed the cloud team to dedicate more servers to Pokémon GO thereby averting disaster. “I don’t know how you plan for something as strange as the way that it took off socially” Hanke recalled. “So we just kind of played catch-up. I wish we had had everything provisioned in advance but I know that if we had it to do over again I’m not sure any one of us would have anticipated that.”Due to its long history and strong following the Niantic team knew that Pokémon GO would be more successful than Ingress. However because they “didn’t do any advertising or marketing” they expected to gradually “bring people on board to teach them about the game to market the game over the course of many months.” When Hanke was later asked why the company had not done a better job of anticipating the explosive growth of Pokémon GO he replied that “we would have sounded insane.” Back in Japan Ishihara was also caught off guard by the game’s popularity which was “100 times bigger than we expected.” Over the next few weeks Nintendo Co. Ltd. (Nintendo) which owned 32 per cent of the Pokémon Company saw its stock price more than double. Pokémon GO also bolstered sales of other Pokémon Company products such as its core video games movies and merchandise.Consumer Behaviour Fuelled by NostalgiaMillennials who grew up with the original Pokémon games were largely responsible for the massive surge in Pokémon GO players during the first few weeks after the launch accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the downloads from the Apple and Google Play stores. As a teenager New York Times reporter Mike Isaac was never swept up by the Pokémon craze of the late 1990s in the same way as many of his friends. “And yet as a 31-year-old reporter for the New York Times” he said he found himself “running wild—with thousands of others—through the streets of San Francisco.” Isaac continued:I can’t help admitting somewhat reluctantly the fun I had wandering around my city catching these goofy monsters and talking to other people about how to do it. Even though I didn’t play much as a kid Pokémon is a cultural touchstone of my youth something that stoked a sense of nostalgia—and something I suddenly became invested in.“To us millennials the early days of videogames and the internet are nostalgic” noted Spanish-American actress Nathalia Ramos. However she also placed importance on the sense of community with other players:For the first time in over decade and a half I found myself in a park running around like a child catching Pokémon and making new friends. For that hour my parent’s voices reminding me of the dangerous world we live in disappeared. I forgot I wasn’t supposed to talk to strangers or hang out in public places after dark. In that moment I could feel that I was a part of something special. It was the first time in my adult life that I felt a true sense of community. I felt connected to my neighbors and my neighborhood. Our generation has Facebook friends on every continent yet we have never met our next-door neighbors.Psychologist Clay Routledge believed that the social and nostalgic aspects of the game connected people through “shared memories” of an earlier period in their lives. However nostalgia and social interaction alone could not explain the explosive growth of Pokémon GO. In fact Pokémon GO was just one of many nostalgia-based product launches in 2016; others included superhero films cereal mascots and flip phones.According to Oxford Internet Institute psychologist Andrew Przybylski Pokémon GO was successful because it created new experiences that combined the elements of the original game series with a unique mobile-based social experience. It meant that players could not only reward themselves with more Pokémon but also share those experiences on their favourite social media sites. Snapchat Instagram Facebook and Flickr became inundated with screen-captures and photographs of players standing next to Pokémon Pokémon in unusual locations and tips on where to find rare Pokémon. “The modern era has trained people for playing Pokémon GO” observed Przybylski.On the other hand many advanced players preferred to disable augmented reality which made it more difficult to capture Pokémon. One gaming site had this suggestion: Do yourself a favor and tap the button at the top right of the screen the next time you enter a capture sequence.Doing so replaces the background with a generic woodland environment which not only makes everything clearer but it also forces the creature to remain focused in the center of the screen instead of flitting about.The Business ModelIn its first two weeks Pokémon GO generated more than $250 million in revenue primarily through in-app payments for items such as Pokéballs and lures. The game also set a record as the fastest to surpass $500 million in revenue reaching the milestone in only 60 days compared with Candy Crush Saga’s 200 days and more than 400 days for other popular mobile games such as Puzzle & Dragons and Clash of Clans. Clash of Clans by Finnish game developer Supercell had been one of the most successful mobile games to date earning nearly $1 billion on $2.3 billion in revenues in 2015. It was also one of the few games that experienced steady year-over-year growth posting revenues of $101 million in 2012 $892 million in 2013 and $1.5 billion in 2014. Other mobile games were more ephemeral often declining as fast as they had risen. “For games on average it takes just two months for the app’s monthly users to decline to 50 per cent of their lifetime peak” observed Craig Palli chief strategy officer of Fiksu a mobile app marketing company:One of the most popular games over the last two years Candy Crush reduced its 2014 forecast after reporting lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue.This caused some unwarranted hand-wringing in the press about the future of mobile games.While it may be newsworthy for a juggernaut like Candy Crush to see falling revenues it’s actually nothing new.Niantic hoped that continually improving the game and adding new features would make Pokémon GO as enduring as Ingress or Clash of Clans. To fund that growth Niantic created different types of revenue streams but relied primarily on in-game purchases.Players acquired virtual goods using the game’s own virtual currency known as Poké Coins. These could be earned by completing various in-game actions such as defending a gym from other players or they could be purchased. Defending a gym earned a player 10 Poké Coins. Alternatively players could purchase Poké Coins at a value of one coin per U.S. cent. Players who spent $5.00 or more received bonus coins with larger bonuses for larger purchases (see Exhibit 3). At Pokémon GO’s peak in mid to late July 2016 downloads of the game reached an estimated 27 million per day with revenue topping out at $16 million per day (see Exhibit 4). On average revenue for mobile games was approximately 10 cents per day per user while more popular games such as Candy Crush Saga generated as much as 23 cents per day per user. Niantic believed that Pokémon GO’s per-user revenue was low compared with that of other popular games but with the number of users expected to pass 1 billion by the end of the year the company focused more on volume. “We don’t turn the knobs up on the in-app purchase in the way that some products do” Hanke explained. “We’re trying to be more user friendly I guess in that sense. But it monetizes well.”In Japan Niantic partnered with McDonald’s to create important game sites as a way to supplement revenues and rely less on in-app purchases. Hanke noted: My belief is that the sponsored-location model is a better business model for games.The idea with real world games was to build an advertising model that is deeply tied to the way the game itself works . . . so it doesn’t break the flow of the game. It doesn’t feel like something is grafted on. That’s what we’re trying to do and it will provide a complement to in-app purchase. In-app purchase will be the majority of the revenue but it does take some of the pressure off of us to squeeze hard on the purchase side which would be detrimental to the game.Despite the clear benefits of sponsored locations Niantic was reluctant to enter into business partnerships particularly if it involved in-game advertisements or commercial logos overlaid on game maps. “We don’t want to have too many commercial locations in the game because the original spirit of it was get out and discover these interesting [things]. . . . If there is one thing we learned from Google it is to go light on [the advertising].”Estimating costs for mobile game hosting often proved difficult as it depended on factors that were hard to predict such as the amount of time users spent in the game resource utilization and so on. Andrew Boring a systems engineer with cloud-hosting company SwiftStack estimated that game hosting could cost between 5 cents and 25 cents per user per month. However he also noted that “many users won’t use all their allotment so you can under provision and oversubscribe as part of your model if you plan for rapid capacity changes. You’ll also receive discounts as your usage increases so you achieve per unit cost savings as your usage increases.” At the same time Pokémon GO’s heavy use of geolocation and mapping meant that its server utilization costs were likely to be more expensive than those of many mobile games.The explosive growth of Pokémon GO also proved problematic as distracted drivers caused crashes and landmarks were overrun with players. After crowds gathered in the Holocaust Museum in Washington the museum director pleaded to have it excluded from the game. Niantic was also criticized for having Pokémon in churches cemeteries and memorials. By using the geographic data from Field Trip and Ingress to create Pokéstops and Pokémon gyms the company had inadvertently drawn crowds to sacred and hallowed sites. Within the first few months after the game’s launch Niantic faced numerous lawsuits claiming damages for injuries and trespass although legal experts did not expect them to have a major impact on the company’s earnings.Building on the Ingress PlatformAt its launch Pokémon GO was at best a “minimum viable product.” Nevertheless Niantic had no desire to create an AR version of the original Nintendo console game. Instead it originally planned to emulate and replicate the key features and gameplay mechanics of Ingress. Hanke explained: It will change and evolve quite substantially over the next few years. If you want to predict the future you can look at the past. A lot of what we’re doing with Pokémon we learned through three years of hard work with Ingress: building up that community around the world maturing that technology. . . . The group gameplay and the events for Ingress are really the lifeblood of that game. You can expect to see things like that in Pokémon GO. This type of game lends itself well to people coming together for big events that are part competitive part social part just a big party. They’re a ton of fun. They solidify the user base.For instance one of the first Ingress features planned for Pokémon GO was linking distant teams together. “To be successful you have to be part of a team” explained Hanke. “You have to work with people locally and you have to know players in other cities and then that expands globally. So in Europe people in Germany and Russia and the U.K. and Italy are all cooperating together.”Ingress also had regional events where players gathered in the tens of thousands to compete in teams participate in activities purchase merchandise and interact with developers and other fans (see Exhibit 5). Niantic planned to replicate these types of events for Pokémon GO with Pokémon walks in major cities. “It’s a great way to retain your players over time and keep them interested in the game.”ChinaIshihara hoped to grow the user based by expanding into mainland China. However the game relied on Google Maps and Google Services to function and both were unavailable in China. Although some computer-savvy users found ways to bypass what was known as the “Great Firewall of China” Niantic still needed to supply essential geographic data.Meanwhile at least one Chinese clone of Pokémon GO had already appeared. City Spirits Go was launched in China in March 2016 while Pokémon GO was still undergoing beta-testing in Japan. City Spirits Go was not an AR game in the true sense; instead it displayed creatures on a three-dimensional-map image. However in other ways the game was nearly identical to Pokémon GO. And similar to Niantic the Quanzhou Fujian–based developer supported itself by offering in-game purchases that ranged in price from a few cents to nearly $100. Although its revenues were unknown City Spirits Go quickly rose to the top of the mobile gaming charts in China.New FeaturesOne of the first accessories for Pokémon GO was a $30 watch-like device that vibrated or lit up when players were near Pokémon. Players simply tapped the device known as Pokémon GO Plus to capture nearby Pokémon. Niantic also planned to introduce smartwatch integration so that players would not need to constantly stare at their phones. Over the longer term the company hoped to introduce glasses with a heads-up display. However unlike Google Glass Niantic’s AR glasses would be inexpensive and unobtrusive. Such a device could be paired with Pokémon GO Ingress or any other AR game supported by the company. Hanke hoped AR glasses would eventually supplant virtual reality (VR) glasses:It is the direction that I think is far more interesting and promising for technology and really for humanity than VR for example because you know in a VR situation you’re isolating yourself from everything around you and entering this completely virtual space. [AR glasses are] designed to enhance the things you do as a human being: being outside socializing with other people shopping playing having fun. AR can make all those things better and I think when we eventually get there the technology is significantly more challenging than VR because of the need to register reality. . . . And I think the opportunity there is a really big one not only for gaming but it will be the next big transformative step in technology.The success of Pokémon GO brought AR gaming to mainstream audiences including game developers. As more independent developers pitched ideas to Niantic Hanke envisioned an ecosystem of AR games built around Niantic’s gaming platform:We will be working closely with these people because the technology is something that we probably know better than anyone else on the server side in terms of how to make it work. But games are an interesting thing; you can’t corner the market on creativity. So there are a lot of great ideas out there and great teams out there; our goal is to enable them with our unique real-world technology and the data but to really let other people with great vision drive those projects forward and add to what we’ve done: not to just copy the mechanics of Ingress or Pokémon GO but to take that even further and add new elements to it. . . . I think that there’s a lot of room for this genre of games to continue to grow.Many Pokémon GO players complained that the game bore little resemblance to the original Nintendo console game. At the very least they wanted to be able to trade between players and engage in battles with other players and “wild” Pokémon. “Battling is a category that we do best at Pokémon” Ishihara observed. However “it’s important to really carefully consider any feature that may increase the difficulty and raise the barrier to entry for more casual users.”Combatting the CheatsShortly after the gamed launched online social forums began to discuss ways to circumvent its rules. A Reddit group called Silph Road discussed hidden attributes of various Pokémon so that players could determine which creatures were the strongest and most valuable. It also detailed requirements for advancing as a trainer and provided other details about the inner workings of the game many of which players could use to advance more quickly.Members of another Reddit group were able to access raw game data that allowed them to publish detailed maps of the locations of various Pokémon. This initially required some familiarity with computer code but more user-friendly instructions gradually began to appear. Players who were frustrated by the lack of rare Pokémon in their locations could use the map cheats to locate desired Pokémon. However using the software was a violation of the game’s terms of service so players who did so risked being banned from the game.By August 2016 sites like pokévision.com began publishing easy-to-use maps of Pokémon. Later that month PC World magazine published a guide to the best map cheats. Mark Hachman PC World senior editor wrote:Numerous maps are available but here are the best Pokémon GO maps. The first at pokecrew.com zeroes in on your location and begins showing what Pokémon might be nearby. And if you happen to live in the Boston area you’re in real luck: a sweet Google Map known as Gotta Catch ’Em All happens to list all the locations local players have found complete with a list of rare and ultra-rare Pokémon. A separate Google Map pegs Pokémon locations in Seattle and Tennessee. Pokemapper also provides a worldwide look at Pokémon locations but without the sophistication of other sites.The Pokémon maps encouraged taxi drivers to offer Pokémon collection rides. Pokémon GO Streetcars in Manchester England had 12 Pokémon cars that could be hired for £20 per hour. “Quite a few of our staff play Pokémon” explained Naveed Arshad director of Pokémon GO Streetcars:We had the idea that we could use it as a marketing gimmick and it’s just exploded. . . .I’ve only just started I’m on level four. . . .We’ve got specific Pokémon drivers. They’re on level 18 or 20 they know everything.[We also use] live Pokémon maps on Google that tell you where the Pokémon are.Similar services often operated by freelance drivers who were also Pokémon players appeared in other cities around the world. Molly Fitzpatrick senior editor of New York–based Fusion explained why she hired a driver to help her catch Pokémon:I hatched three eggs caught about a dozen Pokémon—a total that would be much higher if my app had worked properly or if I had been more focused on hunting than talking—and visited more Pokéstops than I could count. But the company alone was well worth the cost.This is the truth about Pokémon GO: It’s not about finding Pokémon. It’s about finding other people. The game is better played in a group than as an individual—in part because you can share the attractive powers of lures and pool information about recent Pokémon sightings but primarily because it’s simply more fun that way.In August 2016 Niantic announced that it was banning all third-party access to its mapping data. Niantic’s chief marketing officer Mike Quigley believed that there was no other option. “They were just crushing us on the server side” he said.I won’t say it’s a no-win situation but it’s a tough balance. You’ve got to keep fans happy but you also have to keep the core product accessible.Some of the server outages back in July were a punch in stomach. For us for fans for The Pokémon Company too—it’s not a good signal for their brand. We’re very close to them and we have to do right by the brand by our players and Niantic. That’s why we had to make some of those hard decisions like blocking third-party sites. It’s difficult but ultimately it’s the right thing to do for the life of the product.Many players quit the game because they eventually became bored with the repetitive nature of collecting Pokémon in the wild. Moreover without maps showing nearby Pokémon users became frustrated with the randomness of the game. “This is likely to alienate players especially if done with little explanation” observed Mark Humphery-Jenner of the University of New South Wales:Some commentators have branded the game “broken.”In Pokémon GO’s case the feature in question was “Pokémon tracking.” A core aspect of the game is that it creates a virtual representation of the player’s real-world location which is then populated with Pokémon characters for players to collect by walking around. But to catch Pokémon players need to know where they are—and without Pokémon tracking players are left wandering aimlessly and relying on luck to find them.Despite the growing chorus of discontent Niantic was intractable. No matter how many times Hanke was asked the question “When are you going to include battles?” the answer was always the same. “It’s something that will probably make its way onto our road map.”Shortly after blocking third-party mapping sites Niantic announced that it was also banning rooted or jailbroken phones in order to prevent GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing a technique that allowed players to virtually teleport themselves anywhere in the world to catch rare Pokémon and gain other advantages. Many players complained that Niantic was punishing players who had legitimate reasons for rooting their phones. One study estimated that more than a quarter of Android users rooted their phones mostly for legitimate purposes such as installing backup software; improving battery life by removing unneeded preinstalled apps; and gaining early access to software and security updates.Despite Niantic’s efforts new cheating software appeared on an almost daily basis (see Exhibit 6). PokeGOD for instance could play the game virtually allowing players to catch Pokémon without leaving their homes. Some players complained that Niantic was not doing enough to crack down on cheaters. Fad or Phenomenon?Prior to the launch of Pokémon GO the term “Pokémon” was already a more popular search term in Google than any mobile games had been at the height of their popularity. When the game was launched that popularity surged to unprecedented levels only to decline at an almost equally steep rate (see Exhibit 7). In response some observers proclaimed the rapid demise of the game. One was New Zealand sociologist Robert Bartholomew who exclaimed “Mark my words; if the history of fads and crazes is anything to go by Pokémon GO will not last long. While 2016 may turn out to be the American Summer of Pokémon GO it will likely be gone by the year’s end.” He predict that the game was not only “fading fast” but would soon “go the way of Flappy Bird Fruit Ninja and Candy Crush.”Technology columnist Phil Owen was even blunter in his assessment of the game. “There was never any question that the popularity of ‘Pokémon GO’ would fade pretty quickly” he asserted “because it requires too much of a time investment for casual players to keep at it for long. The real question instead was whether it would be able to sustain a substantial core base of users over a long period.”However even if the direst predictions were to prove accurate Bartholomew believed the new genre that Niantic had created would have staying power long beyond Pokémon: “Pokémon GO will likely go down in history as the game that started the new augmented-reality movement on a global scale in the same way that Pong and Pac-Man ushered in new eras in video games.”Meanwhile even as downloads continued to decline revenues stabilized at a respectable $2 million per day in September. At the same time the Niantic team breathed a collective sigh of relief. After an exhausting summer they welcomed the respite and the opportunity to be “a little more thoughtful about the next set of features.”For Hanke Pokémon GO and Ingress were part of a greater mission to enlighten the world about the benefits of AR and AR games. The Niantic team believed that unlike traditional games such as Angry Birds FarmVille and Candy Crush which enjoyed massive surges in popularity only to die out months or years later Ingress and Pokémon GO would be around for many years. As Ingress reached its four-year anniversary for instance it was more popular than ever. Hanke believed this difference came down to one factor: the human need to socialize. In his view playing AR games was less like playing traditional video games and more like playing league sports. Baseball or bowling for example drew people together not only to compete with each other but also to socialize.CONCLUSIONAs the wish list for new features continued to grow Niantic’s complement of 70 programmers staff and engineers found themselves barely able to support the existing game features. Much of their time was spent blocking cheat sites fixing bugs and planning events. Until they could hire additional staff they needed to prioritize new features. They also wondered what to do about the cheat sites that took a heavy toll on the company’s servers when they accessed maps and data but were popular with players who found the game’s rules and limitations to be repetitive and boring. “These superfans are tired of doing battle with Niantic itself when they argue that they’re just trying to help make the game experience better” explained author and tech journalist Paul Tassi:But the fact remains . . . that the game still does not have an effective tracking system now three months after launch. . . . Many regions [of the world] have never experienced Pokémon GO with a fully working tracker which is a shame because there was no better experience in the game than being able to hunt for a specific rare Pokémon in the wild that showed up on your radar. But with the old broken system and the new one which only works half the time that experience is hard to replicate.Others were frustrated that Pokémon GO lacked many of the most popular features in the original Nintendo console games. United Kingdom–based technology journalist Rob Price admitted that he was initially obsessed by the game. But as a millennial who grew up with Pokémon he lamented the lack of features from the original games. “Aside from outward appearances the app has few of the elements that made the original ‘Pokémon’ games such smash hits” he complained:You can’t trade Pokémon with other players. You can’t battle other players (you’re forced to leave your Pokémon in “gyms” where they are controlled by the computer in battles). You can’t even battle wild Pokémon before you catch them; you’re forced to just throw Pokéball after Pokéball and pray.As Niantic faced a growing chorus of discontent it considered its options. Pokémon GO could continue to evolve in the pattern of Ingress with teams and live events or Niantic could abandon its plan and create an entirely new gaming experience that focused on features such as battles and trading found in the original Pokémon games.Should Niantic expand to meet the anticipated demand of AR gaming or should it partner with third-party developers including “cheat” developers who were popular with players but had violated the company’s terms of service? Some of those developers had earned significant revenue from their “services” while Niantic incurred most of the costs.Finally what options should Niantic explore in its efforts to find ways to fund its unanticipated growth: additional funding rounds more in-app purchases and advertising and/or additional commercial location partnerships with companies such as McDonald’s Japan?Exhibit 1: Microsoft HoloLens “Mixed Reality” ApplicationsActiongram BetaActiongram delivers an eclectic mix of holograms that enables new forms of storytelling.

Meakin was reviewing the financial statements for 2016 as compared with 2015 for Meakin Industrial Ag Corp. (Meakin Industrial) and Meakin Farms Inc. (Meakin Farms). While both organizations remained viable he wondered what he should do for 2017 and beyond given the unique structure of the businesses and the vast uncertainty of the agricultural industry. Should he remain at the 2016 farm size of 3200 seeded acres (1295 hectares) or go back up to approximately 4000 acres (1620 hectares) as he had farmed in 2015? What should he do with the trucking businessâexpand contract or maintain the current levels of business? Could he expand both operations or would he need to have a contraction in one to enable an expansion in the other? What were the risks and benefits of the changing business environment and how would they influence his decision? MEAKIN ENTERPRISES: COMPANY HISTORYAs a child Meakin had spent many days with his grandparents on the family farm near Langham Saskatchewan. Like many children when Meakin graduated from high school he was encouraged to attend university and develop a career away from the farm. He followed this advice and earned an engineering degree in 1998 and went to work for a farm implement manufacturer in Regina Saskatchewan some 300 kilometres away from the family farm.Although Meakin had a successful and fulfilling career as an engineer farming remained his passion. By 2004 when Meakin had chosen to return to Langham to embark on a career in farming the family farm had already been sold as land prices had been favourable and no successor had been identified. Meakin was left with the unenviable task of starting a farming operation from scratch. In 2005 Meakin started his farming operation Meakin Farms by purchasing one quarter section (160 acres or 65 hectares) of land from his grandmother and supplementing the owned acreage with rented land. Through the years Meakin gradually bought more land and rented additional land to increase the land base. The farm size peaked in 2015 at 3840 acres (1554 hectares). While growing the farm Meakin employed a true entrepreneurial approach and used his professional engineering skills to be of service to other farmers in equipment modifications servicing repairs and grain hauling. In this way he gained farming skills while creating income and cash flow to expand his own farming operation. This farm service income led to the creation of Meakin Industrial which grew into a trucking operation for the hauling of grain bins grain seed and fertilizer with annual revenues of more than CA$250000 by 2016. THE Agriculture IndustryThe Supply Chain: Sourcing InputsThe size and structure of the agriculture industry had seen significant change in recent decades: the total number of Saskatchewan farms had decreased from 63431 in 1986 to 36952 in 2011 and a further decrease was evident. The average farm size had grown substantially from 1036 acres (419 hectares) in 1986 to 1668 acres (675 hectares) in 2011 with many active farming operations managing 5000 acres (2023 hectares) or more. The thousands of Saskatchewan farmers typically purchased their crop inputs such as seed fertilizer and chemicals from numerous independent retailers across the province. Large multinational agrochemical and biotechnology companies such as Monsanto Bayer Inc. Syngenta Canada Inc. DuPont BASF SE and Dow AgroSciences LLC supplied many of these inputs to the retailers. Farmers were free to choose their retailer of choice and to seek a low-cost provider but price differences between retailers were negligible and many sought to create relationships with their local retailer in an effort not only to reduce transport distances but also more importantly to gain access to new products application methods and farming techniques. As with the farms themselves much of the production and retailing of agricultural inputs had been consolidated. For example many of the input retailers had other regionally affiliated stores and the large inland grain terminals that historically handled grain were increasingly adding input sales to their product and service mix. Furthermore fertilizer and fuel markets two crucial inputs had seen vast price variability in recent years given the changing microeconomic factors. As a result of this supply chain the farmer had become very much a price-taker with many of the crop inputs having volatile prices. The prices of the crop inputs supplied to the farmer varied due to not only the changing commodity prices of the inputs but also crop selection. Of the main inputs of seed fertilizer and chemicals the highest input cost was most often fertilizer. In crop selection the farmer faced difficult investment decisions; for example while canola traditionally realized a higher selling price than wheat the required seed fertilizer and chemicals costs were also greater for canola.From Field to PlateThe marketing of commodities was a vital skill not often associated with farming. Farmers aimed to be low-cost producers but also needed to maximize their profitability in commodity sales where prices were largely determined by global supply and demand. Many modern farmers were skilled in marketing commodities as crops such as canola peas and lentils had been traded in an open market system for decades. The marketing of wheat and barley however had recently changed with the dismantling of the Canadian Wheat Board marketing agency in 2012 which paved the way for a free market system that allowed farmers to capitalize on market opportunities but also exposed them to risks. Many farmers argued that the Canadian Wheat Boardâs monopolistic system had limited sales and subsequent price opportunities while others felt that the pooling system had offered the best returns for their commodities. Farmers often attempted to reduce production risks and âlock inâ prices by forward contracting a specified amount of crop at a minimum quality level and specified price. These contracts could be made using intermediary brokerage agents or directly with distribution processors and terminals. In practice forward contracting was a useful risk management tool but if discrepancies arose the agreements could be difficult for individual farmers to enforce with larger processors. Determining the grade of commodities was not an exact science particularly given the volume of product handled by both farmers and processors. Farmers were always seeking to produce and market the highest-grade commodities possible to capitalize on their price potential while processing and distribution intermediaries were trying to realistically assess the grades. Disagreements existed. Fluctuations in production both locally and internationally led to a wide variation in the price per bushel of crops produced (see Exhibit 1).As was the case with the production and marketing of all commodities differentiation of the final product was difficult. Farmers regularly sought means to make their products more appealing to processing intermediaries and final consumers alike. Some means of differentiation included attaining premium-grade quality crops or producing new crops and crop varieties that had characteristics desired by consumers. The organic movement which had resonated with end-consumers in recent years could yield price premiums for producers but much misinformation persisted and many farmers questioned the profitability and land use of organic production. Upon completion of harvest farmers delivered their commodities to several inland terminals and processors. Some farmer-owned co-operatives and independent intermediaries existed particularly in the processing of pulse crops such as peas and lentils but much of the processing capacity was also held by a few large multinational agriculture corporations such as Cargill Inc. and Viterra Inc. many of which also supplied the inputs and agronomy services used by farmers. The iconic image of the small-town prairie grain elevator had all but disappeared to make way for more modern and efficient grain terminals. These large terminals were strategically located in the province to reduce the rail infrastructure needed to move the commodities to shipping ports in Vancouver Churchill Thunder Bay and the St. Lawrence River. The consolidation of the inland terminals meant that more grain was transported from country farms to terminals via roadways with truck and trailer. The rail system was an oligopoly dominated by the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway and the scheduling of grain cars could be problematic resulting in the terminals becoming filled to capacity and forcing farmers to invest in grain storage while also straining their cash flow.The final market for commodities varied from year to year and new markets were emerging. While some of the canola was used locally in crushing plants to create canola oil and meal Canada exported approximately 90 per cent of the canola produced nationwide. Key canola markets included the United States Mexico and the European Union for biodiesel development and China and Japan for edible oil. Peas were generally used for human consumption in regions such as India Bangladesh and China. Wheat was Canadaâs most significant grain export to some major import markets in the Western Hemisphere (United States Mexico Colombia and Peru) Europe Asia (Indonesia China and Bangladesh) and Africa (Nigeria). Weather and PestsA number of exogenous variables influenced agriculture but perhaps none was more impactful than weather conditions. Producers needed to regularly contend with weather-related factors such as excessive rain or drought damaging winds hail and extremes in temperature (heat and frost). Farmers attempted to mitigate weather risks through insurance crop rotation production contracts and plant varieties but uncertainty persisted. Furthermore some scientists and interest groups were concerned that weather conditions were becoming unpredictable given the influence of global climate change. In addition to weather variables farmers needed to regularly monitor and control yield-robbing pest pressures in the form of weeds disease fungi and insects. Modern producers had long relied on herbicides and pesticides as effective means to control these pests. The use of herbicides had increased in recent years as farmers adopted a âzero-tillâ approach in an effort to capitalize on valuable soil moisture and nutrients that traditional tillage methods released into the atmosphere. Modern herbicides were much more effective in controlling pests and led to fewer health and safety concerns; still some interest groups were concerned about herbicidesâ long-term ecological impacts. The impact of weather and pests resulted in variations in production yields (see Exhibit 2).The Increasing Value of Farm LandOne of the greatest challenges affecting the viability of modern farms was the immense capital expenditure necessary to maintain an appropriate land base to contend with the ever-growing size of competing farms. Land prices had increased significantly in the past decade (see Exhibit 3). Although high land prices were a welcome sight for retiring farmers looking to sell their land the prices were prohibitive for those looking to start or expand. Land prices varied significantly from province to province and from region to region within each province. Numerous factors influenced land prices including farmersâ crop income and cash position the health of the land as a result of historical farming practices the landâs proneness to drought or flooding tree coverage oil or natural gas wells on the property proximity to urban centres foreign investment and competitive pressures from expanding farms. Farm Credit Canada noted that numerous profitable growing seasons and limited available land as a result of expanding farms and family succession had resulted in high demand for land. Purchase prices varied from as low as $1000 per acre ($405 per hectare) to well over $2500 per acre ($1012 per hectare) given some of the aforementioned influences. Lease rates were similarly volatile and varied with rates as low as $40 per acre ($16 per hectare) to upwards of $100 per acre ($40 per hectare) in certain regions. The âlease versus buyâ debate was a common discussion among farmers. Purchasing land enabled the upside potential of capital appreciation but required either an extensive cash investment or financing. Furthermore land prices had been rising for several years and some industry insiders wondered whether prices would begin to level out or even decline in the near future. Inclement weather or low commodity prices or both could further strain land prices at any time. Leasing land reduced some of the risks of land purchases but limited capital appreciation and determining lease rates could be challenging for both farmers and landlords. Securing leased land for periods of more than five years at a time was an uncommon practice and many farm operations had seen their leased acreage fluctuate from year to year making equipment investments difficult. When making land acquisitions the price was only one factor. Farmers also needed to assess the location and quality of the land the timing of expansion their financial situation the market situation and finally the businessâs short- and long-term goals. Skilled Labour in Short SupplyThe availability of skilled labour posed constraints for many farms. In past decades many farms were family-run operations where multiple generations would come together to bring in their own harvest and that of their neighbours. The dynamics were changing as children were often encouraged to pursue post-secondary education and many did not return to the farm. The average age of farmers in Saskatchewan had increased from 50.5 in 2001 to 54.2 in 2011. Families were getting smaller and farms were getting larger relying more on large-scale technology to replace the once historic abundance of labour. The jobs that remained were challenging to fill as they required a combination of skills that werenât always available: the agribusiness management necessary to execute a successful growing season and the technical skills of operating modern farm equipment. The seasonal nature of the business further exacerbated the problem and drove many prospective farm workers in rural areas into oil and gas jobs while farms close to the urban centres always contended with the draw of city opportunities. Even the grandparents and retired neighbours that were once relied on as seasonal help were less relevant as a labour pool given the complex nature of modern farm equipment. Operating a modern combine was more akin to flying an aircraft than driving a car. Many farm owners also maintained off-farm occupations to help alleviate the ever-present risk of a crop failure and cash flow concerns. The Crisis of Cash FlowA significant risk for a farming operation was managing cash flows. While most businesses had working capital requirements for inventory and receivables the working capital typically turned into cash inflows in a matter of a few months. In farming the lead times from the cash outflows such as crop inputs the interest and principal on the financing of land and machinery fuel wages and insurance preceded the cash inflows from crop sales by many months and sometimes by more than a year. As almost all of the farmâs cash outflows were expended before the crop was harvested and ultimately sold the economic effects of a crop failure were particularly acute. While other businesses could potentially avoid variable expenses if the revenue did not materialize farmers had already incurred all of their fixed and variable expenses before any revenue was realized. Thus any reduction in revenue due to crop failure or low commodity prices directly affected the operating earnings of the farm operation with little or no reduction of expenses. The Trucking Industry Bin HaulingThe demand for on-site grain bins had increased in the past decade as a result of the growing size of farm operations and the distance of the farms to grain terminals. Grain bins varied in length and diameter; the larger bins were up to 32 feet (9.8 metres) long and had a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). Bin delivery required the use of a pilot truck (the largest bins require two pilot trucks) to precede the truck that was hauling the bin to warn of the large load approaching on the highway. Bin hauling required specialized trailers that enabled the large round grain storage bins to be delivered to a farm fully assembled (see Exhibit 4). The trailers utilized a hydraulic lift system to transport the grain bins in a horizontal position. Once at their delivered destination the trailers were able to place the bins in a specific location in a vertical position. The hauling of bins required permits from the Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries obtaining permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck.The peak period for bin hauling occurred from August to October which coincided with the harvest period and the increased need for grain storage.Grain Seed and Fertilizer HaulingGrain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the grain terminals. As the distance of the farms to grain terminals increased larger trailers were utilized to haul grain. Grain and fertilizer could be delivered using a âSuper B Trainâ trailer that could haul a payload of up to 46.5 tons (42.2 tonnes or approximately 1700 bushels of wheat) depending on road conditions (see Exhibit 5). Fertilizer was particularly corrosive to trailers and could increase both depreciation and the costs associated with maintaining safety for insurance. Some trucking companies maintained special trailers to haul corrosive fertilizer or used smaller grain trailers to access farmyards and gravel roads when spring season weight restrictions were in effect.Chemical HaulingHauling chemicals and other goods required a flat-deck trailer which was the least complex and least expensive of the three trailers but was very useful in a variety of applications. The driver needed to attain hazardous goods training to haul chemicals. The Impact of WeatherWeather had a profound effect on the profitability of both the farming operation and the trucking operation. The excessive rain drought winds and hail that resulted in lower crop yields could also lower the demand for grain bins and grain hauling and could make deliveries challenging. Skilled Labour Still a ConcernTo drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries a driver needed a Class 1 licence which required oral or written knowledge tests for Class 1 vehicles and a road test in a Class 1 vehicle. A pre-trip inspection known as a circle check needed to be demonstrated at the time of the road test. Drivers possessing this licence were in high demand particularly during peak delivery seasons. Drivers typically sought to own and operate their own trucks and trailers often under the umbrella of a larger established trucking company. Maintaining loyal long-standing employees was often a challenge as competitors could entice drivers away by offering higher wages. Drivers could be paid hourly or by piece rate by the tonnage hauled while some farm employees received a salary and operated a truck and trailer as part of their farming duties. One of the challenges in the hauling business was employing drivers over a cyclical year where demand fluctuated from season to season and even from month to month. The scheduling of deliveries could also be complicated as trucking companies sought to link deliveries and make use of âback haulsâ to avoid empty miles on the road. Scheduling needs increased commensurately with deliveries. COMPANY OPERATIONSFarming OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Farms for the three-year period 2014â2016 is provided in Exhibit 6.Land: Lease or Buy?Meakin was in the unique and challenging position of trying to start a farm from scratch and the increasing prices were both a benefit and a curse. He was able to further leverage more financing as a result of the capital appreciation of his existing land but was limited in his ability to lease or buy more land given the high prices. The number of seeded acres farmed had fluctuated from 2014 to 2016 as Meakin Farms changed the proportion of land leased and owned (see Exhibit 7).The 2016 reduction in acreage was the result of Meakin not having renewed a lease on 800 acres (324 hectares) of land due to the high lease rate of $62 per acre ($25 per hectare). Meakin Farms had incurred rental rates ranging from $45 to $62 per acre ($18 to $25 per hectare) over the past three years. It was likely that additional farmland could be leased at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) in the near term. In 2017 the company purchased two additional quarters of previously rented land (320 acres or 130 hectares) which brought the total land owned up to 1200 acres (486 hectares).Crop ChoicesAs with most farms Meakin Farms produced a variety of cropsânamely canola wheat and field peas. The choice of one crop over another was not merely based on the highest price commodity. The farming practices for each commodity differed. For example canola which was often the highest priced commodity required more fertilizer than wheat. In addition the harvesting of canola was a two-step process of first knocking down the crop into swaths and then picking up the crop with a combine; thus requiring two passes in the field incurring the twice the costs in equipment fuel and labour as wheat and peas which when âstraight cutâ harvested required only one pass. Field peas were beneficial to soil health by fixing nitrogen and making it more available to crops planted in subsequent years. A healthy crop rotation of seeding different crops from year to year on the same land also helped to reduce the impact of diseases weeds and pests. During the past three years Meakin Farms had shifted away from wheat and towards canola (see Exhibit 8). Equipment UtilizationMeakin Farms used older farm equipment that was stretched to the limit in farming more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) in 2015 and was underutilized in 2016 as yields were down due to hail damage on 640 acres (259 hectares) of land. If the farm size were to return to more than 3800 acres (1538 hectares) it would likely need a further investment of $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment. Human Resources: Daved Meakin as a Key to Success The availability of farm labour could be problematic. The need for the farm labour was seasonal yet the responsibilities of the labour when operating complex equipment were great. Like most farm operations Meakin relied on both seasonal farm labour and family. For example Meakinâs spouse Nicole a chartered professional accountant who had an off-farm career often pitched in to operate the combines during the peak harvest season. In addition Meakinâs management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. Unfortunately the busy bin-hauling component of the trucking operation often coincided with the harvest season of the farm. Meakin was clearly pivotal to the success of the business because of his time relationships and expertise which drove the organization. Farming was also one of Saskatchewanâs most hazardous industries with an average of 13 people killed each year and many others injured. In the unfortunate event of his injury or death the company operations would most certainly fail. As with many busy managers and entrepreneurs Meakin also wanted balance his obligations of work and life with his personal interests and family being key priorities. Financing with Long-Term DebtFarmland and equipment were financed with long-term debt. As a farming operation that did not benefit from a land-base inheritance Meakin Farms was highly leveraged with 75 per cent of the land and equipment financed. In addition the costs of crop inputs for seed fertilizer and chemicals which ranged between $110 and $130 per acre ($45 and $53 per hectare) needed to be financed until the resulting crop was harvested and sold. The costs of fuel wages insurance and repairs ranging from $25â$35 per acre ($10â$14 per hectare) along with the long-term debt servicing also required cash outflow before the crop was sold. This situation resulted in high levels of operating lines of credit and bank indebtedness.The Trucking OperationThe statement of earnings for Meakin Industrial for the three-year period 2014â2016 is provided in Exhibit 9.Types of Hauling Bin Hauling: The trucking operation Meakin Industrial began in 2013. The genesis of this business was to primarily service the delivery needs of two large industrial bin manufacturers for Central Saskatchewan. The bin manufacturers typically outsourced the delivery of grain bins to private operators such as Meakin Industrial. The grain bins varied in length and diameter with Meakin Industrialâs current equipment able to transport bins up to 32 feet (10 metres) long and with a diameter of 20 feet (6 metres). In 2014 Meakin Industrial had contracts with two large bin manufacturers which resulted in revenues of more than $150000. In 2015 Meakin Industrial lost one of the contracts with a major bin manufacturer to a competitor that undercut the delivery charges. The bin hauling remained strong in 2015 albeit only for one of two bin manufacturers due to a need for on-farm grain storage because of a backlog of rail car grain deliveries. In 2016 the demand for bin hauling declined due to some hail damage in the area during the 2016 growing season.Grain Hauling: Grain hauling was a service provided to other farmers for the delivery of their grain to the inland processing terminals. Meakin Industrial provided this service to 10â15 farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. When one of the contracts for grain bins was not renewed in 2015 Meakin set out to expand the grain-hauling portion of the business. Meakin Farms was also able to reduce its own grain delivery costs by utilizing the services and equipment of Meakin Industrial.Seed Fertilizer and Chemical Hauling: During the spring seeding season Meakin Industrial was busy hauling seed fertilizer and chemicals to farmers within a 100-kilometre radius of Meakin Farms. A unique flatbed trailer was needed to haul chemicals and the driver needed to have attained hazardous goods training.Human Resources: Time in Short SupplyAs a result of the seasonality of the hauling business Meakin Industrial faced similar challenges to the farming operation in terms of the availability of skilled employees. As noted earlier to drive large trucks for the different types of deliveries required a Class 1 licence. In addition drivers who hauled chemicals required hazardous goods training. Also two drivers (three for the larger bins) were needed for each delivery to accommodate both the pilot truck and the delivery truck for bin hauling.Meakinâs management time was split between working on the farm and operating the trucking operation. The hauling of bins required permits from the provincial Ministry of Highways and the larger bins also required coordination with the provincial power company to lift power lines that crossed the highway. As a result a great deal of management time was needed in coordinating deliveries securing permits and arranging for the lifting of power lines. Financing with More DebtThe cost of financing equipment for the trucking operation was relatively high with interest rates usually at 8 per cent. All of the trucks were owned and financed with bank debt while most of the trailers were leased on five-year terms.Word-of-Mouth MarketingMarketing for Meakin Industrial was mainly done through word of mouth. The contracts with bin manufacturers were secured through direct marketing by personal contact from Meakin. All trucks were marked as âMeakin Industrial Agâ to facilitate name recognition when the trucks were delivering products on the highways. THE FUTUREIn January 2017 Meakin Farms purchased an additional 320 acres (130 hectares) of farm land that it had previously rented for $260000; 75 per cent of the cost was financed at a mortgage rate of 4 per cent. As Meakin contemplated his future plans he received a letter notifying him of the opportunity to lease an additional 960 acres (389 hectares) of government-owned farmland at $55 per acre ($22 per hectare) which coincided with the rate he was currently paying for other rented land. Just as he began to prepare projections for an expanded farm size he received a text message from the large industrial bin manufacturer that had previously opted for another contractor in 2015. It was dissatisfied with the service from Meakinâs competitor and wanted him to handle the contract moving forward and offered a 5 per cent price increase for his services. Meakinâs excitement for the new opportunities was short-lived when he recalled that in 2016 he had been overloaded with management responsibilities. The demands on his time and the need for hired labour which was difficult to find were at a maximum. In addition the farmâs poor financial results in 2016 as a result of hail damage and the additional financing of the 2017 land purchase would leave little financing capacity to expand his farming and trucking equipment.Meakin quickly realized that the constraints of management time labour and financing would result in some difficult choices. He could choose one of following three options for 2017:Option 1: Maintain the current levels of business. Keep the farm size at 3200 acres (1295 hectares) (substituting the 320 additional owned acres [130 hectares] for rented acres) and keep the trucking business the same size thereby forgoing both the land lease and the bin-hauling opportunities.Option 2: Expand the farm to 4160 acres (1684 hectares) and reduce the trucking business. Meakin did not have the management time and needed labour resources to both increase the farm size and maintain the trucking operation. Given the similarity in peak seasons the bin hauling would need to be eliminated if Meakin were to expand the farm. He would need to invest $100000 in seeding and harvesting equipment to expand the farm size of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing bin-hauling trailers for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needed for the farm expansion.Option 3: Reduce the farm to 2240 acres (907 hectares) and expand the trucking business. Due to the constraints of management time and labour resources Meakin could not both increase the trucking operation and maintain the farm size. He would need to invest $100000 in bin-hauling trailers and pilot trucks to service the new bin-hauling contract of which he could finance 50 per cent at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Meakin would be able to sell the existing seeding and harvesting equipment for $50000 to pay for the remainder of the funds needs for the trucking expansion.EXHIBIT 1: CANOLA WHEAT AND FIELD PEAS CROP PRICES 2014â2016 (in Canadian DOLLARS PER BUSHEL)Note: 1 bushel = 35 litres; 1 tonne of canola = 44.092 bushels 1 tonne of wheat = 36.744 bushels and 1 tonne of peas = 36.744 bushelsSource: Created by the authors using Government of Saskatchewan âSaskatchewan Cash Pricesâ accessed September 20 2016 www.agr.gov.sk.ca/apps/markettrends/.

GROWTH IN AFRICAAfrica’s middle-class population tripled from fewer than 5 million in 2000 to 15 million in 2014 which contributed to an increase in disposable income. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was 5 per cent for 2013 compared with a 6 per cent growth rate in East and West Africa showing a promising economic outlook. The number of Internet users in Africa had grown by 3600 per cent from 2000 to 2012 and the penetration of mobile phones in Africa increased from 1 per cent in 2000 to 54 per cent in 2014.THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN AFRICAThe African airline industry was highly regulated by the government and companies needed to follow the rules and regulations set by their home country. In addition when airlines wanted to fly internationally they needed to adhere to the rules laid out in a bilateral air services agreement which specified additional regulations that were unique to each pair of countries.Since 2010 air transportation passenger traffic had grown at an average annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent and was projected to continue to grow at this rate until 2030. This growth rate was slightly higher than the world’s average annual growth rate of 4.8 per cent revealing a significant level of consumer demand. Africa’s international traffic had grown rapidly and the continent was predicted to be the world’s third fastest-growing region in terms of international traffic by 2015. The expansion of the airline industry had contributed to the development of new market opportunities for local African entrepreneurs and businesses. It was predicted that from 2012 to 2032 879000 new jobs would be created throughout the airline industry value chain for the African population.Despite increasing demand the African airline industry still faced several challenges related to infrastructure development. General problems of poor infrastructure in the airline industry were related to a lack of quality human and physical resources a low level of technological connectivity and the absence of adequate transit facilities.The high capital intensity in the airline industry contributed to a low average return on investment of 7.84 per cent. Furthermore the global airline industry median values in 2013 for profit margin return on equity current ratio and quick ratio were 3.10 9.30 1.50 and 0.90 respectively.COMPETITION Precision AirPrecision Air Services Plc (Precision Air) a standard airline company offered its customers quick comfortable and reliable service through the application of a customer-focused approach. Precision Air aimed “to develop and provide superior air transport services that exceeds customer expectations” and wanted “to be the airline of choice.” Its main hub was located in Dar es Salaam and it operated on a regional basis with flights to 10 destinations within and outside Tanzania.Recently Precision Air had been struggling financially and experiencing challenges in earning revenue because of Fastjet’s entrance into the industry. In 2013 Precision Air incurred a loss of TSh30 billion in revenue with gross margins of 18 per cent. In 2014 the company reduced its deficit by 60 per cent with a loss of TSh12 billion and had an increase in gross margins to 28 per cent.Precision Air had recently decreased its fleet size from nine to six aircraft and started suspending unprofitable flight routes. The company also began to offer additional training to staff who lacked the skills required to provide top-quality service. Precision Air also planned on forming more partnerships and joint ventures to increase revenues and improve its financial performance.FASTJET INTERNAL DISCUSSIONCompany BackgroundOn November 29 2012 Fastjet launched its first flight from Dar es Salaam Tanzania to Mwanza Tanzania after acquiring Fly540 a low-cost airline that operated in Tanzania Kenya Angola and Ghana. Two months later Winter was appointed chief executive officer and headquarters were established in London England. East Africa specifically Kenya or Tanzania was considered the best region to launch Fastjet. Tanzania was chosen due to the relatively new Fly540 operations in the country and the Tanzanian government’s welcoming and positive attitude. Kenya was deemed the riskier alternative due to Kenya Airways Ltd.’s considerable influence over the Kenyan government and the associated Civil Aviation Authority.Edward WinterWinter had begun his career as a pilot with British Airways. Subsequently he gained more than 40 years of industry experience both in standard airline services and with the low-cost carrier airline model. He was both the chief operating officer and a founding director of the low-cost airline Go which quickly became profitable with 28 aircrafts. After the sale of Go Winter became the chief operating officer of easyJet a U.K.-based low-cost carrier and successfully expanded easyJet’s operations into Europe. Winter had also served as the chief executive officer of the National Air Services in Saudi Arabia.Upon launching Fastjet Winter had two overarching goals for the company: to become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline and to make reliable and safe air travel accessible to all.The Low-Cost Carrier ModelAs a low-cost carrier Fastjet offered low ticket prices to customers by minimizing expenses. The airline achieved major operational savings by purchasing one type of aircraft used Airbus A319s which reduced spending on spare parts and maintenance. Furthermore Fastjet prepurchased currency and fuel to lower its operational expenses and outsourced engineering and airport passenger handling to provide expert services and to lower its start-up costs. The airline also followed strict hiring policies ensuring that all staff were “clever people” so that exceptional customer service was offered in a responsive manner. Fastjet also cross-trained employees to maximize the company’s investment in its workforce.Fastjet was a “no-frills” airline with a ticket that included just one seat and one piece of hand luggage. Extra charges were applied to any additional items such as food drinks and checked baggage. Despite this pricing scheme 40 per cent of passengers still paid for additional services of some variety.Ticket prices ranged from US$20 to US$170. The earlier a customer booked the cheaper the ticket. This pricing structure allowed Fastjet to maximize the number of purchased seats per flight. This low-cost strategy attracted passengers who had never considered flying to be an affordable option. Approximately 38 per cent of Fastjet passengers had never flown before. In the past they would have travelled far distances by bus or might not have travelled at all.Current PerformanceFastjet’s consistently full flights and high percentage of first-time flyers demonstrated strong market acceptance in Tanzania. In particular Fastjet developed a reputation for reliability and punctuality with cancellations at less than 1 per cent. Fastjet embraced technological trends by developing a highly successful m-commerce platform with M-pesa and Tigo and utilized social media platforms to effectively lower communication and marketing expenses. As a result Fastjet’s African Grey Parrot logo gained significant brand equity.In 2013 yield per passenger grew by 106 per cent from January to December and capacity had increased by 68 per cent. However despite positive feedback from customers Fastjet had continually reported operating losses since its inception (see Exhibit 1). Winter and his management team attributed Fastjet’s losses to its operations in Kenya Angola and Ghana. To free up cash Fastjet terminated operations in these countries on June 24 2014 and began solely focusing on Fastjet Tanzania.To fulfil his goal of having Fastjet become the most successful pan-African low-cost airline Winter wondered whether now was a good time to expand. Before analyzing his options he wanted to determine Fastjet’s financial position (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3).PROPOSED SOLUTIONSTo overcome Fastjet’s recent expansion challenges and financial losses Winter needed to decide whether to expand to Kenya develop a Fastjet base in Zambia or maintain the focus on domestic flights. When considering the options Winter would need to take into account how each option would align with Fastjet’s low-cost model and short-term goals and would position the airline company for long-term success.Option 1: Partnership in KenyaKenya was located north of Tanzania and had a population of 45 million. Kenya was known as Africa’s hub for financial communication and transportation services and had positive economic prospects with a gross domestic product of 4.7 per cent in 2013. As of 2014 1.2 million Kenyan passengers flew annually making Kenya the fifth-largest domestic market in Africa based on seat capacity. This information was promising for Fastjet which expected to increase air traffic by offering low-cost plane tickets to those who currently travelled long distances by bus.Jambojet Ltd. a subsidiary of Kenya Airways Ltd. had recently entered Kenya as a low-cost carrier and planned to focus solely on the domestic market. Winter saw this situation as an opportunity to access the Kenyan market by working with Jambojet Ltd. to offer connecting flights. Although this option meant Fastjet would not need to spend time developing the infrastructure for establishing a base Winter was concerned about the Kenyan government’s strong regulations in the airline industry and how Fastjet should respond.Option 2: Fastjet ZambiaZambia was located southwest of Tanzania and had a population of about 15 million. Compared with other African countries Zambia was economically and politically stable and imposed fewer airline regulations. Although Zambia had a smaller customer base Winter saw the country as offering a great opportunity for entering the market because it did not have a low-cost carrier. He had already been in discussions with the government which was supportive of Fastjet bringing low-cost flights to Zambia.To pursue this option Winter would need to purchase new planes. He was looking to source two A319 models between seven and nine years old which would cost US$40 million each. The Zambia hub would also require a US$5 million investment for marketing and development costs. The costs incurred during the first year would include salaries and wages of US$4.7 million and a fuel expense of US$1.5 million. Winter and his management team estimated that expanding to Zambia would bring in US$11.2 million in revenue in the first year.Expansion to Zambia would also require approval from South African authorities because South Africa was Zambia’s largest market accounting for 37 per cent of total international seat capacity. Although Winter had experience working with South Africa—during Fastjet’s launch in Tanzania—it had been a long and tedious process. He wanted this expansion to happen quickly and he feared he would encounter similar delays with Fastjet in Zambia. Winter wondered how he could leverage his existing relationships in South Africa to speed up the process. Winter was also concerned with the size of the market and whether it would offer enough demand to justify the costly investment in building a new base.Option 3: Focus on Growth in TanzaniaWinter wondered whether it was even a good time to expand to other countries. Although Fastjet had secured US$25 million from new investors he recognized that the group would ultimately need more capital from both institutional investors and local African partnerships to finance the expansions. Considering the 2013 profit margin for Fastjet Tanzania was around −90 per cent he wondered whether he should wait until Fastjet had positive returns before expanding elsewhere. Fastjet Tanzania had made great progress in gaining market share in Tanzania and Winter wanted to continue this growth. To stay ahead of its largest domestic competitor Precision Air Winter aimed to attract more first-time flyers and expand the airline’s market. This plan would include increasing the frequency of domestic flights and expanding domestic flight destinations. In addition he planned to improve domestic infrastructure by working with governments beginning with the Mtwara Airport in southwestern Tanzania. Investing back into the Tanzanian community would showcase strong corporate social responsibility and help Fastjet gain access to parts of Tanzania not currently serviced by air travel. DECISIONAfter analyzing Fastjet’s current position in the airline industry its recent financial performance and the alternatives Winter needed to determine whether he would be able to fulfil Fastjet’s goals. Was Fastjet ready for the next frontier?EXHIBIT 1: fastjet’s six-month INCOME STATEMENTs December 2013 to June 2014 (in US$ thousands)Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: fastjet SIX-MONTH BALANCE SHEETs December 2013 to June 2014 (in US$ thousands)Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: FASTJET SIX-MONTH CASH FLOW STATEMENTS (IN US$ THOUSANDS)Source: Company documents.ENDNOTES

The fish pond held a special significance for the company. The water in the pond was from the water treatment plant of the manufacturing facility and the healthy colourful fish that swam in it served as visual reminders of Asahi Kasei’s corporate philosophy which was based on corporate responsibility and the creation of shared value for all stakeholders. The plant had the distinction of being the only facility in the world to manufacture a type of cellulosic fibre called cupro. Cellulosic fibres were often used as a low-cost alternative to silk. Cupro yarn was a superior quality cellulosic fibre made using the cuprammonium process. Cupro’s unique properties distinguished it from the more common viscose rayon and made it a useful fibre for producing clothing garments especially women’s traditional Indian garments (see Exhibit 1).While Asahi Kasei had various product lines cupro fibre had a special place among them. This was due not only to cupro fibre’s long history dating back to 1931 and Asahi Kasei’s status as the world’s only producer of cupro fibre but also to its unique value chain which included several small and medium-sized enterprises in India. Kamiyama started his career in the cupro division in 1990. After a stint with another division in Taiwan during which time he acquired an executive master of business administration degree he was back as general manager of the cupro division handling the Indian market. In 2014 Asahi Kasei expanded the capacity of its cupro plant in view of the market potential in India. However in 2015 the entry of finer variants of viscose rayon increased the competitive pressure in the market. During 2016 one of Kamiyama’s important goals was to address this challenge but he would not stop there. He also had to help the company achieve its goal of building an even more inclusive value chain in India. He wondered if the two goals were indeed compatible.Asahi KaseiAsahi Kasei a diversified company was established in Japan in 1922 by Shitagau Noguchi. The manufacture of cupro yarn was one of its earliest lines of activity. Since then the company continued to grow and diversify and in 2015 it had a total turnover of US$17.2 billion from operations in fibres and textiles chemicals electronics home and construction materials pharmaceuticals and medical devices.Asahi Kasei set up a corporate social responsibility (CSR) department in 2006 though it had been pursuing many CSR-like activities since 1976. The company was guided by its mission of “contributing to life and living for people around the world” and several CSR activities were embedded into the business practice. The four broad CSR areas were compliance responsible care (including environmental protection and safety) corporate citizenship and respect for employee individuality. Philanthropic activities were also undertaken by its international subsidiaries in Thailand Korea Taiwan China and India.Cupro fibre was a product of Asahi Kasei’s fibres and textiles strategic business unit (SBU). The unit’s other products were non-woven fabric spandex fibre and nylon yarn for automotive applications. Of the SBU’s total sales of $1.3 billion in 2016 cupro accounted for approximately 20 per cent. Cupro Fabric Production Value ChainThe technology to manufacture cupro fibre was originally developed in Germany in 1897 and was imported by Asahi Kasei in 1928. The fibre was used to manufacture unusually soft moisture-absorbent textile that was comfortable to wear throughout the year.The reason why Asahi Kasei was the only manufacturer of cupro in the world was because the manufacturing process resulted in waste water that contained copper. All of the other plants around the world had eventually discontinued operations due to their inability to meet environmental regulations. Asahi Kasei however had invested heavily in research and development and developed a process to reduce the copper content to only half of the level permitted by the stringent regulations in Japan. Thus it could continue cupro production (see Exhibit 2). In fact there was currently a research project in progress to further reduce the copper content of the waste water. Though the copper content was already at half of the permitted levels Asahi Kasei continued to develop processing technologies to bring it down to one-tenth of the permitted level with the ultimate goal of producing zero emissions.The main raw material in the production of cupro was cotton linter which was imported primarily from India North America and South America. Cotton linter was the short soft fibre surrounding cotton seeds. The process of extracting linter called “delinting” involved thoroughly cleaning cotton seeds and then separating the fibre from the seed. The linter was processed chemically to produce yarn with properties distinct from those of cotton. Ninety per cent of the yarn produced was filament yarn and the balance was staple yarn. One-third of the yarn was sold domestically in Japan; another third was sold in the Indian market; and the rest was sold in Europe China and other countries. In some markets the yarn was dyed and then woven; in other markets the yarn was first woven and dyed later. After weaving and dyeing the fabric was sold in wholesale markets or to large manufacturers of ready-made clothes. In some very small-volume businesses a third method called “piece dyeing” was used in which garments were sewn and then dyed.Cupro partnerships in India Asahi Kasei began selling cupro yarn in India in 1976 when the government of India allowed its import under the Open General License even though a burden of 100-per-cent import tax existed at that time. Its first sale of cupro yarn of 100 metric tons (MT) was made to a weaving unit in Surat an important textile centre in the state of Gujarat. An engineer from Japan had to subsequently visit Surat to guide the weavers on handling the delicate yarn. Even in 2016 98 per cent of the yarn exported to India was sold to weavers in Surat. These weavers sold the grey fabric to local fabric wholesalers and distributors who in turn sent the fabric to dyeing factories (see Exhibit 3). The wholesalers then sold the dyed rolls of cloth made from cupro yarn to designers and apparel companies to make traditional Indian clothes for women such as saris and dupattas (a kind of scarf worn as part of the Punjabi salwar kameez outfit). In 2016 the president of the fibres and textiles SBU Toshio Takanashi used the phrase “40 years of miracles” to describe Asahi Kasei’s long relationship with weavers in Surat. The partnership had continued despite challenges such as the Indian foreign exchange crisis in 1991.Asahi Kasei’s technical knowledge transfer to its Indian partners was an ongoing activity. Even in 2016 for instance some dyers faced problems with dyeing quality. When Asahi Kasei explored the prospect of selling to another important textile centre Varanasi in northern India some weavers faced problems such as yarn breakage. Asahi Kasei decided to send its technicians from Japan to help resolve the issues faced by the weavers and dyers.In 2012 the company’s partnerships in India were expanded to include a contract with a cotton ginning unit in Maharashtra for the regular supply of raw material—cotton linter. Previously the unit had only processed cotton and extracted oil from cotton seeds. The supply of cotton linter resulted in additional revenue which in 2015 accounted for 10 per cent of Asahi Kasei’s $18-million turnover. Asahi Kasei provided the unit with delinting machines worth $5 million in return for an exclusive bi-monthly supply of cotton linter. Initially the quality of cotton linter supplied by the unit in Maharashtra was very poor and did not meet the requirements of the Japanese factory. Engineers from Japan worked closely with the unit so that it could progressively reduce the level of contamination in the cotton linter and deliver better quality.Asahi Kasei officials regularly visited retailers to understand the latest fashion trends which ultimately determined the demand for different types of yarn. Realizing the need to make fashion designers in India aware of cupro and its unique features Asahi Kasei started collaborating with the National Institute of Design Ahmedabad and the National Institute of Fashion Technology Mumbai. By conducting lectures and seminars Asahi Kasei officials educated upcoming designers and apparel producers about how cupro fabric could add value to the garments they designed. The company also sponsored two students to visit Japan and intern at Asahi Kasei’s cupro plant.As a yarn manufacturer Asahi Kasei focused not only on the next stage in the value chain namely weaving but also on the entire value chain; it was aware that to build demand for cupro it needed to develop awareness in the entire ecosystem. This strategy led to increased sales of cupro fibre in the Indian market and increased India’s importance as a market relative to other countries (see Exhibits 4 and 5).Inclusive Value ChainWhile Asahi Kasei’s initial foray into India was motivated solely by market expansion considerations over time as India began to play an important role at both ends of the value chain the company also started considering the development implications of its activities in the country directly and indirectly. Besides contributing to child labour eradication efforts in India and ensuring that the cotton farmers were paid fair prices for corron linter. Asahi Kasei started focusing on making its value chain in India as inclusive as possible (see Exhibit 6). The company had already had some achievements in this regard. Since cotton linter was obtained from a part of the cotton plant that was previously thrown away Asahi Kasei’s fair-price purchases of cotton linter provided a welcome boost to local farmers’ incomes. By 2015 approximately 270000 farmers had benefited from this initiative and it was estimated that by 2020 approximately 390000 farmers would indirectly benefit. By bringing in experts in modern delinting weaving and dyeing technologies the company helped train factory employees to use these technologies and techniques. Asahi Kasei also provided training and internships to students studying textiles and design thus contributing to improving skill levels among the youth in India. By the end of 2015 it had partnered with 60 weaving and three dyeing factories and achieved sales of 4300 MT. By 2020 Asahi Kasei aimed to sell 6000 MT to 80 weaving and 10 dyeing units.In 2016 Asahi Kasei joined the “Business Call to Action” a global initiative promoted by the United Nations Development Programme and various donor governments and development agencies. The initiative challenged companies to advance core business activities inclusive of poor populations and to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Asahi Kasei committed to enhance the skills and productivity of 5240 employees in the cupro fibre industry to invest $40000 in developing the capacity of 700 young people (75 per cent women) between 2016 and 2020 and to increase the production efficiency of 97 small- and medium-scale delinting weaving and dyeing units.Outlook for cupro in IndiaIn June 2014 Asahi Kasei invested approximately $29 million in a new cupro production facility which increased its total capacity by 1000 MT (to 16000 MT). This capacity expansion was said to be the first new fibre production facility in 27 years in Japan. Further expansion of capacity to 18000 MT by 2018 was in progress. These investments were made in view of the Indian market potential as the domestic market was shrinking.While sales of cupro to India had been growing since 2010 in 2015 the product started to face intense price competition from viscose rayon fibre a fibre of a similar genre. In the past viscose rayon manufactured in India had been much more coarse than cupro. Now however it was available in finer variants which competed with it more directly. Cupro fibre offered advantages in terms of the drape of the fabric and being more suitable for embroidery and other embellishments. The manufacture of cupro was also considered better than the manufacture of viscose fibre in terms of the safety of workers and the impact on the environment due to its use of ammonia rather than carbon disulphide. However viscose rayon was 20 per cent cheaper and in a highly price-conscious market like India price was a significant factor. In addition the retail customer who bought fabric made with cupro yarn often did not know that it contained cupro because it was not always disclosed on the tag. Moreover customers were usually unaware of the unique qualities and environmental advantages of cupro compared to viscose rayon.Some segments of the ready-made market such as the designer segment were relatively price inelastic and were more likely to appreciate the superior nature of the cupro fabric. Asahi Kasei began discussions with leading Indian designers working with labels such as Anita Dongre to supply them with cupro fabric. Some designers responded positively but others were concerned that parts of the fabric value chain such as the dyeing units were not producing consistent quality. This was because dyeing was done in small dyeing houses that lacked adequate quality control; also these units found dyeing cupro fabric to be especially challenging compared to other kinds of fabric.Next StepsKamiyama considered various courses of action that could be implemented to help address the quality issues arising in the fabric dyeing process. He also pondered how to increase awareness about cupro among retail customers. Only if awareness was created about cupro could the company tap into growing niche markets in India such as segments that were highly quality-conscious or that were very concerned about the environment. But merely creating product awareness would not be sufficient; at retail outlets customers wanting to buy the fabric should be able to easily identify it. As Kamiyama wandered away from the Koi pond he thought about how to increase the sales of cupro in India.Exhibit 1: Cupro fibreCupro fibre was roughly three times more expensive than cotton yarn as the cloth woven from it had several features that made it unique:Cupro fabric had a soft and smooth surface.Its moisture absorption was better than other synthetic fibres even cotton.Various properties helped moderate the temperature inside the garment making the fabric comfortable to wear year-round.The manufacture of cupro fibre offered some advantages from an environmental perspective:Cupro was made by processing cotton linter a waste product obtained from cotton seeds before they were crushed for oil extraction.Production facilities were certified to meet both ISO 14001 and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements. ISO 14001 referred to a general set of standards regarding environmental management. Oeko-Tex Standard 100 was an environmental standard specific to the textile industry.Fibre was biodegradable.Uses of cupro:Cupro fabric was used for a lining material by premium European brands such as Gucci and Canali and for making innerwear by leading brands such as Uniqlo Wacoal and Gunze. It was also used to make socks sportswear and leggings.Cupro fabric was used selectively by leading brands such as Prada and Burberry for some garment designs. In India it was used for making traditional garments such as saris and dupattas.In Japan it was used to make fillings for cushions and futons. Staple yarn was used in the manufacture of quilts.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Asahi Kasei Cupro Plant at Nobeoka JapanSource: Photo taken by the authors with company’s permission.Exhibit 3: Weaving and Dyeing Units at Surat and Varanasi IndiaSource: Photos taken by the authors with company’s permission.EXHIBIT 4: CuPRO NET SALES TO INDIA (IN metric TONnes)Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.Exhibit 5: Sales Volume of cupro yarn by country (in METRIC tonneS)Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.Exhibit 6: Asahi Kasei’s plans to build an inclusive cupro value chain in IndiaSource: Company documents.

Dobbie was excited to begin this next stage in his career but he continued to formulate plans hoping to guarantee that the company he had founded would have many successful summers in its future. SKIMBOARDINGSimilar to surfing skimboarding involved using a board which could be made of a variety of materials to glide across the water�s surface. Skimboards differed slightly in design from surfboards as they were more rounded in shape and did not have underside fins. Despite the smaller design of the boards skimboarders could still perform impressive tricks such as spins flips and jumps.Skimboarding had begun in the 1920s in Laguna Beach California when lifeguards skimmed over the seashore on planks of wood. The sport grew in popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s when professional competitions began emerging. Skimboarding gained further media exposure in the 1980s and 1990s including being on the cover of Sports Illustrated the development of Skim Magazine and early websites such as SkimOnline. Skimboarding was divided into two main categories: ocean skimboarding and flatland skimboarding. Flatland skimboarding was developed after ocean skimboarding had been well established. Rather than skimming on the open ocean flatland skimboarding focused on skimming across pools of shallow water often created by receding tides such as those found in White Rock British Columbia (BC). WRS primarily focused on flatland skimboarding; however as the tides came in ocean skimboarding could also occasionally be performed.Skimboarding�s popularity remained consistent within coastal communities. Competitions and championships were held around the world and were often sponsored by global and local skimboard manufacturers. WHITE ROCK SKIMBOARDINGWhite Rock British ColumbiaThe city of White Rock was located in Surrey BC and was part of the the greater metropolitan Vancouver area. It was named after the distinctive white boulder that was located on the famous White Rock Beach. The rock which appeared white in colour due to the amount of bird excretions dropped onto it was so recognizable that it was originally used as a beacon by nineteenth-century sailors. It remained white through monthly applications of white paint by municipal workers and was still the most prominent landmark on the beach. Many local businesses including WRS still used it as a reference point when providing directions to visitors. White Rock boasted a population of 19952 and was especially busy in the summer when it was a popular destination for both out-of-province tourists and BC locals. The median age of the population was 53.8 years older in comparison to the median age of the rest of the province at 41.9. Dobbie observed how the city�s demographics changed in the summer months as younger family members of the more mature population flooded in for extended visits. White Rock hosted several arts and cultural events throughout the summer and was known as a common shooting location for films. Company HistoryAn avid skimboarder for much of his life and a White Rock local Dobbie launched White Rock Skimboarding in 2014 when he was just 18 years old (see Exhibit 1). Dobbie had noticed that whenever he and his friends went skimboarding at White Rock Beach multiple children would continually crowd around with interest and attentively watch the skilled skimboarders skim and practice tricks. With the intent of converting this captivated audience into paying customers Dobbie attained the necessary permits and licences to open a business and by the summer of 2014 WRS was enjoying its first season of operations. While attending Western University Dobbie returned to White Rock each summer to ensure the smooth operations of his company. This steadfastness resulted in considerable growth for the company. The business�s popularity was such that day camp sessions regularly sold out and campers returned over the course of several weeks and seasons. Even as he entered Ivey Business School and began adding to his business experience by working in several industries Dobbie always ensured that he made time to return to White Rock for most of the skimboarding season. To efficiently run WRS�s growing operations Dobbie employed a large number of seasonal staff who were well trained in all aspects of the business. Dobbie used WRS as an opportunity to provide fulfilling employment to some of his close friends and family members as well as members of the BC skimboarding community. Staff members were both local to White Rock and from countries around the world and many had competed in international skimboarding competitions. All staff members were personally trained by Dobbie. Trainees shadowed him until Dobbie felt confident enough in their abilities and expertise to assign them to day camp sessions or lessons or to allow them to instruct customers on their own.OPERATIONSDay CampsThe core of WRS�s operations were the day camps that ran for two months out of the four-month operating season (May to August). These camps were designed for children aged seven to 14 and were run out of a WRS kiosk on White Rock Beach. An average session had room for 30 campers but within each session campers were assigned to small groups of five to nine and paired with a WRS instructor for the duration of the camp. Due to the fact that a high tide made it impossible to flatland skimboard WRS camps were at the mercy of the ocean tides and had to compensate with different tasks and instruction when skimboarding could not be performed. This included alternative programming such as beach games observing local wildlife and occasionally cancelling camps on certain days due to extreme or unforeseen circumstances.Camps were held in July and August of each year. In 2017 13 sessions of camp were offered with five- four- and three-day camps being held over various weeks (see Exhibit 2). Regardless of how many days a camp ran each day consisted of three hours at tide-dependent times. Dobbie felt that the pricing was affordable for parents seeking a quality experience for their kids. Campers were required to bring their own skimboard though WRS did make rentals available for campers who did not own their own boards. Private LessonsIn addition to camps WRS also offered private lessons for smaller groups of one to three people. Unlike in group camps board rentals were included in the fee for private lessons and lessons were offered from May through August�two months longer than standard camps. Private lessons were priced at $110 per hour for a group of three $80 per hour for two individuals and $45 per hour for one person. Lessons accounted for 7 per cent of WRS�s revenue in 2017. While private lessons were not a main source of income they provided healthy margins and supplemented revenue especially in the slower months of operations. Dobbie also noticed a pattern of less confident and shyer children taking private lessons prior to enrolling in WRS day camps. Skimboard RentalsAll WRS campers were required to either own or rent a skimboard to participate in any camp. Those who elected to rent boards for their camp sessions were charged an additional $5 per day above camp costs (e.g. a skimboard rental for a five-day camp would be an additional $25). This was far below the typical rental price as Dobbie felt strongly that not owning a skimboard should not be a barrier for children to participate in WRS camps. While most campers came with their own boards Dobbie observed that if campers used the rental option for their first session they would often have purchased a skimboard by the next session they attended. WRS also offered skimboard rentals and sales to the public. Dobbie charged $7 per hour for skimboard rentals and only offered rentals to the public when WRS employees were already present on the beach running camps and giving lessons. Dobbie did not think it made financial sense to offer rentals outside camp operating hours. Board rentals were 1.4 per cent of WRS�s revenue in 2017 and had not seen any growth in recent years. Dobbie wondered if this service should be expanded to stimulate growth or instead discontinued as part of WRS�s offerings.Merchandise SalesWRS began selling skimboards in 2015�once Dobbie realized the company had been missing a significant opportunity to make further revenue from its existing customers. Board sales were a small but growing segment of the business and Dobbie liked the idea of WRS campers using boards sold by his business. Dobbie did significant research to determine the best-value and highest-performance skimboards from various brands and decided that his target market would be best served by stocking the basic Channel One skimboard. Dobbie discovered that the best sourcing for the boards was to buy in bulk from WRS�s main competitor Kayotics Skimboards (Kayotics) who was the main seller of the same boards. He was aware of the downsides associated with buying from his direct competitor but he felt it was the best option for his current situation as no other supplier could compare to the prices he was able to procure from Kayotics. WRS charged $60 per board (the same as Kayotics) incurring a $40 variable cost on each board. Recently Dobbie had noticed that Kayotics had raised its consumer prices to $70 per Channel One board and he questioned if he should do the same. He did not expect this increase would affect the price he paid to Kayotics for the boards. In addition to skimboards Dobbie also sold WRS-logoed T-shirts. Dobbie first began offering them in order to sell off extra unneeded staff uniforms but quickly realized that kids and parents alike would often purchase shirts as a souvenir of both skimboarding with WRS and the city of White Rock. While the shirts were not a major source of revenue Dobbie enjoyed the exposure they gave WRS and saw no disadvantages to continuing to sell them along with boards. MARKETINGWRS relied extensively on word-of-mouth advertising and was established as a reputable brand in the community. It enjoyed significant free media coverage and was featured in several local and national outlets such as The Peace Arch News Shaw TV and Kid Approved BC. WRS also maintained active Facebook and Instagram pages which allowed for further engagement with customers and the community.In 2017 WRS also established a partnership with the White Rock Sea Festival an annual celebration established in 1949 and held on the first weekend in August on White Rock Beach. WRS offered skimboarding prizes and ran free events for festival attendees over the course of the festival. This partnership provided additional exposure of WRS to people who may never have previously heard of the company or the sport.CONSUMERSChildrenWhile WRS camps currently catered to children aged seven to 14 private lessons rentals and sales were open to all age groups. Still the vast majority of WRS�s non-camp consumers fell within this age range. It was common for a single WRS consumer to be a client in multiple WRS revenue streams. Dobbie was hesitant to change the age range for camps as he felt seven was the minimum age a child could be physically and mentally mature enough to gain value from the experience while children generally outgrew summer day camps by age 15. Dobbie felt customers were most influenced by seeing skimboarding in action and found that a large portion of campers stumbled upon WRS while spending time on the beach. The openness and public nature of the beach occasionally resulted in onlookers attempting to join in and participate in camp activities often not realizing these were for paying customers. These situations were typically resolved by a WRS staff member speaking to parents and explaining that a private camp was in progress. Dobbie wondered if there was a way to capitalize on the piqued interest of these potential campers.Parents and GuardiansIn addition to the campers themselves Dobbie believed that parents and guardians were also their own consumer segment as they paid the fees for WRS activities on behalf of their children. Dobbie knew that he needed to represent WRS as a professional safe and fun environment in order to convince parents and guardians that such a camp was suitable for their children. Dobbie felt that WRS did a good job at this portrayal considering its past successes and the company�s professional website and secure payment system. However he still wondered if there was anything further he should be doing or anything he could be doing differently to maximize the appeal to this consumer group. THE COMPETITIONKayoticsWRS�s most direct competitor was Kayotics Skimboards a Vancouver-based skimboarding company founded in 2001. Kayotics was established by local skimboarders and branded itself as a �skimboarding lifestyle� company. In addition to the Channel One boards Dobbie bought from Kayotics the company also sold its own Kayotics-branded boards. These boards were of higher quality than the Channel One boards and retailed for $100 to $200. Kayotics promoted these boards as a step up from beginner boards and used them to sponsor several skimboarding athletes in global competitions. Additionally Kayotics operated competing skimboarding camps and private lessons in White Rock Centennial Park (Tsawwassen) and Spanish Banks (Vancouver). Kayotics camps were slightly more expensive than WRS camps offering a five-day camp for $150. Dobbie did not feel that Kayotics White Rock Beach camps were preventing WRS�s success as Dobbie�s business had no problem filling all camps it offered each year. Kayotics also did not offer rental boards for its camps and instead maintained the policy that all campers needed to bring their own board to camp. Summer CampsWRS also competed with various other summer and day camps locally and in the Greater Vancouver Area. With over 200 camps to choose from it sometimes proved difficult for WRS to convince potential campers and parents of why WRS�s was the best available. Dobbie questioned the advantages and disadvantages of his three-hour camp style and wondered how the company could best move forward in the competitive landscape.Other CompetitorsFinally the city of White Rock and surrounding area was full of various activities that children and families could choose to fill their summer days with. Sports leagues summer school programs and vacation destinations were just some of the non-camp alternatives that could be chosen by potential campers and their families. POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVESWhile Dobbie knew that demand for WRS would continue to be stable the following summer he thought about several options for WRS�s continued future growth.Status Quo Dobbie was content with WRS�s performance and was happy to continue operations without any major changes. He remarked from his past financials that the company had consistently earned profitable financial results especially given the limited four-month season (see Exhibits 3 4 5 and 6). Dobbie was nonetheless concerned about the logistics of maintaining operations given that he would be starting a new career in Toronto beginning in September and was not sure if he could effectively run the company remotely. Dobbie believed that if he decided to continue WRS as it was revenue proportions would continue to shift. While he planned to offer the same level and varieties of camps as the previous year Dobbie expected fewer campers to return for 2018 due to several factors such as his future absence from the business and heightened competition. As a result he predicted camp revenue to decline to $9000. Private lessons on the other hand had grown tremendously and Dobbie expected private-lesson sales to grow by at least 20 per cent the following year. For the merchandise side of his business Dobbie expected a modest growth in board rentals with growth of one five-day camp board rental for an additional camper and additional three-day camp rentals for two campers. In 2017 public board rentals totalled 18 hours for the summer. It was anticipated that this would grow by 50 per cent for the upcoming year. Dobbie expected T-shirt sales to decline to $300 in 2018 but expected to sell seven additional skimboards above what was sold in 2017.Dobbie expected business-licence expenses to remain at the same dollar value and staff wages to increase to their 2016 sales percentage. All other expenses were expected to remain at the same dollar value or the same percentage of sales.Expand into New Territory Dobbie thought about how WRS could grow if he decided to maintain the company. He felt the size and skimboarding culture in White Rock had been sufficiently established and the market sufficiently saturated. As a result he began thinking about expanding the camp business model to other beaches and communities in the area. He cited White Rock as an example of a city supporting multiple skimboarding camps and wondered if this would hold true in other areas. Locations that he considered included Centennial Park (Tsawwassen) and Spanish Banks (Vancouver)�the two other locations where Kayotics ran its camps�as well as Dundarave Beach (West Vancouver) and Crescent Beach (Surrey). Logistically he believed he could only expand to one additional location for the upcoming season but could use the success or failure as an indication of whether further expansion would be warranted. Regardless of which location he chose Dobbie felt that the upfront investment and costs would be almost identical. He expected to purchase a new ramp for $160 a table for $100 new signage for $130 and another beach kiosk for $600. Additionally Dobbie believed that he would incur another $400 in legal fees associated with the expansion as well as initial recruiting costs of $220 in order to properly hire the necessary staff needed for the expansion. Dobbie did not believe that WRS was ready for a bank loan at this time and he was prepared to use his own personal savings to fund the expansion.Dobbie felt that WRS did not have the resources to offer all services currently offered in White Rock at a potential second location; instead WRS would initially focus on day camps and private lessons. Dobbie planned to offer three five-day camps and two each of four-day and three-day camps. He expected that this would attract an average of 12 campers to each session. Additionally he believed $670 in private lessons could be generated at a new location.Unlike at White Rock Beach WRS would have to pay rent at a new location totalling $500 per month for the summer operating season. To properly establish a brand advertising would be necessary which was budgeted for $400 per year. A new location would also require new staff working in proper uniforms which was expected to total $1350 in new wage costs and 90 per cent of 2017�s uniform costs. WRS�s insurance and licence costs would rise to $900 for the year if this option was pursued but no additional website costs were expected. All other cash expenses were expected to remain at the same percentage as the White Rock Beach location.Dobbie was also concerned about managing such a major undertaking remotely and questioned whether he would need to take an extended vacation or leave his new job in order for this to be successful.Order and Sell Custom Skimboards Dobbie was also looking into the costs of manufacturing a line of White Rock Skimboarding-branded custom skimboards. He had enjoyed success selling skimboards and other branded merchandise (such as T-shirts) to campers and thought that branded custom skimboards could serve as a logical progression to increase revenue and further legitimize WRS as a strong skimboarding brand. He was considering several design ideas for a medium-sized skimboard (see Exhibit 7). This decision would come with a higher price as a custom WRS skimboard would now retail for $90. Dobbie knew that this project would need to be outsourced and had already found a firm interested in completing an initial order of 100 skimboards. The company Yuan Sports was based in China and did not have an established reputation like other North American board manufacturers. It did however send a sample board to Dobbie who personally tested it and was very pleased with its quality and performance. Yuan Sports offered to fill the order at a cost of $60 per board with another $400 in shipping costs. Dobbie was not sure of the number of boards that would actually sell in the first season and he thought about the amount of boards that would have to be ordered to merit the venture.Dobbie also believed that to effectively promote WRS boards advertising would be necessary. He felt that print pamphlets would be most effective as he could personally target his own campers and easily distribute them across White Rock. To print 1000 pamphlets per year would cost $0.35 per pamphlet with an additional yearly $50 distribution cost. Dobbie believed this alternative would have significant brand value but was unsure whether it would be financially viable especially if the boards did not sell as well as he hoped.Sell or Pass On the BusinessDobbie also considered whether it was time to end his chapter with WRS and focus on a career in business. He felt there was significant value in the company but was not sure how to assess it. Dobbie had identified several potential buyers including his friends; existing WRS employees; and his sister Adriana who had been helping with WRS�s administration for several years. Alternately he also could look to external buyers who might see value in WRS. Dobbie knew that whomever he agreed to sell the business to would have a major impact on the price. He was not interested in charging his friends or sister anything significant and preferred to pass the business on to someone with a similar vision and passion. Dobbie also thought about what would happen if no potential buyer was interested and how he could best economically wind down the business.DECISIONAs Dobbie started packing up his skimboards and other equipment to put into storage the many options circled in his head. He was optimistic for the future of WRS but knew that any decisions he made would deeply affect him his employees and the campers who returned every year.

It was 4:00 p.m. on a Tuesday which meant that it was almost time to meet with his executive leadership team. The atmosphere at the head office was always light and easy-going and playing with his dog in the office always seemed to help MacLean mull over strategic business issues. His latest struggle was fraught with opportunity and riskâhe was considering stretching ECL beyond its regional identity.In 2013 MacLean founded ECL a Nova Scotia-based apparel company that sold a range of products from T-shirts and hoodies to dog collars and baby onesies. The company had experienced exponential growth as a small business. Despite having operated for less than four years ECL had already sold more than 500000 products. Its product line was now available in 91 retailers across Canada and had been worn by many high-profile celebrities including singer Ed Sheeran Nova Scotian hockey star Sidney Crosby and members of the rap band Wu-Tang Clan. At 25 years old MacLean was now the chief executive officer of one of Canadaâs fastest-growing business ventures. He had received many accolades for his leadership including being featured as one of the âTop 30 under 30â in Marketing Magazine. For ECL to continue its substantial growth it needed a market with more space. One option was to invest heavily in extending its brand portfolio. MacLean had recently won a lengthy copyright battle over the rights to West Coast Lifestyle (WCL) a nascent sibling brand to ECL which had limited current appeal and relatively small sales volumes in British Columbia and Alberta. He had the chance to develop this brand for bicoastal collaboration or friendly competition but doing so presented the risk of brand cannibalization and identity confusion. MacLean also had the vision of making ECL a truly global brand by expanding into the United States before launching in Japan and Australia. While the U.S. Eastern Seaboard offered a massive market for lifestyle apparel and offered synergies with ECLâs current positioning the logistics of brand-building distribution taxes and tariffs and revising ECLâs organizational structure were roadblocks for getting started. Plus was it realistic to think that ECL could become an imported regional brand that locals were proud of or was ECL already too mainstream and corporate to resonate with non-Canadians? MacLean started the meeting: Lately weâve been trying to do everythingâlaunch new product lines develop West Coast Lifestyle as a separate brand and penetrate the U.S. market. Iâm not convinced that our divided attention is working because we are not seeing enough progress fast enough. Perhaps we should choose one option for growth and focus on it.After two hours of protracted debate MacLean still felt he was in the same position. He wanted to do everything but he knew that choosing one strategy for the time being was likely the right thing to do. The real question was which one strategy to pursue and more importantly how to implement it and roll it out. COMPANY BACKGROUNDIn January 2013 MacLean was a 21-year-old business student at Acadia University in Wolfville Nova Scotia a small student town with a population of less than 5000. Along with eight other students he was enrolled in a class called Venture Creation where the goal of the course was to create a business plan for an invention. MacLean who was rather pragmatic if not rebellious thought âWhy would I create a business on paper when I can start a real business?â With an $800 loan from his father and the idea that locals wanted to wear their maritime pride he created East Coast Lifestyle. He bought 30 hoodies and screened them with the phrase âEast Coast Lifestyle.â He then became active on social media platforms including Facebook Instagram and Twitter to create awareness about his start-up. He sold the hoodies on his front lawnâand sold out on the first day. He reinvested the profits to purchase 60 hoodies the following day and began allowing consumers to pre-order to facilitate inventory management. By the end of the month he had generated $3000 in revenue. At the end of the semester his professor was not overwhelmingly impressed with MacLeanâs successâit was a business plan class not a business class. MacLean decided to continue with ECL after the class had ended. 
During the summer of 2013 MacLean worked part-time at Atlantic Lottery and part-time on ECL selling about 25 hoodies a week. He hired his first employee Taylor Northey as ECLâs creative director. ECL began diversifying its products by also offering T-shirts and tank tops. By late 2013 MacLean was approaching retail chains to carry his product line. Pseudio a regional apparel retailer with 30 stores was the first store to sell the ECL brand. One store manager took 10 hoodies initially and told MacLean that if he could sell those 10 hoodies Pseudio would place them in stores across Canada. Pseudio sold out of the ECL hoodies in 30 minutes. That day MacLean learned about his consumersâ price elasticity when he realized that people were willing to pay an extra $10 in the store for the same product he was selling on his lawn. In May 2015 he graduated from Acadia University and made ECL his full-time job. THE ECL BRANDMacLean consistently talked about the distinctive character of ECL as being simple and universalâit was about being proud of where you are from. To understand East Coast pride it was important to understand some of the history of the region. Historically the major industries of the region were based on fishing agriculture forestry and coal mining. For myriad reasons including fiscal policy and investment decisions being driven by the needs of urban centres in Central Canada the region entered a period of economic malaise in the 20th century. To this date the Maritime provinces remained one of the poorest regions in Canada with lower average wages and lower property values relative to the rest of Canada. As a result Maritimers tended to be rather humble but still felt a tremendous amount of regional pride. Maclean understood these challenges as opportunities: âIâm proud of being from the East Coast where oftentimes we are the underdogs of Canada. People are often required to leave their home to find work.â With ECL people could share this identity wherever they went showing others where they came from and connecting with other people from âhome.â competitionThe ECL brand transcended traditional apparel categories being positioned as a true lifestyle brand that encapsulated surf skate and snow vibes. While lifestyle branding was unique for the region it also positioned the brand against a broad array of competitors. The competitive landscape for lifestyle apparel was diverse with varying niches marketing budgets and access to capital. Regardless the lifestyle apparel business was a lucrative one; margins on apparel goods were typically upward of 70 per cent. In Atlantic Canada ECL was the market leader in regional lifestyle apparel. Other clothing companies that sold Atlantic Canada-inspired designs such as Lost Cod New Scotland My Home and Local Legends generally operated out of one location or solely online. While these brands satisfied the needs of tourists and advocates of buying local they appeared to lack the resources distribution or brand awareness to consider scaling. In addition the positioning of these brands tended to be predominantly geography-based and not inherently tied to a specific fashion subculture. ECL designs and promotions aligned closely with premium consumers of surf skate and snow fashions. This market space was incredibly competitive and saturated occupied by many large U.S.-based apparel organizations that had substantial financial backing. For example Zumiez one of the largest retailers in surf skate and snow clothing and accessories carried more than 400 different brands from Burton and Vans to Nike and Adidas. More generally consumers could choose from countless other fashion brands outside of this space ranging from value brands (e.g. T. J. Maxx) to mid-market brands (e.g. The Gap) to luxury brands (e.g. Tom Ford). According to the 2017 report from McKinsey on âThe State of Fashionâ the global apparel industry was characterized by uncertainty change and a series of challenges that resulted from volatility in global sales based on geopolitics the proliferation of city-based strategies instead of country-based strategies a preference for discounts on fashion the emergence of new apparel categories based on casualization and active lifestyles (e.g. athleisure clothing) digital shopping and fashion e-commerce. ECL PRODUCTSECLâs product portfolio had diversified to include a broad range of apparel offerings. In February 2017 the most popular products were the hoodies ($69) T-shirts ($34) tank tops ($30) hats ($30) and toques ($30). ECL also sold a variety of eclectic accessories including baby onesies flags anchor-logoed bowties stickers duffle bags and throw pillows. The company even collaborated with a local carpenter to make an ECL gnome door. MacLean wanted to continue launching three to five new products per year. In 2017 the winter plan was to release branded socks menâs boxers womenâs tall sweaters and a new style of blankets while the summer offerings would include beach towels and water bottles. Novel products in conjunction with the virtually non-existent discounts offered on products helped rejuvenate and preserve the fresh and premium positioning of the brand.One key differentiator of ECL products was that many of the products were limited editions. With the exception of the anchor-logoed apparel (see Exhibit 1) all other lines were of a limited run. Once a limited-edition product was sold out Macleanâs policy was to never reorder or recreate the line. For example ECL had recently partnered with rapper Ghostface Killah from the rap band Wu-Tang Clan to create a limited-edition Wu-Tang hockey jersey. Only 100 jerseys were produced each with a number from 1 to 100. As a result of its predominantly limited-edition products ECL had experience in launching hundreds of logoed items. PROMOTIONSECL continued to promote its products using guerrilla marketing tactics and a very lean budget. MacLean typically relied on social media with happenstance celebrity endorsements an ambassador program and cross-promotional initiatives to communicate with prospective customers. Instrumental for ECL in communicating with its customers about new product offerings was ECLâs Instagram account which now had almost 600000 followers (see Exhibit 2). Although the products offered varied drastically from year to year MacLean relished the control of communicating the culture of the brand and was personally responsible for ECLâs social media messaging and customer feedback. ECL typically decided which products to brand based on feedback from customers on social media. Celebrity support had been perhaps the biggest driver of exposure for ECL. Although MacLean had never paid for an endorsement he used the social media platform to get gear into the hands of a broad swath of celebrities including Sidney Crosby (and other National Hockey League players) the rapper Classified and pop singer Ed Sheeran. Each celebrity âplacementâ was then actively promoted on ECLâs social media and website. For example MacLean reached out to a social connection that worked with Ed Sheeran who then provided the singer with ECL clothing to wear during his concert. After Ed Sheeran wore a branded T-shirt on stage the item with the help of a social media push sold out online.ECL concurrently ran a brand ambassador program which offered free promotional items and commission on products sold in exchange for various local promotional activities for the brand. This influencer program was initiated from a simple Instagram post looking for student brand ambassadors asking where each prospective brand ambassador was from; ECL received more than 10000 responses. Over several days MacLean and his team narrowed the list to 50 students; each had between 5000 and 150000 Instagram followers and regularly posted about ECL. The brand ambassadors also received a discount code to share with their followers which enabled ECL to track each brand ambassadorâs effectiveness. For each sale that brand ambassadors closed they received between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in discounts. ECL had also run a series of cross-promotional campaigns. In 2014 MacLean received a call from Alexander Keithâs Brewery (Keithâs) a 200-year-old brewing institution located in Halifax Nova Scotia regarding a campaign to target a more youthful demographic with a T-shirt giveaway in specially marked Keithâs bottle packs. Keithâs paid for all of the T-shirts upfront and gave ECL a royalty on each case of beer sold. MacLean went on to secure a cross-promotional deal with Captain Morgan Rum on a probationary three-year term. ECL also gave back to the local community that had supported the companyâs growth by launching special co-branded collections with Wounded Warriors and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation sponsoring local sports teams with apparel and offering gear to groups aligned with surf skate and snow. ECL recognized that to get people to buy into a regional brand the brand should do something for the region. DISTRIBUTIONECL sold its products through three primary venues: four ECL retail locations an e-commerce-enabled website and various other retailers. ECL operated a flagship retail store on the Halifax waterfront which was near the Seaport Farmersâ Market the Halifax boardwalk and the disembarkation point of cruise-ship passengers. The flagship store had a staff of four employees. ECL also sold its products at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport in a shop run by six staff members to reach travellers seeking an East Coast souvenir. ECL had recently set up a kiosk that employed four people at Dartmouthâs Mic Mac Mall Atlantic Canadaâs largest shopping mall.  ECL even used a âpop-upâ shopâa truck and trailer containing a broad array of merchandiseâthat travelled around the Maritimes with a team of four employees and sold its products at various festivals from May to November. ECLâs e-commerce platform accounted for 30 per cent of annual sales. Online customers were primarily Canadians with sales from every province. What MacLean always found interesting was that the majority of online sales were not from the Atlantic region but rather from Alberta and Ontarioâa not-so-subtle nod to the East Coasters who worked far from home. ECL used various manufacturers to satisfy customer demand and outsourced the majority of its products to fulfil bulk retailer orders. However some products maintained their Canadian roots. For example the classic hoodies were made in Toronto while many of the T-shirts were screen-printed in Halifax.  Although ECL had been expanding its own retail operations the ECL stores still comprised a small portion of the overall retail sales. ECL relied heavily on its retail partnerships to maintain the majority of its sales volume without having to deal with traditional retail management issues and costs. MacLean ensured that all products soldâwhether online or in partner-retailer locationsâwere priced identically to mitigate potential channel conflict.When ECL was first launched it stocked its product for any Canadian retailer that was interested in carrying it. However with many small retailers concurrently selling knock-off lifestyle products (e.g. âCape Breton Lifestyleâ) ECL made the strategic decision to withdraw all products from the hodgepodge of retailers and to sell through only two retailers: Pseudio (in Atlantic Canada) and Below the Belt (in Central and Western Canada) which meant that ECL had its products in 91 stores. While the Canadian retail operation followed a specific structure the three small U.S. retailersâtwo in Rhode Island and one in Floridaâreceived product only because they explicitly asked for it. All three had discovered ECL through Instagram and wanted to try out their inventory. However by October 2016 when each store received 50 more units to sell they had moved only one or two units per week and all U.S. stores still had inventory from their original shipment.THE GROWTH OPTIONSWest Coast LifestlyeFrom day one MacLean wanted to make people proud of where they were from on a worldwide scale. This insight led to the development of a sibling brand in 2014 for Canadians in British Columbia and Alberta: West Coast Lifestyle. At the time of launching the start-up MacLean could not afford to trademark both ECL and WCL so other businesses blossomed in the region with a similar name and aesthetic to ECL. MacLean had to fight trademark issues for a year and was ultimately successful with his lawsuit making him the rightful owner of WCL. In 2017 WCL was relaunched with new logos through both online and in-store locations of Below the Belt. While WCL products were now carried in 35 stores in Western and Central Canada the resources available to invest in ECL were not available for WCL. MacLean explained that to this point he worked on WCL only 10 per cent of the time. One of the primary challenges with WCL was that the same formula used by ECL had not âunlockedâ the regionâs potential. Products moved at a glacial pace relative to their Atlantic counterparts. In addition West Coasters were potentially less inclined to identify with the coast as a region. Albertans for example did not typically see themselves as being on the coast because they lived in a landlocked province. MacLean felt that WCL had tremendous potential in terms brand development. However simply using a boilerplate or standardized ECL model by substituting mountains for anchors was unlikely to do the job. Geographic ExpansionBesides brand development and new product launches MacLean grappled with geographic expansion ideas. He wanted ECL to become a global player in the lifestyle apparel category. The most logical step was the U.S. Eastern Seaboard whose population of more than 115 million dwarfed Atlantic Canadaâs population of less than 5 million. He had grand plans to eventually capture the hearts and minds of consumers in other countries that had rich surf skate and snow subcultures and were located on a seacoast including the east coasts of Japan (with a population of 10 million) and Australia (with a population of 15 million). While ECL had shipped to 55 countries to date through its online store the logistics of stocking suppliers and brand-building outside of Canada was truly foreign. At the time ECLâs U.S. presence had been built from the requests of a handful of small retailers who had ECL products that were not moving. MacLean had no overarching strategy or rollout in place for expansion. First of all it was unclear how ECL could develop a deal with an established retail partner. Professional salespeople were available who were trained to approach U.S. retail chains that had brand alignment with companies such as ECL including Zumiez PacSun and Urban Outfitters and these salespeople did not cost much upfront. However for every chain that the salesperson signed the salesperson received a rather hefty percentage (10â15 per cent) of all products that were sold through the chain. This commission was on top of the 60 per cent margin that retailers often demanded to justify carrying the product. At that point it would be very difficult for ECL to be profitable at launch considering the import taxes it would need to pay to take product into the United States. While ECL might have hit the ceiling on Atlantic Canada other domestic growth opportunities were available. For example ECL could develop its retailer presence itself opening a series of small stores and kiosk locations to earn full margins on its products. MacLean was unsure how this idea might affect his existing retail partners and was leery of investing in assets that were not the traditional strength of ECL. ECL could also make its products available to other retailers in Canadaâthe demand was certainly there. The trade-off was the cost of potentially mainstreaming the brand too much and thereby diluting the uniqueness of ECL and what it meant to offer limited-edition apparel. MacLean could also make other global decisions such as expanding the brand ambassadors network to a global scale and using a social media influencer network and online sales to sell directly to consumers without brand building. Another international option had recently presented itself. An organization in South Korea which had a rich surf skate and snow culture with coastal identification had approached ECL with the opportunity to license the brand on a one-year contract trial basis. In this scenario ECL would mitigate much of the expansion risk and cost to access a new consumer base in exchange for even lower margins and less brand control online. This option did lead MacLean to consider a hybrid of leveraging the brand ambassadors program as a franchise initiative to mitigate risk and grow quickly but he was skeptical of the implications of a novel business model. MOVING FORWARDMacLeanâs quandary came down to one question: How should ECL strategically expand? The ECL and WCL brands were trademarked and incorporated globally and both were assets with broad appeal and public relations momentum. The perspective that ECL could grow in many different directions was exciting for MacLean but also concerning given ECLâs lean organizational structure (see Exhibit 3). Because he had invested so much of his own time and resources into the business and felt that he truly understood his customers the prospect of risk and giving up control was daunting. Around his office MacLean kept free promotional items from Hurley and from Burton American West Coast companies that thrived after their expansion into Canada. MacLean wanted to reverse that trend bringing some Canada to the world in a way similar to what Herschel had done for bags and what Westbeach had done for snowboard apparel. Could an Atlantic Canadian brand resonate in a city such as Los Angeles with WCL or in Miami with ECL? Americans clearly had a sense of pride that MacLean could tap into but he wondered whether a Canadian brand could authentically fill that void.

As part of its sustainability agenda Standard Chartered had launched a community project in 2012 called Silver Lining which aimed to support elderly Singaporeans in meeting their financial and health care needs.Five years later Singapore’s social and community landscape had changed significantly and it was time to review the impact of Silver Lining. As the head of community engagement and sustainability Winnie Tan was responsible for ensuring that Standard Chartered was at the forefront of corporate giving. She sought to strengthen Standard Chartered’s outreach and effectiveness in order to balance generating growth and returns with minimizing negative effects on the environment health and safety of the local community. How could Silver Lining evolve to remain locally relevant? How could Standard Chartered rationalize the need for continual funding for community investment? STANDARD CHARTEREDStandard Chartered was part of an international banking group with more than 84000 employees and 150 years of history in the world’s most dynamic markets. The group derived the majority of its income and profits from Asia Africa and the Middle East which also represented some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Standard Chartered opened its first Singapore branch in 1859 and in October 1999 was one of the first international banks in the country to receive a qualifying full bank license.The bank offered a full suite of services for retail and small and medium-sized enterprise clients; these services included deposit taking wealth management services overdrafts personal loans credit cards auto financing and mortgages. The bank offered corporate and institutional clients services in trade finance cash management lending securities foreign exchange debt capital markets and corporate finance. The bank also provided private banking services through its private banking division. Standard Chartered’s brand promise “Here for Good” underpinned the organization’s commitment to ensuring the sustainable growth of the markets and communities in which it operated.STANDARD CHARTERED’S COMMUNITY INVESTMENT EFFORTSStandard Chartered’s purpose statement “Driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity” set the tone for the bank operations which aimed to create long-term value for its shareholders and society. The bank’s community investment strategy had two priorities: global sustainability and community investment. Global sustainability in youth health and education guided the bank’s worldwide community investment efforts. For instance its flagship charity Seeing is Believing was focused on treating or preventing avoidable blindness unlocking new opportunities and bringing economic and social benefits to communities. The Singapore office was a key fundraiser in this global initiative (see Exhibit 1). The bank’s community investment projects needed to be locally effective and relevant. This was important as the bank’s footprint covered vastly diverse communities across Asia Africa and the Middle East. The bank took on various initiatives to encourage its employees’ active engagement and contributions to local communities. For instance every Standard Chartered employee was entitled to three days of employee volunteering (EV) leave which was recorded (and therefore auditable) on the company’s human resource system. The company intranet hosted EV schedules best practices and a support network to catalyze employee-led initiatives. Top managers actively participated in all facets of the program and key project leaders in the workforce were also recognized as part of their annual reviews. This naturally led to a successful employee engagement program which enabled team bonding within and across various business and support functions. In 2016 Standard Chartered saw its employees devote 3605.5 volunteer days to support the local community—a 12-fold increase over 2007 when 290 volunteer days were recorded.Standard Chartered used a partnership model for all of its community initiatives as it recognized both its own areas of strength and those areas where it needed support from partners. As a financial institution the bank was an inherently good risk manager and governance steward. However it lacked the operational knowledge and the understanding of social and community issues at the grassroots level that were needed for community project implementation. Employee volunteering was a key tenet of the bank’s sustainability agenda; volunteers were full-time employees who applied their time experience and expertise to causes they were passionate about. Hence partnerships with the right social service organizations were critical elements of success. The bank was able to rally fundraising from key stakeholders who could support the projects.Singapore: The Local CommunitySingapore had experienced rapid growth over the past few decades developing into a city state with a high literacy rate and a good standard of living. However the rapid development and population expansion had not come without a cost. While an open foreign labour policy had initially contributed to growth in Singapore’s productivity it had also led to an increasingly competitive job market a greater strain on public resources and an inflated housing market. Furthermore due to the high cost of living couples were less willing to have children and fertility rates continued to decline despite the Singapore government’s incentives to encourage childbirth. Over the past few decades Singapore’s fertility rate had declined rapidly and stood at 1.16 births per female in 2017. The combination of a declining fertility rate and increasing average life expectancy due to advancements in health care meant that Singapore faced the pressing issue of an aging population. The proportion of Singaporeans aged 65 and above was set to increase significantly from almost half a million in 2016 to approximately 900000 people by 2030—around 20 per cent of the estimated population. By 2018 the number of Singaporeans aged 65 and above would be equal to the number of youths aged 15 and below. In addition the country’s resident old-age support ratio showed a generally decreasing trend of about 30 per cent from 7.4 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2017. A shrinking workforce and increasing costs for seniors’ health care could pose risks to Singapore’s economic development. SILVER LININGThe LaunchFollowing its incorporation in Singapore in 2012 Standard Chartered recognized the critical implications of an aging population in Singapore and shaped its community investment to focus on the theme of health specifically health for the local elderly population aged 65 and older (see Exhibit 2). The Silver Lining project comprised various fundraising and community engagement initiatives that supported elderly Singaporeans especially those living alone and with household incomes of less than SGD1500. Key initiatives under the project included improving the quality of these seniors’ lives by providing medical care daily necessities and food rations.The initial launch of Silver Lining focused on providing financial support and making health care accessible for the elderly population. However at the time of the launch not many corporations were addressing issues related to the aging population in Singapore and there was no existing approach that Standard Chartered could use as a point of reference. To ensure that the project was a success Standard Chartered partnered with organizations with relevant expertise and knowledge in order to leverage their complementary strengths. Such partnerships allowed Standard Chartered to carry out various initiatives to touch the lives of the elderly community; these included festive celebrations befriending sessions food distribution home refurbishment projects and health care support (see Exhibit 3).effects and SuccessesFrom 2012 to 2017 Standard Chartered invested over SGD1 million and involved over 5000 employee volunteers to reach out to elderly people in Singapore. By 2017 Silver Lining had touched the lives of more than 8000 seniors and Standard Chartered had received two awards (Corporate Platinum and Gold) from the social services agency Community Chest the fundraising and engagement arm of the National Council of Social Service that engaged the community through volunteer work and social service programs. Providing critical medical services medical screenings and food rations for the needy were some of the direct outreach initiatives the bank had undertaken in partnership with local voluntary welfare organizations. A participant in the Stepping Out into Active Life program at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)—someone who suffered from heart problems asthma arthritis and hypertension—commented that the program had helped her to stay fit as it ensured that she was doing her exercise every day.The employee volunteering element in Silver Lining also helped Standard Chartered deepen employee relationships and instill a community-giving spirit among employees. Standard Chartered saw improvements in employee retention and camaraderie as employees had a shared sense of purpose and derived fulfillment through these activities. The bank increasingly saw projects that were initiated from the ground up by employees themselves and this was a distinctive element of the bank’s community initiatives. Standard Chartered also gained intangible benefits such as a strengthened reputation as a firm that was committed to corporate giving. As the public became increasingly conscious of corporate community investment efforts Standard Chartered’s social causes resonated well with the community.Overcoming Past ChallengesChoosing the Right PartnersOne notable partnership success was Standard Chartered’s partnership in 2012 with TTSH. The TTSH and Standard Chartered Stepping Out into Active Life partnership benefited more than 1200 elderly people and involved more than 1500 Standard Chartered volunteers over a span of three years (see Exhibit 3). TTSH which provided holistic and integrated patient care already had programs for seniors in place and had a wealth of experience and knowledge about caring for seniors and operating initiatives related to their needs. The financial and human resources Standard Chartered provided enabled the program to reach out to a larger group of elderly people.Encouraging and Educating VolunteersTan knew that the success of Silver Lining required the support of both the organizations and employee volunteers. Although the number of volunteer sign-ups across the organization had increased some employees needed to be encouraged to consider volunteering with the elderly as they were concerned about communication barriers and a lack of common interests. The younger generation in Singapore was not as comfortable conversing in Chinese dialects and this created a communication barrier for some elderly people who were only comfortable conversing in dialects. Standard Chartered sought to overcome these challenges by conducting orientation workshops where employee volunteers were given tips on communicating with and caring for seniors especially those with disabilities. Standard Chartered also developed a dialect translation mobile application (app) in 2014 to help volunteers communicate and build a rapport with the elderly participants. The app which was also available for public use contained common phrases for various dialects grouped into five key categories: greetings conversation food health and recreation. Silver Lining at a Crossroad2015 was a watershed year: the Singapore government and other organizations introduced initiatives such as the Pioneer Generation Package and the Silver Support Scheme. These provided the elderly population in Singapore with comprehensive health care benefits at a national level (see Exhibits 4 and 5). The Singapore government also committed SGD3 billion to promoting successful aging by improving social and health care infrastructure. As health care supports for the elderly became institutionalized Silver Lining needed to re-evaluate the way it operated so that it could continue to offer meaningful services. Standard Chartered was at a strategic crossroads and had to address three key issues.KEY ISSUESAn Increasing Number of Elderly with Mental Health IssuesAs the population in Singapore began to age a worrying trend that emerged was the increasing number of elderly people with poor mental health. Mental health as defined by the World Health Organization was “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential can cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and is able to contribute to her or his community.” Tan noted that one of the main causes of poor mental health was increased social and emotional isolation among the elderly especially those who lived alone. Statistics showed that in severe cases some elderly people even resorted to taking their own lives. In 2014 126 seniors aged 60 and above committed suicide—an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2000. Although the rising trend of mental health issues among the elderly was pertinent most organizations did not actively target it as they deemed it too complex. Despite their enormous impact on the affected persons and their caregivers mental health issues were difficult to diagnose and it required a great deal of financial and human resources to provide care and services for these people. Tan recognized that this was an opportunity for Silver Lining to channel its resources to this underserved segment while staying aligned with its main objective of supporting the elderly. Tan sought to leverage the expertise of a partner who would be well-versed in supporting socially isolated elderly clients. To maximize the effects of the project with limited resources Standard Chartered decided to focus its efforts on constituencies that had a significant proportion of senior residents. Other factors it took into consideration included the density of the elderly population and the average household income of different geographic areas in Singapore.Building Thought LeadershipAnother option Tan explored was the notion of building thought leadership. As part of its existing commitment to sustainability Standard Chartered had joined Company of Good (CoG) in 2015. CoG was a platform under the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre that sought to empower businesses to give better and more holistically through a “4 I” framework that emphasized investment integration institutionalization and impact (see Exhibit 6). CoG’s platform had a far-reaching effect on organizations and had developed a network of over 200 members since its inception in May 2015. In addition to empowering companies it helped organizations to collaborate and tap into each other’s highly diverse areas of expertise—which ranged from financial services to food and beverages—to achieve a greater combined impact. This presented a huge opportunity for Tan who had planned to contribute to leadership and mentorship in the CoG member community. By leveraging CoG’s network to share Standard Chartered’s best practices and frameworks she sought to inspire and assist other companies in contributing to the local community. For instance Tan could share how Standard Chartered had managed to build a strong employee volunteer culture through company policies and strong support from the management.Achieving a Multiplier EffectAs Singapore’s economy flourished the number and complexity of issues faced by the aging population also increased. It was clear that the efforts of a single organization were insufficient to bring about a significant change. Thus Tan sought to rally the resources of multiple organizations with similar community engagement objectives to maximize the effects of a combined effort.One project in particular caught Tan’s eye. Samsui Supplies and Services (Samsui Supplies) a subsidiary of Soup Restaurant Group Limited and a member of CoG had used its expertise in the food and beverage industry to run a sustainable food delivery program that could provide up to 1.8 million meals per year to beneficiaries. The elderly population was a sizeable proportion of these target beneficiaries. Standard Chartered considered investing in Samsui Supplies’ central kitchen which was located in Changi Prison. The kitchen—part of Samsui Supplies’ food delivery program—engaged 30 inmates who would prepare up to 6000 meals per day for distribution to nursing homes and volunteer welfare organizations. The inmates who were selected by the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises and Samsui Supplies were provided with culinary training that equipped them with skills required for integration back into society. If Standard Chartered took on this investment this tripartite collaboration could make use of the partners’ respective strengths and resources to deliver a sustainable long-term benefit to the local community. By investing in a social enterprise project and bringing it to scale quickly to maximize its benefit Standard Chartered would be able to meet the objectives of Silver Lining and create a win–win situation for all parties involved.MOVING FORWARDAs of January 2018 developing Silver Lining so that it remained relevant was still an ongoing process in terms of both business rationale and social needs. Tan needed to uphold Standard Chartered’s strong reputation and growth while doing good; she understood the delicate balance between effectiveness and resources and she sought to justify the firm’s community investment efforts. What should Standard Chartered continue to do that would provide the greatest benefit to its various stakeholders? What measures could be taken to encourage more organizations to partner with Standard Chartered to enhance the Silver Lining project?EXHIBIT 1: SEEING IS BELIEVINGSeeing is Believing was Standard Chartered Bank’s flagship global community investment program to tackle avoidable blindness.Standard Chartered Bank had for more than a decade helped more than 150 million people in Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America to tackle avoidable blindness and visual impairment. Through partnerships with leading international eye-care organizations such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness it had improved access to eye care in communities where help was most needed.Why Eye Care?Blindness was a common global problem that affected 36 million people worldwide. With proper cost-effective interventions 80 per cent of blindness could be prevented or treated. However eye-care problems were currently being underserved by charity organizations.

It worked with local communities to deliver programs focused on health and education. In 2016 Standard Chartered invested US$52.3 million in its communities and its employees contributed 67611 volunteering days.Standard Chartered’s largest community program Seeing is Believing provided funding to tackle avoidable blindness. In 2016 Standard Chartered raised US$6.5 million for Seeing is Believing through fundraising and group matching. In addition Standard Chartered’s Goal program an initiative to empower girls and young women through sports and life skills training had reached nearly 69000 girls in 2016. With a focus on building the financial capability of youth and micro and small entrepreneurs in its markets Standard Chartered’s financial education programs had trained more than 106000 youth and 1020 entrepreneurs.Sustainable Economic GrowthStandard Chartered sought to ensure that its core business of banking supported sustainable growth in its markets. In 2016 Standard Chartered provided loans and advances that supported the key sectors of the economy that were driving sustainable growth from infrastructure financing to microfinance. It also funded and facilitated more than US$800 million to the clean technology sector in 2016.To manage environmental and social risks Standard Chartered proactively engaged with various stakeholders such as its clients governments non-governmental organizations and communities to mitigate the impact stemming from its financing decisions. Its financing standards referenced industry-wide benchmarks such as the International Finance Corporation and it worked closely with its clients to manage these risks.Being a Responsible CompanyStandard Chartered sought to deliver long-term value by having the right culture structure and processes in place to practice strong governance and ensure a positive workplace environment. Standard Chartered ensured that it had a sustainable environmentally-friendly workplace. Between 2008 and 2016 Standard Chartered reduced its energy consumption by 37 per cent water consumption by 35 per cent and paper use by 71 per cent. Local suppliers and goods were also preferred as part of Standard Chartered’s promise to invest responsibly in local communities.In addition the bank prided itself on the diverse culture of its workforce as it held the strong belief that different views drove innovation and fostered an open and collaborative culture. In 2016 it engaged staff through more than 40 country-based employee networks and three global networks (women disability and LGBT and allies). Some processes that Standard Chartered put in place included its robust operational and compliance processes where efficient risk management and responsible selling were carried out.Note: LGBT = lesbian gay bisexual and transgenderSource: Created by the case authors based on Standard Chartered Bank “Sustainability Summary 2016” Standard Chartered Bank accessed October 10 2017 https://av.sc.com/corp-en/2016-Sustainability-Summary.pdf. EXHIBIT 3: TIMELINE OF INITIATIVES UNDER SILVER LININGSilver Lining was a Singapore-specific project aimed at addressing issues faced by a rapidly aging population. This program aimed to reach out to Singaporeans aged 65 and above especially those living alone and with a household income of less than SGD1500.First launched in 2012 Silver Lining had since received two awards from Community Chest (Corporate Platinum & Gold). Over SGD1 million was donated for community projects that affected over 8000 seniors and more than 5000 Standard Chartered staff had volunteered.EXHIBIT 4: PIONEER GENERATION PACKAGEThe Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) was launched in 2014 to honour and recognize the pioneer generation for their contributions to Singapore. Singaporeans who met the following criteria would be entitled to the benefits under the package:aged 16 and above in 1965obtained citizenship on or before December 31 1986PGP was estimated to benefit about 450000 Singaporeans and included the following benefits for life:Outpatient care:50-per-cent discount off the net bill for subsidized services at specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinicsEnhanced Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) which provided all pioneer generation members with CHAS benefits and additional subsidies for existing CHAS members Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme which provided cash assistance of SGD1200 per year for those with disabilitiesMedisave top-ups: Annual Medisave top-ups of SGD200–SGD800 would be disbursed to members of the pioneer generation depending on their birth cohorts.MediShield Life: Pioneer generation members would receive premium subsidies starting from 40 per cent of MediShield Life premiums and rising to 60 per cent of their premiums at age 90.

Cleghorn the chair of the board of directors for one of Canadaâs oldest railway companies Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) received a rather blunt e-mail from Bill Ackman the chief executive officer (CEO) of CPâs largest shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing). In the e-mail in which Ackman stated that âwar is also not inevitableâ Ackman demanded that Cleghorn provide Pershing with two seats on the board of directors and approve the hiring of a new CEO of Ackmanâs choosing. Cleghornâs uncertainty about how to respond to Ackmanâs request was documented in the email he had sent to Ackman that day: âThank you for your email and for your phone message. Let me reiterate that we would like to reach an agreement which advances the best interests of the company. As you will appreciate I will be discussing your email with my board.â Whatever decision Cleghorn made it had to be in the best interests of shareholders.âHISTORY OF CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAYThe Early DaysCP was one of Canadaâs most recognized companies with a history that dated back to the late 1800s. As part of Canadaâs Confederation in 1867 the provinces that joined were promised a transcontinental railway to physically link them with the other provinces from east to west. The railroadâs early construction was fraught with controversy and politics until a group of Scottish-Canadian businessmen formed a viable syndicate and incorporated the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPRC) in 1881. Despite some continued building struggles the last spike of the railroad was driven into the ground in Craigellachie British Columbia in 1885 and the first transcontinental train departed on June 28 1886.Throughout the early 1900s CPRC expanded its business into land sales telegraph lines locomotive construction and steamships and served as the primary transportation network during World War II. The company also focused on expanding its rail network through acquisitions particularly in the United States through the Soo Line in the Midwest and the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Northeast. By 1986 CPRC was Canadaâs second-largest company with CA$15 billion in revenue.The Modern RailroadIn 2001 the five subsidiaries created through various acquisitions by CPRC were spun into separate companies leaving CP as an independent public company. The following decade witnessed continued expansion through track re-building renewing locomotive fleets modernizing information technology systems and focusing on railroad safety; however CP also faced significant challenges during this time. The company was often the focus of takeover rumours including a widely reported rejection of a takeover inquiry from a private equity group led by Brookfield Asset Management in 2007. The company also suffered during the economic recession; in 2009 CP reported operating income of $830 million reflecting a 20 per cent drop from 2008 levels. This decline was primarily due to lower traffic volumes decreasing fuel prices and a drop in both the freight rates and the average length of haul of coal exports. In 2011 severe weather and flooding caused significant train disruptions resulting in an over 13 per cent decline in year-over-year operating income. CP was committed to executing its multi-year plan which aimed to drive volume growth expand network capacity and control costs. See Exhibit 1 for a summary of CPâs key financials for 2007â2011.By 2012 the company had grown to over 16000 employees operating in six provinces and 13 U.S. states across 14700 miles of railway track. The railway transported a wide range of goods including industrial and automotive products food and agricultural products forest products and energy/wind energy products. Customer shipments were handled either through traditional transloading or through the use of intermodal containers depending on customer needs and preferences. The transportation of unit trains (i.e. a shipment of multiple cars containing a single product) was considered more efficient and less complex than mixed-load trains which had to make multiple stops and switch cars in and out of the train. As a result mixed-load trains required more complex scheduling and labour utilization. Bulk products transported primarily by unit trains represented approximately 44 per cent of CPâs total revenues in 2012 with the remainder requiring mixed-train planning and execution.the north american railroad INDUSTRYPrior to the invention of the automobile rail networks represented the sole means of long-distance travel. As such railway operations in North America received significant political attention and continued to be viewed as an essential form of infrastructure.The United StatesThe railroad industry in the United States had faced significant regulation since its origins in the early 1800s. The Interstate Commerce Commission was formed in 1880 to limit the exercise of monopoly power by local rail companies and stabilize the industry through the regulation of freight rates formations and consolidations and service levels. Unfortunately the growth in regulation and resulting pace of approval stifled the industry leading to financial crises and numerous firm bankruptcies from 1960â1980. In 1980 the industry was revolutionized by the Staggers Rail Act which eliminated regulatory control of freight rates in the United States. Canadian firms were forced to respond to the resulting competitive pricing pressure given their significant rail network within the United States.CanadaUnlike in the United States which from 1980 onwards was struggling with industry consolidation in Canada with extensive mergers and acquisitions starting after the repeal of the Staggers Rail Act in early 1980 and gathering momentum in the late 1990s two key players dominated the railroad industry: CP and Canadian National Railway (CN). While rationalization of the rail network in Canada was limited by various regulatory restrictions the effects of regulation were not as severe as the effects of regulations in the United States. The Canadian Transport Commission which was responsible for adjudication and safety regulation was disbanded in 1988 and its functions divided among various new bodies significantly âderegulatingâ the industry and allowing competitive forces to prevail. The Canadian and U.S. rail industries began to merge into a broad North American industry with acquisitions in the 2000s given the significant cross-border assets and alliances between firms. The industry was heavily concentrated with the seven largest Class I freight railroads accounting for 69 per cent of freight rail mileage 90 per cent of employees and 94 per cent of revenues. This concentration prompted governments on both sides of the border to maintain the regulation of anti-competitive railroad conduct. Noteworthy was that CN had made significant acquisitions in the United States and had evolved as a north/south railroad network largely through a major acquisition of the Illinois Central Railroad providing access to Chicago and points south and west; in contrast in 2011 CP had largely focused on a Canadian railroad networkâan east/west network.Canadian National Railway CompanyCN was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government to assume responsibility for a number of small railroads on the brink of collapse. As a Crown corporation CN received government subsidies to support its operationsâan action that was the topic of significant political debate. CN posted deficits from its inception up to the late 1970s which the government absorbed as part of its budget. The company began to rise to profitability after 1978 by divesting non-core freight rail assets including hotels airlines and telecommunication companies. Following deregulation CN abandoned unprofitable rail lines it had been forced to absorb through prior government policies. In 1995 the government initiated the largest privatization in Canadian history at the time by selling all of its CN shares under the CN Commercialization Act. The Act specified that the companyâs headquarters must remain in Montreal Quebec and that no individual or corporation could own more than 15 per cent of CNâs shares. In 1998 CN purchased the Illinois Central Railroad shifting its focus from solely an eastâwest Canadian link to a northâsouth North American railway. The company also embraced âprecision railroadingâ which focused on stringent train scheduling to reduce terminal dwell time and improve asset utilization. For CN this strategy produced industry-leading operating ratios and on-time performance.By 2012 network rationalization focused expansion and operational improvements had transformed CN into a $9 billion company with over 23000 employees making it the largest railroad in Canada. Its focus on precision railroading contributed to a significant decline in the companyâs operating ratio from 75.3 per cent in 1998 to 63.5 per cent by the end of 2011. See Exhibit 2 for a summary of CNâs key financials for 2007â2011.CPâs MANAGEMENT TEAM and board governanceManagement TeamIn 2006 CP announced the retirement of CEO Robert Ritchie after an 11-year term and appointed the then chief operating officer (COO) Fred Green as the new CEO. Green had joined CP in 1978 and had progressed through the organization by assuming roles in operations marketing and sales. He had also served as an officer or director of many of CPRCâs former subsidiaries. In the six years since Greenâs appointment the remainder of CPâs management team had been described as a revolving door with three different chief financial officers and five different COOs. Board of DirectorsCPâs board of directorsâ mandate disclosed that âthe Board is responsible for CPâs long-term strategic direction succession plans for senior officers and risk management oversight.â At the end of 2011 CPâs board of directors consisted of 15 members including current and former CEOs of publicly traded companies railway industry veterans and political leaders (see Exhibit 3). For example board members included the former or current CEOs of some of Canadaâs largest companies such as the Royal Bank of Canada Suncor Energy and Shell Canada Limited. In addition one-third of board members had been appointed Officers of the Order of Canada.The CP board was considered long-tenured with 60 per cent of members having served on the board longer than five years. In December 2011 the board appointed two railroad industry veterans as directors: Tony Ingram the former COO of the CSX Corporation and Ed Harris the former COO of CP. Board governance documents indicated that the board could consist of no fewer than five members and no more than 20 members.canadian corporate governance and shareholder activismCorporate GovernanceA companyâs board of directors was charged with the overall governance and stewardship of the organization and directors were appointed to act in the best interests of shareholders. By virtue of corporate and securities laws shareholders of a corporation had the right to vote on a range of issues affecting the corporation including the appointment of directors appointment of auditors and approval of certain fundamental changes or transactions. When organizations sought approval from shareholders on various proposals they engaged in a process termed proxy solicitation to gather votes in advance of the annual general meeting of shareholders. Shareholders typically voted on these proposals by appointing another party to vote on matters on their behalf (a âproxyâ) in order to streamline the process. The proposals were detailed within the companyâs proxy circular which included the relevant information required by shareholders in order to make an informed vote.âDissidentâ shareholders who wished to challenge management and propose alternative agendas could do so by engaging in a âproxy contestâ to solicit votes from shareholders in their favour. In Canada any shareholder with more than a 5 per cent share ownership of a certain voting class of a companyâs equity could call a shareholder meeting and solicit proxies in support of their agenda. Reporting Beneficial OwnershipShareholders acquiring 10 per cent or more of a voting class of a Canadian companyâs equity were required by the Securities Act to issue a press release announcing the acquisition and to file an âearly warningâ report within two days. Similarly U.S. securities legislation required that shareholders file a Schedule 13D within 10 days of acquiring more than 5 per cent of a voting class of a companyâs equity while also reporting the transaction and providing a rationale for the acquisition. In Canada shareholders were not required to disclose their intentions with respect to the ownership creating potential uncertainty and unwelcome âsurprisesâ for the company.The Rise of Shareholder ActivismActivist shareholders could be defined generally as investors who purchased a large stake in a publicly traded organization with the intent to enact changes and realize a profit on the investment. The first notable wave of shareholder activism began in the United States in the 1980s with so-called âcorporate raidersâ taking advantage of depressed share prices and undervalued assets. By the early 1990s companies had responded by introducing takeover defense mechanisms such as poison pills and golden parachutes resulting in a decline in takeover activity.Given the concentration of institutional investor share ownership among many Canadian companies the level of shareholder activism in Canada paled in comparison to activities at U.S. organizations. Canadian institutional investors typically communicated displeasure by selling shares rather than initiating conflict. Notwithstanding shareholder activism in Canada had gained traction in recent years as evidenced by the increasing number of proxy battles launched against Canadian companies. Approximately 101 proxy contests were completed in the five-year period ending December 31 2012 representing an 84 per cent increase over the 55 contests completed in the prior five-year period. This growth in shareholder activism and proxy contests in Canada could be partially attributed to activist-friendly legislation introduced in 2008 allowing eligible shareholders to solicit proxies without issuing a proxy circular. As such shareholders could solicit proxies by simply issuing a press release or public announcement at any time prior to the proxy submission deadline (which could be as late as the eve of a shareholdersâ meeting).bill ackman and pershing square capital MANAGEMENTWilliam (Bill) Ackman graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1992. Upon graduation he teamed up with Harvard classmate David Berkowitz to launch a hedge fund called Gotham Partners. With a passion for investing and US$3 million in start-up capital the fund achieved significant success throughout the next six years with annual returns of up to 40 per cent. Although the fund began by investing in relatively conservative opportunities the pair became increasingly speculative and ran into trouble in the early 2000s. A highly leveraged investment in a money-losing golf course combined with a probe into improper conduct by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forced the fund to wind down operations and sell off its assets in 2002.Unfettered by the failure of Gotham Partners Ackman launched a new hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing) in 2004. Pershing was described as a research-intensive fundamental value investor typically focusing on long-term large-cap and mid-cap companies. The fundâs style combined value investing and activist approaches to drive company share prices and improve fund performance. The bulk of Pershingâs portfolio was fairly concentrated with the majority invested in consumer goods and consumer services businesses.Over the next few years Ackman garnered significant media attention by engaging in activist behaviour âthat is investing in companies and aggressively pursuing changes such as shifts in strategy or changes in management. In many cases he succeeded in driving changes at his targeted companies with limited effort; however not every activist investment made by Pershing proceeded according to plan. In 2007 Pershing established the âPershing Square IVâ fund and invested $2 billion in shares of retail giant Target Corporation in order to enact changes in strategy and increase the share price. Although the company had partially implemented some of Pershingâs strategic recommendations Pershingâs investment had fallen by 90 per cent by 2009 which Ackman described as one of the greatest disappointments of his career. When the company rejected further proposals by Ackman he launched a proxy battle to appoint himself and four others to the board of directors; however his bid was rejected by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Of the 24 companies Pershing had targeted for active investment Target Corporation was only the second proxy battle initiated by Ackman (see Exhibit 4).By 2012 Pershing had grown to over $11 billion in assets under management and employed 51 people. Since its inception Pershing had delivered more than a 20 per cent annual compound rate of return to investors approximately 90 per cent of which was generated based on activist plays.A Stake in CP RailOn October 28 2011 Pershing filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating that it had acquired 12.2 per cent of CPâs outstanding shares at an approximate cost of $1.07 billion. The filing also indicated that Pershingâs intent was to âengage in discussions with management the board other stockholders of [CP] and other relevant parties concerning the business management operations assets capitalization financial condition governance strategy and future plans of [CP].â The acquisition made Pershing the largest single shareholder of CP shares.In response to the filing Cleghorn issued a memo to all CP employees on October 31 stating âAs with others CP is open to the views of its shareholders. We will speak with Pershing Square to hear their input into our plan already targeted at realizing greater efficiency and improved service reliability.âinitial correspondence and pershing square requestsAfter some initial phone calls Ackman and Cleghorn decided to meet on November 2 2011 to discuss Pershingâs investment objectives. During this meeting Ackman focused heavily on CPâs past performanceâspecifically the firmâs operating ratio. CPâs operating ratio was notably higher than most other Class I freight railroads and had been trending upward during Greenâs tenure. By the end of 2011 CPâs operating ratio was the worst among its key competitors. Ackman asserted that the operating ratio could be reduced to the mid-60s by 2015 but only if a change in leadership occurred. Further Ackman proposed that existing CEO Green be replaced by Hunter Harrison the retired CEO of CPâs Canadian rival CN. At the time Cleghorn indicated that the board supported Green and CPâs existing strategy and the two parties closed the meeting with limited resolution. Over subsequent communications in the days that followed it became apparent that Ackman had two primary objectives: install Hunter Harrison as CEO and secure two seats on CPâs board of directors.Hunter HarrisonHunter Harrison had had an extensive career in the railway industry beginning in 1964 as a carman-oiler for the St. LouisâSan Francisco Railway. The Burlington Northern Railroad acquired the railway in 1980 and Harrison quickly progressed through the organization to the executive ranks. He was appointed CEO of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1993 and COO of CN when it acquired the Illinois Central Railroad in 1998. In 2003 he was appointed CEO of CN and remained in the position until his retirement on December 31 2009. During his career Harrison was named Railroader of the Year (2002 Railway Age) CEO of the Year (2007 Report on Business) Railroad Innovator (2009 Progressive Railroading) and International Executive of the Year (2009 Canadian Chamber of Commerce).As part of his previous employment contract with CN Harrison was bound by non-compete and non-solicitation agreements expiring December 31 2011. In addition his retirement and pension arrangements separately prohibited him from competing with CN until the end of 2014. Notwithstanding Ackman was adamant that Harrison was the only candidate who could improve CPâs performance and help the company achieve its operating objectives.Request for Board SeatsOn November 4 2011 Ackman contacted Cleghorn requesting that the board provide Pershing with two seats on the board for him and a business partner Paul Hilal. The board agreed to interview Ackman for a board seat but declined to consider Hilal given his lack of railway industry experience. This rationale was given despite a lack of railway experience among CPâs board members at the time. Following Ackmanâs interview the board extended him an offer to join the board; however Ackman subsequently refused the offer due to a âstandstillâ agreement he was being asked to sign. On December 13 2011 Pershing filed another Schedule 13D indicating that it had acquired further shares of CP bringing its total holdings to 14.2 per cent of CPâs shares outstanding.Canadian pacific goes publicOn December 30 2011 The Globe and Mail newspaper published an article titled âCPâs Activist Investor Eyes Former CN CEO Mr. Hunter Harrison.â The article represented the first public declaration of intent by Pershing to have Green replaced. In response to the article Cleghorn publicized a letter addressed to Ackman on January 3 2012 to reiterate the boardâs commitment to Green and the companyâs existing strategic plan. He refuted any rumours that the board was considering meeting with Harrison and emphasized the boardâs commitment to engaging in continued dialogue with Pershing (see Exhibit 5).Pershing square fires backThe following day Ackman released his own public letter addressed to Cleghorn countering the statements made by Cleghorn in his earlier letter. Specifically Ackman asserted that Cleghorn had indicated that there was interest in meeting with Harrison that the board was âforcingâ Ackman to sign an exceptional contract in exchange for a seat on the board and that Pershing did have a strong plan to improve CPâs operating performance. He closed by urging Cleghorn to meet with Harrison and board candidate Hilal as soon as possible (see Exhibit 5).Early the following morning Cleghorn received an e-mail from Ackman titled âWar and Peaceâ in which Ackman reiterated previous comments and provided an ultimatum: accede to his requests or Pershing would launch a proxy contest at the next shareholdersâ meeting. As part of this contest Pershing was prepared to âtake the largest public hall available and make a presentation to shareholders and the public about management and board failure over the past 10 years at CP.â His e-mail closed with a not-so-subtle threat: âLetâs avoid having a border skirmish turn into a nuclear winter. Life is too short.â The set of emails between Cleghorn and Ackman were fully reproduced by The Globe and Mail in its article of January 16 2012. What came across in the emails was a sense of heightened emotions between Cleghorn and Ackman.planning his next moveCleghorn was faced with a dilemma. On the one hand he could view the e-mail as an unfounded attack on the company one that he needed to defend vigorously. On the other hand he could view Ackmanâs recommendations as having additional merit and as warranting more in-depth investigation. There were three potential courses of action. The choice made by Cleghorn and his board would be driven by their having to act in a manner consistent with the Canadian Business Corporations Actâto act in the best interests of the corporation. Taking such an action would be a clear expression that the board viewed their role as fiduciary agents of the corporation.Agree to Ackmanâs ProposalOne way to end the issue was to offer Ackman and Hilal two seats on the board (removing the standstill agreement) and commit to replacing Green with Harrison. If Cleghorn were to determine this was the optimal solution then he was faced with how he would recommend these changes to the remaining board members and whether there was a business case to remove Green from the position of CEO. If he agreed to these changes what else would Ackman push for once he was appointed as a board member? Was opening the doors to Ackman without certainty of his voting intentions the beginning of future boardroom battles?Ignore Ackman and Maintain Existing StrategyWith a careful reading of the email exchange between Cleghorn and Ackman it is reasonable to suggest that Cleghorn might consider that Ackman was bullying the board by using threats. Cleghorn based on his most recent upbeat annual presentation to shareholders demonstrated confidence in the companyâs current strategic direction; thus the question he had to consider was whether Ackman had a clear plan to implement the changes he sought. The company was a blue-chip Canadian company with a long and illustrious history and hedge funds such as Pershing had to date largely ignored the Canadian marketplace. Therefore a question that the board should consider was whether Ackman would give up the battle if Cleghorn and the board did not respond to this e-mail or what other measures might be necessary to end his advances. Should Cleghorn return to the media and employ a tactic based on preserving Canadian firms to largely Canadian owners and encourage other shareholders to push back against Ackman? Perhaps strength in numbers was all that was needed.Continue NegotiationsAlthough recent conversations between Cleghorn and Ackman had been made public one of the possibilities for Cleghorn in deciding the best course of action was to continue negotiating privately with Ackman in the hopes of swaying his opinion or at the very least reaching some form of compromise. What would be best for the corporation? Should Cleghorn on behalf of the board offer Ackman some other arrangement to appease his interests while maintaining the stability of CPâs current management team?With the knowledge that he should act in the best interests of shareholders and that Pershing was CPâs largest shareholder Cleghorn had to confront the challenge of determining how to prioritize these competing interests. With Ackmanâs escalating threats and a shareholdersâ meeting expected to occur in the next few months time was not on Cleghornâs side and he needed to resolve this matter quickly.Exhibit 1: Canadian Pacific railway KEy Financial Data (2009â2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 2: Canadian National railway KEy financial data (2009â2011)(For years ending December 31 in CA$ millions)Note: * Not strictly comparable to Canadian Pacific Railway.Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 3: Selected CP Board of Directors Biographies (as at december 31 2011)John E.

However the online market for flower and gift sales was changing rapidly presenting new opportunities for efficiencies and market expansion. Jim was joined in a meeting at 1-800-Flowers.com�s headquarters in Carle Place New York by his younger brother and chief operating officer Chris McCann as well as Joe Pititto vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. The meeting was called to discuss how 1-800-Flowers.com could gain competitive advantage through collaborations with the extended supply chain. Chris started the discussion by suggesting that 1-800-Flowers.com should bring more florists into the company�s �BloomNet� network and introduce more of its non-floral gift products (specifically its gourmet gifts) into the florists� shops for same-day delivery. He believed that �the best way going forward is to expand our BloomNet network and get [florists] to carry our gourmet gifts for same-day delivery; this would extend our product offerings and geographical reach and more importantly we could be close to the customer with minimal investment.�Jim agreed with Chris but only up to a point: While I agree that we benefit immensely from collaborating with independent florists and they have the ability to carry other gift items in their shops for same-day delivery we cannot rely solely on the florists to drive our growth. Our agreements with them are non-exclusive and we do not have any control over their day-to-day operations. [Further] they have limited capabilities in terms of space and inventory investment bandwidth to carry all the products that we would like to position closer to our customers. Chris listened to these thoughts and replied: I think we may be missing a point here. Our supply chain does not stop with the florists. In terms of floral gifts some of the delivery issues that we have had in the past were due to the non-availability of quality flowers specific to our product designs to meet customer demand. To address this element of our gifting supply chain I think we need to bring the floral growers into our discussion. Further as you have pointed out our business is no longer just about flowers; we also need to look at how we bring synergies through our supply chain including our own gourmet gift production warehouse and delivery facilities. Jim concurred: In terms of the floral supply chain our goal of influencing the availability of key floral varieties and enhancing our ability to help our florists do the best possible job for us must address the supply chain from the farms all the way to the florists. While buying [from] growers or wholesalers is an involved and risky approach�not to mention capital intensive�developing a strategy and an initiative to offer an electronic marketplace for flowers would help us improve availability lower costs and improve coordination thereby providing us with a sustained competitive advantage. Chris agreed noting that integration across the value chain could be one important element toward the overall goal of leveraging both owned and partnered assets to bring consistency of supply and expanded range of products closer to the firm�s customers. As they left the room the three men knew that they needed to consider further some important questions. First how could 1-800-Flowers.com improve the performance of the floral supply chain in terms of floral designs costs and delivery through better information sharing and coordination across the supply chain? Second how could the company benefit from combining the floral supply chain with the gift supply chain?Company History1-800-Flowers.com began operations as Flora Plenty in 1976 when Jim acquired a single retail florist in New York City. He subsequently expanded the business to a 14-store chain. Jim�s younger brother Chris joined the company in 1984. In 1986 Flora Plenty acquired a Texas-based florist named 800-Flowers along with the rights to the toll-free number 1-800-Flowers. At a time when brick-and-mortar retailing was the common practice Jim made the bold move to adapt telephone commerce as the business model and renamed the company 1-800-Flowers. This change was a stroke of marketing genius: the innovative and memorable name led to a strong brand recall value among customers. The company was one of the first retailers to use 24/7 toll-free numbers and it changed the way the floral industry operated. Floral orders over the phone would soon become the norm. Two years later in 1988 the company launched BloomNet its own network of independent florists to facilitate same-day delivery of customer orders. BloomNet would later become a fully owned subsidiary of 1-800-Flowers.com offering business-to-business florist wire service. Over the next few years while the retail industry was riding the �1-800 wave� 1-800-Flowers was already exploring several new ideas in pursuit of the next big technological innovation that would fundamentally alter the way business was done. As a part of this initiative the company explored the possibility of selling through the Internet and had its own website by 1991. The results were not immediate because Internet retailing was practically non-existent at that time due to the lack of supporting infrastructure. However the launch of several web browsers between 1993 and 1995 kick-started the e-commerce era and 1-800-Flower�s online sales volume increased significantly after 1995. To reflect the changing times and to emphasize the role of the Internet in the company�s business strategy going forward 1-800-Flowers was re-christened �1-800-Flowers.com� in 1998. The company was one of the first retailers to directly sell over the Internet and as with telephone retailing the Internet retailing model revolutionized the floral industry landscape. Suddenly customers had access to the products offered by hundreds of florists across the country through 1-800-Flowers.com�s website. From the company�s standpoint this meant increased product variety along with the added benefit of reduced investment in inventory and infrastructure. The Internet retailing model pioneered by 1-800-Flowers.com soon became a standard in the floral industry. Social Local and Mobile1-800-Flowers.com had always been a leader in adopting technology to drive business and it lived up to its reputation when another wave of change swept the retail industry: mobile and social commerce. 1-800-Flowers.com launched the floral industry�s first mobile gift centre in 2008 and went on to win numerous awards for its innovative applications (apps) in the mobile commerce space. In 2009 the company added one more accomplishment to its list of �firsts� in the floral industry (and the retail industry in general) by partnering with social commerce provider Alvenda. With the partnership 1-800-Flowers.com became the first retailer ever to open a fully operational store inside Facebook. Customers could purchase and make payments without leaving the social media website. Many other retailers soon followed suit. 1-800-Flowers.com was also a pioneer in social marketing partnering with Facebook Twitter Google+ and many other blogging websites to reach customers directly and in a cost-effective manner. The company planned to further invest and innovate in the social and mobile media space in line with its social local and mobile theme which recognized the growing importance of mobile commerce and social networking to the firm�s future growth and marketing plans.Not Just FlowersWhile 1-800-Flowers.com had been a leader in the floral industry for almost 30 years it was no longer just about flowers: the company�s mission was to be the �leading provider of thoughtful gifts� by positioning itself as an everyday gift destination. In line with this mission 1-800-Flowers.com began offering non-floral products like gourmet cookies and gift baskets in the late 1990s. The diversification gained momentum with the acquisition of The Popcorn Factory in 2002. Since then the company had invested heavily in the non-floral category to open new businesses and had also made a series of acquisitions. As of 2012 in addition to its core floral business and BloomNet wire service 1-800-Flowers.com had a significant presence in the gourmet foods and gifts industry through its various wholly owned subsidiaries (e.g. The Popcorn Factory a leading producer of gourmet popcorn and specialty treats; Cheryl�s offering fresh-baked gifts; Fannie May offering confections; 1-800-Baskets.com specializing in gift baskets and towers; and Winetasting.com offering a collection of more than 700 wines from around the world). To leverage its multi-million customer base and leadership position in the floral industry 1-800-Flowers.com used a multi-brand website that directed the high traffic flow to 1-800-Flowers.com to the company�s non-floral business as well (see Exhibit 1). In 2011 53 per cent of the company�s revenues came from the consumer floral business 11 per cent from BloomNet wire service and 36 per cent from gourmet food and gift baskets.1-800-Flowers.com�S Supply Chain1-800-Flowers.com operated a complex supply chain comprising manufacturers (non-floral); growers (floral); distribution centres; fulfillment centres; and franchised company-owned and independent retailers (floral and non-floral) (see Exhibit 2). Typically orders for all products were placed either online (through 1-800-Flowers.com 1-800-Baskets.com etc.) or over the telephone; however the order fulfillment strategy varied significantly depending on the product type. Flowers and Plants1-800-Flowers.com�s floral orders were fulfilled using a hybrid system consisting of (1) the BloomNet network of franchised and independent florists and (2) the company-owned distribution centres. Customers had the option of choosing from a menu of the following items: hand-crafted floral arrangements which were delivered in person by the local florist on the same day (representing approximately 80 per cent of the company�s floral sales); a wide variety of �shipped in a box� floral arrangements which were directly shipped from the distribution centers (no same-day delivery was available for this option); and a select variety of floral products through the firm�s Fresh From Our Growers� program in which case the flowers were shipped directly from the growers� fields to the customer. BloomNetFor nearly a decade after 1-800-Flowers.com began operations in 1976 the company primarily fulfilled its orders through 14 company-operated stores. This system changed in 1988 when 1-800-Flowers.com teamed up with a select network of independent florists to create the BloomNet network. This collaboration with florists opened up new opportunities in terms of product variety flexible delivery options and more importantly a wider geographical reach. Through its florist partners 1-800-Flowers.com had the advantage of being close to the customer; for the first time the company was able to offer same-day delivery nationwide. The florists also benefitted immensely from this partnership because 1-800-Flowers.com�s strong brand value and large customer base provided increased visibility and demand for the florists� products with little to no additional marketing costs. Over the years the nature and scope of the collaboration between 1-800-Flowers.com and the florists increased steadily culminating in the formal launch of BloomNet as a business-to-business al wire service provider in 2005. BloomNet was no longer just an order fulfillment network; it offered a suite of products and services to help florists grow their businesses profitably (ranging from exclusive wholesale merchandise to floral design training programs). 1-800-Flowers.com had a quality assurance program for BloomNet florists to guarantee customer satisfaction and maintain high standards for florist-to-florist transactions within the BloomNet network. The company selected retail florists for BloomNet based upon florists� design and delivery capabilities and allocated orders to members within a geographical area using a complex algorithm that considered a variety of inputs (e.g. a florist�s historical quality performance and customer satisfaction ratings its inventory and ability to fulfill orders to the company�s recipes and specifications and the number of member florists serving the area). The industry standard revenue-sharing agreement for floral orders as adopted by BloomNet was as follows: the florist who received the order (i.e. either 1-800-Flowers.com or an independent BloomNet florist) kept approximately 29 per cent of the total order value while the fulfilling florist received the remaining 71 per cent. The responsibility for the floral inventory and delivery rested with the fulfilling florist. Gourmet Foods and Gift BasketsFor non-floral products 1-800-Flowers.com primarily used direct shipment from its manufacturing and distribution facilities to the customers. Further as of December 2011 the company owned and operated approximately 70 Fannie May and Harry London stores and nine Cheryl�s retail stores and had a growing number of franchise retail locations for its Fannie May brand. Fannie May chocolates (as well as the company�s Harry London wholesale brand of chocolates) were produced in Canton Ohio (approximately 10 million pounds of chocolate produced annually). The company�s Cheryl�s brand cookies and other baked gifts were manufactured at its facility in Westerville Ohio. The Popcorn Factory products were produced in its Lakeville Illinois plant and its 1-800-Baskets.com gifts were produced at its facility in Melrose Park Illinois. Economic Downturn and Strategic ResponseThe gift industry was highly discretionary in nature and performance was heavily subject to the economic climate. The demand for gift products depended on customers� spending ability which was in turn directly related to factors like the unemployment rate housing market conditions and commodity prices. During the 2008 global financial crisis demand for 1-800-Flowers.com�s products was adversely affected (mainly in the core floral business) resulting in a negative operating income in 2009 and 2010 (see Exhibit 3). The impact of this recession in terms of net revenue was worst in fiscal year (FY) 2009/10. Cost-Cutting Measures1-800-Flowers.com�s initial response to the reduced demand and lacklustre market conditions was to implement a series of cost-cutting measures. Between June 2008 and June 2009 the company significantly reduced its workforce (including full- and part-time employees). This reduction included an elimination of roughly 15 per cent of full-time jobs. Another 100 employees were laid off in the following year. In addition to downsizing its workforce 1-800-Flowers.com decided to close its brick-and-mortar customer service centres in order to reduce the fixed costs associated with operating these facilities. The company transferred employees from these centres to its home agent network and used sophisticated call routing and voice-over-Internet solutions to virtualize its customer service platform. Importantly this move also served to improve customer satisfaction ratings because home agents proved to be stable and experienced staff who were motivated by their ability to work from home.As part of the cost-cutting plans 1-800-Flowers.com also accelerated the initiatives under its Process Enhancement Programs to reach the goal of saving US$50 million in operating costs by the end of FY 2008/09. During the fourth quarter of the same fiscal year the company made the strategic decision to divest its home and children�s gifts business to better focus on the floral business BloomNet and the gourmet foods and gift baskets categories. These measures resulted in lower operating costs (excluding the goodwill and intangible impairment expenses of $85.4 million in 2009) leading to increased gross margin percentages in 2010 and 2011. Furthermore 1-800-Flowers.com�s operating expense ratios were comparable to pre-recession levels despite the much lower revenues in 2010 and 2011. The economic recession impacted 1-800-Flowers.com in several ways. While it emerged leaner and operationally more efficient the company quickly realized that simply cutting costs and passing on the benefits to the customer (e.g. through discounted pricing free shipping etc.) were not sufficient to spur market demand in tough economic times. In the lead-up to Valentine�s Day (February 14) 2010 1-800-Flowers.com resorted to a combination of steep discounts and increased marketing spending to generate consumer interest for its products. These promotional activities continued all the way to Mother�s Day (in the United States the second Sunday in May). Although these programs saw an increase in the number of orders and new customers that increase was insufficient to offset the associated decline in the average value per order resulting in lower gross margins. Based on an in-depth analysis of the company�s financial performance in FY 2009/10 top management at 1-800-Flowers.com concluded that the company had to look beyond the existing methods and line of products to return to profitability and support its ambitious growth plans. While staying committed to its efforts to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency the company decided to invest in developing new and exciting products that would better capture customers� interest. Products were organized into three categories�good better and best�based on their price points. The cost-based approach had led to a focus on the �good� products and did very little to differentiate 1-800-Flowers.com from every other company that offered low-cost gifts. Therefore 1-800-Flowers.com made the bold decision to focus on the �better� and �best� categories while working closely with the supply chain. A key element of this strategy was the close collaboration with florists at the design stage.A-DOG-Able� CollectionBy June 2010 1-800-Flowers.com had already decided to invest in developing new and exciting products but one key question still needed to be answered: how would the company create such radically new designs? The straightforward answer would have been to increase in-house product design efforts by residential floral designers; however the company was convinced that this was not the solution. The management team felt that it had to look outside the firm for fresh outside-the-box ideas. It was at this juncture that 1-800-Flowers.com decided to bring a knowledgeable valuable source of ideas into its product design process�the company�s own BloomNet member florists. Many florists within the network had outstanding design capabilities and involving them in product design would also be valuable from an operational standpoint because ultimately product crafting and delivery were carried out by the florists. The company employed a variety of strategies to facilitate idea exchange and deepen the design collaboration with the florists. One such initiative was the creation of a magazine Floriology through which florists could exchange inspiring ideas marketing strategies and so on. The magazine regularly featured promising designs by member florists along with a short narrative of the design concept. Some of these designs might eventually be added to 1-800-Flowers.com�s product offerings. This recognition and visibility encouraged the florists to actively participate in the design process. The company also established the 1-800-Flowers.com Floral Design Council to foster floral design artistry and collaboratively develop new products. The design council routinely conducted design competitions for florists and winners were rewarded with cash prizes and in some rare cases a share of the revenue for designs directly attributed to the winner. The company had even named a floral arrangement �Dee�s Tropical Paradise�� after a Boston-based florist who provided inspiration for that particular design. The increased product design efforts through collaboration with the BloomNet florists resulted in many innovative and exciting products including the widely popular �a-DOG-able�� collection of products which featured a set of 11 products for different seasons and reasons (see Exhibit 4). These floral arrangements were hand-crafted by the fulfilling florists in the shape of an adorable dog complete with eyes nose and a pair of long ears. The a-DOG-able� line was an instant hit due to its appeal unique design and more importantly the value that it offered to customers with a low starting price of $34.99. Moving Forward1-800-Flowers.com�s design collaboration with the florists was proving successful but numerous challenges lay ahead for the company. While the economy remained the single biggest threat the firm was facing intensifying competition as well. In the floral category 1-800-Flowers.com�s competitors included retail floral shops online floral retailers floral wire services and supermarkets with floral departments. Improvements in information technology and the convenience of e-commerce had led to a surge in the number of Internet-based floral retailers some of which also sold their products through traditional channels by collaborating with independent florists. In addition 1-800-Flowers.com�s partnership with the independent florists and growers was non-exclusive; the service agreement could be terminated by either party with very little notice. The company had no control over the operations of either the independent florists or the growers which exposed it to a certain level of risk that needed to be carefully managed in terms of quality timeliness and reliability of its services in the floral business. To deepen its relationships with its BloomNet florists 1-800-Flowers.com decided to expand its franchise program. Prior to 2011 the company had not added a new florist to its small franchise network (part of BloomNet) for more than a decade. However rising interest from florists after the company�s very positive appearance on the hit television program Undercover Boss led to an initiative to allow select BloomNet florists to co-brand which offered florists the benefit of retaining their local brand recognition while also gaining from 1-800-Flowers.com�s national brand recognition and advertising campaigns. In addition to the expansion of co-branded franchise florists in FY 2011/12 the company acquired Flowerama a Waterloo Iowa-based florist franchise company with more 77 retail stores in more than 25 states. Flowerama stores had already begun to co-brand their retail locations. 1-800-Flowers.com franchise florists became the upper tier of the company�s BloomNet network in terms of their deep relationships with the company.1-800-Flowers.com was also working on leveraging the company�s existing non-floral supply chains to deliver floral products while concurrently seeking ways to utilize its unique same-day delivery capability through the BloomNet florist network for many of the company�s non-floral gourmet food gift items. Integrating the floral and non-floral delivery channels offered tremendous potential. The company operated 68 company-owned (and a growing number of franchise) Fannie May and Harry London retail stores as well as the nine Cheryl�s retail stores all of which could be doubled up as retail outlets for the floral business. This gave 1-800-Flowers.com a cost-effective way to be closer to the customer. The company had also recently introduced a new product line Fruit Bouquets designed to compete with the franchise chain Edible Arrangements. The idea was to refit existing florist locations and company-owned gourmet food gift stores with the ability to craft fruit bouquets and thereby grow national same-day delivery capability quickly. To achieve this goal 1-800-Flowers.com needed to invest in employee training as well as significant planning before the floral and non-floral delivery channels could be integrated. As 1-800-Flowers.com sought ways to address these diverse opportunities a number of key strategic decisions needed to be made. It was clear that the company needed to leverage and expand the supplier collaboration effort. What was the most effective way to do this? Should the strategy be based primarily on vertical integration or should it be created along the lines of virtual integration? A second and related question pertained to the level of integration with the growers. One of the firm�s key strategic choices had been to focus on the higher end of the product offerings. Could 1-800-Flowers.com somehow extend the integration back to the growers so that flowers of the right type and quality (including exotic flowers) could be made available as needed thus providing the firm with sustained competitive advantage? How should the company begin to establish that strategy? What was the optimal supply chain structure: a fully integrated supply chain extending all the way up to the growers a semi-integrated supply chain involving virtual integration with the growers and vertical integration with the florists or a completely virtually integrated supply chain? In 2014 1-800-Flowers.com�s management had also been evaluating a proposal to develop an electronic marketplace. The marketplace would allow for florist-to-florist transactions as well as 1-800 Flowers.com-to-florists transactions. The company could procure the most needed flowers from growers and auction them at the electronic marketplace thereby increasing the availability of critical flowers for local florists. Further the transaction data could give 1-800-Flowers.com important information about demand patterns for various types of flowers and the firm could then coordinate planning with growers in advance. This approach could be a middle ground between vertical integration and maintaining the status quo. However important challenges related to the positioning planning and execution of this approach would have to addressed. Exhibit 1: 1-800-Flowers.com�s multi-brand websiteSource: Company files.

NPCI�s organizational form was unique: A not-for-profit entity that was initiated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) India�s central bank but owned by a consortium of India�s leading banks. By creating multiple new products for India�s financial payments system NPCI established its reputation as a trail-blazing financial technology (fintech) innovator. Many of its platforms which were initially devised as unique solutions for India had by now attracted the attention of other countries. As NPCI moved on to further streamlining national payment systems in the digital age the RBI decided to open up the market allowing banks and other financial services companies to compete directly. Did NPCI have the right structures processes and strategies to continue to thrive in this rapidly evolving environment or should it change the not-for-profit collaborative organizational structures that had made it successful in the first place?INDIA�s FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE: �CASH IS KING DIGITIAL IS DIVINE�In 2018 the RBI came up with a catchy motto: �Cash is king digital is divine� signalling how far India had come in digital payments. Some analysts claimed that India had surpassed the West in payment technology.India�s journey toward a cashless economy began in the early 1990s when following economic liberalization India experienced a significant improvement in economic growth. With the increase in commerce came a wave of banking needs for businesses and individuals and this resulted in an unprecedented increase in banking activities. Despite practically no change in the number of commercial banks during 19912005 deposits and credits grew by an annual average of more than 16 per cent in that period. While the liberalization policies including the new regulations for the financial sector contributed to this massive growth in banking activities an even more important role was played by the proliferation of information technology in handling large-scale increases in payments and settlements.By 2005 almost all private banks and 77.5 per cent of public sector bank branches were fully computerized of which 28 per cent had core banking solutions. There were 21147 bank-operated automated teller machines (ATMs) nationwide. Also the acceptance of credit cards for retail payments had increased sharply as had the use of various new funds transfer and settlement technologies. Consequently non-paper-based payments and settlements had increased from 29.4 per cent in 200102 to 51.2 per cent in 200506.The digital revolution provided India with an opportunity to surpass more advanced markets through technology. The banking landscape however was dominated by several state-owned banks that were lagging in pioneering new technologies. The absence of a common platform offering interoperability across different banks caused delays in payments and settlements. Along with this a low penetration of bank accounts beyond urban areas was hampering the growth of the burgeoning financial sector. The inefficiencies in interoperability reduced the attractiveness of owning an account and a low volume of accounts in turn made any investment in technologies mitigating those inefficiencies prohibitively expensive. India�s time for overtaking had not yet come.It fell on the RBI India�s central bank to look for solutions that could smooth inefficiencies in the financial system. To this end the RBI had already taken several measures. For large-scale interbank transfers new real-time gross settlement systems allowed for faster settlements. In addition the RBI started incentivizing banks to adopt cost-efficient payment technologies while also improving the legal infrastructure for digital payments. However the RBI also had a broader mandate to pursue financial inclusion which would require more innovative fintech solutions. In order to achieve its goals the RBI came up with a road map entitled Financial Sector Technology Vision Document (2005) which ultimately led to the emergence of an unlikely homegrown Indian fintech innovator: the NPCI.THE BIRTH OF NPCI: publicprivate collaboration reimaginedBy 2005 the RBI was ready to roll out a pilot for its cheque truncation system (CTS) which would reduce cheque clearing time to a single day. However the RBI recognized that improving cost efficiency in the payments and settlements system was not possible without a greater level of interoperability among banks and other financial service firms. A critical question was who should be responsible for spearheading the development of a new interoperability technology.The banks did not have enough incentive to invest in developing such infrastructure themselves. The public nature of interoperability infrastructure made investments susceptible to potential free-rider problems. If the RBI were to appoint a single for-profit entity to develop the entire interoperability technology for payments and settlements an undesirable concentration of market power could potentially result.As a way forward the RBI consulted the Indian Banks� Association (IBA) to design a solution. The RBI and the IBA came up with the idea of forming a not-for-profit �co-opetitive� entitya structure characterized by co-operation among competitors. The new entity would be jointly owned by competing banks and focus on improving inefficiencies in the interoperability system.It was an intriguing proposition. In a world dominated by faith in the invisible hand of competition could a not-for-profit collaboration between competing players deliver innovation? Naturally this not-so-traditional idea raised a few questions: Had such a model ever been tried? Even if the model were workable on paper would profit-seeking banks be interested in co-operating with each other?It turned out that a couple of similar examples could in fact be found in the financial sector. Interestingly these came from none other than the bastion of free market capitalismthe United States. Both Visa Inc. (Visa) and Mastercard Incorporated (Mastercard) had been not-for-profit co-operatives with thousands of banks and credit unions across the United States as members. Only recently had these two credit card giants become independent firms. While a co-opetitive model among banks was certainly not without precedence unlike Visa/Mastercard which were private sector initiatives it was the regulator that had championed the idea of a coopetition in India.A creative reimagination of publicprivate collaboration was warranted to solve this collective action problem inhibiting digital growth. After much deliberation a road map and scope of operations for the new firm was drawn up by the RBI and the IBA and the 10 largest commercial banks agreed to go ahead with the plan. These banks included six public sector banks two private sector banks and two multinational banks. To overcome potential resistance to co-operation among competitors the banks were assured that the profits from any transaction would be retained by the bank that executed the transaction while the co-opetitive firm would focus only on innovation. Thus NPCI was born.AN INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURENPCI started its journey in 2008 with the mission of establishing �safe secure sound and efficient payment and settlement systems for the country.� This new venturethe progeny of publicprivate collaborationwas intended to leverage technology to significantly reduce transaction time remain cost efficient and allow interoperability among banks and other payment platforms. It was decided that NPCI would be incubated by the RBI for the first three years after which it would operate independently while being regulated by the RBI. According to NPCI�s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Dilip Asbe the organization�s goal was �to touch every Indian through digital payment platforms.�NPCI�s mandate was to develop a homegrown platform that could be scaled up to create a flexible ecosystem for interoperability. One key issue that needed to be resolved was whether to rely on foreign technology or to develop it in-house. The industry norm was to purchase key technologies from specialist vendors or outsource them entirely. For instance Kenya�s money transfer service M-Pesa used technology from Visa and Bangladesh�s bKash service used technology from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. NPCI on the other hand was completely homegrown which not only provided flexibility but also helped in terms of cost efficiency. As Vishal Anand Kanvaty NPCI�s chief of market innovation explained �We completely insourced our technology. We didn�t want any third-party dependency. We wanted to have complete control of the codes to make changes.�For the new entity to deliver on its promise the RBI and the IBA needed to make sure that the right people were hired the right organizational structure was designed and the right type of rewards metrics were implemented. From the start NPCI deliberately put together a group of people who were not from the RBI or the banking system but rather primarily from the technology sector. It was important that these hires believed in the mission of NPCI. In fact NPCI operated very much like a private entity with its own board independent of both the RBI and the IBA.Both the RBI and the IBA had the foresight to recognize the potential advantages and drawbacks of such publicprivate collaborations. Although being part of a government agency could be useful when it came to offering public goods such close ties might also attract bureaucratic interventionantithetical to innovation. Likewise while private ownership could offer a customer-centric orientation critical for innovation the typical private sector focus on profitability could slow down investments in common payments infrastructure.A not-for-profit multi-bank ownership structure combined with an independent board regulated by the RBI provided NPCI with the best of both worlds. While NPCI�s independence gave it much-needed breathing space to innovate a not-for-profit structure made it possible for NPCI to focus on long-term collective benefits without having to worry about short-run market pressures.CREATING THE FINTECH HIGHWAYNPCI�s first set of innovations was meant to improve existing systems in terms of efficiency and speed� something that clearly benefited all banks who used these systems as well as their ultimate customers. NPCI was able to improve the basic workings of the existing financial system in India. At the time of the launch the RBI handed over to NPCI the responsibility of finding solutions in three areas: (1) expansion of the National Financial Switch (NFS) (2) implementation of the CTS and (3) upgradation of the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS). These technologies were already being developed by the RBI.The NFS became the largest network of shared ATMs in India after NPCI took over its operations from the RBI. In 2009 there were around 50000 ATMs nationwide under the NFS. As of July 2019 the network connected over 241000 ATMs. Thus NPCI was able to bring together under this co-opetitive umbrella not only the large banks but also many smaller regional and co-operative banks. In fact NPCI established tie-ups with several international card schemes�namely Discover Financial Services Japan Credit Bureau and China UnionPay International�allowing international cardholders of these organizations to use ATMs connected to the NFS network.Similarly the CTS became the standard for cheque clearing in India. The process involved capturing the beneficiary�s information encoded in the cheque and sharing it digitally thereby eliminating the need for physical transportation. This reduced the cheque clearing time by up to nine working days. The benefits offered by the CTS apart from the faster clearing cycle included a better verification process same-day local cheque clearing and next-day intercity cheque clearing minimized transaction costs and minimized operational risk by securing the transmission route. Soon after the adoption of the new standards new peaks were achieved in the cheque clearing process.At the time NPCI took over upgrading the ECS system from the RBI multiple systems were in operation at the local regional and national level. These systems were platforms that could be used for repetitive and periodic transactions which were typically large in volume. NPCI consolidated all of these systems running across the country under one web-based solution�the National Automated Clearing House (NACH). Despite being one centralized system NACH allowed enough flexibility to let the member banks design and customize the associated services for their clients. A few months into its launch in July 2013 NACH processed around US$170 million. In September 2020 the amount processed through this system was $17 billion. Almost simultaneously NPCI started working on developing a more efficient solution for interbank fund transfer the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) system. This was the first major platform developed from scratch by NPCI. Transferring funds in real time had been a major problem for the banking industry and IMPS solved this challenge by allowing real-time fund transfers using the NFS thereby improving both the safety and economy of such transactions.The success of these novel interoperability products established NPCI�s reputation as a fintech innovator while improving the ecosystem by creating a common �highway� for the banks. According to Kanvaty �NPCI is the highway that connects all banks on a single platform where all messages are standardized and every bank can talk to any other bank in the country.�A HELPING HAND FROM THE GOVERNMENT: The �JAM TRINITY� AS THE CATALYSTHaving successfully innovated and put in place new systems to improve interoperability among existing players and increase their efficiency the next task for NPCI was to go beyond offering efficiency in interoperability and become a key stakeholder in the nation�s financial inclusion drive.Building trust was key to providing convenient payment solutions for every Indian. As Arif Khan chief digital officer at NPCI reflected: �Building trust in the early days laid the foundation for the growth in the ecosystem of payments.� NPCI started gaining this trust by facilitating instant bank-to-bank transfers greater ATM interoperability and easy linking of bank accounts with mobile phones.However a large portion of the Indian population remained unbanked due to issues on both the supply and demand side of the financial ecosystem. On the demand side unbanked people did not seem to have any real use for banking services. They primarily engaged in localized small-scale economic activities conducting all transactions in cash. Moreover the low levels of literacy and lack of proof of identity among this population segment were impediments for complex economic transactions. On the supply side it was simply not financially feasible for commercial banks to provide services to much of the unbanked population. The potential transaction volumes were too low for the banks to make the services accessible to this section of the population. Thus there was neither demand nor supply for the services among the unbanked population.Three important pieces eventually came together to help NPCI solve the puzzle on the demand side. First there was a remarkably high penetration of mobile phones among the unbanked population. Second the government of India had started issuing Aadhaar cards (national identity cards) to identify much of the population. These cards could be used to resolve the onerous know-your-customer requirements of the central bank. Third if government subsidies for the unbanked population could be channelled through the banking system instead of through the local administration then demand for banking could potentially be ignited. This led the government of India to introduce the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana schemepopularly known as �Jan Dhan� (people�s wealth). Under this scheme individuals no longer needed a minimum amount to open an account which greatly increased the demand for banking services. Together these three componentsJan Dhan Aadhaar cards and mobile phonescame to be known as the JAM trinity.CONNECTING THE DOTS WITH RUPAYWith the JAM trinity in place to spur demand there was a need to improve the supply side. As a way to provide a common channel across multiple banks NPCI launched an affordable card scheme RuPay. Developed from scratch RuPay allowed NPCI to provide similar services as any other card scheme such as Visa or Mastercard at just one-sixth of the cost. The ability to launch a card with low fees incentivized the commercial banks to adopt RuPay immediately. Moreover the pricing structure for RuPay was deliberately kept at a simple flat rate for all customers unlike Visa or Mastercard. This helped in the adoption of RuPay by both larger and smaller banks.Another challenge was to understand the needs of the unbanked. In an effort to do so the banks engaged individuals known as �bank mitras� (friends of the bank) as local bank representatives to help community members open bank accounts. The bank mitras received a commission for every newly opened account and each transaction. The community members trusted the bank mitras with their finances as they knew them personally. This concept became an important pillar for NPCI�s financial inclusion drive as it brought financial services to the customer�s doorstep. The combination of the JAM trinity RuPay cards and bank mitras thus led to a revolution in financial inclusion. The RuPay card issuance drive mandated by Jan Dhan became a massive success leading to more than 600 million RuPay cardholders across India in 2019.Subsidies such as home gas subsidies and insurance benefits started coming directly into the bank accounts of beneficiaries. Three hundred and fifty eight million beneficiaries were part of Jan Dhan with almost $20 billion deposited into bank accounts. Thanks to RuPay and bank mitras almost 80 per cent of the adults in India had bank accounts by 2017 far outpacing other emerging economies (see Exhibit 1). The high penetration of digital banking also facilitated direct government transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.To take full advantage of the recently built national payments ecosystem NPCI had earlier launched three other solutions for facilitating financial inclusion. These were (1) the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) (2) *99# and (3) the Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) System. NPCI launched AePS in 2011 to allow interoperable transactions through micro-ATMs and through the bank mitras of any bank where customers were able to use their Aadhaar card. In 2013 NPCI launched the *99# service for simple mobile-banking transactions based on unstructured supplementary service data (e.g. transfers and payments). The APB System allowed customers to link their bank accounts to Aadhaar numbers thus making it easier to receive funds from various agencies without having to inform them about changes in bank account information. These services facilitated digital payments of government transfers and subsidies thus taking substantial steps toward accelerating digital payments. The next step then was to move payments beyond the banking system and unleash a new wave of financial innovations based on NPCI�s latest fintech solutions.DEMOCRATIZING PAYMENTS THROUGH the Unified Payments InterfaceTo move further into the digital financial payment space NPCI began introducing new innovations targeted at the digitally savvy urban-banked population who now had many choices of payment platforms. While the traditional banking platforms were now more interoperable and efficient this was not the case for the non-bank payment platforms that were popping up everywhere. With the advent of Paytm Google Pay PhonePe and other payment platforms some of which had been introduced by the banks themselves the need arose to make these bank and non-bank payment platforms interoperable. NPCI therefore had to move beyond its original purpose of providing interoperability infrastructure primarily for the banks. In addition to providing interoperability for banks and fintech players NPCI also created its own products. As Praveena Rai NPCI�s chief operating officer commented �Yes it is infrastructure but it goes beyond offering [only] the platform.�The digital innovation drive led to the development of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)�a first of its kind globally and NPCI�s source of pride. This was essentially a payment highway where any payment platform could connect and seamlessly execute inter- and intra-platform transactions. The end-users only needed to remember their UPI ID and they could use any payment platform of their choice. UPI allowed peer-to-merchant and peer-to-peer transactions such as payments at retail stores; transferring money to others; requesting a payment; or authorizing a payment. Kunal Kalawatia chief of marketing at NPCI claimed �One of the innovative things we�ve done with UPI is that I can not only send money but I can also send a request to you saying you owe me this much please pay up. And you can authorize it. So this helps the merchants. UPI is also replacing cash-on-delivery.�Perhaps the most significant impact of UPI was allowing the democratization of the payment systems of which there were several aspects. To begin with UPI was built on protocols that could interact with a variety of payment solutions. It could be used by not only traditional bank and credit card solutions but also the more recent payment platforms such as Paytm WhatsApp Pay and Google Pay among others including NPCI�s very own Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) payment app.Further the open-source technology that NPCI had chosen for UPI made the system more efficient. It also made the system more democratic by reducing the cost of innovation for small fintech players. As Khan explained �The moment you use open source and open stack by definition it allows many more people to participate with you.� Also UPI allowed individual users to pick and choose their payment service providers. For instance it was now possible for customers to keep their funds in one trusted bank while using specialized fintech services for greater convenience. Lastly the greater accessibility lowered the barriers to entry and led to more collaboration between the legacy institutions (such as banks) and fintech organizations. Khan added �Typically the legacy financial organizations see fintech as competitors and they don�t really collaborate. UPI actually allowed the fintechsthe giant fintechs and the start-upsto come together and co-create experiences under a clearly defined set of rules.�In the first three months after the launch of UPI in August 2016 transactions through UPI were approximately $11 million with 26 banks using the platform. In the second quarter of 2020 transactions through UPI reached $83 billion with 155 banks using the platform. NPCI also launched several other platforms that were compatible with UPI.NPCI launched the UPI Chalega (loosely translated as �UPI is accepted here�) campaign in early 2020 to increase widespread acceptance of UPI at merchant locations. In hindsight the campaign turned out to be highly prescientthe benefit of cashless digital transactions was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic which called for social distancing.With NPCI individual banks and other fintech players all creating innovative products the challenge was now to achieve greater acceptance for these innovations. To extend the products� reach NPCI put a substantial amount of time and effort into reaching every Indian. It offered its BHIM app in 17 languages and offered one for the visually impaired. Yet around a quarter of the adult population was not fully able to read or write. NPCI was actively working on the use of icons in its payment systems interface so that people lacking in literacy were able to interpret and make transaction choices thereby helping to increase financial literacy.The use of UPI and the products it supported grew tremendously allowing NPCI to revolutionize India�s payment systems. Asbe NPCI�s CEO pointed out that UPI also stimulated India�s economic growth. Sateesh Palagiri head of mobility solutions for NPCI remarked �UPI brought about a paradigm shift. It acted as a stepping stone for a lot of fintechs and emerged as the first choice for a lot of global giants to venture into retail payments. When I look at the daily volumes today I feel humbled at the enormity magnitude and scale.�KEEPING THE innovation CYCLE GOINGWhile its initial journey had been as a business-to-business firm NPCI became a business-to-business-to-consumer firm with a large range of innovative products and solutions. How had NPCI been able to innovate and launch solution after solution in such a short period of time? When it came to developing novel solutions both NPCI�s extreme customer focus and active stakeholder participation had been instrumental. Kalawatia said �There are 60 banks of various representations giving us inputs in the product development process . . . and the process involves reaching thousands of customers through the participating banks. This experience you cannot replicate in a research.�Anubhav Sharma head of international business for partnership business development and marketing at NPCI International Payments Limited a subsidiary of NPCI and former head of UPI and the IMPS at NPCI concurred. He added that such links to the member banks made all the difference:NPCI worked closely with member banks as stakeholders to align expectations features and functionalities. It is aligned to the democratic philosophy of NPCI that the users of the product and platform have their say in building and shaping it. This not only helped NPCI build UPI as a platform of citizen scale but also helped member banks remain in control of the innovation at the front-end driving consumer behavior and preferences.When it came to implementing those innovative solutions the unique organizational structure of NPCI offered important advantages. The primary customers of NPCI solutions were the banks who were also the owners. As pointed out by Nalin Bansal head of RuPay and the NFS �Typically the adoption [of new solutions] takes a lot of time . . . the fact that NPCI is owned by multiple banks made adoption easier.�To keep the innovation cycle going NPCI identified several important areas that would need careful handling. First NPCI needed to continuously upgrade and refresh its talent pool to keep up with new technologies. For instance capabilities such as blockchain could be valuable one day but the technology could take a different direction the next day requiring NPCI to update its human resources accordingly. Second NPCI would have to encourage a culture of risk-taking. Operating at the frontier of fintech with disruptive solutions launched frequently NPCI needed to look beyond the existing products and solutions and venture into the unknown. Thus the firm made a deliberate decision to inculcate a culture of risk-taking within acceptable limits. The third area was the acceptance of potential cannibalization due to innovation. With several highly successful products NPCI had to decide between being protective of these products or engaging in its own Schumpeterian creative destruction.In addition to the above NPCI also benefited from innovation and stimulated this in others. For instance it launched an accelerator program to encourage collaboration among solution developers in the broader community. This was essentially a web portal that allowed start-ups to connect with the application programming interfaces (API) of NPCI and other global API providers to develop solutions for the banking financial services and insurance industry.making india the GOLD STANDARD FOR digital paymentsWhile NPCI was busy creating new innovations the government moved ahead with its successful Digital India program. An influential committee set up by the RBI concluded that �India with its uniquely rich payment ecosystem is now emerging as a global leader in innovative population-scale payment systems.� NPCI had played an important role in this significant achievement for such a large emerging market as India.To cement India�s role as a global leader the committee advised the RBI to grow digital payments even further by fine tuning the system domestically and by linking it up globally. The committee also advised the RBI on how to mitigate the risks associated with digital payments. With the launch of UPI and RuPay NPCI managed an enormous amount of funds daily. Managing and operating these seamlessly without any glitch was NPCI�s primary security and risk-management concern. The RuPay card for instance was launched in 2012 when there were 375 million credit and debit cards in use in India. In 2019 that number reached 900 million with 600 million cards being RuPay alone. NPCI had to ensure the systems were always available without downtime interruptions disruptions or data loss.Another concern was the cost of digital payments and how to keep them as low as possible for consumers. The committee made various recommendations including stimulating interoperability and allowing more competition for UPI something that was also being discussed in the Indian media. It suggested leaving the so-called merchant discount ratea significant source of income for NPCIto market forces. While in some quarters NPCI was seen as a monopoly Rai clarified that �each product that we created competes with one or the other.� The RBI was trying to find the right balance between market forces common infrastructure and interoperability. The opening up of the market could have implications on the collaborative structure of NPCI enticing some of the member banks to break away from NPCI and create separate interoperability systems.Finally besides fine tuning domestic digital payments the committee strongly recommended NPCI to go global. This involved enhancing the BHIM UPI to allow for currency conversion and overseas remittances with connections to global payment systems. Moving beyond India was a new thrust for NPCI adding to its already busy set of priorities ahead. As Asbe said:Having created a strong infrastructure for digital payments in India NPCI is all geared-up to foray into international markets. With a successful pilot launch of RuPay and UPI in Singapore we wish to realize our ambition and redefine the payment system internationally. It is our vision to be the best payments network globally.Other countries were already paying attention. UPI had the potential to move beyond India and become a public good for the world supporting other countries in building real-time payment systems. In fact The Economist reported in 2020 that Google LLC had written to the US Federal Reserve asking it to endorse a similar model for America.WHAT NEXT: REMAINING FIT FOR PURPOSEAn extraordinary combination of tech innovation and national pride had led NPCI to become a large and successful organization. Looking back several factors could account for NPCI�s unprecedented growth beyond its own innovations. Asbe stressed the important role of the Indian government and the RBI in NPCI�s growth as well as the nurturing

Chinese employees were mostly administrative and service staff recruited locally while non-Chinese employees were mostly expatriates from around the world including Europe North America Latin America Africa Australia and Asia. In their day-to-day work Chinese and non-Chinese staff interacted frequently in a flat and functional organizational structure (i.e. with limited power relations between co-workers).On March 7 2012 one day before International Women’s Day all 244 female staff members of Birkenshire received an email from the human resources (HR) department announcing a gift of pink towels in celebration of the day. Within one hour of this announcement a discussion commenced as an email thread among female staff and continued into the afternoon of March 8. The question facing the management of Birkenshire was whether they should respond and if so how and when.The PINK TOWELSThe email message from HR read as follows: Dear AllTomorrow is International Women’s Day (IWD). The first IWD was observed on March 8 1911. In China March 8 was officially marked as Women’s Day by the government in December 1949. Each year on this day there are hundreds of thousands of activities around the world for the celebrations. Interestingly in China this year to celebrate the upcoming International Women’s Day women in bridal dresses and high-heels took part in a running contest in the Colorful World Park of Changsha capital of the Hunan Province. As with our celebration of IWD this year HR has prepared a towel gift set for each female staff member: We are putting the gifts in your pigeon holes this afternoon (by 4:00 p.m.). For those who do not have a pigeon hole please go to the post room to collect your gift when you are free.The subsequent discussion included female staff with a few male staff in management positions copied. The first response read like this:I don’t want this to be mistaken as ingratitude but I do start to wonder what kind of image of women is reproduced here? We have in the past been treated to pink-glitter picture frames and visits to kitchenware factories and now the company is showing how much it is caring about our physical appearance by offering us pink towels! As a woman who has gained a Ph.D. and a decent job in a corporate environment that is still very much dominated by white men I’m very aware of the struggle many women have had to go through to reach such a position. Up to this day it still happens regularly that people I newly meet will turn to my husband and ask him what his work is in China. When he answers that it is me who is working here they kindly ask if I am a language teacher! Certainly no woman can be an executive!Because of this obvious continued subtle and open discrimination of women I feel that these kinds of presents are absolutely not the appropriate way of celebrating Women’s Day. The company should set a good example in recognizing the professional achievements of the women working here instead of joining the general patriarchal chorus that sees women at work as a temporary maybe even regrettable incidence and thinks that women should rather care about their looks (towels) home (kitchenware) and children whose picture would look extremely nice in pink-glitter picture frames. There are certainly books DVDs and other kinds of gifts which express respect for women’s intellectual and professional qualities rather than reducing them to pink towels!  Staff ASome of the following comments expressed sympathy with the above statement.Well said. I totally agree. The money could be far better spent on contributing to causes to help other women in China. Staff BI support the sentiments expressed. Another idea might be to offer a fund for young women to pursue higher education. Staff CSoon the discussion expanded its focus and began to take on other issues.I’ve lived and worked in three different countries—the United States the United Kingdom and China—and have to say this: it is nice to be receiving a gift in the workplace to commemorate such a day as it is not something I expected. It is special to be in China so I take it as part of the wonderful Chinese protocols. However as you pointed out the symbolism of the items selected is deeply rooted and as one of the few women holding a high position in the company it is appropriate that you point it out. Perhaps next year more individuals can be consulted about what might constitute an appropriate gift to mark this occasion before someone goes shopping with the company’s money? The idea of a contribution to a cause for women in China sounds like a great idea and something most of us could agree on. Staff DThe following comment took a personal perspective and further expanded the focus:Thanks to [Staff D] for reminding us all of the fact that we are in China which as you correctly point out has its own protocols—the symbolism of which is very deeply rooted. On that point maybe the following may shed more light. My mother who was born and brought up in China before emigrating returned to the land of her birth just once (in 1973 and by boat) when she brought amongst other things bales of towels for the very reason that towels have long been popular presents for men and women in China. As for the colour it should be remembered that whilst the choice of pink has certain connotations in countries such as Germany and Britain it has no such connotation in China as far as I am aware.As for Britain I worked there for 20 years in two organizations where my employers never once offered any material token of their appreciation for all my hard work. The tokens of appreciation offered by Birkenshire are therefore much appreciated by me as I accept them in the spirit in which I feel they are meant. Staff EThe two following commentators also expressed their appreciation for the gift:Yes [Staff E] I agree with you and thank you for your comments. Actually most of us Chinese staff appreciate the gift from the company. We don’t think too much about it. This case might be a good example of what “cultural conflict” is . . . . Staff FThank you for such an interesting email [Staff E]. You are right about the colour issue in China. Do look around and you will see how pink has a different connotation here. I could not agree with you more in appreciating the gesture from Birkenshire. I am happy to belong to a work environment that expresses recognition for my work through such small details. Thank you to the people who thought about us the women at Birkenshire and thank you for the little token. Staff GAt this point the first commentator Staff A provided further input to the ongoing discussion:I’m sorry that this issue is now interpreted as a cultural conflict. This is absolutely not the case. I do not object at all that a present is given nor do I want to contest that pink/red might have another meaning or that towels are not seen as offensive. What I am objecting to however is that women are given household goods as gifts by their employer. If towels are a common gift in China then I can assume that men too receive pink (lucky) towels as gifts from the company? No of course not. I would imagine though that key rings agendas purses business card holders and similar items of daily use can be given as gifts too; right? Why then household goods to working women? This is a gender issue and not a cultural one. It is about appreciating women’s work and not about Chinese versus Western culture.The conversation continued to split from there with more comments and perspectives being contributed:Different women have different views towards gifts. I just got the pink towels and they are lovely. I really love them. Staff HI am a working woman and hope to become an executive in the future. I don’t think someone or my employer buying me a pink towel or a business card holder could change the fact that I am a professional woman. I’d interpret the type of gift being selected here simply because compared to business card holders towels could be useful to everyone. I have to say having lived and worked in the United Kingdom for more than 10 years the last one and half years at Birkenshire have been very different but certainly memorable to me as I feel I have been recognized and considered after all the hard work. I very much appreciate all gifts being offered by Birkenshire not just the money being spent but the idea the time and people who organize all of these. To some extent I won’t mind any gift being offered. Staff IAlthough “cultural conflict” makes the issue sound more fun I have to agree with Staff A that this is a gender issue instead of a cultural one. As a Chinese person I am not bothered at all by the pink towels or red but as a woman I do find it ironic to have this “Women’s Day.” Does it mean all the rest of the year are men’s days? I would rather there were solid regulations considering working women’s welfare for instance longer maternity leave or better/more chance for professional development etc. That said I will still pick up my pink towels. Just hoping next year or in the near future we can see a difference and not just pink towels.  Staff JIt’s a real shame that in an organization where thinking is exactly what we are meant to do Staff A’s astute points about gender get distorted into ingratitude to the hospitality that China offers and worse escalates into the ever-convenient discourse of a Western attack on China. She is spot on. Staff KThe first commentator Staff A continued to offer more input:The Day of Women’s Rights and International Peace actually celebrates: www.un.org/ ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womday97.htm; www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html. Women’s Day is to remind us that women’s rights had to be fought for and that this is still the case today. It’s not Mother’s Day.The email discussion continued on until the afternoon of March 8 before eventually quieting down. During the course of discussion the management of Birkenshire had not responded but a few (male) staff in top management positions including the head of HR and the chief executive officer were copied on the emails and therefore were aware of the discussion while it developed.

His prior experience as vice-president of product engineering in another leading global company matched IR’s desired candidate profile. The position was established to lead IR’s ETCs in India to a new path making them more efficient and effective. IR India established its ETCs in 2004 to support the product development activities of different IR businesses in India and abroad. Soon after he joined Madhavan found that the ETCs were not able to perform as designed. Projects were missing their delivery targets and there were major differences in the understanding of the requirements among the strategic business unit (SBU) teams which led to continuous changes in deliverables and resulted in customer dissatisfaction. Key employees of the ETCs were unhappy and some high performing team members left the organization. In general the ETCs were designed to cater to the needs of the various SBUs. However without effective support from these centres the company’s SBUs could outsource work to private companies threatening the existence of the ETCs as internal service providers. In early 2012 only a few months after joining the ETCs Madhavan was assessing the situation and determining whether he had the right organizational configuration to grow and sustain the ETCs in IR India. History of Ingersoll Rand: The parent companyIR was a US$13 billion diversified industrial company that had been operating in numerous countries since 1871 and traded under the stock exchange symbol NYSE:IR. The first invention that led to the establishment of the company originally called the Ingersoll Rock Drill Company was a steam powered rock drill (see Exhibit 1) invented by Simon Ingersoll (1818–1894). The drill was instrumental in excavation mining tunnelling and highway construction. The company further specialized in heavy tools developing other useful products such as the hammer drill jackhammer drill downhole drill stopper drill paving breaker air-operated hoists clay diggers riveting hammers chipping hammers and grinders. In 1902 the company developed the first portable compressor and began a compressor line of business to go along with its tool business. However the company was known largely for its rock-drill products and enjoyed a narrowly focused industrial company image until the year 2000. In that year Herbert Henkel the company’s chief executive officer at the time attempted to change that image by changing its logo. However his efforts met with limited success. In 2005 the company engaged in further re-branding exercises. It identified a strategy to more broadly change its image—“to inspire progress by unleashing the potential in people and technologies.” IR hoped to do this by diversifying from a maker of “construction/heavy machinery” to a company that would be active in the “diversified industrial” sector. Since 2000 IR also made a number of acquisitions particularly in the non-construction and non-heavy-machinery sectors (see Exhibit 1). The company decided to focus on integrated home solutions by investing in security technologies and manufacturing door locks. It made its largest investment in 2008 when it acquired Trane Inc. a global leader in indoor climate-control systems and solutions valued at $10.1 billion. In 2011 IR operated in various different business units including the following:Climate Solutions: Climate-control products delivered energy-efficient refrigeration and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment as well as refrigeration for transport stationary refrigeration and manager-controlled temperature environments. This segment included leading brands such as Hussmann Thermo King and Trane.Residential Solutions: A broad segment of residential products and services which were only available in North and South America provided safety comfort and efficiency to homeowners. This range of products and services included mechanical and electronic locks energy-efficient HVAC systems indoor air-quality products advanced controls portable security systems and remote home management products. This segment included such brands as American Standard Schlage and Trane.Industrial Technologies: The industrial technologies segment included products and services that enhanced energy efficiency productivity and operations. The range of products and services included compressed air systems tools pumps fluid-handling systems golf and utility vehicles and micro turbines. This segment included such brands as Club Car and Ingersoll Rand.Security Technologies: The security technologies segment included products related to electronic and biometric access control systems and software; locks and locksets; door closers; exit devices; steel doors and frames; portable security devices; and time attendance and personnel scheduling systems. The focus of the scheduling systems was on various different markets including commercial construction health care retail maritime transport education and government procurement. The brands included CISA LCN Schlage and Von Duprin.Ingersoll Rand in India IR started its India operation in Kolkata in 1921 making it the oldest Indo-U.S. joint venture company in India. In 1958 it opened a branch in Ahmedabad and established the first Indian manufacturing facility in Naroda Ahmedabad in 1965 where small garage-type reciprocating air compressors were produced. In 1978 IR established its second manufacturing plant in Bangalore for production of construction mining and water-well-drilling equipment. The company produced compressors in the United States and only customized them slightly in India in the initial phase. In 1983 the Naroda plant started assembling screw compressors and in 1989 packaging the centrifugal compressors under the brand name Centac. The centrifugal compressor was a breakthrough technology because it had a higher flow capacity it was more reliable and it required less maintenance compared to the reciprocating compressors commonly sold at that time. The plant also started manufacturing gas compressors in 1994 and received ISO 9000 certification in 2000. In addition the company acquired a majority stake in Wadco Tools which was based in Sahibabad India. The company launched an indigenously built hydraulic drifter drill in 2001. The plant at Naroda expanded to other areas of production as the company decided to shift the production of its polyethylene terephthalate packaging facility from the United States to Ahmedabad. The manufacturing of the rotary compressor facility was also shifted from Bangalore to Naroda. The Indian economy showed resilience in 2008–09 during the global economic crisis. In 2008 IR experienced weaker demand globally for its products and services and an internal analysis predicted that the outlook would be similar in 2009 as the markets saw a decline in North America and Western Europe which accounted for a majority of its sales. The revenues from the newly acquired Trane were also on a decline except in the Asian markets. Therefore it was important for the company to direct its focus to the growing markets in Asia including India (see Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3). In addition the lower cost of production in India meant that it was lucrative for the company to increase its focus on India. The years 2008 and 2009 saw an increased transfer of manufacturing from the United States and Europe to Indian facilities. The company had already transferred production of blowers to Naroda from Europe. The company wanted to move to India the production of four product families comprising 67 models which would result in an increase in annual export potential of $2.6 million. The company also started a repair and rebuild facility in Naroda to increase recurring revenues. IR’s former chairman and chief executive officer Henkel stated in an interview in 2009 that the company planned to make India a major manufacturing hub and that in the following three years the company planned to invest about $100 million in its Indian operations to double the size of the company. Energy efficiency climate-control and security technologies were key focus areas for the company in addition to local manufacturing innovation and market-centric product development in areas such as food preservation. The company was also looking to start a new manufacturing facility that would primarily cater to manufacturing products for the heating ventilation and air conditioning industry. It would also focus on products for transport air conditioning and food security. The foundation of this growth appeared to be customer-driven innovation a robust infrastructure to support after-sales services a significant investment in facilities to transform the company into a world-class manufacturing operation with a customer-first mindset and a drive to fulfil customer needs. In May 2009 for the first time the company named a president of Indian operations and outlined three focus areas for IR’s India operations: growth innovation and productivity. The Engineering and Technology Centres The ETCs were started in 2004 with ambitious goals: accelerate innovation; leverage key India-based competencies in advanced software design next-generation controls automation solutions mechanical design and systems simulation; and design energy-efficient competitive products and solutions for India and emerging markets. Every SBU of the company had its own set of engineers such as product engineers (for mechanical) or controls engineers (for electrical and software). The ETCs worked with the company SBUs in emerging economies and took on jobs that the in-house development teams of the SBUs did not have the time or expertise to complete such as new product development and product improvement. The two centres located in Bangalore and Chennai aimed to contribute to IR’s global growth by providing high-tech niche engineering solutions and technologies as well as providing support for regional product development. The centre at Chennai had been a part of Trane before it was acquired by IR in 2008.The focus of these technology centres was to support product development needs of the SBUs and create market opportunities “in India for India by India.” The ETCs were to invest 30 per cent of their time creating products and services for India and the rest creating products and services for the global businesses. The ETCs were able to develop B-100 a refrigerated transport technology for the Indian environment. The product—designed for “last mile” distribution of temperature-controlled and refrigerated products to ensure that perishable food items such as fruits and vegetables remained fresh during transport—was designed with a bare minimum of special features which was necessary and affordable to meet the needs of the local customer. Another product that was developed by ETC was the Trane residential split air conditioner with a Zigbee wireless remote control capability. Trane the air conditioning brand acquired in 2008 catered to the commercial space segment which included hotels and offices. Trane wanted to enter the residential segment in India because it was a growing market. The idea received instant support and a compelling business case was created. The climate-control business leader also liked the idea and prepared a product portfolio for both short- and long-term plans. The team developed an advanced interactive remote control device (see Exhibit 4) that was a key differentiator in the drive to educate the customer in the running efficiency of the air conditioning unit. Internal studies suggested that to feel comfortable within an office environment a differential of 5°C from the external environment was adequate. However people were known to keep their homes and offices at 18°C which did not allow the air conditioner to work efficiently. The industrial design of this residential air conditioning segment was completed and the product was launched. The product was well received but did not meet the forecasted sales volumes. It was felt that Trane’s lack of brand image in the residential segment its premium pricing and the connected home solution with automated locks made this product appear too futuristic for the Indian market. Structure of the ETCEach ETC was divided into two functions: mechanical product engineering and controls engineering. Mechanical product engineering dealt with both design and manufacturing aspects of a product. Controls engineering on the other hand used sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements were then used to give feedback through intelligent software logic to the input actuators that made corrections towards the desired performance. Controls engineering also housed the software development team. However because IR was a traditional engineering-focused organization the team’s software capability did not meet the desired level. The teams of mechanical product and controls were housed at each SBU who reported to the ETC head. New employees who joined ETC would become associated with a particular SBU and would dedicate time working for that specific SBU. Normally these employees would not be reassigned to a different SBU because they usually worked on specific product domains and technologies. This also meant that each SBU always needed to be ready to support these employees by providing an adequate number of projects. Problems Faced by the ETCsAfter his arrival Madhavan found that for many of the ETC projects its clients (i.e. SBUs) would change the initial project specifications at a later stage leading to confusion misunderstanding and delay in the project delivery. The project’s documents were unable to resolve such issues. Many unintended conflicts with clients emerged. The ETCs were at a disadvantage because in most cases they would have to accommodate the SBUs’ demands and work on the changed specifications. SBUs would also ask for periodical updates on the projects undertaken which the ETC teams working on the project would find difficult to satisfactorily provide in many cases. Often the engineers working on the projects would provide vague answers such as “we are on schedule.” However the concerned business unit would not be given details on aspects of the project that were completed or that remained to be done. If the SBU employees asserted that the ETC team had not delivered it was difficult to prove otherwise with available data. To address a query about the status of the project a meeting of all the counterparts involved had to be called requiring numerous meetings to obtain the status of all projects. Most projects would involve a team where members worked in different geographic locations. The updates would be sent by e-mail and it would be difficult for managers to monitor the status on a dashboard. Different SBUs also had different systems for product development making it difficult for the ETCs to align their own systems to all the different SBUs thereby adding to the chaos and confusion. The situation was even more complex due to some third-party vendors involved in the process. For example the ETCs would enter into a partnership with a vendor for a project’s specific need without specific deliverables confirmed upon the contract’s signing. This would result in the client (i.e. the SBU) not accepting the final output and the vendor sometimes refusing to redo the work claiming that the work was delivered as expected. This process would result in a blame game ultimately affecting the project at hand.Problems related to people development processesIR India also lagged behind in people development processes which were common across the company’s global counterparts. For example the U.S. company had a strong emphasis on development planning meetings between employees and their managers. However managers in India did not actively participate in the development planning process. In fact managers would just write down their employees’ development requirements each year with no follow up during the year. Human resources (HR) required employees to complete development planning forms every year. One of the managers in India recalled his experience with the development planning process stating that “development planning is just something on paper . . . we used to just copy and paste the same thing since the last five years. Nothing ever happened with reference to what we wrote.”The local talent review process was weak with no data available on key talent and successors. Talent prospects were weak at the leadership level and at the next two levels and no potential future ETC leader had been identified. There were no potential successors for 20 per cent of positions at the next level nor for 51 per cent of positions at the level after that. At the results announcements of each employee performance evaluation employee promotions were also announced. Many employees who were not promoted after the performance review (conducted biannually) would choose to leave the company at that time as they saw this as a twice a year opportunity to get promoted.In 2012 a new HR team was established by the IR India management. The new team headed by Savina Verma realized that a lot of work was needed to make the ETCs more efficient in terms of process and people practices in order to create best-in-class ETCs. In one of its first initiatives the new HR team implemented an employee pulse survey called “Your Ideas Our Future” (see Exhibit 5). The survey invited employees to identify their pain points and suggest ideas for improvement. One survey question asked the employees if they felt that they received the right kind of training. The feedback from employees to this question was generally negative. Employees felt that training was based mostly on managerial nominations and the choice of training programs for employees was left to the discretion of the manager. One manager recalled his experience with the training program as follows:Every year there used to be a program on root cause analysis. Every year we used to attend because my manager used to nominate me. So we used to attend. . . . I had undergone the same training three times. Did it add any value to me? Probably not because I never got to work on any project that really used that. Why this used to happen I will tell you. We used to do competency mapping. So every time they used to ask me “Do you know the subject?” I would say “Yes.” Then they asked “Have you implemented it?” I would say “No.” So they would say that is why we need to give you another training [session].After further probing from the HR team it was found that employees wanted technical training. For example geometric dimensioning and tolerancing training for mechanical engineers was common in the U.S. company but it was a skill that engineers in India particularly struggled with. There were several such technical areas where training was required but the HR team members had little information about the kind of technical competency needed because it was beyond their level of expertise.There also appeared to be a sense of distance between various units and hierarchy levels. For example the engineering services team and technical publication team at the lowest level of the business hierarchy did not see themselves as important parts of the organization. The engineering services team designed computer-aided design jobs based on input received from product designers. The technical publication team wrote the manuals for the products. The employees at this level could only be promoted to product engineer which was the lowest position in the mechanical and controls division. Individuals who loved to do technical work were promoted to people management positions. However only some of them were considered competent in their new roles. Other managers who had been promoted still preferred to do technical work rather than to manage people. The HR team however had little knowledge of the competencies of each manager. If a manager’s post for one of the client SBUs became vacant the HR team would find it difficult to identify a suitable successor. Additionally the transfer of talent from one project to another was difficult to manage. The ETC employee engagement survey reported an engagement level in 2011 of 68 per cent which dropped slightly to 67 per cent in September 2012. The Road AheadIn the years that IR existed in India the company grew from a firm selling imported products manufactured outside India to a company assembling and selling products in India. The recent strategy was to manufacture products in India primarily for the Indian market as well as for export. Because India was a price-conscious market it was important to develop relevant products to capture available gaps in the market. The ETCs were created specifically to partner with the Indian SBUs in climate-control products and industrial technologies to help them develop relevant products useful for emerging markets. According to NASSCOM the Indian offshore engineering research and development market was expected to reach $37–$45 billion by 2020 driven by an increase in global spending.In his new role Madhavan assessed how the ETCs could be leveraged to support IR and how best to align people places and processes with a strategy to prepare for the future. He knew that although the ETCs were supported by the global businesses the SBUs were also free to explore other private vendors for projects if the ETCs did not meet their needs. The ETCs were created to be innovation-driven units. It was difficult to think about increasing the rate of innovation when employees were dealing with organizational frustrations. The ETCs needed to change to ensure that they could develop as an effective organization focused on the IR goals.

This increased scale will drive further efficiencies and benefits to both Tassal’s salmon offering as well as seafood and uniquely position Tassal for its next phase of growth.Mark Ryan chief executive officer (CEO) of Tassal Group LimitedIn August 2018 Tassal Group Limited (Tassal) signed a deal to acquire a shrimp farming business from the Fortune Group’s prawn aquaculture business. This strategic move was to further diversify from its core salmon market to a seafood market. Earlier in July 2015 Tassal announced the acquisition of De Costi Seafoods Company (De Costi) in a deal of combined cash and shares. The acquisition would allow Tassal to address a A$4.3 billion Australian seafood market that was much larger than the previously addressable salmon market of only $700 million while simultaneously improving their economies of scale and scope in production logistics and retailing. Such species diversification was not a new strategy for Tassal: in 2013 the company launched the Salamanca brand for wholesaling imported Norwegian salmon in Australia. Tassal was the largest among the three major producers of premium Tasmanian salmon farmed in inshore pens located in Macquarie Harbour. However the harbour had been under the scrutiny of the Australian authority for mass production and adverse environmental impacts. Given the problems with Macquarie Harbour Tassal’s CEO Mark Ryan had many questions to answer: Should Tassal continue to expand overseas? What were the motives behind the acquisition of De Costi? Did the company have sufficient capabilities and resources to cope with the high demand for Tasmanian salmon particularly in the Asian market? Did the acquisition address Tassal’s vision and its long-term strategy?HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENTTassal was founded in 1986 on the island state of Tasmania Australia as a small salmon farm and hatchery. It was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2003 with headquarters in Hobart Tasmania’s capital. It believed in vertical integration as an effective strategy as early as 2007 when its first salmon shop and restaurant were opened. In 2010 it was Australia’s largest salmon producer sharing 70 per cent of the country’s production. Tassal opened a second hatchery and salmon shop in Kew Melbourne in the same year. In 2011 it launched innovative products such as Tassal Gourmet Salmon Smallgoods and Tassal Salt Reduced Smoked Salmon. In 2013 it launched Salamanca Seafood Company to sell high-quality smoked Norwegian Atlantic salmon to the domestic wholesale market.Growth StrategyTassal had grown through several mergers and acquisitions. It acquired some of the 11 companies that owned leases in Tasmanian waters becoming the industry leader with its high market share and large variety of distribution channels. Tassal provided customers with a large variety of fresh smoked canned and frozen salmon products under various brands including Tassal Superior Gold Tasmanian Smokehouse De Costi Seafood and Salamanca Seafood. As a vertically integrated company Tassal had supply chains scattered throughout the state—freshwater hatcheries saltwater aquaculture sales and marketing and distribution and retail (see Exhibit 1). It also had a sales and marketing office on the mainland in Melbourne Victoria.Tassal focused on increasing the per capita consumption of salmon in the Australian market increasing the margins by improving production processes and strengthening market promotions. Australians were willing to pay slightly more for domestic-quality seafood. Increased fish supply better pricing and efficiency improvements had driven the growth of Tassal’s revenues and profits. Tassal derived 70 per cent and 30 per cent of its revenues from the domestic and export market respectively. The salmon and seafood segments accounted for approximately 84 per cent and 16 per cent of the company’s total sales respectively. Domestic consumption was thus particularly important to maintaining Tassal’s profitability as it could compensate for exchange rate fluctuations in the export market. These factors had contributed to Tassal’s financial performance in 2016. Brand StrategyThe Tassal brand dedicated for the local Tasmanian salmon was Tassal’s cornerstone. Other brands were also introduced for salmons from other areas. For example in 2013 the company created the Salamanca Seafood brand for selling imported Norwegian salmon to Australian wholesalers. It was also a hedge against risks in locally farmed salmons. The acquisition of De Costi in 2015 was also intended for brand and product extension.AccreditationsIn 2012 Tassal joined WWF-Australia (World Wide Fund for Nature) in a three-year partnership project. It was the only salmon producer in Australia that was authorized to use the WWF logo on product packaging. The company had received numerous awards for achieving the highest global standard of responsible seafood production. In 2012 it was the first salmon producer in Australia to achieve the full Best Aquaculture Practices certification at the farm level by the Global Aquaculture Alliance. In 2014 it was the first company to achieve Aquaculture Stewardship Council certification the gold-star rating of sustainable salmon farming.COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT The Australian fisheries and aquaculture industry was a minor producer and exporter producing less than 0.2 per cent of the global market share which was valued at approximately $3.1 billion. Tasmanian salmon was a premium product selling at a better price in the local market. In 2016 Australia’s salmon farming industry was worth more than $700 million. There were a few major domestic players and international competitors.Tasmania’s second-largest salmon farmer behind Tassal was Huon Aquaculture Limited (Huon) founded in 1986 and headquartered in Dover Tasmania. Due to a strong domestic demand and premium prices for Tasmanian salmon Huon mainly focused on the domestic market’s wholesalers supplying salmon to restaurants supermarkets fishmongers and other food businesses.Founded in 1949 Petuna Seafoods Tasmania (Petuna) leased fishing pens in the Macquarie Harbour alongside Huon and Tassal. In 2010 it sold half of its shares to Sealord Group Limited an Australian and New Zealand global seafood enterprise creating opportunities for major facility upgrades and large infrastructure investments including marine farms and hatcheries.Van Diemen Aquaculture Limited and Saltas Limited were relatively small compared to the first three producers of Atlantic salmon—Tassal Huon and Petuna. The former was a sea farmer while the latter mainly operated hatcheries. Both were privately owned and sold products domestically.To meet the strong domestic demand it was necessary to import salmon from overseas. However international competitors were not seen as a threat to the three major domestic players as the imports still allowed them to maintain competitive pricing with a relatively higher quality product.ACQUISITION OF DE COSTI SEAFOODSIn July 2015 Tassal announced the acquisition of De Costi to combine salmon and seafood markets into its operations. This strategic move was intended to ensure the sales growth and returns of its seafood category. The resulting increased scale would strengthen efficiencies and benefits in Tassal’s salmon and seafood categories while preparing the company for future growth. De Costi was a logical target because it was one of the largest players in the Australian seafood industry.In 1974 George Costi and his wife started out with a small fish stall at Paddington Markets in Sydney before founding De Costi in 1981. Its head office procurement and distribution centres were in Lidcombe New South Wales. From a humble beginning De Costi had developed into one of Australia’s largest fresh seafood suppliers. Its facilities were fully automated with large areas to facilitate huge volumes of seafood processing and packaging for further distribution.De Costi distributed its seafood products mostly to the eastern side of Australia and South Australia. Its main customer was Woolworths Group Limited a major Australian company with extensive retail interests throughout Australia and New Zealand. It also supplied to Metcash Limited which was Australia’s leading wholesale distribution and marketing company. In 2015 De Costi’s turnover was approximately $138 million with an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $10 million and net profit before tax of approximately $5.3 million (see Exhibit 2).Motivations The acquisition would allow Tassal to access a larger combined salmon and seafood market in Australia. In 2015 the total seafood industry in Australia was worth $4.3 billion of which salmon and other seafood were worth $0.7 billion and $3.6 billion respectively. The acquisition could bring about synergies within the two entities including product expansion and production efficiency. Tassal could continue to improve existing production facilities while creating new ones including new fish pens without large capital outlays.By joining forces with De Costi Tassal could improve its customer value proposition with a wider and more sustainable product range. Tassal could also improve category management of its new seafood products. The acquisition would improve Tassal’s product technology and innovation thereby increasing its product exposure in Australia’s states and export markets. It would also open new opportunities for Tassal in other food services and help the company build relationships with other retail stores. The acquisition would allow Tassal to focus on its original brand in wholesaling while expanding the retail base through the De Costi brand. The move would also align perfectly with Tassal’s strategy to create and maintain multiple brands and to avoid diluting its original brand. According to Ryan the acquisition had put in place the right foundations for Tassal to pursue the salmon and seafood strategy. The acquisition would help Tassal maintain its overall profitability in the face of uncertainty in local fish farming changes in climatic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations for international markets. During fiscal year (FY) 2016 Tassal was faced with higher costs and less-than-optimal supply due to warm water throughout the summer and autumn months while a high percentage of retail sales volume and pricing were already locked in. These unfavourable issues were reflected in Tassal’s financials for the second half of 2016 where the salmon revenue was comparatively lower than expected.Terms of the Acquisition DealThe payment for the acquisition comprised two components—first an upfront cash payment of $50 million at the completion of the proposed acquisition; second a growth-based earnout payable in new Tassal shares over each of the three financial years from FY 2016 to 2018. The compliance restructuring alignment and integration costs for De Costi amounted to $1.1 million.In particular the upfront payment was based on a multiple of five times the maintainable EBITDA of De Costi’s business in 2015 which was about $10 million. The growth-based earnout depending on meeting the performance targets would also be paid for approximately five times the maintainable EDITDA over the three-year period from FY 2016 to 2018. This contingent earnout was capped at a maximum nominal amount of $30 million and a maximum of 10 million new Tassal shares for that entire period.Under such contingent payment Tassal issued 2.1 million new shares to De Costi (based on its FY 2016 performance) which were 65.6 per cent of the maximum possible earnout for that year (see Exhibit 3). Because of De Costi’s increased post-acquisition operating performance in FY 2017 Tassal issued two million new shares to De Costi which were 60 per cent of the maximum possible earnout for FY 2017.Financial ImpactsTassal had restructured De Costi to ensure that it provided a solid operating platform for Tassal’s sustainable growth initiatives. The restructuring addressed inefficiencies in the seafood supply chain while integrating Tassal’s best practices to increase operational capabilities and further synergies. Despite higher salmon costs and relatively locked-in domestic channel sales Tassal had achieved good performance due to its efficient production and supply chain—particularly in the wholesale market. Such supply chain efficiencies could be partly attributed to De Costi’s strong location advantage which enabled it to service retailers along the east coast of Australia and South Australia. In particular Tassal’s EBITDA in FY 2016 was up by 4 per cent to $97.29 million (see Exhibit 4). This increase was partly due to additional earnings from De Costi and improved operational efficiencies of balancing the product mix. Importantly the cash flow had also increased to $50.2 million which could buffer Tassal from adverse conditions—especially from the local salmon farming—while facilitating its investments for profitability and growth in the long-term. In FY 2016 Tassal also received a five-year tenor of core debt facilities from existing Westpac Banking Corporation and Bankwest which provided the company sufficient leeway to counter agricultural risks and allowed it to consider expansion opportunities.Following the acquisition in FY 2016 however Tassal’s net debt had increased to $69.6 million ($48.9 million of which was used to fund the acquisition). The gearing ratio and funding ratio had also increased (see Exhibit 5). In the first half of 2018 Tassal reported a growth in revenue and operating earnings of 23 per cent and a growth in operating cash flows of 69.2 per cent to $40.6 million. The higher cash flows and the capital raised in the second half of 2017 had significantly reduced the gearing ratio to 13 per cent which provided greater flexibility for long-term investments. These positive figures had substantially strengthened Tassal’s overall financial position. The earnout arrangements could be tricky for De Costi especially when the earnout was tied to the company’s profits or sales. In particular De Costi would become a division of Tassal and have to achieve some mutually agreed upon goals and it could not fully control the necessary resources to achieve them. However the integration had improved the earnings of both entities. In particular Tassal reported an additional expense of $6.7 million to be paid from the company as part of the terms for the earnout payment in FY 2017.Tassal’s operational focus on De Costi’s advantages—innovative product and packaging supply chain efficiencies strong distribution of seafood in Australia’s eastern seaboard and species diversification—was a success as the seafood revenue in the first half of 2018 grew to $42.5 million from $41.1 million and $35.7 million in the same period of 2017 and 2016 respectively. With Tassal’s market dynamics and De Costi’s supply chain efficiencies the combined entity had been successful in species diversification. The acquisition allowed Tassal to effectively put in place a strong set of competencies—particularly in vertical integration from aquaculture to processing and marketing—to diversify into the wider seafood market.Strategic ImpactsThe acquisition of De Costi—one of the market leaders in the seafood industry with strong retail outlets—was a very important strategic move that allowed Tassal to address a much larger Australian seafood market of $4.3 billion from the previously addressable salmon market of only $700 million. This acquisition was a major pivot point in Tassal’s product portfolios and technology to ensure strong sustainable growth. The acquisition had helped in driving Tassal’s seafood sales through a better use of supply chain channels and an optimization of operational costs. Tassal was shifting its focus to a balanced marketing mix by reducing the retail sales and focusing more on the larger volume of the wholesale market. The company was also focused on improving product and packaging and a balanced salmon number and weight. The strategic shift had helped Tassal to improve cash flows and optimize returns.The vision of both companies aligned well in that the De Costi mantra was to source the best-tasting freshest seafood possible while Tassal aimed to create a better tomorrow for the industry. As George Costi the company’s former CEO agreed to continue managing the operations of seafood products for at least three years the post-acquisition integration had proceeded smoothly. This friendly acquisition was successful as De Costi’s seafood segment continued to grow within the Tassal group. The acquisition fulfilled Tassal’s quest for species diversification from salmonids to the entire seafood segment. In 2018 Tassal signed a deal via a De Costi subsidiary to acquire a shrimp farm for over $20 million from the Fortune Group’s prawn aquaculture business aiming to increase its shrimp production sixfold. The acquisition of prawn farms was a further step in its diversification. With the market value of $750 million in 2015 prawns were a major segment in the Australian seafood market that still had a shortfall in supply of approximately $420 million. Due to the strict regulations for obtaining a prawn-farming licence it was easier to simply acquire a company to overcome that entry barrier. This further step would be facilitated by leveraging De Costi’s supply chain advantages and Tassal’s market leadership. Species diversification was a risky move if the parties involved were not familiar with the associated risks in the new segments. Tassal’s prior experience in pioneering vertical integration in the salmon business would be a valuable asset for the company to replicate this expertise in other seafood segments in order to drive category growth (see Exhibit 6).Based on sales channels the Australian seafood industry was divided into retail food service and institutional markets. The acquisition of De Costi had given Tassal easy access to the retail seafood market. Although the seafood segment accounted for less than 20 per cent of Tassal’s total revenue the acquisition of De Costi had allowed Tassal to leverage both companies’ market positioning and supply chain efficiency to further improve market share in both salmon and seafood.TROUBLES IN MACQUARIE HARBOURSalmon farming was introduced in Tasmania in the 1980s after it was found that this island state could successfully farm Atlantic salmon. Tasmanian salmon was considered a fine delicacy and a premium product in Australia. Among 11 companies only the three large salmon farmers—Tassal Huon and Petuna—remained farming salmon in Tasmanian waters. Tasmania was the largest salmon export state in Australia (see Exhibit 7). Macquarie Harbour was the first place where intensive salmon farming started in Australia. It was located on the west coast of Tasmania bordering on a wilderness World Heritage Site. These three companies were still farming salmon in this inlet. The production capacity of salmon pens in the harbour had more than doubled over the last few years up until 2018.However the environmental impact of salmon farming on the area had put the harbour in a state of stress. The Environment Protection Authority which was Tasmania’s principal environmental regulator stated that 21000 tons of fish feed had ended up on the sea floor in 2015 creating huge areas of waste. The specialists stated that the natural landscape of Macquarie Harbour was not suitable for intensive farming due to its narrow inlet known as Hell’s Gates. The inlet was not wide enough to create a big enough tide to help drain the harbour of the feces and fish feed that were ending up on the sea floor. Such deposits were detrimental to the sustainability of the ecology and the farm’s production capacity was forced to step down to 9000 tons in 2018 from 21500 tons in 2017.In 2016 Tassal accounted for about 70 per cent of the state’s farmed salmon—a capital-intensive industry with a three-year harvesting cycle. Tassal owned three leases in Macquarie Harbour. Any troubles in Macquarie pens would be reflected negatively in Tassal’s income statement. The cost of farmed salmon production was increasing year after year. Marine farming however was much more expensive than maintaining the pens in Macquarie Harbour.Ocean warming and a reduction in dissolved oxygen levels were harming the growth and weight gain of the salmons that were being farmed in Tasmanian waters. With warmer waters the farms required more labour for bathing the fish at harbour pens to combat amoebic gill disease. Also protests over the use of synthetic astaxanthin—a chemical in the fish feed used to ensure that farmed salmon had pink flesh similar to wild-caught—had forced major salmon producers in Macquarie Harbour to move to natural astaxanthin which further drove up costs. Then following the massive death of salmon in Tassal’s pens and the ensuing investigations in early 2018 there was public outcry for closing down the pens though the warming ocean water was considered to be the cause. To overcome such public resistance Tassal and Petuna had jointly managed their salmon pens in Macquarie Bay to ensure the sustainability of the seabed and the allied ecosystem. The increased costs had also forced Tassal to withdraw from renewing some fixed-price salmon supply contracts. According to Ryan this move was to balance out the supply-side stress due to the large-scale deaths and increasing production costs of farmed salmon. Tassal’s expansion into the larger seafood industry and plans for vertical integration of prawn farms might also be viewed in the light of these issues to maintain a balanced product mix and mitigate risks of Tasmanian salmon farming. Therefore the acquisition of De Costi had provided Tassal with access to the related seafood markets. Importantly the acquisition and other diversification efforts would help to buffer troubles in the salmon farming industry at least in the short term. Although Australian salmon production was only a small percentage of global salmon production any adverse changes would have repercussions in the domestic seafood market. In 2018 Tassal had resumed exports to take advantage of high global prices. Tassal believed that their bigger fish could be sold at premium prices particularly in Asia as the company planned to open a sales office in China.EXPANSION TO ASIAN MARKETSThe demand for seafood in Asian markets was expected to increase due to stable economic growth a rise in population and the availability of seafood. Seafood was a relatively cheaper alternative to meat for Australian Indian and Chinese customers. The expansion into seafood including the prawns market would help Tassal offset losses owing to increasing costs of salmon production and deaths of salmon in marine pens from climatic changes. Since the acquisition of De Costi Tassal had entered into several joint ventures and planned for further acquisitions and its balance sheet supported such plans. Australian exports of fresh Atlantic salmon to China had risen steeply in January and October 2017 from the same months of 2016 (see Exhibit 8A 8B and 8C). China imported 5137 metric tons of salmon in 2017 which was an increase of 477 per cent. According to Ryan Supply volumes are seasonal and the recent increases have been in part due to strong biomass growth from our farms with fish reaching their optimal harvest weight and seasonality of market demand. We are harvesting some of the largest salmon in the world at present meaning a strong supply of very large fish which the Chinese tend to favour.For Tassal the forecast for an increase in salmon consumption in China and possibly other Asian countries—like Japan and South Korea where Australian salmon was perceived as a premium fish—was a great opportunity for long-term growth. Given environmental challenges in Macquarie Harbour and the growing demand for the salmon and broader seafood markets in Asia Ryan wondered whether Tassal’s acquisition of De Costi made sense.Exhibit 1: TASSAL’S OPERATIONAL BASESSource: Created by the case authors based on Tassal Group Limited “Our Operations” accessed October 26 2018 https://tassalgroup.com.au/our-planet/our-operations/.Exhibit 2: DE COSTI SEAFOOD’S INCOME STATEMENT (IN million A$)Notes: EBITDA = earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization; EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes; NPAT = net profits after taxes; E = expected.Source: Created by the case authors based on CFA Institute Tassal Group Limited 12 September 17 2015 accessed October 26 2018 www.arx.cfa/up/post/872/Melbourne-University-of-Melbourne.pdf.Exhibit 3: DE COSTI SEAFOOD’S standalone income and earnout (post-acquisition)Note: FY = fiscal year.Source: Created by the case authors based on Tassal Group Limited Annual Report 2016 5 accessed October 26 2018 www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/T/ASX_TGR_2016.pdf; Tassal Group Limited Annual Report 2017 2 accessed October 26 2018 www.tassal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1717106-2017-Annual-Report.pdf.Exhibit 4: TASSAL GROUP LIMITED’S KEY FINANCIALS (IN MILLION A$)Note: n/a = not available; EBITDA = earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization; EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes; NPAT = net profit after taxes.Source: Created by the case authors based on CFA Institute Tassal Group Limited 11 (2013–2015) September 17 2015 accessed October 26 2018 www.arx.cfa/up/post/872/Melbourne-University-of-Melbourne.pdf; Tassal Group Limited Annual Report 2017 3 30 (2016–2017) accessed October 27 2018 www.tassal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1717106-2017-Annual-Report.pdf.Exhibit 5: TASSAL GROUP LIMITED’S FINANCIAL RATIOS (%)Source: Created by the case authors based on CFA Institute Tassal Group Limited 11 (2012–2015) September 17 2015 accessed October 26 2018 www.arx.cfa/up/post/872/Melbourne-University-of-Melbourne.pdf; Tassal Group Limited Annual Report 2017 3 30 (2016–2017) accessed October 27 2018 www.tassal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1717106-2017-Annual-Report.pdf.Exhibit 6: TASSAL’S SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATIONNote: The supply chain began from activity no. 1 to no. 5.Source: Created by the case authors based on Wise WiseFish Upgrade: The Inside Story at Tassal Australia accessed October 27 2018 www.wisefish.com/images/Factscheets/Case_Study_-_Tassal_-_portrait_REV03_forweb.pdf.Exhibit 7: Australia seafood export values by STATES IN 2015–2016 (million A$) Note: Total exports from Australia included exports from Australian Capital Territory and re-exports.Source: Created by the case authors based on “Fisheries Data” Australian Government—Department of Agriculture and Water Resources accessed October 27 2018 www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/fisheries/fisheries-data#australian-fisheries-and-aquaculture-statistics-2016.Exhibit 8A: Australia seafood export values by products (million A$) Source: Created by the case authors based on “Fisheries Data” Australian Government—Department of Agriculture and Water Resources accessed October 27 2018 www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/fisheries/fisheries-data#australian-fisheries-and-aquaculture-statistics-2016.Exhibit 8B: Australia seafood export values by market (million A$) Source: Created by the case authors based on “Fisheries Data” Australian Government—Department of Agriculture and Water Resources accessed October 27 2018 www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/fisheries/fisheries-data#australian-fisheries-and-aquaculture-statistics-2016.Exhibit 8C: Australia seafood export values by SELECTED markets and PRoDUCTS (million A$)Source: Created by the case authors based on “Fisheries Data” Australian Government—Department of Agriculture and Water Resources accessed October 27 2018 www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/fisheries/fisheries-data#australian-fisheries-and-aquaculture-statistics-2016.ENDNOTES

Gould had founded TFF in 2011 as a next-generation innovation platform for sustainable food and agriculture. In its first four years of operation TFF had helped more than 5000 university students generate viable business plans to address the vexing problem of feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 (see Exhibit 1). At least 18 new student-led companies had been launched and increasing numbers of professional mentors and support organizations were now joining the TFF global challenge and summit.In 2015 Gould had to make a difficult decision: to either maintain TFF’s current status as an internal initiative at Syngenta or register it as an independent non-governmental organization (NGO). Syngenta had provided critical financial support as Gould had launched the TFF platform and importantly it had allowed her to allocate some of her working hours to the initiative. But now that TFF had reached the scale that required significant funding and a dedicated staff and leader Gould wondered if it would be better to take the platform outside. Independent NGO status would enable the organization to raise funds from a wider base of supporters but there was no guarantee that those funds would actually flow. Gould wondered if the enhanced flexibility outweighed the increased risk. She also wondered how senior Syngenta colleagues would view the move. They had encouraged her to keep TFF as an internal Syngenta initiative back in 2011 when she had been planning to leave the company as an entrepreneur focused on nurturing early-stage food and agriculture start-ups. Would they once again push her to maintain TFF’s inside status now that the organization’s industry impact was growing but required additional resources?TFF’s OriginsGould launched TFF in 2011 convinced that next-generation innovation was the key to solving humanity’s most pressing food challenges. Her inspiration began when she studied for her master’s degree in agriculture system innovation at Columbia University where her peers and colleagues were passionate advocates of openness transparency and cross-sector collaboration aimed at altering the agricultural status quo through innovative business models. Later when she joined Syngenta she found that these ideals sharply contrasted those of the policy makers and industry leaders she encountered in her work. The complexities of agricultural regulations and the need for large-scale solutions led most industry experts to believe that global food challenges would ultimately be solved through traditional product-based technology research done by incumbent firms with laboratories scientists legal teams and other resources required to bring new ideas to market. For a firm like Syngenta to gain the approvals needed to launch a new active ingredient for crop protection for example it could take more than 10 years of research and legal processing at a cost of US$280 million. It was hard for industry insiders to see how business-model innovations and low-tech solutions from outside the traditional systems could have an appreciable effect on global food production in the near future. At the same time Syngenta executives were sensitive to ongoing societal changes that posed risks to their traditional business model. For example although investment in agricultural technology had been increasing rapidly in recent years there was a troubling trend of growing public distrust of big agribusiness in general and of technological innovations in particular (see Exhibits 2 and 3). Technological agricultural innovation primarily took the form of chemical modifications to pesticides and other crop protectors seed breeding using biotechnology and genetic methods or cultivation of bio-pesticides and all of these technologies were controversial in the eyes of the public. Regulators were increasingly recognizing public views on the wisdom of new product approvals and public distrust represented the growing risk that some long-term innovation projects would never be commercialized. Most Syngenta leaders felt that public opinion about the need for traditional agricultural innovation and the benefits of these would align with those of industry if citizens had a realistic understanding of how modern food systems worked and how much time and effort went into assuring the safety of new products before their release. Michael Kock global head of intellectual property at Syngenta pointed out the risks of weak public understanding: “People have a romantic view of how food security works and what it means to be an innovator. Many negative perceptions are based on a lack of understanding which in the end limits an innovation’s potential to solve problems.” A second worrisome trend for the industry was the changing work preferences of the millennial generation. University graduates increasingly chose to work in small- and medium-sized businesses or to launch their own entrepreneurial start-ups. Few young people entered the farming industry directly. According to Kock in 2011 Syngenta could “already see that the way of attracting researchers in the past by offering lifelong employment and a secure income was no longer attractive for the next generation [which] wants to work on projects in an open environment and change companies every few years.” There were concerns that this trend could drive fundamental changes in the nature of future research. Some company leaders were looking for ways to explore possible future innovation scenarios. Consequently when Gould announced her plan to leave Syngenta and launch TFF as an entrepreneurial venture senior colleagues encouraged her to launch it as an internal Syngenta project instead. Executives welcomed the opportunity to test new ways of speaking to young people and to gain perspective on youth employment needs and requirements. Gould was offered a newly created position in the department of external affairs dedicated to next-generation innovation and engagement (see Exhibit 4) and she was allocated a budget to support the first innovation challenge. Happy to have the freedom of an entrepreneur along with the structure and security of a corporate job Gould agreed to the arrangement.Launch and Early GrowthThe first TFF Challenge was a simple event that invited university students to think deeply about global food challenges and how to address them. Company executives who attended the event were pleased to see young people gaining a deeper view of both agricultural realities and the complexities involved in finding solutions. What they did not expect was the depth of passion that the challenge evoked in these young enthusiasts and the resulting speed of TFF’s growth. Participants spread the news of TFF over digital and university networks and the number of challenge participants grew significantly each year (see Exhibit 5). TFF and the winning teams from the annual challenge also attracted the attention of international media outlets like Huffington Post Forbes and Fast Company. TFF’s Facebook page had already accumulated more than 9000 followers by 2014. In response to this growing visibility and enthusiasm Gould continuously expanded the scope and professionalism of activities. By 2014 TFF had evolved into a multifaceted platform for cultivating and launching transformative food system innovations and building the human capacity needed to achieve that ambitious goal. The platform was uniquely designed to attract and empower the next generation of youth who had the passion for a more sustainable world the willingness to change the status quo and the cutting-edge technological knowledge of digital natives. TFF made an impact through three key pillars: the TFF Challenge an annual two-day summit and its diverse global community. The TFF ChallengeThe TFF Challenge invited university students from all fields of study to generate prototypes for previously unseen solutions to the complex challenges of global food security. Applicants were invited to use online training resources to improve their ideas and develop business plans. Gould commented “We expected to see bold and innovative technologies with the latest resources . . . [but] innovations are not enough. The projects had to be implementable with serious scalability potential on a global level.” Applicants who made it onto the competition’s shortlist received individual coaching to cultivate entrepreneurial go-to-market skills. As such the platform was instrumental in transforming students into innovative entrepreneurs regardless of their final placements in the competition. Participants found the experience inspiring and transformational and after four years several had already succeeded in launching start-up businesses (see Exhibit 6). Max Loessl co-founder of Agrilution GmbH (Agrilution) commented on the experience: “Before we got in touch with TFF our team was just developing ideas around vertical farming and brainstorming about how to get involved in this new technology. TFF pushed us to make our idea more realistic and business oriented.” Gerald Perry co-founder of FoPo Food Powder (FoPo) agreed: “TFF was the first single step for us to start our journey. [In response to] all the encouragements and pressures we went to Philippines and tested our business plan.” The Two-Day Annual TFF SummitThis second pillar brought together competing teams of students entrepreneurs investors and thought leaders working in food agriculture innovation entrepreneurship and science. TFF summits had a stimulating and unique style that prompted participants to call them their “best event[s] personally and professionally.” In addition to the final competition the program included inspirational talks from leaders at cutting-edge organizations like the XPRIZE Foundation IDEO and the Kirchner Impact Foundation. It also included skill-building sessions and learning games that explored innovation impact sustainability and emerging technologies like precision agriculture vertical farming and synthetic biology. Participants were encouraged to learn and to make the most of networking opportunities. The Diverse and Passionate TFF Global CommunityTFF’s third pillar was a stable community of individual enthusiasts and organizations that were leading the search for agricultural innovations in their respective fields. TFF sought to pool the expertise of this group to solve problems that no single person institution community or country could realistically conquer alone. Since next-generation innovation was an open collaborative experimental approach to finding solutions the TFF community served the important role of assuring ongoing collaborations among those who had initially engaged in competitions. Community members were committed to actively teaching and coaching one another and also to connecting and sharing resources.Choosing the Path to ScaleBy 2014 TFF’s rapid growth had made Gould and her colleagues question its long-term viability as an internal corporate initiative. The budget allocated by Syngenta had been increased each year to total $600000 by 2014. This covered platform development costs and direct expenses for the annual challenge and summit; nevertheless it was not sufficient to support a full-time dedicated staff and this created a critical bottleneck in TFF’s development. Taking TFF outside Syngenta would give Gould the flexibility to raise additional operating and investment funds from other individuals and institutions concerned about food security and agricultural innovation. Independent status would also make it easier for TFF to work with professionals who otherwise might fear conflicts of interest when collaborating on Syngenta-funded projects. Syngenta had always been hands off with TFF allowing Gould to build without directly promoting Syngenta interests. Nevertheless Gould saw a need to assure participants that TFF was not a public relations project for Syngenta but rather a truly collaborative attempt to find food-security solutions. Independent NGO status would immediately resolve all of those concerns and support TFF’s evolution into a third-party platform serving the interests of the entire industry. In fact by serving the industry TFF might offer even greater value to Syngenta. The entire agribusiness industry was gradually moving away from selling isolated products and toward selling integrated solutions. Gould’s colleague Kock had noted that Syngenta could “produce a building block for the solutions” but could not produce solutions in their entirety. He saw a need “to collaborate with others by design in order to integrate the building blocks into a solution.” An independent TFF might have even more opportunities to safely explore new technologies and collaborative business models without immediately affecting core business activities.  On the other hand the TFF competition and summit greatly benefitted from Syngenta’s commitment and industry-leading support as well as from the personal time devoted by participating company leaders and professionals. Gould knew she could count on Syngenta’s continuing support for TFF if she took it outside but if she wanted to appreciably grow TFF inside Syngenta she would have to identify and demonstrate its tangible value for the firm. Until now TFF had been housed in the external affairs department where Gould worked. Nurturing relations with the millennial generation and a broader community of interested professionals clearly delivered value to external affairs. Moreover Syngenta executives had been very pleased that TFF had provided more than the initially desired medium for delivering Syngenta’s views to the public. Indeed TFF drove deep dialogues and two-way conversations among people with very different views. As Steve Maund head of Syngenta’s global License-to-Operate platform said “I see value in talking to outsiders. If you have conversations only with those who agree with you you don’t learn very much.” Gould had regularly briefed Syngenta staff and executives about her insights on millennials and the firm had recruited several TFF alumni. Clearly TFF brought value to Syngenta’s human resource team. Maund noted an even broader contribution:People want careers with purpose. If you can [connect people] and express the ideas [of working together on solutions] as TFF and we in License-to-Operate try to do it brings meaning in itself. Corporations that engage in these types of activities will be much more attractive to the next generation of employees. . . . Some [TFFers] may develop a passion for innovation that lasts their entire life. They will study agriculture go into research or launch startups to work on agriculture innovation. Out of that process real innovation will emerge.Bangladeshi student Lamia Anwar Shama was a case in point. She noted “When I started my undergrad as a business student I thought I would become a banker. But after I participated in the TFF Challenge and won I shifted my interests and ended up working in the agricultural sector.”Nevertheless until the innovations emerging from TFF could be incorporated into the company’s product innovation cycle the business case for Syngenta would be difficult to assess. Despite repeated attempts by Gould and others the goal of leveraging TFF had not yet been attained. As Juan Gonzalez Valero Syngenta’s head of public policy and partnerships pointed out There were real discussions about whether we could help some of these ideas to grow by incorporating them in our innovation cycles but most ideas were not sufficiently developed to grow within an organization like Syngenta. We even looked at the possibility for joint sponsorship of some ideas but that did not materialize either.In practice the TFF ideas that had gone to market up to this point were either low-tech improvements to existing food systems—primarily in developing economies—or modifications to agricultural business models like vertical farming. As a product-driven company Syngenta struggled to see how business-model innovations could be of use. The seeds of some very interesting early-stage technology innovations had appeared in the TFF Challenge but no one had been able to bring those ideas into Syngenta’s business activities or research labs which of necessity had to focus on much more mature technologies.A Future Within Syngenta?With $13.4 billion in sales and more than 28000 employees in 2015 Syngenta was a leader in agricultural innovation (see Exhibit 7). Approximately 10 per cent of its revenues were allocated to research and development each year even in periods of market downturn generating a very strong pipeline of products under development. Company leaders were deeply committed to sustainability and Syngenta was one of four co-sponsors of the Vision 2050 project of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Former chief executive officer Michael Mack and Valero were key contributors to the WBCSD’s work of developing a blueprint for achieving the well-being of 9 billion people living within the limits of the planet. In addition to this external collaborative work with other multinational corporations (MNCs) Syngenta executives were formulating ideas for an integrated company strategy that would transform the traditional culture and mindset from its previous narrow focus on objective science and technology innovation to a more comprehensive view of technology serving the land and the people who worked it. In 2013 Syngenta announced its Good Growth Plan—a commitment to continuous improvement on six specific and measurable sources of value to society including resource efficiency ecosystem rejuvenation and the strengthening of rural communities (see Exhibit 8). The engine for achieving these targets remained firmly rooted in product-based technological innovation. That model had served Syngenta well and the firm had amassed critical skills and resources for maximizing its value. No one believed the fundamental business model should be altered but there was a growing view that broader change was on the horizon and would require more vigilance than the company had needed in the past. Maund elaborated: Gould and I tried to challenge the organization to think a bit more broadly than our traditional business model methods because both of us saw the need for our organization to evolve. You need your big machinery to scale and address a global market but you also need the lean mean fighting machines with the startup mentality to be sure that you avoid a Kodak moment of missing the new trends.Robert Neill Syngenta’s head of global product marketing addedThe big value for me of TFF was preventing narrow-mindedness. The TFF teams came up with fantastic ideas that addressed a huge variety of opportunities. Maybe their particular ideas wouldn’t immediately make it to market but they sure challenged you to think outside the box! It was very energizing.As Maund observed “There is a danger that in big companies we business-case new ideas to death. I recall a Silicon Valley speaker once saying that an innovation is unlikely to prove disruptive if it fits your current business model.”Although she was happy to hear these supporting views Gould questioned whether she could produce any measurable evidence of their validity. She was acutely aware that Syngenta like most MNCs facing an ongoing global market slowdown had in early 2014 launched a cost-cutting program intended to save $1 billion by 2018. In such an environment she would have to develop tangible impact measurements to justify TFF’s growing space within the organization. Some scholars and consultants were beginning to develop metrics for the softer elements of sustainable business such as employee and stakeholder engagement but no standards had yet emerged. She certainly could not devote her time to that problem when so much other work was needed to maintain the momentum she had worked so hard to build with TFF.An Independent Future?Although independence would allow TFF to seek new funding sources the work of securing the funds would put huge pressure on an already lean management team. Moreover Gould needed to sharpen TFF’s value proposition for everyone involved. She had to articulate the value to financial sponsors and the value that would keep TFF community members actively participating over time. Of course she also had to assure that there was value for new students so they would continue to enter the TFF Challenge each year. So far students had been motivated by sheer passion for starting businesses and finding sustainable food systems and by the opportunity to experience the unique TFF Summit and be coached by experienced mentors. Of course students also liked travelling to the summit which was held in a different national capital each time. If TFF were to have a real impact on food stability moreover Gould would have to further develop the potential of taking innovative ideas to market. Kock had noted “TFF brings together students industry academics startups coaches and sponsors but all of that is not so well orchestrated that you can say [TFF is] maximizing the potential for industry innovation.” The TFF Challenge and Summit did a great job of kick-starting the go-to-market process but sustained and continuous investments of professional time and money would be needed to fully nurture most of the TFF Challenge ideas. Building the TFF community into a formal incubator or accelerator might be one path to follow. Gould wondered what additional resources and activities she would have to employ to realize that type of solution. A very different possibility would be to reorient the TFF Challenge so that it was no longer strictly a student competition but a public incentive prize challenge instead like the XPrize which offered large crowd-sourced financial rewards to anyone who could provide answers. Gould knew such approaches had been used to generate late-stage prototypes to specific information technology and engineering challenges but it wasn’t clear that they could generate viable ideas to address a broader challenge like ensuring global food security. In her view these approaches had another more serious flaw: they had little potential to cultivate the dedicated community of next-generation innovators that she and other TFF mentors were so passionate about. Edward Silva executive director of TFF commented on this community:The communities that support incentive prize competitions are often an undervalued asset. They bring diversity that boosts the potential for creative interaction. It is clear from TFF summits that out-of-the box solutions—those that really push the edge of the envelope—happen when food and agriculture intersect with other fields.In his view large open challenges were unlikely to really push the edge. He therefore favoured small incentive prize competitions focused on issues like vertical farming or open data conducted in partnership with other organizations seeking insight ideas and talent. It seemed that no matter what path TFF followed there was work to be done. TFF had been successful so far in building interest and an understanding of global food challenges nurturing ideas to resolve those challenges and building the human capacity to put the ideas into action. With the right boost in resources and the right shift in focus TFF could continue on that accelerated path. As she pondered the next moves Gould realized that much was at stake. Exhibit 1: The Challenge of Feeding over 9 billion people by 2050In a presentation at the 2016 TFF Summit in Zurich scientist and agriculture change agent Mike Gould pointed out the following information: For 10000 years agriculture was sustainable. Productivity was low but the population was small (less than 2 billion before 1900) and resources were plentiful. However in the 20th century the human population increased at an unprecedented rate reaching to more than 6 billion by 2000. New technologies bring dramatic increases in agricultural production but also require massive inputs of non-renewable energy water and chemicals. This model is not sustainable as the world population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. This means we need to produce as much food as the entire human population has produced in the past 10000 years. As we are already using nearly all the farmable land on the planet and 70% of the earth’s fresh water we need to find new more sustainable agricultural technologies that provide very high productivity but require lower input of arable land fresh water and fertilizers.Compounding the problems of population growth and natural resource limits noted by Gould in his 2016 speech modern agricultural systems were stressed in the 20th century by a rapidly growing demand for protein. As poverty declined new middle-class families switched from plant- to meat-based sources of protein. Since livestock farming was more resource intensive (e.g. in terms of feed water and land) and emitted more carbon than crop farming planetary systems underwent a double hit as the population swelled. The poverty and low education levels of smallholder farmers posed another major challenge. In a short-sighted drive to boost crop yields and incomes uneducated farmers overused pesticides and fertilizers eventually triggering runoff that contaminated water and soil resources for future use. Smallholders also under-invested in safety precautions leading to injuries and toxic exposures. Finally the search for income growth drove younger generations of farming families off the farm and into the cities for jobs and education. Farm communities faced potential collapse or extinction as the pool of skilled labour declined.

Ltd. (Reike) sat at his desk in the company office in Zhongguancun Beijing feeling upset. He and his team should have been pleased because they had completed the main part of a project after more than a year of hard work. However Lee had lost his usual self-confidence after a troubling call from the finance department. The previous year Lee had signed a CN�15 million service contract on behalf of Reike with Shenghui Co. Ltd. (Shenghui) a well-known multinational software company. Although almost 80 per cent of the project work was complete Shenghui had not confirmed the project schedule on which payment was based. Lee had received calls from the finance department once a month for almost a year asking him if there was any revenue that could be recognized. Unfortunately Lee had to say no every time�a headache that just would not go away. When the situation began to affect the processing of project costs and performance assessment Lee decided to consult Reike�s general manager.company backgroundReike Technology Co. Ltd. was an information technology (IT) consulting and outsourcing company. Founded in 1995 with less than 50 people it became one of the largest IT companies in China with over 23000�employees and approximately �500 million in annual revenue. In 2005 it successfully made an initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Reike�s headquarters were in Beijing with four branches in Shanghai Shenzhen Xi�an and Ningbo. Reike�s core�competitive strength was its rich experience in IT solutions�from localization testing and development services to system level design. Since its launch the company had accumulated experience in the high tech telecommunications financial services manufacturing retail and distribution industries. In the 1990s more and more western software companies were entering the Chinese market. Localization was the first thing they all had to face. Reike took the opportunity to build partnerships with Fortune 500 software companies and continuously earned contracts as these companies expanded their business in China. This strategy helped Reike gradually increase its reputation in the software outsourcing industry. By 2011 the company had become one of the largest professional software outsourcing service providers in China. It had also built strong co-operative partnerships with some large international companies.China�s IT Outsourcing IndustryIn the previous 20 years the global information industry had gone through a gradual transition from a hardware-dominated industry to a software- and service-dominated one. Human resource cost was the key profitability factor for software service enterprises and accounted for 70 per cent of software development costs. An effective way to reduce software development costs was to outsource services to developing countries. Consequently the main employers of the global software outsourcing business in North America Western Europe Japan and other developed countries transferred their outsourcing services to Asia Pacific and other low-cost developing countries.According to a Gartner report global spending on IT outsourcing (ITO) was around $251 billion in 2012 and reached $288 billion in 2013 a 14.7 per cent growth. China was playing an emerging role in this global market. According to China�s Ministry of Commerce China�s whole outsourcing market�including ITO business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing�grew�from $2 billion to $4.47 billion in contract size from 2009 to 2011 for an almost 50 per cent average annual growth. ITO was the mainstream in the outsourcing market. By 2013�China�s ITO offshore market had reached $3.11 billion with a year-on-year growth of 36.8 per cent.Meanwhile in China�s domestic software and services market most industries� IT systems were built using popular products from big western software companies. However facing huge market demand as well as the great pressure of human resource cost international software providers could focus only on their own products not services. In other words when selling products to an end customer they needed local partners to do most of the customer development and maintenance work. This situation provided huge market opportunities for Chinese ITO companies.Business Department NO. 3: Lee�s partnership with Shenghui Lee was the manager of Reike�s Business Department No. 3. He had graduated from a famous university and had both technical and managerial talents to reach sound decisions. He joined Reike from another software company in 2010. Under Lee�s leadership the performance of Business Department No. 3 improved rapidly. The department created a lot of profit for the company which was attributed largely to the co-operation with Shenghui.Shenghui was a well-known multinational software company. Since starting business in mainland China it had developed rapidly and gained popularity for its world-class products among government and large companies in various industries. However along with business expansion came problems. Although Shenghui had a whole research and development sales and support team in China it could not cope with the high business demand. For example the pre-sales technical support team in Beijing had no more than 50 people while a large order often required more than a year�s work of over 100 engineers for complex custom development. It was impossible for Shenghui to recruit large numbers of independent engineers which would result in enormous expenses and management issues.To solve this problem Shenghui co-operated with local software outsourcing enterprises such as Reike. Shenghui was responsible for technical solutions as well as project planning and management while the outsourcer was responsible for sending engineers for the development of specific work. In this way Shenghui could concentrate on being a business consultant without worrying about managing a large team of engineers and could put more energy into improving products. The outsourcer could earn commissions and get sound profits by relying on its advantages in having a mature implementation team and lower labour costs. Thus both sides got what they wanted. For the projects between Shenghui and Reike the number of engineers ranged from a few to dozens and the project cycle time ranged from two months to a year or two. The deliverables were calculated based on the workload per month of each engineer and the commission was also on a person-month basis of different levels of engineers. The software engineering was complex and unpredictable to some degree and project delays were common. Even so the settlement between Reike and Shenghui was generally on a monthly basis according to progress. The two companies had had a good business relationship over the previous few years.Zhongjiao Project: Accept or Not?In October 2012 Lee learned that Shenghui had recently received a large order to upgrade the IT system for Zhongjiao International Group (Zhongjiao). Zhongjiao was a large state-owned power generation enterprise established in December 2002. Its net assets were �32 billion and its total assets in 2012 were �128 billion. It mainly specialized in managing power energy organizing power production and sales manufacturing electric power equipment and other services. In China the state retained monopolies in a number of industries including telecommunications banking transportation and power. The big state-owned firms were guaranteed by the Chinese state and it was easier for them to get bank loans approved.Lee felt keenly that it would be a profitable project and his department was at home when providing such services. He was excited and immediately discussed with the sales manager the idea of lobbying with Shenghui to get a share.Shenghui usually did not put out project tenders. It kept in touch with a number of outsourcing companies and co-operated with the company that could form a satisfactory team. However Shenghui relied heavily on several particular companies such as Reike. Therefore when Lee came to visit Shenghui about the new project the business executive who maintained frequent contact with Reike was pleased to entertain him. At dinner he generously said that there would be no problems co-operating on the new project but there would be other partners involved besides Reike because the project was large. He also said that Reike could help with some urgent tasks and the formation of the team could begin right away.However before Lee�s face could light up the business executive changed topic and said that the contract would be modified because the Shenghui headquarters had some new requirements for subcontracts in the Chinese market. In the new contract the commission would not be calculated according to a person-month rate but would instead be settled based on the percentage of the project completed. For example if a project was expected to be completed in 10 months when two months of the workload was complete 20 per cent of progress payments would be paid. When five months of the workload was complete 50 per cent of progress payments would be paid and so on. If the project was delayed a separate additional contract would be signed.Lee was confused about the need for a new payment scale because the project was no different from previous contracts. Anyway the contract would be reviewed by the legal staff and financial personnel in both companies so these changes would not be a great concern. Back home Lee called in some personnel immediately to form a new project team. Soon he received the new contract from Shenghui (see Exhibit 1). The contract amount was �15 million and the contract period was 18 months. However the settlement terms seemed doubtful and read as follows: �According to the provisions of service contents standards and progress check the project is divided into the milestones of 20 per cent 50 per cent 80 per cent 95 per cent 100 per cent; after Shenghui receives the corresponding proportion of payments from the owner it will pay to Reike Technology.�Reike followed a rigorous review process for business contracts. Before a new project contract was signed there had to be joint approval by the legal business finance and operation departments. For such unusual contract terms Lee did not dare figure it out alone. He immediately sent the contract to the legal department and copied the business finance and operation departments.As expected when the manager of the legal department read the contract she pointed out the infamous �pay-when-paid� clause. She said �It is very risky because there is serious information asymmetry between us and the general contractor. If we sign the contract after a year�s work the general contractor may refuse to pay us on the grounds that they have not received the payment from the owner or even default.� The company would suffer major losses under these circumstances. Signing such a contract was asking for trouble.Lee was further cautioned by his colleagues in the operation department who reminded him that �Although a pay-when-paid clause is not a new thing in software outsourcing industry there are indeed examples that outsourcers suffered from such terms. How do you assess the risk of this contract? What are the reasons to support it?� Finally Lee reported to the business director for a decision. This was the first time that the director made such a decision. He called in several other managers who had co-operated with Shenghui and discussed the contract with them. Since Shenghui was a reputable company and had never repudiated a debt they all agreed that they should accept the contract even though there was a risk. The Zhongjiao project was a large amount of business and everyone wanted a share. If they did not accept the contract other outsourcing companies would. If Reike turned down the project not only would it miss an opportunity to earn money but the relationship between Shenghui and Reike would also be directly affected.The director made his decision to support the project. However he directed Lee to keep the team on a small scale. In this way the project was approved with reservations.After the project was approved Lee immediately began recruiting new engineers and building the team. This was routine work for Lee who felt very much at home. In the next month the Zhongjiao project team comprising a dozen engineers began to carry out work on schedule led by Shenghui�s senior architecture design and management team. These engineers had an average of three years� work experience so the labour costs were relatively high.Revenue Recognition at the End of the First YearWhen the Zhongjiao project contract was signed Jeff Young Reike�s finance manager was away on business. The contract was reviewed by his deputy together with other departments. Young only learned about the major new order after he returned. Previously after Reike was listed the finance department had set up a ledger for all approved projects. Project expenditures revenues related creditor rights and debt were registered and monitored in real time. However for the Zhongjiao project it was not until the end of the year that Linda Zhang the project accountant asked Young whether the revenue for the Zhongjiao project should be recognized. Young told Zhang to handle it in the same way as in previous years. She explained that the revenue from Business Department No. 3 was based on labour income and commissions over the past few years while the Zhongjiao project revenue was accounted for using project milestones. The first milestone 20 per cent of the project had not come yet. Young called Lee and asked him for proof of the project completion schedule which should have been confirmed by Shenghui. After that the revenue could be recognized according to the progress. Lee said that the payment for the Zhongjiao project was in accordance with milestones and the first milestone was not complete. According to the contract Shenghui had no obligation to identify and confirm the progress so it was a bit much to require Shenghui to do so. Lee asked if it was possible that Business Department No.�3 provide proof of the project completion schedule by itself.Young asked Zhang for her opinion on this matter. Zhang said that Business Department No. 3 had done its job. The team believed that Shenghui was a large international company that had good credibility and was not likely to default. Moreover Business Department No. 3 had no bad debts in its dealing with Shenghui so in her opinion they could recognize part of the revenue in accordance with Lee�s recommendations. Besides the labour costs for the Zhongjiao project during the two months were nearly �0.9 million and recorded in the labour cost account for the project. When revenue was recognized the labour costs could be recognized as operating costs.Young did not respond but waited for Zhang to forward him a copy of the contract for the Zhongjiao project. He glanced at the contract and took a deep breath when he saw the �pay-when-paid� clause. Young was glad that he had not let Zhang handle the business before seeing the contract! He called Lee again. After hearing the explanation from Lee Young reminded him about the finance department�s principle of revenue recognition. �Reike is a listed company and there are countless people staring at the quarter and annual report. The revenue recognition must conform to the accounting criteria. Since the �pay-when-paid� clause for the Zhongjiao project is risky please communicate with Shenghui and also with the financial department after each milestone is completed� Young requested. After talking to Lee Young told Zhang to call Lee every month to keep an eye on the project progress.Trouble with Project Settlement at Each MilestoneLee and his team worked day and night and the Zhongjiao project progressed smoothly. Three months later the first milestone was reached. As usual Lee wrote a project progress report and sent it to the Shenghui business executive. If he replied and confirmed Business Department No. 3 could report the income to the finance department and require an invoice. The money could then be collected within 30 days. A 30-day payment collection period was not only the rule of the industry but it was also predetermined in the contract. The payment collection in Lee�s department was always efficient. Also Shenghui was a seasoned client with whom Reike had been happy working together for many years so Lee had great confidence in the contract payment this time. However after a few days Lee had not received a reply from Shenghui. Wondering whether the company had forgotten to reply he sent the report again and called the business executive at the same time. The executive politely said that the current progress had some problems and they had not reached the milestone of 20 per cent. Nevertheless the problems were not serious and the payment would be put off until the next month so Lee was asked to please be patient!Lee was surprised. Project progress had never before been questioned by a customer. The service quality and standards had not encountered problems. Why had the executive said that the project had not reached 20 per cent completion? Although he was puzzled Lee had to wait for written confirmation from Shenghui which unexpectedly took six months. During the wait Lee experienced great pressure in terms of performance evaluation. Even worse while forming the project team at the early stage it had been difficult to recruit qualified engineers in a short time so he had contracted that part of the business out to another company. Now the subcontractor was requesting its payment. While asking for confirmation from Shenghui Lee had to dodge the outsourcing company.When the project reached the 50 per cent milestone Shenghui again failed to recognize or make the payment. Zhang made her monthly phone call to ask about the project�s revenue. Meanwhile Lee visited Shenghui repeatedly. In the beginning the business executive would explain that the problem was due to communication issues between Shenghui and Zhongjiao and he hoped that Lee would be patient. �We have co-operated for so many years. You should have confidence in Shenghui.� Later however he would be blunt and state �Please go back to read the contract.� Lee was annoyed. He met over drinks with the sales manager who had helped him set up the project to lament:I worked hard and finally signed the �15 million contract but now I haven�t seen a penny of it! Shenghui always says the progress is slow or the owner does not pay but we all know that these are excuses! We thought we had the money in the bag for the contract was signed and the work had been actually done. At least it should be accounts receivable. But now if I can�t get the confirmation by the end of this year we may have been doing all this for nothing the whole year. The bonus of our team is ruined and then I�ll have to find another job.The sales manager who had been Lee�s partner for a long time understood Lee�s suffering.Yeah if an IT giant such as Shenghui does not follow the provisions the outsourcing companies have to close. The projects were settled on a monthly basis in the past and the income was stable every month. We didn�t need to recognize the project�s revenue. However this is a �pay-when-paid� clause now. If they do not confirm the progress the financial department will not recognize the project�s revenue so the big contract is useless. We really have a tough time. Processing Project CostsBefore long came the end of 2013. At the end of each year the accounting supervisor was responsible for checking the company�s asset items to see what assets should be impaired or transferred. When checking the account line �Inventory�costs of project� at the end of 2013 he found that the Zhongjiao project costs were up to �8.04 million and the project had not been paid. He met with Zhang and with Young who was emerging from a day-long meeting and had a very animated discussion about how to resolve this problem.The accounting supervisor believed that almost 80 per cent of the project was complete but Shenghui had not confirmed the project schedule. It now seemed possible that the project funds might never be recovered. He wanted Zhang to immediately estimate the loss for the Zhongjiao project. Otherwise more than �8 million would be treated as a loss the next year thus creating great pressure on the income statements. However Zhang did not agree. Referencing International Accounting Standards (see Exhibit 2) she stated:For such a project as the Zhongjiao project the revenue can be recognized in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method. If the percentage of completion cannot be confirmed or the recognition criteria of the revenue cannot be met it should be considered whether the costs incurred are recoverable. If the costs incurred are expected to be recoverable revenue can be recognized based on the costs incurred and no profit is recognized; if costs are not expected to be recoverable revenue can be recognized only to the extent of costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable and costs can be recognized according to actual expenses.Zhang thought that although Shenghui did not sign off on the progress report at each milestone it had a business reputation so the recovery of receivables was simply a matter of time. The company cautiously assigned �12 million in revenue based on the percentage of completion with business revenue of �8.04 million and  labour expenses of �8.04 million tagged as operating costs (see Exhibit�3).The accounting supervisor retorted:From the perspective whether expenses are expected to be recoverable there are also guidelines like this. �If all costs incurred are not expected to be recoverable the revenue should not be recognized and the costs incurred should be recognized as period expenses.� Zhongjiao project has been carried out for more than a year but Shenghui does not recognize even 20 per cent of the project�s progress. Even if Shenghui has a reputation the owner may delay! In my opinion the income cannot be recognized. The �8.04 million should be included in this year�s expenses. This is a really cautious accounting processing.�Do you mean [to say that] Zhongjiao international Group will be deadbeats?� asked Zhang. �Then they will meet Shenghui in court. Zhongjiao is a large state-owned enterprise. It�s impossible that they lack money.�The debate continued until Young waved his hand and said �Hold on please. Let me think about it.�Performance Assessment at the End of the Second YearAt Reike each department had its own bonus policies but the general procedure was the same. A certain amount of money (about 3 per cent of the total revenue) was identified from the revenue and set aside as commissions and bonuses. Each department could set its own rate according to the amount of revenue. At the end of each fiscal year the management team in each department would discuss how to allocate the bonus amounts: either as small bonuses to everyone or large bonuses to only some people. Usually large bonuses were given so the team had to decide who deserved bonuses (other than the management team) and how much should be given. Qualified people would be paid a one-time bonus after an annual performance review was conducted in person.Although a bonus was never assured in the salary package at Reike managers tried their best to retain core team members by offering bonuses. In recent years Lee and his team had consistently been the company�s performance stars. However at the end of 2013 with a low bonus pool Lee worried that he could not please all of his core team members so he would likely lose some of them. Lee�s bonus would be assessed by the higher management team. Although he had done a good job in delivering the whole project the loss was likely to prevent him from receiving a satisfactory bonus. Lee heard that a neighbouring company also provided services for Shenghui and that dozens of people worked for a year but got nothing. With the net loss of several millions the company was preparing to prosecute Shenghui. Lee hoped that it would not reach such a situation but wondered how he would deal with it if it really happened. There were almost 3000 people engaged in the Shenghui and Reike partnership. How would the company survive if it were to sue Shenghui�its god of wealth? Lee stayed late at the office gloomily considering the situation. While Lee was on pins and needles Young was also having a hard time. The personnel department had asked the finance department to provide performance data. When it came to Business Department No. 3 Young hesitated. According to Zhang�s proposal the project revenue for the Zhongjiao project should offset labour costs; therefore the department reaped nothing that year. On the other hand according to the proposal the predicted loss for the Zhongjiao project was more than �8 million that year which meant that Business Department No. 3 not only had no profits but should also be responsible for the loss. Lee felt that he had not signed the contract alone so why should the loss be borne only by him and Business Department No. 3? Moreover �pay-when-paid� contracts were not uncommon in the industry. Should the company have undertaken such a project? How could the financial department avoid a similar difficult situation in the future? How would the company fairly handle performance appraisals at the end of the year? Bothered by these problems Lee decided to talk to the general manager the next day.Exhibit 1: Excerpt from Shenghui Consulting Services subcontractParty A (Employer): Shenghui Co.

Under this method revenue is recognized in the accounting periods in which the services are rendered. For revenue arising from the rendering of services provided the following criteria are met revenue should be recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date (the percentage-of-completion method): the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the seller;the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; andthe costs incurred for the

As he skimmed the participants� handout he took note of the usual suspects: inflation trade energy price fluctuations monetary policies macroeconomic trends and strained markets. Unbeknownst to Snabe an event unfolding halfway across the globe was about to challenge those conventional notions of risk.That night while fast asleep in his Palo Alto hotel room Snabe was suddenly jolted from his slumber by an incoming call on his cellphone. The Maersk chairman glanced at the iPhone dock on his bedside which read �4:00 a.m.� in a dim blue digital font. Who could be calling at this hour he wondered.�We�ve suffered a major cyberattack!� exclaimed the caller. �The network is down for the entire company�every system in every location around the globe.� Not even the telephone lines were spared. Maersk which accounted for 18 per cent of global container shipping had gone dark.Jim Hagemann SnabeJim Hagemann Snabe was born in the small Danish commune of Egedal approximately 30 kilometres from the Swedish border but spent his early childhood in Nuuk a remote outpost in Greenland where his father was a helicopter pilot. It was a lonely and isolated existence in a place where it took a week or longer to receive a message from the outside world. Returning to Denmark for his high-school education was not easy but he found solace in the �cold logic� of computers on which he programmed simple games.A self-described �nerd� Snabe attended Aarhus University in the late 1980s where he studied mathematical proofs. However his main love continued to be computers and he secured part-time work in the business school�s information technology department. �Mathematics is a lonely enterprise� explained Snabe. �My thesis was only read by three people including my mother and she did it out of courtesy.�Upon receiving his master�s degree in 1990 Snabe became a trainee at software giant SAP Germany�s second-largest company after Siemens. In the mid-1990s Snabe left SAP for IBM but returned less than two years later after being offered a position as regional manager for SAP�s Nordic region. �At that time I thought I was smart and could solve problems on my own� he recalled. �But later I learned that putting the right team together with the best people is more important.� Over the next decade and a half he continued to rise within SAP�s ranks until 2010 when he was appointed chief executive officer (CEO). In May 2014 after leading a transformation that saw SAP�s stock price more than double Snabe resigned �to start a new professional life that allows me to spend more time with my family.�Shortly after Snabe announced his retirement Siemens invited him to join its supervisory board to improve the company�s �technology and software competence.� He was also elected vice-chairman of Allianz a German financial services firm that focused on insurance. Over the next couple of years Snabe wrote a book on leadership gave seminars at business and leadership conferences and taught business courses as an adjunct professor at Copenhagen Business School. While promoting his new book Snabe was asked how �leadership is changing in the digital world.� He replied: Most companies try to avoid changes until they are in trouble. Many talk about a need for a �burning platform� to change everything. I believe that in the digital world the ability to reinvent yourself comes from the ability to create a burning desire not a burning platform.Finally in January 2017 Siemens elected Snabe to be supervisory board chairman promising to further accelerate the company�s digital transformation. As if taking the helm of Germany�s largest conglomerate was not enough a few months later Snabe also agreed to serve as chairman of A. P. M�ller-Maersk the world�s largest shipping company. It was a move that prompted the Financial Times to declare him �Europe�s top industrialist.�Shepherding Maersk through �the biggest transformation in its history� would not be easy after the company reported the largest loss of any Danish enterprise. Still if Maersk could modernize many believed that Snabe was the one to do so. Not only was he younger at 51 than the chairmen who had preceded him he also had �an exceptional gift for finding a clear path through a forest of opportunities threats and complexity.�A. P. M�ller-MaerskA. P. M�ller-Maersk commonly known as the Maersk Line was founded in 1904 when A. P. M�ller and his father purchased a used steamship operating out of the Danish port of Svendborg. Ten years later the company added more steamships to meet the demands of the �Great War� that had engulfed Europe. Shortly after the war Maersk built its own shipyard and established an overseas office in New York City where it operated a shipping route from the United States to Asia. Although during the Second World War most of the company�s ships were requisitioned by various Axis and Allied countries and many were sunk during the war Maersk was able to resume operations after the war along its original routes and added new routes to the Middle East and Africa. By the time of A. P. M�ller�s death in 1965 the company operated nearly half of Denmark�s entire merchant fleet. In the 1970s the company began operating container vessels which became the defining symbol of the company�s global shipping operations. The size of those ships continued to grow over the years from fewer than 3000 TEUs to more than 20000 TEUs in 2018. Maersk also began manufacturing its own containers and developing internal logistics capabilities. In 2005 it acquired Damco a leading provider of supply-chain management and merged it with Maersk Logistics under the Damco name. By 2017 Maersk operated out of 343 ports worldwide and managed approximately 18 per cent of the world�s container shipping. That meant that �every 15 minutes on average a container ship will come to a port somewhere with between 10 [thousand] and 20 thousand containers� explained Snabe. �For each container shipped there may be up to 30 different parties involved communicating up to 200 times.� Although the placement and management of orders was typically electronic most of the �underlying processes� had not changed in decades. Much of it was managed on paper and there was no consistency between countries. Snabe�s focus would be to modernize the supply chain partly by digitizing those underlying processes.We want to transform the industry by reducing the complexity. . . . The opportunities from digitisation are significant. It has the potential to both simplify the customer experience and improve the productivity of assets primarily ships and ports effectively reducing costs across the value chain. It is my sincere belief that this company is best positioned to front the digitisation of the shipping industry. . . .In 2016 Maersk lost nearly $2 billion on $27 billion in revenue (see Exhibits 1�3). The losses were largely blamed on shipping industry overcapacity leading to a nearly 20-per-cent drop in freight prices. It was the second annual loss since the devastation of the Second World War. However by early 2017 demand had increased to the point that it outstripped supply prompting CEO S�ren Skou to predict �reasonable . . . supply-and-demand fundamentals� that would lead to an estimated $1 billion in profit by the end of 2017. He added that because the �price war� was over �things are looking a lot better now than they did a year ago. We are starting [2017] from a strong position.� At the same time Skou warned that a trade war between the United States and China could result in a 25-per-cent drop in Chinese exports negatively impacting Maersk.War in UkraineFor much of its history Ukraine has been a battleground between east and west. At various points in the 20th century it was occupied by Poland and Germany to the west and Russia to the east. In many of these conflicts Ukrainians aligned with various occupation forces. During the Second World War for instance some Ukrainian nationalists supported Germany�s invasion of the Soviet Union which had annexed Ukraine in 1921. By the end of the war 28000 towns and villages had been razed and as many as eight million Ukrainians�roughly 20 per cent of the country�s population�had lost their lives.The defeat of Germany by the Red Army left Ukraine entirely in Soviet hands. For the next four decades Ukraine led the Soviet Union in economic growth and output even surpassing Western European countries in the output of some key commodities. It also became an important location for technology hosting various Soviet weapons aerospace and energy centres. The fall of the Iron Curtain led to Ukrainian independence in 1991. However unlike other former Soviet republics that experienced rapid economic growth in the 1990s Ukraine was plagued by hyperinflation and a severe recession that saw its gross domestic product fall by 60 per cent. At the same time state failures pushed many Ukrainians toward the black market and despite its independence Ukraine continued to rely heavily on Russia with which it conducted nearly 40 per cent of its trade.Tensions over the role of Russia in Ukraine�s economic and political affairs came to a head in 2013 when anti-government forces mobilized against pro-Russian president Victor Yanukovych. Many Ukrainians wanted their country to strengthen ties with the West and perhaps eventually become part of the European Union while Yanukovych sought to strengthen Ukraine�s ties with Russia which for its part saw the encroachment of the European Union and NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) as a threat to its security. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea following an uprising by pro-Russian militias against Kiev. Inspired by the events in the Crimea other parts of eastern Ukraine attempted to secede with pro-Russian separatists receiving material support from Moscow. Despite Russian efforts to destabilize the country integration with the West continued including a 2016 free-trade agreement with the European Union and a 2017 visa-free travel agreement. Ultimately the Ukrainian government saw these agreements as steps toward European Union membership.CyberwarWe anticipate that cyberwar may be to the 21st century what blitzkrieg was to the 20th century.John Arquilla and David RonfeldThe rise of fake news attacks on the media and interference in both the Brexit vote and the 2016 American election appeared to catch many off guard. Yet in their seminal 1993 U.S. Department of Defense analysis on cyberwarfare John Arquilla and David Ronfeld predicted that �widespread multi-organizational networks that have no particular national identity� would attempt to undermine civil society. �A netwar may focus on public or elite opinion or both� they explained. It may involve public diplomacy measures propaganda and psychological campaigns political and cultural subversion deception of or interference with local media infiltration of computer networks and databases and efforts to promote dissident or opposition movements across computer networks.Despite these warnings 25 years later democratic nations around the world appeared ill-equipped to handle the deluge of cyberattacks directed at large and small organizations nations and individuals. Following the overthrow of Victor Yanukovych in 2014 Russia began sponsoring cyberattacks against key components of the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure beginning with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against pro-Western websites. A DDoS attack involved using compromised computers and devices to send massive amounts of garbage data over the Internet to targeted websites. In some situations these attacks resulted in service slowdowns but often they could knock a site off the Internet for days at a time. Meanwhile Russia engaged in a social-media campaign blocking pro-Western accounts and disseminating Russian propaganda.Phishing�whereby attackers sent emails with links and attachments that when opened delivered a payload of malicious software (i.e. malware)�was frequently deployed against Ukrainian networks. The malware might manifest itself immediately but often it worked to stealthily provide access to hackers who would steal information or attack assets at a later time. On December 23 2015 compromised accounts delivered malware to the Ukrainian power grid causing a widespread power blackout. The malware simultaneously erased computer drives to delay restoration and a coordinated DDoS attack disabled the power company�s phone lines.Ransomware was a particularly destructive malware that encrypted victims� data so that it could not be read without a decryption key. Ransomware screens often displayed a payment page that required the victim to pay a fee in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency to receive the decryption key. To mitigate such attacks network administrators were admonished to back up data on a regular basis because even when ransoms were paid the decryption keys did not always work. The best mitigation involved completely erasing the computer drive and restoring the system from an uninfected backup.NotPetya RansomwareNotPetya was a particularly virulent strain of ransomware that targeted a Ukrainian financial program known as MeDoc. In the weeks leading up to the attack MeDoc employees opened phishing emails that contained malware attachments or linked to malware servers. The attackers then used leaked U.S. National Security Agency exploits such as EternalBlue and EternalRomance which the U.S. government had developed for Internet surveillance. EternalBlue gave attackers remote access to infected systems through vulnerable Microsoft Windows� file and printer sharing protocols while EternalRomance escalated privileges to control and modify systems without detection.Although Microsoft issued an emergency patch for the vulnerability in March 2017 many organizations had yet to update their systems. Once computers were infected attackers could install other software monitor communications and steal data and passwords. With those passwords in hand infecting patched systems became trivial allowing the attackers to hide the NotPetya ransomware in a software update that was pushed out to MeDoc customers on June 22 2017.In fact a few weeks before NotPetya�s devastating attack Microsoft announced that it had �uncovered a well-planned finely orchestrated cyberattack that targeted several high-profile technology and financial organizations.� Microsoft cybersecurity researcher Elia Floria explained: An unknown attacker was taking advantage of a silent yet effective attack vector: the compromised update mechanism or software supply chain for a third-party editing tool. The software vendor that develops the editing tool was unaware of the issue. In fact while their software supply chain served as a channel for attacking other organizations they themselves were also under attack.Floria further noted that the effectiveness of supply chain cyberattacks depended on �the common trust relationship� that exists between customers and suppliers.NotPetya was also not a true ransomware program but one that mimicked ransomware by offering to restore infected computers after victims paid a ransom of $300 (see Exhibit 4). However the attackers provided no means for victims to pay the ransom or receive decryption keys. Instead NotPetya sought to permanently destroy and disable infected systems and networks.The sophistication of the tools employed and the fact that no ransom could be paid to recover infected systems suggested that NotPetya was not the work of cybercriminals intent on extorting companies for financial gain but a state-sponsored group most likely aligned with Russia. Moreover NotPetya remained dormant for five days until the eve of Ukrainian Constitution Day a celebration of independence from Russia and one of the republic�s most important holidays. When this ticking time bomb finally exploded on the morning of June 27 it spread through infected networks at an unprecedented speed. A major Ukrainian bank saw its entire network destroyed in 45 seconds. It started with an unscheduled reboot of computers followed by encoding of the master boot record that controlled how programs were loaded onto computers. A warning then appeared on the screen that the file system was being �repaired.� �DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR PC!� it read. In fact the only way to save the data from permanent destruction was to shut off power before the files could be encrypted. If one followed the attacker�s instructions the computer would reboot a second time and display fake ransomware payment �instructions.� By this time company files had been lost forever.More than 300 Ukrainian companies banks and hospitals were compromised representing roughly 10 per cent of the country�s computers. Although NotPetya had targeted Ukraine specifically multinational corporations doing business in the region often used MeDoc for local tax filing. Once computers had been compromised the malware also spread throughout their global networks. One of those firms was A. P. M�ller-Maersk.Maersk�s Mess Hardware is easy to protect: lock it in a room chain it to a desk or buy a spare. Information poses more of a problem. It can exist in more than one place; be transported halfway across the planet in seconds; and be stolen without your knowledge.Bruce Schneier chief technology officer of IBM ResilientOn June 27 Pawel Szczecki CEO of Predica a Polish analytics company that provided support to Maersk was meeting with his Maersk counterparts in London England where the company�s information technology (IT) support was headquartered. He recalled: It was . . . a nice summer day. The morning started out like any other. The planned meeting began and discussions about the new Managed Service operations had just commenced when a large commotion spread across the office. Suddenly the monitoring screens started to show all systems turning to red and not long after all laptops started to reboot.Similar events were happening across the company�s global network. As a systems engineer in Copenhagen prepared to deliver an update for the company�s 80000 personal computers (PCs) his computer spontaneously rebooted. When he rose from his desk he noticed �a wave of screens turning black� as all the PCs began simultaneously rebooting. Back in London systems administrators took nearly 30 minutes to realize what was happening before they began shouting to everyone to unplug their machines. The entire network took more than two hours to shut down primarily because email messaging and phone systems were also down as employees resorted to WhatsApp and personal phones to communicate. By then the damage had been done.Maersk�s senior system administrators had warned the company that its network was vulnerable to attack. In 2016 they had complained that the company�s ancient Windows 2000 server software was overdue for a complete overhaul. Additionally because Microsoft had long discontinued support for Windows 2000 and Windows XP both of which were still used on many of the company�s PC terminals any PCs running those outdated operating systems did not receive security patches. The senior system administrators had warned that unless something was done the entire infrastructure could face a crippling attack. Maersk�s senior leadership team had approved the upgrades but the systems administrators�whose bonuses depended on current infrastructure uptime not installing upgrades�had never implemented them.Good computer hygiene involved not only keeping software up to date but also providing regular backups. In this area Maersk followed best practice making backups of its data every few days and keeping those backups off-line at various locations across its global network. However a central piece was missing the domain controllers that mapped the company�s network and allowed access to authorized users. A domain controller was a Microsoft Windows server that authenticated users and provided access to computer resources. It was essentially the central nervous system of the computer network consisting of an �active directory� of multiple master controllers. Maersk operated a network of 150 domain controllers each of which could act as a backup for the entire network. If one failed it could easily be restored from any one of the other 149 controllers. What the company hadn�t accounted for was all 150 nodes being hit by the same malware simultaneously wiping out the entire network in one foray. It meant that the company�s entire network structure would be lost�forever�unless a controller somewhere in the company had been off-line during the attack. �The primary and key objective was to reestablish the Active Directory for identity management� recalled Szczecki. �This was necessary to reenable resource access which was the first step towards switching back to automated operations.�Normally conducting a search of company resources would have simply involved emails or phone calls to key IT staff at each of the company�s 150 domain controller sites. However with the email and phone lines knocked out by the same cyberattack the emergency-response centre had resorted to communicating through personal emails and phone numbers not all of which were readily accessible without the HR (human resources) personnel database. Maersk brought in consultants from Deloitte to manage the recovery effort along with smaller IT firms such as Predica. The company booked all the hotels in the area to house the recovery team but many were working such long hours that they chose to sleep in the office.As status updates rolled in from the various sites the team became increasingly disillusioned. Everyone had been hit. It began to appear that the network directory was lost forever when word arrived that one site may have survived�in Ghana. The West African country was in the midst of a longstanding energy crisis that had led to the demise of numerous businesses. The nation was often plunged into total darkness for up to 24 hours at a time and generator prices in the country soared. The unreliable power situation also had economic consequence and �Morgan Stanley . . . cut its 2015 growth forecast for Ghana from 5�per cent to 3 per cent due to the power cuts.�For most Ghanaians the power outage on June 27 was yet another reason to curse the government. For Maersk however it seemed like divine intervention as �joyous whoops� filled the London command centre. The ecstasy was short-lived however because the company needed to find a way to recover the data. The domain controller could not be connected to the Internet as Ghana�s network bandwidth was so slow it would have taken days to transmit. Moreover connecting it to the internet risked infecting the last known controller and the company�s last hope of restoring its network. Instead the company instructed its administrator in Ghana to deliver the hard drive to London for examination. But there was one problem. No one in the Ghana office had a travel visa for the United Kingdom and Europe and it would take weeks to get one. Instead an employee from Ghana would need to travel to Nigeria and hand the hard drive to an employee in that country who would then transport the hard drive to London. For a time it became the most valuable hard drive in the world.Managing a Global Shipping Company with Pen and PaperAs the London Emergency Response Centre worked furiously to restore Maersk�s IT infrastructure shipping terminals around the world were becoming hopelessly backlogged. Maersk operated the largest terminal in the Port of Los Angeles commonly known as America�s port because of its importance to U.S. trade. Not only was the Port of Los Angeles the largest container port in the United States but as a part of the San Pedro Bay Port Complex and together with the neighbouring Port of Long Beach it supported one in nine jobs in the five-county Southern California region. As Maersk shut down its global computer network it was left with no choice but to close the terminal.A similar story was unfolding at Maersk�s terminal in Port Elizabeth New Jersey the largest port on the east coast. Three thousand trucks arrived daily at the port to load and unload hulking containers loaded with furniture electronics bananas and almost every other imaginable product. On the morning of June 27 more than 800 trucks lined the road for more than a mile to the port unable to move. Some sat for as long as six hours before police told them to turn around and leave the area. One trucker explained how he received an incomprehensible email about the attack from a Gmail account. It offered no explanation and no information about when the port would reopen. His only recourse was to find somewhere to store his cargo and await word. Normally 90 per cent of Maersk�s shipping orders were placed through the company�s online system. The company had no choice but to manage shipments manually. Many companies with tight supply chains could not wait for orders to be processed manually. Instead they sought out alternative shippers in many cases resorting to costly air freight. Maersk offered to compensate customers for the added expenses which amounted to millions of dollars per customer. Overall Maersk saw its shipping volume decline by 20 per cent.Customers that remained with Maersk during the cyberattack and its aftermath were often forced to resort to pen and paper pasting sticky notes onto packages and then tracking them in Excel. Coordination was done on WhatsApp which at the time became in effect Maersk�s instant messenger outside of the United States.Maersk�s ships were mostly disconnected from the network during the attack and therefore had not been infected. Moreover ships were required to have procedures in place to handle adverse conditions such as natural disasters and were able to function independently. For ships that were already loaded the impact was minimal. S�ren Meyer of Maersk Tankers explained that although his division was also hit by the attack it was able to function without the IT system. �It comes back to the craftsmanship of our people and the hard work of our people being able to do things with a pen and paper� he explained.Once the network restoration began online ordering and tracking was prioritized to allow shipping services to return to normal. On July 25 2017 Maersk announced that its online quoting system was back online and that it was working toward clearing the backlog of delayed shipments (see Exhibit 5). Counting the Cost�We had to install 4000 new servers 45000 new PCs 2500 applications� Snabe noted. �And that was done in a heroic effort over ten days. Normally�I come from the IT industry�I would say it�s going to take six months. It took ten days and was a heroic effort.� Nevertheless those 10 days cost the company some $300 million in expenses and lost earnings. And it would take weeks to re-image and upgrade every computer in the company. Any locally stored information on infected PCs that had not been backed up prior to the attack was forever lost including contacts orders and any personal files such as family photos. Moreover because hackers had gained access to compromised networks for weeks or months prior to the attack they may have siphoned valuable business and personal data from victim PCs. Given that the drives were destroyed by NotPetya it would be impossible to determine what if any information had been stolen. For Snabe it was a wake-up call. �It is time to stop being na�ve when it comes to cybersecurity� he said vowing to transform Maersk into a world leader in network and supply-chain security. �Many companies will be caught if they are na�ve. I think that it is important that we are not just reactive but proactive.�Exhibit 1: Maersk Income statements 2013�2016 (in US$ millions)Notes: 1 Discontinued operations comprise Maersk Oil Maersk Tankers Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service.

Every day his department saw a high volume of work requiring the completion of payments through medical insurance which was needed for patients� administrative discharges from the hospital. Qureshi looked at the lineup of patients� relatives and friends waiting to make payments and pondered why the hallway was so crowded. �Roy you wanted to solve a managerial issue as an intern. Here you go! Why don�t you address this issue?� Firoz asked the summer intern Sudipendra Nath Roy as he gestured toward the people waiting. �There are more cashless patients [patients with medical insurance] these days in the hospital and as the TPA [third-party administrator] office is closed after 5 p.m. it is creating this influx Sir� replied Roy. For the next few weeks Roy tried to understand the various tasks and functions of the health administration department and the effects of these tasks and functions on patients waiting for administrative discharge.BOMBAY HOSPITAL INDOREBombay Hospital Indore was a premier private trust hospital serving 21 clinical disciplines and four allied disciplines. The hospital situated in the vibrant city of Indore in the state of Madhya Pradesh was an example of India�s state-of-the-art medical care facilities. Since its establishment in October 2003 the 600-bed hospital had relentlessly delivered multi-specialty tertiary care in central India primarily serving the region�s middle and upper-middle socio-economic classes. Bombay Hospital Indore had established a reliable quality care brand that served both in-patient departments (IPDs) and out-patient departments 24/7. The hospital�s �quality care� brand was bolstered by formal recognition from the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers and from various quality recognitions in medical forums: in 2013 it was named the best hospital in the non-metro category western region in ICICI Lombard CNBC TV18 and IMRB�s India Healthcare Awards and in the same year it received a Healthcare Excellence Award for the best multi-specialty hospital in Indore from World Wide Achievers. These achievements further reflected the hospital�s quality of health service delivery. CASHLESS PATIENTSBefore being administratively discharged IPD patients first needed to clear their hospital bills either through cash payments or through their medical insurance company. As the medical expenditure borne by patients was mainly an out-of-pocket expense admitted patients often had medical insurance that could help pay for unforeseen medical expenditures. India had two types of medical insurance: reimbursement and cashless. For the former patients paid the bills out of pocket and subsequently arranged reimbursement from their medical insurance company. For cashless medical insurance patients provided their insurance cards and the hospital administration coordinated payments directly from the medical insurance companies through their respective third-party administrators (TPAs). Bombay Hospital Indore facilitated cashless medical insurance claims by coordinating and maintaining ties with various medical insurance companies and their TPAs. Cashless medical insurance was vital for many Indians as without such insurance a large percentage of Indian patients would be unable to afford quality health care. The hospital�s health administration department personnel colloquially referred to patients covered by cashless medical insurance as �cashless patients.� The General Insurers� Public Sector Association (GIPSA) a conglomerate of four major public sector insurance companies had pre-approved certain medical procedures as special insurance packages. For instance some of the common insurance packages covered surgery to remove the appendix for the treatment of appendicitis and bypass surgery to treat heart conditions. Nearly 40 per cent of all Bombay Hospital Indore patients underwent treatment that was covered under GIPSA packages.TPAs were organizations that acted as both intermediators and facilitators for the cashless payment process between the medical insurance companies and hospitals. TPAs functioned under the aegis of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and were the points of contact for the health administration departments seeking approval for the medical expenses incurred by the cashless patients. MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGERoy analyzed the entire patient payment process in an attempt to understand the specifics of how the health administration department coordinated with TPAs for covering the medical expenses of cashless patients. The health administration personnel were involved in two different tasks. First once a physician announced the medical care of a patient was complete and the patient was ready to leave the hospital a medical discharge document was created and sent to the health administration department together with the incurred bill. An assistant nurse usually batched the medical discharge documents and delivered them to the health administration desk. The health administration staff upon receiving the batch of medical discharge files would send a text message to each patient�s designated contact person (usually a relative or friend) informing them to bring any additional required documents such as insurance policy documents or ancillary bills incurred during the treatment period. After a patient�s contact person delivered the documents the administration staff processed the medical discharge files and entered the relevant information on a web portal hosted by the corresponding TPA. This first process was termed the Submission of Documentation to TPA for Final Approval. The TPA approval process often took a long time which was outside the hospital administration�s control. Therefore patients� contact persons generally left the health administration department and waited outside but near the hospital. Once the TPA approved the expenses the health administration department staff sent a second automatic text message through the hospital management information system (HMIS) to the patient�s contact person and included instructions regarding further documents required to complete the payment process. These documents might include the pre-approval of a medical insurance claim or information related to the patient�s medical history. After receiving the requested documents from the patient�s contact person the health administration staff proceeded to complete the second process which was termed the Discharge Documentation process. This process included updating the HMIS with payment details regarding the specific TPA-approved amount and generating the administrative discharge permission. If the TPA authorized only a portion of the medical expenditure the patient�s contact person needed to pay the balance in cash. Although the time for the second process was almost identical for all patients the processing time for the first process could vary especially when patients opted for treatment plans listed by the GIPSA. Processing an average of 30 administrative daily discharges efficiency in the two administrative processes was crucial as any delay could lead to a lower bed turnover and hence lower revenue. Therefore because delays in the TPA approval were beyond the control of the health administration department there was great incentive for identifying operational improvements in the medical and administrative discharge process.GATHERING DATA AND the PROCESS ANALYSISRoy had analyzed the process and observed that a patient�s contact person needed to arrive at the health administration department for the two processes at two different times as the TPA approval was required between the two processes. Roy had also through screening the medical records and the HMIS sampled a few consecutive days� worth of data on the discharge process for the cashless patients. Time-stamps for both process 1 (i.e. the Submission of Documentation to TPA for Final Approval) and process 2 (i.e. the Discharge Documentation) were readily available enabling Roy to calculate the various processing times. Roy calculated the average time for the two processes and two types of cashless patients: GIPSA and non-GIPSA patients. The health administration department at Bombay Hospital Indore had two designated staff members who handled the two types of cashless patients; one handled only the GIPSA package patients and the other handled only the non-GIPSA patients. The two employees were efficient and hard-working and they worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every weekday. Generally TPAs also operated during the same office hours. Roy summarized his findings in a process flow diagram that showed the average time required for each process (see Exhibit 1).Following Qureshi�s suggestion Roy crunched the numbers to determine whether the current design was sufficient to handle each day�s workload. Astonishingly he saw that with the two employees no one should need to wait for service! This finding was in contrast to the reality of daily hospital operations where patients were constantly waiting to be processed. Roy thought �Where did I go wrong? Was it related to the uncertainty in arrivals? For sure we should need a third staff member to reduce the wait or at least not have designated staff.� Looking at his numbers Roy was convinced that he was on the right track but he decided to touch base with Qureshi to get some feedback.PRELIMINARY IDEASRoy�s ideas to improve overall operations and in particular patient waiting time focused on (1) pooling the two dedicated staff members�one who handled GIPSA package patients and the other who handled non-GIPSA patients�to have both handle the two types of cashless patients and (2) adding a third staff member.He conveyed the first idea to Qureshi who responded skeptically: From my experience when patient parties observe more than 10 people ahead of them they are very likely to file formal complaints about our service quality! So at most 10 per cent of the time there can be more than 10 people receiving or waiting for service. Therefore it simply is too risky to merge the two lines. Roy remained unmoved as he believed that pooling the resources might help but he was unsure whether it would be sufficient to ensure the minimal risk of an upset patient party. He moved on to the second idea to which Firoz quickly retorted �Substantiate your claim if you suggest another recruit!� Roy knew that he needed to double-check his numbers and rework the analysis because without a sound analysis and solid numbers he would never convince Qureshi.EXHIBIT 1: PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM FOR bombay hospital indore�s HEALTH ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENTNote: GIPSA = General Insurers� Public Sector Association a conglomerate of four major public sector insurance companies that pre-approved coverage for nearly 40 per cent of the medical procedures conducted at Bombay Hospital Indore; TPA = third-part administrator through which insurance companies covered medical expenses for patients whose medical procedures were paid directly to the hospital.Source: Created by the case authors.

Singh the chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Networks India (Sony) was sitting in his office in the Malad suburb of Mumbai India wondering what to do about some impending problems. Singh was concerned about the future of the television show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah (TMKOC) which aired on the television channel Sri Adhikari Brothers Television (SAB TV) a general entertainment channel (GEC) owned by Sony. TMKOC was a flagship family-friendly comedy show that had enjoyed top ratings for years. However new comedy shows that featured edgier and less family-oriented content with jokes at the expense of characters rather than at situations were gaining new viewers. Current viewers were also using mobile devices rather than traditional television sets to watch content; SAB TVâs online platform was less popular than those of their competition. Singh was concerned about how to sustain SAB TV as a market leader despite the growing popularity of unsavoury content from new comedy shows and emerging digital platforms (see Exhibit 1). What steps could Singh take to ensure that SAB TVâs high ratings would continue?OVERVIEW OF INDIAâs MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYIndiaâs media and entertainment (M&E) industry was among the fastest-growing in the world with television radio film print and the Internet among the various platforms available to 1.324 billion potential consumers. To date television had been the top revenue-generating platform. In 2016 Indiaâs television industry was worth â¹588 billion of a total M&E industry valued at â¹1.262 trillion.Television was introduced in India in 1959 under the monopoly of the public broadcaster Doordarshan. In 1991 during the Gulf War the US Cable News Network (CNN) started transmitting television content to India via satellite thus giving the country its first taste of private television. With globalization becoming a trend during that time India allowed private television to grow without stringent regulations which led to a tenfold growth in the consumption of television content. During this first phase Indian television was flooded with foreign programming. However in October 1992 Zee TV began providing Indian viewers with local content on private satellite channels. Zee TV had established a 50/50 joint venture Star TV to make this possible. By 2017 Indiaâs television industry had 877 granted satellite television channels. During that same period the industry catered to 183 million television households roughly equivalent to 870 million individuals. The television industry in India was expected to grow to â¹1.166 trillion by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 per cent. In 2016 an average Indian viewer spent three hours and 16 minutes per day watching television.In 2008 Indiaâs television industry was worth â¹245 billion and was growing at a rate of 9.3 per cent compared to 17.4 per cent annual growth between 2004 and 2008. Of the total revenue in 2008 61 perÂ cent was generated from distribution and 34 per cent was earned from advertising. Total revenue from cable and satellite television households amounted to â¹118 million.The 2008 financial crisis had an adverse effect on the television industryâespecially in regard to advertising revenue. Television channels realized that to remain in operation they had to increase consumption despite severe challenges including rising production and marketing costs restricted funding investment in both analogue and digital distribution retrenchments and the addition of four new GECs: 9X Colors TV New Delhi Television (NDTV) Imagine and Real. Although the share of viewership was being divided among even more channels greater competition was helping raise the overall quality of programming. As a result viewership for GECs increased from 900 gross rating points (GRPs) to 1200 GRPs in less than a year for 33 per cent growth.In 2017 the M&E industry grew at a rate of 11.2 per cent for a total revenue of â¹660 billion. Cable and satellite penetration of the country reached a high of 64 per cent with access to 780 million individuals in 183 million households while television penetration was at 52 per cent in rural areas. Each day Indians were spending an average of over three hours and 44 minutes watching television and 77 per cent of total viewership came from GECs and film channels. Government initiatives such as demonetization and the introduction of a goods and services tax complicated the industryâs attempts to recover losses from slower periods but content creators experimented with new genres and ideas to increase viewership. Sri Adhikari Brothers TelevisionSAB TV was founded by Gautam Adhikari the current chairperson and director. The television channel was incorporated in December 1994 and listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 1999. Since April 2000 the Doordarshan channel ran syndicated content such as comedy shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Shrimaan Shrimati and Zabaan Sambhalke (see Exhibit 2). With 1305 hours of content and related assets SAB TV was acquired in March 2005 by Sony Entertainment Television (later renamed Sony Pictures Networks India) which eventually owned 31 channels. The network positioned SAB TV as a channel for young people and broadcast International Cricket Conference World Cup 2007 matches in Hindi. However when India failed to qualify to the group stage in cricket that year Sonyâs plan to expand the viewership of the channel did not go as expected. Singh said âWhen we came back with the second season of all the showsâSAB had taken a season break on all its successful shows during 45 days of World Cupâthe loyalists had moved on.â In June 2008 SAB TV was repositioned as a comedy GEC as was originally intended before Sonyâs purchase and Sony looked for a cost-effective show to help it increase viewership over the long run. TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH In 2006 Asit Modi proposed a new show TMKOC to Singh. Modi was the founder of Neela Tele Films Private Limited. Modi pitched TMKOC as a show about the comic interplay between multicultural residents of a residential society called Gokuldham (see Exhibit 3) in their day-to-day lives supplemented with social commentary. TMKOC was inspired by the 1970s popular magazine column âDuniya Ne Undha Chasmaâ written by humourist Taarak Mehta for the Gujarati magazine Chitralekha. Singh offered to commission Modiâs show specifically for SAB TV rather than for the entire Sony network which Modi found disappointing because SAB TV had only 25 GRPs at the time. However Singh stressed that the show would be a good fit because SAB TV was being reinvented as a comedy channel from the former youth-based content. Modi had previously pitched the show idea to Sony six times without success. On one occasion the creative team suggested that Modi include a female protagonist in the show but as Modi had always visualized the main character Jethalal as the focus of the show and was not prepared to change he turned down the offer. After a proposal to Disney Channel the entertainment giant asked that the grandson character Tapu be portrayed as less mischievous but Modi refused that offer as well. Zee TV and Star TV had also rejected the show proposal. Modi would narrate stories from his show idea to his family for their feedback. His seven-year-old son enjoyed listening to the stories. Eventually with persuasion from his wife Modi accepted Singhâs offer to air the show on SAB TV. Singhâs team drafted an agreement for 104 episodes of TMKOC; however Modi asked for a base agreement of at least 208 episodes. âI was thinking that 104 episodes will get over in six months and so artists will feel insecureâ Modi said. He was asked by SAB TV to keep to a low budget for the showâs set but Modi opted for more permanent construction which would last at least two years in case the show became successful. This plan required Modi to invest more of his own funds without a long-term commitment by SAB TV. Despite uncertainties Modi believed in the show enough to endure the high initial investment. After Singh approved the contract for 208 episodes TMKOC aired on July 28 2008 as a daily (Monday to Friday) comedy sitcom.  THE BEGINNING For the first six months TMKOC garnered less than 0.5 television rating points (TRP). The low ratings coincided with SAB TVâs operation during a recession. Still Singh upheld his conviction in the show. Modi was also learning along the way. During the first two months of the show an issue would be covered over two consecutive episodes. Around episode number 40 the storyline revolved around Janmashtmi an annual Hindu festival that celebrated the birth of the Indian god Krishna. During that time the showâs TRP increased to 0.7 from the usual 0.3 or 0.4 rating and viewers expressed a desire for more episodes on the same theme. Realizing that people were interested in stories Modi decided to run each storyline for more than two episodes. âI got a grip on storytellingâ he said. After six months of airing episodes TMKOC had arrived at its inflection point a significant change in the situation as Singh realized: âIf we stay true to the core Indian values of joint family and community living this show will appeal to the masses.â Modi also believed in incorporating core family values as well as joint family systems in his showâs content.CONSUMER INSIGHTS Modi had been a regular reader of Mehtaâs writing during his high school years. For his show he altered some of the characters in Mehtaâs magazine column which was written in 1972 to suit the current times. For example he replaced the âHimmatlal masterâ character with a Marathi-speaking teacher to attract more Marathi viewers to the show. He also included Punjabi and Tamil families in the show to attract a wider viewership.Mehtaâs column was originally based in a low-income tenement neighbourhood (known as a chawl in India) but Modi moved the setting to a more appealing housing co-operative (known as a residential society in India) where many different families lived and interacted regularly. During the showâs development Modi had visited various chawls in the Mumbai suburbs of Bhuleshwar Kalbadevi and others to see how people lived but he realized that chawls had changed over time from the setting Mehta had depicted in her column in 1972. Modi decided instead to creating a housing co-operative for the show where different families lived like one large family which he thought would appeal to everyday people. He applied the insights he had gathered and an Indian mindset to the showâs joint family system.Modi created relatable and innocent characters like Tapu Sena (a mischievous group of children); Daya (Jethalalâs wife) who broke into dance (the Indian Garba) on any happy occasion; and Popatlal with his characteristic umbrella. He highlighted the bond between grandfather and grandson in the show. Moreover he visualized Gokuldham society itself as a character.Modi also adapted the show to reflect viewer feedback. For example when a particular ghost storyline had covered four episodes of TMKOC Modi planned to get to the storyâs climax over the next three or four episodes. However after a viewer told Modi that he was curious how Daya would engage with the ghost which Modi had not yet considered he asked the showâs writers to extend the storyline over 16 episodes to accommodate more character interactions.Regarding some aspects of the show however Modi was inflexible. For example he insisted on having a narrator in the show despite some viewer reactions that the narrator slowed the action in the show.Modi brought to life everyday situations through actors who portrayed lovable people-next-door characters. The episodes were based on events that viewers found familiar. âWe had to think what people would expect in terms of story on this Ganesh Chaturthiâ stated Modi referring to the 10-day festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesh. âWhat is the political environment? How is the husband and wife relationship changing?â The scenes of celebration such as Janmashtmi and Ganesh Chaturthi that Modi included in the show where portrayed as larger-than-life just like in a mega-budget show. TMKOC also addressed current events like the Indian governmentâs demonetization initiative. Other stories from the show that sparked viewer attention included the ghost in Gokuldham the Gokuldham Premier League Tapuâs child marriage and Jethalal in Pakistan.Throughout the journey of developing the show over the years Modi was in constant touch with key stakeholders. At gatherings parties and social visits at home or in public he was constantly seeking consumer insights. CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHANNEL Although TMKOCâs TRP ratings were only at 0.3 at the start all other SAB TV shows had lower ratings (around 0.2 TRP). At the showâs first party SAB TV staff members worried that no one was interested in the channel but Modi reassured Singh: âI believe that if the program is good people will come searching for the channel.âTMKOC eventually became important to the channel for more than just viewership as Singh explained. âWhen you have a driver like this it also gets a lot of revenue riding on it.âTMKOCâs success helped SAB TV hold its position in the industry much like the hit show Kaun Banega Crorepati was influential in the success of Star Plus. In fact TMKOC kept increasing its viewership beyond the showâs 10th season. According to data from the Broadcast Audience Research Council of India in 2017 TMKOC topped the rating charts between June 17 and June 23 surpassing some of the biggest shows on Indian television including Naagin 2 and Kumkum Bhagya (see Exhibit 2).According to Modi TMKOC was the number-one show in the 4â14 age group surpassing both Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. The show was also popular among those aged 35 and over. Modi admitted however that viewership for the show was low in the 15â35 age group which was the main viewership of Star TV and Colors TV.In 2016 Jethalal and Daya were among the top 10 fictional characters on Hindi television which reflected the popularity of the show in its 10th year (see Exhibit 1). Modi advised the actors that their characters would remain popular as long as they did not allow vanity to affect their work. Modi was also concerned about the actors growing older which had to reflect their characters. However Modi was pleased with the showâs success to date:The show not only grew in the last decade it also fetched better time spent than many other shows in the 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. slot on Indian television. Constant innovations in storytelling look-feel and characters as per the changing times could have helped us achieve this.  ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS CASE Modi thought back to the ideation of TMKOC around year 2000 when the television environment was changing. âMost of the weekly shows stopped and the era of daily soaps beganâ he said. Shows like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ki were launched around that time (see Exhibit 2). Within the comedy category other shows also suffered; for example Sarabhai vs Sarabhai lost viewership  when it ran as a weekly show. Modi had produced many successful weekly comedy shows such as Hum Sab Ek Hain (for Sony) Yeh Duniya Hai Rangeen Meri Biwi Wonderful and others (see Exhibit 2). He felt that a daily show was needed to fit the new trend but demand for comedy was declining. âWhenever I would pitch comedy the other person would put the phone down as there was a demand of typical family drama that revolved around saas-bahu (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law) conflicts.â But he found that humour was a missing element in day-to-day life so he wanted to deliver a light-hearted show to viewers in a daily format. In 2008 when Singh was trying to relaunch SAB TV as a comedy channel the recession was forcing television channels to keep costs under control. SAB TVâs content had not been successful so far and financial pressure was increasing. Singh had to ensure that TMKOC was produced at a reasonable cost even though top management had confidence in the show as he explained:The viewership was not very strong and therefore revenue was also slow to come by. There was that initial phase of six to nine months (after the show was launched) when everything was iffy and that was right in the middle of the recession and keeping your head above water was more important for everyone.Singh believed in the channelâs new strategy and was confident about the content of TMKOC which made him support the show. Singh was ready to suffer losses for one or two years because he believed that TMKOC was going to be successful. TMKOC soon became a household name in Hindi-speaking homes of India. Hindi was only one of 22 major languages prevalent throughout India but TMKOC managed to also gain popularity across non-Hindi-speaking markets because the show incorporated characters and references representing Indiaâs diverse cultures. Modiâs efforts to bring positive attention to social issues through humour helped TMKOC become the preferred platform for a progressive India. The show was nominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent and contribute to the governmentâs Clean India (Swachh Bharat) Mission which was one of several government initiatives intended to encourage participation by the Indian people. The show was also one of the most desirable programs on Indian television for the promotion of Bollywood films. The success of TMKOC helped other channels realize the potential of the comedy genre which led to the launch of shows with similar appeal such as Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai (see Exhibit 2). TMKOC was the only daily show airing on a GEC within India where the intellectual property rights to the story and characters were held by the production house rather than by the channel. Modi treated each of his characters as a brand with trademarks for all characters. To ensure that TMKOC remained at SAB TV the channel provided regular incentives over the course of the showâs first 10 years. Modi also had the demanding task of keeping the showâs 26-member cast together over that decade which he was able to do successfully for all but one character. Modi was able to keep his cast intact by providing generous remuneration and understanding their whims and emotions. Most crew members had also stayed with the show all that time. TMKOC had started out with a lower budget than most other shows on Hindi GECs and Modi was prepared to wait for a long-term breakeven point. However positive results began appearing by the end of the first year. JOURNEY OF COMEDY Shows like Dekh Bhai Dekh Hum Sab Ek Hain and Shrimaan Shrimati which were popular in the 1990s led the way for shows like Khichdi and Sarabhai vs Sarabhai in the early 2000s and with Comedy Circus making its debut in 2007 a new brand of comedy was emerging. The new shows featured edgy content with double meanings and louder characters. One of these new shows Comedy Nights with Kapil aired from June 2013 to January 2016 and ruled the non-fiction comedy category in 2014.Modi saw the new trend as being more accepting of questionable content. âNow if a vulgar joke is playing on TV people would see it with their daughters. Previously they used to switch it offâ he said. SAB TV seemed to be the only channel to avoid featuring âin-your-face comedyâ and TMKOC was becoming the only show that parents felt comfortable allowing their children to watch without supervision.DIGITAL FORMAT Singh recalled how episodes of TMKOC were distributed among viewers before digital streaming of content became common. Pirated copies of television shows including TMKOCâs shows on digital versatile discs (DVDs) were sold outside railway stations the same night that they aired on television. Viewers had the opportunity to catch up on the missed shows at their preferred time.By 2016 TMKOC was viewed by 2.5 to 3.0 million people in digital format according to Modi. After the launch of the Indian mobile network operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited many more people were watching the show on their mobile devices than at a fixed time on their television sets. Modi wondered how the viewing habits of his loyal audience would change in the future. Research suggested that adults in India were expected to spend an average of one hour and 18 minutes per day on digital media. In 2016 there were 412 million Internet consumers in India. For all online videos viewed by consumers in India 47 per cent used Facebook and 42 per cent watched videos on YouTube where TMKOC episodes were available. The remaining 11 per cent of online viewing was on online video streaming platforms such as Hotstar VOOT Netflix Amazon Prime Video and Jio TV. Although SAB TV had its own video streaming platform called SonyLiv on which TMKOC episodes could be viewed it was not among the most popular online video sources in the country. Star TVâs platform Hotstar was one of the more popular sites and streamed the second season of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai starting in May 2017.WAY FORWARDTMKOC had been successful in attracting viewership to SAB TV but general comedy content on television was diverging away from the typical content on TMKOC. Singh worried about potentially negative effects on the channelâs viewership and wondered what pre-emptive steps might be necessary. He also had to consider how extending SAB TV content on digital sources would require changes in programming time advertising models and other areas. In general Singh wondered how he could ensure the growth of viewership for SAB TV content.EXHIBIT 1: TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAH SHOW PERFORMANCE 2008â2017Note: TVT = television viewership in thousands; TAM = television audience measurement; HSM = Hindi-speaking market; CS = cable and satellite homes; BARC = Broadcast Audience Research Council (trusted Indian media research organization as of 2016).Source: Prepared by the author with information from company documents.Â EXHIBIT 2: INDIAN TeleVision SHOWS exhibit 2 (continued) Sources: India TV Entertainment Desk â7 Die Hard Laughing Sitcoms that Will Make You Grin Ear to Mouthâ IndiaTV June 27 2016 accessed May 10 2018 www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/bollywood-best-comedy-serials-336734; Sana Farzeen âShriman Shrimati Set to Return on SAB TV Here Are All the Deetsâ The Indian EXPRESS February 21 2018 accessed May 7 2018 http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/shriman-shrimati-return-on-sab-tv-meet-new-cast-5072906; Roshni Chakrabarty âTop 10 TV Series Showcasing Indian Cultureâ NewsGram December 31 2015 accessed May 10 2018 www.newsgram.com/top-10-tv-series-showcasing-indian-culture; âKumkum Bhagyaâ Zee5 accessed May 11 2018 www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kumkum-bhagya/0-6-127; âKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thiâ Balaji Teleflims accessed May 11 2018 http://balajitelefilms.com/serial.php?id=18; âCast of Kahaani Ghar Ki Reunites; Kavita Kaushik Shares a Fun Postâ Times of India March 12 2018 accessed May 11 2018 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/cast-of-kahaani-ghar-ghar-ki-reunites-kavita-kaushik-shares-a-fun-post/articleshow/63265400.cms; âSarabhai v/s Sarabhaiâ TV DB accessed May 8 2018 www.thetvdb.com/series/sarabhai-vs-sarabhai; âOur Showsâ Neela Telefilms accessed May 11 2018 www.neelatelefilms.com; Menka Shivdasani âOver to Sonyâ Business Line September 4 2000 accessed May 11 2018 www.thehindubusinessline.com/2000/09/04/stories/100444m9.htm; âBhabi Ji Ghar Par Hainâ Zee TV accessed May 11 2018 www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/bhabi-ji-ghar-par-hain/0-6-199; âStar to Launch New Weekly Comedy in Septemberâ Indian Television August 22 2002 accessed May 8 2018 www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k2/aug/aug131.htm; âSony Announces New Reality-Based Comedy Format âComedy Circusââ Exchange4media June 8 2007 accessed May 11 2018 www.exchange4media.com/media-tv-news/sony-announces-new-reality-based-comedy-format-comedy-circus-26392.html; Shweta Mulki âKapil Sharmaâs Next: Star or Sony?â Afaqs January 22 2016 accessed May 11 2018 www.afaqs.com/news/story/46924_Kapil-Sharmas-next-Star-or-Sony.EXHIBIT 3: MAJOR CHARACTERS IN TAARAK MEHTA KA OOLTAH CHASHMAHSource: Company documents and âOur Showsâ Neela Telefilms accessed May 11 2018 www.neelatelefilms.com.ENDNOTES

(HPI) the country’s leading cement maker for a full (100 per cent) enterprise value of US$2.15 billion (₱112.3 billion). SMC planned to buy an 85.73 per cent controlling stake in HPI which would make SMC the biggest cement player in the country. The transaction involved the potential transfer of the 5531566062 common shares in HPI (or 85.73 per cent of outstanding shares) that had previously been owned by Union Cement Holdings Corporation (UCHC) Holderfin BV (Holderfin) and Cemco Holdings Inc. (Cemco) (see Exhibit 1). The buyer was First Stronghold Cement Industries Inc. (First Stronghold) a wholly owned subsidiary of San Miguel Equity Investments Inc. which in turn was a wholly owned subsidiary of SMC. SMC had won a bidding process against Anhui Conch Cement Co. Ltd. the largest cement manufacturer in mainland China in the final round. Because SMC’s First Stronghold was acquiring controlling interest of a publicly listed company the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required First Stronghold to conduct a mandatory tender offer for the remaining HPI shares held by minority shareholders which represented 14.27 per cent of the total issued and outstanding capital stock. It would also need prior approval from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) since the transaction was valued in excess of ₱1 billion. While waiting for the approval of the PCC and the completion of the post-closing purchase price adjustment First Stronghold and SMC filed a request with the SEC for exemptive relief which would allow the tender offer to be deferred until after the final purchase price had been determined and paid. First Stronghold had made no specific disclosure about the per-share price of the acquisition. However according to market estimates reported in the Philippine Star SMC had bought HPI for an attractive price of at least ₱16.85 per share higher than the closing price of ₱15.30 on May 10 2019. On December 28 2018 HPI shares had traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange (under the ticker symbol “HLCM”) at ₱5.80 (see Exhibit 2).  Richard Saavedra a retail investor had bought HPI shares at ₱7.30 on June 29 2018. He wanted to understand the current prospects of the cement industry and assess the financial health and valuation of HPI in order to decide whether he should (1) sell his shares in HPI at the current market price and take the immediate gain (2) wait for the mandatory tender offer price from SMC or (3) keep his investment in HPI indefinitely. He wondered if the press had reported the right purchase price per share.PHILIPPINE CEMENT INDUSTRYThe Cement Manufacturers’ Association of the Philippines (CeMAP) which represented the industry in projects and programs with the Philippine government comprised five members: HPI; CEMEX Holdings Philippines Inc. with its operating subsidiaries Solid Cement Corporation and APO Cement Corporation; Republic Cement and Building Materials Inc. (Republic Cement); Northern Cement Corporation; and Taiheiyo Cement Philippines Inc. Eagle Cement Corporation (Eagle Cement) a key industry player was not part of the CeMAP.After the PCC investigated CeMAP HPI and Republic Cement for alleged violations of competitive practices in 2016 CeMAP stopped collecting sales data in August 2017 which resulted in the absence of any report on the cement industry. However it was reported in an affidavit that CeMAP president Ernesto Ordoñez HPI and Republic Cement had violated the Philippine Competition Act’s provisions by using anti-competitive agreements by “restricting competition as to price or components thereof or other terms of trade abusing their dominant position by engaging in conduct that substantially prevents restricts or lessens competition imposing barriers to entry or committing acts that prevent competitors from growing within the market.” Demand for cement in the Philippines had expanded from 15.45 metric tons per year (MTPY) in 2010 to 24.40 MTPY in 2015 representing a compounded annual growth rate of 9.53 per cent. This was faster than the Philippine nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.21 per cent over the same time period. At the end of 2016 CeMAP reported an overall increase in sales of cement including imported cement (see Exhibit 3) which had risen to 25.96 million metric tons with 1.59 million metric tons coming from imported cement. To keep up with the rapidly growing demand the cement industry was expected to produce an “additional 11.5 million tons until 2025” which was up from the 26.82 million tons demanded in 2017 and increased the pressure to either import or increase the capacity of cement plants to bridge the gap between demand and supply. In the first quarter of 2019 the cement industry had reported a 64 per cent increase in imports which continued to rise in spite of the imposition of a provisional safeguard duty of ₱8.40 per bag (US$0.16 per bag) imposed in February 2019. The huge demand–supply gap was the result of the poor state of cement plants in the Philippines which were over 20 years old needed renovations and had a clinker-to-cement ratio below 0.80.Future cement demand was expected to continue being driven by growth in the construction sector. Strong government infrastructure spending to support economic growth such as the Build Build Build! program and developments from the private sector were likely to create a major spike in demand for construction supplies including cement. The construction sector had seen massive growth and was expected to reach US$47 billion in value by 2020 following the government’s push for infrastructure development rural-area urbanization and low- and middle-income group housing; there were also increasing demands from a growing expatriate population for posh condominiums. The government had also committed US$23 billion to tourism infrastructure development from 2019 to 2024 under its National Tourism Development Plan. According to industry reports the Philippine residential market was expected to account for 33.9 per cent of the construction industry’s total value in 2020. Following the growth trends the National Economic and Development Authority planned to increase the government’s infrastructure spending to 7.4 per cent of GDP by 2022 up from 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2017. The government had not only identified 75 projects for prioritization approval and implementation but it had also outlined financial aid for middle- and low-income families under several programs. Because of the Philippine peso’s slide against the US dollar bank lending interest rates had increased from 6.1 per cent in 2018 to 7.1 in 2019; this was expected to increase the cost of interest on home loans and thereby lower the demand for housing. Despite this the construction industry looked positive and its contribution as a percentage of GDP had grown steadily from 2005 to 2015.  HPI’s MAJOR competitorsAs of December 2016 the Philippine cement industry had an estimated clinker capacity of 20.60 metric MTPY and cement capacity of 28.63 MTPY. The top four players in the industry (HPI CEMEX Republic Cement and Eagle Cement) accounted for about 80 per cent and 82 per cent of the total clinker and cement domestic production capacities respectively. Although HPI’s cement production capacity was the largest at 8 million metric tons as of 2016 (see Exhibit 4) all four players had invested more funds and introduced newer projects to boost production output by the end of 2020 making the competitive space very unpredictable. CEMEX Holdings Philippines Inc.A subsidiary of the CEMEX Asian South East Corporation CEMEX was a global building materials company with a footprint spanning 50 countries. Besides ordinary Portland and blended cement it produced masonry or mortar cement and ready-mix concrete. CEMEX and its subsidiaries owned two cement plants (see Exhibit 4) a ready-mix concrete plant and an admixtures facility. It also owned many shipping terminals and land-distribution facilities throughout the Philippines. As part of its corporate social responsibility program CEMEX developed green products and introduced many skill-enhancing initiatives. In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (Typhoon Haiyan) in 2013 it also helped rebuild the northern part of Cebu province and rehabilitate affected communities in collaboration with the local government and non-profit organizations. Republic Cement GroupThe Republic Cement Group a joint venture between the Ireland-based CRH and local conglomerate Aboitiz Equity Ventures had several companies under its umbrella: Republic Cement & Building Materials Inc. Republic Cement Iligan Inc. Republic Cement Mindanao Inc. and Republic Cement Services Inc. While Aboitiz Equity Ventures a public holding company of the Aboitiz Group was a Filipino business group listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange its partner CRH a Fortune 500 building materials company was a listed on the London and Irish stock exchanges. Besides cement the group had business interests across the banking and financial services infrastructure power food and real estate sectors. Republic Cement was committed to nation-building through several corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives: Stronger Communities focused on community welfare Stronger Kids focused on child welfare Greener Cement focused on environmental restoration and preservation Stronger Homes focused on affordable housing and Stronger Structures focused on infrastructure development.Eagle Cement CorporationThe president and chief operating officer (COO) of SMC Chinese Filipino businessman Ramon Ang was reported to be the majority owner and manager of Eagle Cement Corporation. Through one of this company’s two wholly owned subsidiaries South Western Cement Corporation Eagle Cement was engaged in the manufacture marketing sale and distribution of cement products and by-products and owned mineral rights in Malabuyoc Cebu. Through the other subsidiary KB Space Holdings Inc. it owned large pockets of prime commercial land in the City of Mandaluyong. Eagle Cement’s plant at Barangay Akle in San Ildefonso Bulacan was not only the newest and most technological advanced with two production lines but it also had the largest production capacity (in number of cement bags) in the Philippines. HOLCIM PHILIPPINES INC.HPI was created through the 2000 merger of three companies—Bacnotan Cement Corporation Davao Union Cement Corporation and Hi Cement Corporation—and the acquisition of the Alsons Cement Corporation in 2002. As of December 31 2018 60.55 per cent of HPI was owned by Union Cement Holdings Corporation (UCHC); 18.11 per cent by Holderfin BV (Holderfin); and 7.08 per cent by Cemco; while the remainder of its shares were owned by the public (see Exhibit 1). Product LinesHPI manufactured sold and distributed cement dry-mix mortar products and clinker. It offered various cement brands in cement bags and in bulk and it also sold a semi-finished product called clinker which was sold only in bulk to cement producers. Moreover it was involved in the ready-mix concrete business aggregates and dry-mix mortar products.Marketing and DistributionHPI had four cement production facilities one cement grinding mill and various ports and warehouses around the Philippines enabling it to serve customers around the country. HPI’s customers were composed of traders wholesalers retailers and contractors who supplied private and public projects real estate developers and concrete producers. HPI supplied various commercial and government infrastructure projects with the goal of having a well-balanced portfolio containing different categories of customers so that it was not dependent on just a few customers.Risk FactorsOne significant risk factor for HPI was the level of construction activity in both the private and public arenas. Public construction was driven by government spending in sectors such as infrastructure and housing which were subject to budgetary constraints and political considerations. In contrast private-sector construction was affected by investors’ confidence in economic and political conditions in the country.Another risk factor was the possibility of prolonged damage or a breakdown in the company’s large production facilities on the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. It also needed a stable source of power for the continuing operation of these production facilities. Finally company operations were subject to environmental and regulatory risks. For example cement manufacturing involved the use of fossil fuels and electric power and ran the risk of possible emissions of dust into the atmosphere which might adversely affect the environment.Company PerformanceHPI showed a modest financial performance in 2018 with earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) declining to ₱4.9 billion from ₱5.4 billion in 2017 on the back of weak revenue growth in the first three quarters of 2018. Its revenue increased by 2.54 per cent based on stable prices and higher volume. Revenues rose from ₱34.7 billion in 2017 to ₱35.6 billion in 2018 driven by expanding demand from the public and private sectors and tighter competition among cement players. Net income after tax declined from ₱2.7 billion to ₱2.5 billion in 2018 because of higher interest expenses from higher debt (see Exhibits 5 and 6 and the accompanying student spreadsheet product no. 7B21N006). Going forward HPI planned to improve and expand its cement and clinker production facilities as well as to continue cost improvement initiatives to address the impact of higher costs.DIVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF LAFARGEHOLCIM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA LafargeHolcim Ltd. (LafargeHolcim) was the global leader in building materials and solutions. It was active in four business segments: cement aggregates ready-mix concrete and solutions and products which included precast concrete asphalt mortar and building solutions. Headquartered in Switzerland LafargeHolcim held leading positions in all regions across the globe (Asia Pacific Europe North America Latin America and the Middle East/Africa). It employed approximately 75000 people in around 80 countries and had a portfolio that was equally balanced between developing and mature markets. LafargeHolcim was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and on Euronext Paris and was a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) European Index.In 2017 as part of its five-year turnaround plan called Strategy 2022—Building for Growth LafargeHolcim announced plans that included the divestment of its assets in Southeast Asia worth at least US$2.0 billion. These divestments were planned to significantly improve LafargeHolcim’s debt ratios: its target was to achieve two times net debt–to–recurring earnings before EBITDA by the end of 2019 and to concentrate on the United States Latin America India and Africa. Why Southeast Asia?LafargeHolcim’s largest business area in terms of volume and number of employees was Asia Pacific which covered India China Bangladesh Australia and Southeast Asia. The company operated 117 integrated cement and cement grinding plants in the Asia Pacific region with total cement grinding capacity of 117.4 million metric tons. Unfortunately in 2017 Asia Pacific reported lower earnings despite higher volumes among the company’s three product lines namely cement aggregates and ready-mix concrete and its full-year recurring EBITDA had declined by 6.9 per cent to US$1.42 billion. In the Philippines operating EBITDA in 2017 had declined by 49.6 per cent from the previous year because of lower revenues and higher fuel and production costs. LafargeHolcim’s chief executive officer (CEO) Jan Jenisch said in May 2018 that the company’s Southeast Asian business had been “a bit more challenging” amid price pressure in markets such as the Philippines and Malaysia.Subsequently in November 2018 LafargeHolcim announced that it was selling its 80.6 per cent stake in Holcim Indonesia for an enterprise value of US$1.75 billion to PT Semen Indonesia. The assets sold included the entirety of LafargeHolcim’s operations in Indonesia which consisted of four cement plants 33 ready-mix plants and two aggregate quarries. PT Semen Indonesia was a major building materials company in Indonesia. In May 2019 LafargeHolcim also announced the sale of its 51 per cent holding in Lafarge Malaysia Berhad for US$396 million (MYR3.75 per share). This price represented a 43 per cent premium over the prior three-month average trading price of Lafarge Malaysia Berhad on the Malaysian stock exchange. Lafarge Malaysia Berhad operated three integrated cement and two grinding plants. The buyer was YTL Cement Berhad which was a part of YTL Corporation Berhad a Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate involved in cement production construction property development and utilities. Finally LafargeHolcim also sold its entire 91 per cent holdings in its Singapore operation for an enterprise value of US66.85 million to YTL Cement Singapore PTE Limited.Sale of HPIRumours about the potential sale of the Philippine unit of LafargeHolcim first came out in January 2019 when it was revealed that Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)-listed company Eagle Cement Corporation the fourth-largest cement company in the Philippines was interested in taking over HPI’s local assets. Ramon Ang was the chairman of the Eagle Cement Corporation board as well as the vice-chair president and COO of SMC. Shares of HPI surged on news of the potential sale. Finally on May 11 2019 HPI and SMC confirmed that LafargeHolcim had signed an agreement for the divestment of LafargeHolcim’s entire 85.73 per cent shareholding in HPI for an enterprise value of US$2.15 billion on a 100 per cent enterprise-value basis.LafargeHolcim announced that its sale of operations in Indonesia Malaysia Singapore and now the Philippines would enable it to exit Southeast Asia with an enterprise value of US$4.9 billion. These divestitures were negotiated based on a 2018 enterprise value–to–recurring EBITDA multiple of above 21 times. These would also reduce the company’s net debt–to–recurring EBITDA ratio by 0.6 times.According to Jan Jenisch LafargeHolcim’s CEOWith the divestment of our activities in the Philippines we are completing our exit from the increasingly hyper-competitive arena in Southeast Asia. While this decision was based on our strategic portfolio review we had reached very attractive valuations allowing us to achieve a new level of financial strength. We would have over performed our target ratio of net debt–to–recurring EBITDA of two times or less by the end of 2019. We had delivered on the promised strengthening of our balance sheet and we are on track to accelerate the execution of our Strategy 2022–“Building for Growth.”LafargeHolcim said that it had conducted competitive bidding for HPI and that SMC had presented the best offer. Industry sources indicated that SMC overcame various international players such as China-based Anhui Cement Corp. Japan-based Taiheyo Cement Corp. Thailand-based Siam City Cement and the Philippines’ Eagle Cement Corporation.SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION SMC with its subsidiaries was one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines with sales that accounted for approximately 5.9 per cent of the Philippine GDP in 2018. SMC businesses included a globally recognized beer brand food and packaging fuel and oil energy infrastructure and banking investment. Almost 66 per cent of SMC was owned by Top Frontier Investment Holdings Inc.; however deeper research showed that Ramon Ang held over 32 per cent of SMC shares through his wholly owned companies Privado Holdings Corp. and Master Year Limited (see Exhibit 7).In its corporate disclosure with the PSE SMC said its acquisition of HPI would increase the foothold of the San Miguel Group in the cement business and would provide the company the opportunity to implement its plan to expand its cement business nationwide. In 2013 SMC purchased 35 per cent of Northern Cement Company which was controlled by Eduardo Cojuango the chair of SMC. In 2017 SMC entered a joint venture with Northern Cement Company to build a new cement plant in the province of Pangasinan. SMC owned 70 per cent of the joint venture company. The acquisition of HPI was widely seen as Roman Ang’s expansionary move into the cement business amid the government’s ongoing massive infrastructure push. Astro del Castillo managing director at First Grade Finance Inc. said “It’s a logical move for San Miguel considering its exposure to road and airport projects. The company was capitalizing on the government’s ‘Build Build Build’ infrastructure program.” In an interview Ang said he was confident the company would receive the necessary PCC approval since both the public and government considered it positive for a Filipino company to acquire HPI. He added “Do you know that 35 per cent of cement being sold in the Philippines today are imported cement? And the major players in the Philippines―HPI CEMEX Lafarge-CRH and Japanese firm Taiyo and another Taiwanese―they are all foreigners. Don’t you want a Filipino to acquire it?” SMC disclosed that it was buying controlling interest of HPI from three companies controlled by LafargeHolcim namely the Dutch company Holderfin BV Union Cement Holdings Corp. and Cemco Holdings Inc. The consideration of the transaction was to be paid in cash on closing subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment. Furthermore it was disclosed that the amount of the consideration had been negotiated and determined based on the valuation of the business of the target through a discounted cash flow method as well as other methodologies customary for transactions of this nature.PHILIPPINE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONSAs a result of this transaction First Stronghold as the purchaser was required to conduct a mandatory tender offer for the remaining HPI shares held by minority shareholders which represented 14.27 per cent of the total issued and outstanding capital stock. In any acquisition that would result in ownership of over 50 per cent of the equity of a public company the SEC required the acquirer to buy out the minority shareholders through a tender offer at a price supported by the fairness opinion provided by an independent financial advisor. In addition parties to a merger or acquisition valued at over ₱1 billion were required to notify the PCC of their agreement which could not be completed without the approval of the PCC. The PCC had been mandated under the Philippine Competition Act to review mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they would not substantially reduce competition in the relevant market or harm the interest of consumers. Accordingly SMC and HPI notified the PCC of the transaction on June 6 2019. While the HPI acquisition was announced at a time when the PCC was also investigating a possible cartel in the local cement industry details and even updates about this probe had been kept secret. However Renato Balisacan chair of the PCC said that the SMC-HPI takeover deal was “different” from this ongoing investigation saying “Unlike cartel investigations which look into past conduct merger reviews are carried out to determine any competition concerns before the transaction is consummated to prevent potential damage to consumers.” While they waited for the PCC’s approval and the completion of post-closing purchase price adjustment First Stronghold and SMC filed a request for exemptive relief with the SEC to allow the tender offer to be conducted after the final purchase price had been determined and paid. VALUING HPIOn Friday May 10 2019 shares of HPI closed at ₱15.30 per share. Saavedra wanted to confirm this value with his own estimates in order to decide whether to (1) sell his shareholdings in HPI at the current market price and take the gain (2) wait for the yet unpriced mandatory tender offer that SMC was required to launch or (3) keep his investment in HPI indefinitely. Saavedra was able to get a copy of HPI’s financial statements (see Exhibits 5 and 6). From this he thought that he could make income statement free cash flow and working capital forecasts. He wanted to estimate the share price value of HPI as of January 1 2019 incorporating a full-year 2019 forecast. He planned to run a five-year value growth duration from 2019 to 2023 and a sixth-year normalized free cash flow forecast for 2024 which he would use to estimate the terminal value. He projected that revenues would grow at the rate of 10.5 per cent annually over the value growth duration. This was the same nominal growth rate exhibited by the construction industry in the first quarter of 2019. He also assumed that cost- and expense-to-revenue ratios would be based on the average of the last three years leading up to 2018 (inclusive). He expected that net working capital (namely operating cash receivables inventory and trade payables) would follow 2018 estimates and he assumed that HPI intended to set aside 7 per cent of revenues as operating cash.  There was some publicly available information to help forecast capital expenditures. In early 2019 HPI had invested US$54 million (₱2.82 billion) to expand cement production in its La Union plant. For simplicity Saavedra assumed that depreciation would be 5 per cent of revenues and that capital expenditures (CAPEX) would equal depreciation from 2019 to 2023. As things stood he knew that depreciation was already embedded in the cost-of-sales number. For the 2024 free cash flow estimate for terminal value he assumed that depreciation would be same percentage of revenues but that CAPEX would be ₱350 million more than depreciation based on the 10-year historical difference between these two accounts.  He found out that the market risk premium for the Philippines was 6.33 per cent which was the long-term equity market return in excess of the 91-day Treasury bill rate. For revenue and free-cash-flow growth rate for terminal value he had a few possible choices: he noted that the World Bank had projected the Philippine inflation rate at 3.5 per cent for 2019; he read that the Philippine nominal GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 had been 7.8 per cent; and he saw from his previous research that the cement industry was expected to produce “an additional 11.50 MTPY until 2025” from a base of 26.82 MTPY at the end of  2017.  He decided to estimate beta based on monthly HPI stock prices and PSE index (PSEi) values over the last three years (see Exhibit 8). He assumed that SMC would retain HPI’s current capital structure after the acquisition and that the pre-tax cost of debt would remain at 4.66 per cent. He thought he would use the current market capitalization for the weight of equity. He assumed that the “Due to Related Parties” account was non-interest bearing. He also found additional data on the rate of Philippine government securities (see Exhibit 9). He assumed a tax rate of 30 per cent which was consistent with the Philippine corporate tax rate. With all this information on hand Saavedra proceeded to run a discounted cash flow valuation of HPI. Saavedra was also able to gather financial ratios for SMC and for comparable companies in the construction infrastructure and allied services sub-sector of the PSE (see Exhibit 10). He wondered if the trading multiples of HPI would compare well with those of its competitors. Did HPI’s controlling stockholders get a good offer price from SMC? What should Saavedra do given the prevailing market price of ₱15.30? The tender offer price was unknown but he expected it to be the same as that offered to HPI’s controlling stockholders. Should he sell now should he wait for the tender offer or should he do nothing at all and just hold on to his stock?Exhibit 1: Ownership Structure of Holcim Philippines Inc.Source: Holcim Philippines Inc. 2018 Annual Report 142 February 28 2019 accessed July 262020 https://www.holcim.ph/sites/philippines/files/atoms/files/hpi_2018_annual_report.pdf.Exhibit 2: Holcim Philippines Inc.

Ford announced that it would recall more than one million vehicles worldwide as a result of faulty airbags that had failed to deploy upon collision causing multiple deaths. It turned out that Ford had been aware of these faulty airbags but had not taken proactive measures to mitigate potential damage. This information was uncovered by the U.S. regulators who were investigating the multiple deaths in Ford vehicles. Because of the investigation Fordâs share price dropped from US$13.10 to US$12.18 per share on January 17 2018. Smith was trying to anticipate the future of Ford as the holding of the Ford equity represented a significant portion of his investment portfolios. Investors had already started contacting him about the future of the company and the state of their investments. Smith anticipated that given the recent announcement Fordâs share value would drop drastically so he needed to act fast to mitigate the loss of value for his investors. Smith wondered whether Ford could recover from this disaster in the long term and whether its product safety would continue to be an issue and negatively affect its shareholders. While exploring different companies as potential places to reinvest the money Smith wanted to remain in the automotive industry to maintain the portfoliosâ diversification. He had thus explored other companies such as Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) General Motors Company (GM) and Honda Motor Company Ltd. (Honda) as possible alternatives to Ford. FORD MOTOR COMPANYFord Motor Company headquartered in Dearborn Michigan was an American multinational automobile manufacturer founded by Henry Ford in 1903. It was the second-largest automobile manufacturer based in the United States and employed approximately 202000 workers worldwide. The company had been publicly incorporated since 1956; however the Ford family continued to retain 40 per cent of its voting rights. Ford sold automobiles under the Ford brand while its luxury automobiles were sold under the Lincoln brand. Ford specialized in large-scale manufacturing by using an industrial workforce. It had incorporated moving assembly lines into its plant operations and used modern economic and social systems to facilitate mass production. This method of production became known as Fordism and was widely applied to improve productivity within the industry. In addition Ford aimed to maintain a lean inventory by adopting just-in-time inventory management. INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONSGlobal automotive sales had increased by 5.6 per cent in 2016. Asian-Pacific markets had seen the highest growth and volume of automotive sales in 2016. The key contributor to the increase in sales was the Chinese market given its high double-digit growth. In North America the United States had seen a growth rate of 0.4 per cent in 2016 with 17.55 million cars soldâa record number.  It was good news for the shrinking industry in the United States. The slowly improving economy and the increasing demand for trucks and SUVs seemed to finally turn the business around at least for the time being. Global automotive unit sales continued to grow and reached 86.05 million units in 2017. The growth rate of the global automotive industry was expected to be about 3 per cent annually in 2017 and 2018. Sales of electric cars were expected to take up a larger share of the overall market with most of the growth coming from China and Europe. Overall the 2017 year-end conditions were positive with both global and domestic conditions showing improvements. Analysts and consumers expected these positive trends to continue into the near future. The World Bank forecasted global economic growth to increase to 3.1 per cent with advanced economies expected to grow at a more conservative 2.9 per cent. Overall consumer confidence increased; however this consumer confidence was accompanied with the risk of overinflated asset prices and heightened equity prices. The auto manufacturing industry had seen a trend toward electrification and digitalization solutions. In addition autonomous driving was just becoming another key trend expected to continue into the long-term future. In both technologies Tesla Inc. had been a market leader but other major players were also ramping up their investments by partnering with non-traditional technology companies to introduce new car models powered by new technologies. In January 2018 Ford pledged to spend $11 billion on electric cars by 2022 which doubled its original investment estimate. Regional start-ups were also entering the electric vehicle market spurred by the $2 billion that had been invested in these start-up companies. The share of diesel engines in Europe was declining and expected to continue shrinking due to tightening regulations. Besides Europe countries across the world including major markets such as China and India were planning to introduce bans and regulations on diesel cars. As a result automotive companies saw a rise in environmental regulations increasing their overall costs while the increasing cost of fuel had reduced the demand for fuel-engine cars. THE ALTERNATIVESSmith and his team identified Fordâs main competitors to be GM Toyota and Honda. These companies competed directly with Ford and thus represented viable alternatives to the Ford stock. GM was an American multinational corporation headquartered in Detroitâs Renaissance Center. The company designed manufactured and distributed vehicles and vehicle parts and was the second-largest automobile manufacturer in the world and the largest in the United States. GM had a strong position in the U.S. automotive market. The companyâs best-known auto brands were Cadillac Chevrolet GMC Holden and Wuling. Toyota the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world was a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota Japan. Toyota was by far the worldâs leader in the sales of hybrid electric vehicles having successfully applied its mass-production strategy to its line of hybrid electric vehicles. According to Toyota 80 per cent of Toyota cars sold in 1998 were still on the road.  Honda was a Japanese public multinational conglomerate corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles aircraft motorcycles and power equipment. Since 1959 Honda had been the worldâs largest motorcycle manufacturer. Furthermore Honda was the worldâs largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume. In 2013 Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter to the United States. THE ANALYSISThe team at Uria Investment had all of the information available to make their decision. They had the comparative financial informationâbalance sheets (see Exhibit 1) income statements (see Exhibit 2) and statements of cash flow (see Exhibit 3)âfor the four companies as well as the financial ratios (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Smith had also reviewed Fordâs stock price and was taking into consideration analyst forecasts for the stock price as compared with its competitors (see Exhibits 6 and 7). Fordâs stock had fluctuated slightly during 2017 but the closing stock price was within the same range as at the beginning of the year. When Smith initially invested in Ford he believed it would translate into long-term growth and profits for his clients. However as he analyzed the situation Smith was unsure whether Ford could recover from the numerous safety scandals while simultaneously catching up to competitors in terms of innovation. Smith and his team wondered what this information would uncover and how it would lead to the final decision.

(Netflix) was faced with another round of skeptical business press as he attempted to grow his firm in 2017. His 1990s start-up business plan which had introduced the market to the convenience of home delivery of DVDs through the mail had eviscerated the prior market leader Blockbuster LLC (Blockbuster) forcing it to divest itself of thousands of brick-and-mortar video rental stores before finally falling into bankruptcy. Hastings was so successful that Fortune magazine named him its 2010 âBusinessperson of the Year.â This meteoric rise however seemed a distant memory as Netflix focused on its transition to the digital delivery of video content. Digital delivery required mastering new technologies and created the need to acquire or create popular content. Numerous competitors including both established mainstream content producers and digital upstarts were making it difficult for Netflix to recreate its earlier dominant success. The business press had become critical of Netflixâs slowing acquisition of subscribers and its accelerating levels of debt which had reached US$3.4 billion by March 2017.Netflix was faced with the challenge of determining where and how quickly it would invest its capital in order to continue its growth. Though the company had had early success in creating new exclusive content (e.g. television series House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black) this apparent invincibility appeared to be fading as more recent shows (e.g. The Get Down Iron Fist) had been panned by the critics. As Netflix faced increasing competition to acquire exclusive content some of which came from companies with a long history of success in content development both the cost and the risk of failure seemed to be rising. In addition former content suppliers that had previously licensed content to Netflix now viewed Netflix more warily given its growth and apparent ambition to become more than just a delivery platform. Future deals would undoubtedly be more expensive if agreement could even be reached at all. Should Netflix continue to try to be a content producer competing with Hollywoodâs industry leaders? Should it form a partnership with another media company or companies to align everyoneâs incentives? Should it consider moving into other media content areas outside of traditional entertainment? Further there remained the question of how to treat its legacy DVD-by-mail business a former cash cow that had been the subject of controversy both in the market and internally at Netflix. Would the best choice be to sell the franchise and cash out? Netflix needed to decide where when and how to invest so as to ensure its future lest it suffer the same fate as Blockbuster.BACKGROUND: VIDEO RENTAL STORES AND THE RISE OF BLOCKBUSTERTo better understand Netflixâs situation it is useful to understand the industry that existed before it entered the marketplace. Although Sony Corporation (Sony) developed its Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR) in 1976 for U.S. consumers the key development in the growth of home video entertainment was a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court 5â4 decision that found that the Betamax did not violate copyright laws. This was followed by Congress affirming the copyright lawâs âfirst saleâ doctrine and refusing to pass a law proposed by Hollywood studios that would have forbidden the renting or re-selling of movie videotapes. In short order the focus of VCR users shifted from recording broadcast shows onto blank tapes to buying or renting pre-recorded media. The video rental industry in which VCR owners could rent tapes with video content (e.g. movies) was initially dominated by a variety of independent stores that had sprung up quickly in neighbourhoods everywhere. In 1985 David Cook opened the first Blockbuster store in Dallas Texas. Blockbuster brought to the industry an aggressive strategy based on multiple stores and a central database that connected them. These data allowed Blockbuster to more accurately forecast demand for videos and its emerging economies of scale kept its costs lower than that of its competition. By opening stores larger than those run by mom-and-pop operators Blockbuster could offer customers more choices and more copies of popular movies. By 1993 Blockbuster had grown to over 3400 stores an accomplishment it achieved despite some hesitancy by the movie studios which preferred the higher margins on individual consumer sales via outlets like Best Buy rather than the smaller margins available from Blockbusterâs rentals. NETFLIXâS DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION Netflix Knocks Off BlockbusterNetflix lore noted that Hastingsâs desire to found Netflix started with a $40 Blockbuster late fee that he incurred in 1997. As motivating as that might have been the shift from bulky VHS videotapes to slimmer more durable DVDs was also necessary to make a mail-order model feasible. One limitation for Netflix in 1997 was that DVD players were new and expensive and therefore had limited U.S. household adoption. Blockbuster continued its growth of brick-and-mortar stores and also began integrating DVDs into its inventory. In 1999 Netflix hired Ted Sarandos from Blockbuster competitor West Coast Video and he focused on the content side of the business. Rapid growth in U.S. DVD adoption helped both firmsâhalf of all U.S. households owned a DVD player by 2003 and over 80 per cent of households adopted this technology within the first nine years of its introduction. This adoption rate was even faster than that for VCRs which had taken 13 years to reach the same level.Netflixâs pricing evolved from a traditional fee per rental just as in video stores to a monthly subscription model at first limited to a fixed number of DVDs then later evolving into a $20/month price for unlimited rentals. Significantly Netflix had no late feesâcustomers could watch their rentals at their convenience whereas late fees were Blockbusterâs primary revenue source. Netflix also touted the convenience of shopping by mail eliminating both the trip to the store to rent a title and the trip to return it. However Netflix found it challenging to provide an adequate number of high-demand titles to its customers. Its solution was to be an early developer and exploiter of database personalization using a customerâs past rental history to suggest other titles they might like. Though keyed from past rental history the recommendation system was also biased towards titles that Netflix actually had in stock and therefore allowed Netflix to fulfill a greater percentage of orders. In addition its relatively centralized inventory permitted it to stock a greater variety of titles which Blockbuster with its inventory scattered across thousands of individual retail locations could not easily support. Netflix developed good relationships with DVD suppliers who saw it as another outlet for their product and as a hedge against the growing near-monopsonist Blockbuster. Netflix also worked closely on advanced integration with the U.S. Postal Service becoming one of its biggest customers. In 2000 Netflix with its 300000 subscribers was still not profitable. Meanwhile DVD-player adoption had helped fuel Blockbusterâs growth to some 7700 stores. Hastings who earlier in his career had started but later sold the company Pure Software had reported that in 2000 he engaged in negotiations with Blockbuster to sell it interest in Netflix for $50 million: âWe offered to sell a 49-per-cent stake and take the name Blockbuster.comâ he said but Blockbuster was not interested.Blockbuster would attempt to copy Netflix with an online service in 2004 hoping to leverage the availability of its brick-and-mortar stores with the mail-order option and keep the operations integrated. It was ultimately unsuccessful with its online offering however as were other contemporaneous imitators such as Wal-Mart. Netflix grew from 4.2 million subscribers in 2005 to 15 million in 2010 (see Exhibit 2). Although Blockbuster still had 47 million registered customers its eventual demise seemed apparent. Netflix had more than doubled to 32 million subscribers by November of 2013âthe month that Blockbuster announced it was going out of business. NETFLIX FACES DIGITAL DELIVERYWhat Is Digital Delivery?Information goods (i.e. any good that could be represented digitally) could be delivered over a communication network such as the Internet. Initially early Internet content was limited to lower-volume content such as text and then later images and music. Video content with its relatively large file sizes tended to be limited to physical media such as film videotape and discs. However with advances in both network speeds and compression algorithms to deliver content with greater fidelity using less data other options emerged.Traditionally the first step in digital delivery was via downloaded content such as Apple iPod users downloading the complete file of any music they purchased from the iTunes online store. These files were stored on the userâs device and could be played repeatedly thus mimicking physical media such as vinyl records audio tapes and music compact discs which consumers were used to purchasing and owning. Streaming content on the other hand was content that was played on the consumerâs device but stored on a different deviceâtypically a server operated by the content owner or licensee. Streaming required a network connection between the two devices in order to play the content. In this way it more closely resembled listening to music on the radio where the listener needed to have a connection to the content (similar to radio frequency reception) as opposed to owning local copies. Because video typically required much more data than music streaming video required a faster network connection in order to provide a reasonable viewing experience. As a consequence some content owners developed lower-resolution versions of their files in order to reduce their size which then allowed them to stream the content. This also avoided the problem of allowing consumers to possess a digital copy of their content which could potentially be shared or resold. Furthermore the very large file sizes of full movies acted as a partial deterrent to digital piracy (as did law enforcement efforts such as the 2012 closure of the popular website Megaupload). Netflix initially thought the future of digital video delivery would be downloading not streaming. It created a dedicated device (that later was sold and became the Roku box) for this purpose but eventually developed a standalone streaming service which was released as âWatch Instantlyâ in 2008. Early attempts at streaming were low quality and in any event most potential customers did not have the required Internet bandwidth. However seeing the potential of streaming in 2011 Netflix made what would be seen as an ill-fated too-early commitment to the digital delivery model when it announced a decision to split itself between its traditional DVD business (to be re-named âQwiksterâ) and an uncoupled streaming business which required separate customer logins. As it was to be operated as two separate companies with no bundled discounts for those seeking both DVD rentals and streaming availability the new pricing model would mean a 60 per cent effective price hike for existing subscribers who wanted to continue both service types. Predictably the announcement was met with a loss of 800000 subscribers and Netflixâs stock price fell 77 per cent. Although Netflix reversed the decision a month later considerable damage had been done.  This public relations disaster fed into a variety of contemporaneous pessimistic predictions about Netflixâs future. One noted that Netflix shares were in âfree fallâ after the third-quarter mishaps and projected future losses. Another said âcustomers wasted little time in jumping ship.â Despite these misgivings Netflix recovered and continued to grow after 2011 increasing its subscriber count from 23.5 million to over 93 million by the end of 2016 a compound annual growth rate of 32 per cent. REED HASTINGSâS DECISION POINTSDigital Delivery ChallengesRegardless of the mode or degree of digital delivery adoption digital delivery presented Netflix with significant challenges in terms of streaming content acquisition. This was not a problem in the DVD-by-mail delivery model as DVDs could be acquired from distributors and then rented. However acquiring streaming content was both riskier and more expensive.First licensing content was subject to the terms dictated by the content owner. Netflix learned this lesson early on when its original streaming contract with the Starz network expired. Starz would not renew the contract on terms acceptable to Netflix leaving Netflix with a hole in its available inventory. Second the home entertainment market was a very crowded one with 12 streaming competitors to Netflix that had each surpassed 1 million subscribers. One significant competitor was Hulu founded by The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and 21st Century Fox (Fox) in 2007 and later joined by the DisneyâABC Television Group and Time Warner Inc. It operated on a subscription model but also offered advertisement-supported options. Fox streamed content 24 hours a day through Hulu in some cases even bypassing its local affiliates. As of July 2017 Hulu had the greatest viewer engagement of all streaming services measured at 2.9 hours per day (versus Netflixâs 2.2 hours per day) and its content included the shows Casual and The Handmaidâs Tale. Another streaming competitor was Amazon Prime Video. Amazon initially offered its Amazon Prime Video service as a bonus for subscribers to its fee-based Prime membership service. Doing so provided the video streaming service a large number of subscribers at launch. Further the service benefited from Amazonâs financial power and multiple lines of business (e.g. Amazon Web Services). Amazon spent more than $100 million on content in the third quarter of 2014 alone and its portfolio included the television series Transparent and The Man in the High Castle. In addition its Fire TV platform grew with each device it sold (see Exhibit 3 for additional details).Traditional web giants that competed with Netflix included both Google LLC/YouTube LLC (YouTube) and Facebook Inc. (Facebook). While 75 per cent of U.S. Wi-Fi households had a Netflix subscription YouTube had quickly grown into second place in 2017 with 53 per cent penetration and reached more of the coveted 18â34-year-old demographic than any cable network. Its content included the series Escape the Night. Facebook late to the sector had also announced plans to offer new proprietary content and tried to make up for its late start by offering Hollywood studios better terms for their content including sharing advertising revenue and data on viewership the latter of which was an important asset that had distinguished the success of digital platforms such as Netflix. Of course Netflix also competed with traditional home entertainment outlets including Home Box Office (HBO) and Sling TV Dishâs live TV service. HBO had an extensive library of shows to watch on demand via cable and it had an app (HBO Go). It had a large number of subscribers and a strong extended track record of developing very popular original content such as television series The Sopranos and Game of Thrones. Sling TV although it had fewer subscribers than Netflix in 2017 had viewers who were more engaged averaging 47 viewing hours per month versus Netflixâs 28 hours per month.Many of these competitors fell into the category of âcoopetitionâ to Netflix a term that suggests co-operation between competing companies. Netflix licensed content from some of the same companies that formed Hulu but at the same time provided a competing service. Further it relied on companies like Sony which had its own streaming service to carry the Netflix app on Sonyâs PlayStation videogame consoles. Lastly Netflix relied on the availability of bandwidth from cable companies to provide its services to customers; many of these same cable companies (e.g. Comcast Time Warner Inc.) were also content producers with an interest in streaming services and with which Netflix competed.Major news outlets such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix was seen as a rival to firms from which it had previously licensed content and that therefore deals were being cut back. The Wall Street Journal wrote â[Netflix] must keep things cordial with Hollywoodâs traditional studios . . . [and] prevent them from turning to its main competitors Amazon and Hulu.â  It only had the one source of revenue but in its new market it was competing with firms that had much more diverse portfolios and revenue streams.For example if Netflix wanted to acquire some popular new show it most likely would have to borrow money from the bank; if Amazon wanted to acquire it it could borrow money from the Amazon Web Services division (of which somewhat ironically Netflix was a customer). Apple Inc. another financially powerful competitor with $260 billion in cash in 2017 was also investing in content creation most recently poaching two senior executives from Sony TV.As an alternative to licensing third-party content in 2013 Netflix ventured into developing its own original content. It started out with a âhome runâ when it acquired House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey which went on to win three Emmys. Given its lack of a track record at the time Netflix needed to commit to buying the entire season of the show without the option of declining after a pilot episode as traditional media outlets usually required. It also did well with Orange Is the New Black a popular series based on a book as well as the 1980s-style adventure series Stranger Things. However and to illustrate the risks a more recent effort Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny was widely regarded as a flop and Netflix found itself increasingly cancelling original series that did not produce sufficient returns such as Sense8 and The Get Down.In addition there were significant sums at risk in these ventures. Netflix budgeted $6 billion in 2017 for contentâmore than twice its total revenue. This level of spending resulted in $3.4 billion in long-term debt. Critics said that its debt was such that it must continue to add more subscribers just to feed the business model or everything could come crashing down. Whereas Netflixâs streaming content obligations were approximately equal to its revenue in 2011 by 2017 a significant gap had emerged.In-House Competition; the Challenge of IncumbencyOne consistent challenge confronted by all successful organizations facing significant technological change was the allure of their existing incumbent line of business. This took several forms including financial investment in the existing capital infrastructure organizational investment in skills and routines and the risk associated with moving away from a consistent well-understood source of cash flow. Author Joshua Gans termed this challenge âsupply side disruptionâ about which drawing on the academic research of Rebecca Henderson he saidDemand side disruption involves an established firm missing a certain kind of technological opportunity but supply side disruption arises when an established firm becomes incapable of taking advantage of a technological opportunity. Specifically when a new competing innovation involves a distinct set of architectural knowledge established firms that have focus on being âbest in breedâ in terms of component innovation may find it difficult to integrate and build on the new architecture.At Netflix those responsible for the legacy business had successfully argued for its re-investment. The finely tuned industrial-engineered manual process of opening and stuffing the trademark red mailing envelopes was replaced by special-purpose robots that could process 3400 envelopes per hour versus the 680 per hour processed the prior labour-intensive way. This enabled Netflix to reduce the number of distribution centres from 50 to 33. These efficiencies resulted in cutting 75 per cent of its labour costs while retaining a high degree of customer serviceâ92 per cent of its customers received next-day delivery service. Competitors also continued to see promise in the DVD format as Redbox with its trademark automated kiosk vending machines grew from about 100 locations in 2004 to 34000 by 2012. One argument for continued investment in the legacy business was that as recently as August 2015 fewer than half of all U.S. homes had high-speed broadband service and it could be expected that the currently un-served lower-population-density areas might be without this service for the foreseeable future. This lack of connectivity contributed to the continued success of brick-and-mortar video rental stores in these areas. This primarily rural phenomenon in the United States could presage markets in international locations with limited broadband that might also continue to support the DVD format. And when it temporarily split off its DVD business in 2011 Netflix lost a number of its own senior managers.On the other hand Netflix did not face the sort of business cannibalization challenges often faced by traditional media businesses with the advent of a disruptive technology. Netflix for example did not face the loss of advertising revenue as a result of a shift to streaming delivery a potentially significant problem for some of its competitors. Further despite its increased internal efficiencies its traditional DVD-based business faced other costs such as its dependence on the U.S. Postal Service which had recently resulted in a $100-million increase in mailing rates.  Uncertain Future Public PoliciesââNet Neutralityâ and Its Variants In 2003 Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu coined the term ânet neutralityâ to describe a government regulatory principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source without favouring or blocking particular products or websites. It gained in visibility as Internet traffic became more and more concentrated over time with Wired magazine reporting in 2014 that half of all Internet traffic originated from just 30 organizations including Google LLC Facebook and Netflix. The policy required that ISPs not discriminate (e.g. âthrottling backâ throughput speeds) or charge differentially by user content website platform application type of attached equipment or mode of communication. This controversial policy tended to find favour with Internet firms especially those that generated a lot of traffic like Netflix. It tended to be opposed by ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon which argued that by limiting their decision rights the effect of the regulation would be to reduce investment in broadband network services and therefore to stifle innovation. In 2015 the Democratic Party administration in the United States enacted the rules into law effectively making broadband firms âcommon carriersâ like the telephone network. In 2017 the Republican Party administration scaled back the regulation. Netflix similar to other Internet firms originally lobbied for net neutrality as streaming video required significant amounts of bandwidth and limiting ISPsâ ability to differentially charge for this service effectively subsidized the Internet firmsâ activities. By 2017 at least publicly Hastings argued that it was no longer especially important. However the uncertainty about the regulation and its future added risk to any decision-making in the digital delivery market. In addition as the telecommunications sector of the economy grew and prospered it became an attractive area for lawmakers to target for new taxes. In 2017 Canadian legislators proposed but did not pass a 5 per cent tax on broadband charges dubbed by the press the âNetflix tax.â These monies would have been redistributed to traditional communications firms like newspapers that were adversely affected by the rise of the Internet. Traditional media firms lost revenue due to the Internetâparticularly classified advertising but also subscription revenueâas some of their customers shifted use to their Internet equivalents. If broadband revenue would be ultimately subject to additional taxes this could decrease demand for it and thereby hamper the growth of Netflix-like streaming services.HASTINGSâS DECISIONSHastings faced a significant number of business decisions and despite Netflixâs successes he was self-critical and was often quoted as admitting to having made a number of at least in hindsight poor decisions in relation to the technology and home entertainment industries. These included online advertisements on the website starting an independent film production company and buying DVDs out of the Sundance Film Festival (which turned out to offer limited profitability) in addition to the 2011 Qwikster gaffe. In addition he had initially believed that the future would be digital downloading rather than digital streaming and in 2009 Hastings said that there would still be DVDs in 2030 a prediction that looked increasingly unlikely. However despite some of these missteps Netflix was positioned to compete with some of the biggest firms in both entertainment and consumer technology. Hastings himself noted that historically firms facing disruption such as AOL Inc. and the Eastman Kodak Company failed because they were too cautious. But which non-cautious path should Netflix take? Should it continue to create its own content or revert back to being a neutral platform? Should it look to form exclusive contracts with content providers and/or hardware manufacturers to âlock inâ its customers? Did it need to acquire competitors and/or upstream or downstream partners? What was the appropriate role for the legacy DVD divisionâshould it continue to be operated as a cash cow for as long as it was economically viable or should it be sold off so as to reinvest the funds in current operations? Or was it finally time as suggested by analysts who argued the firm was over-valued to sell the company and cash out while it had a high market capitalization?  Exhibit 1: CHRISTENSENâS DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION CONCEPT Harvard Business Schoolâs Clayton Christensen has authored a number of books and articles defining and illustrating what he terms âdisruptive innovationsâ which are new products or services that re-make whole industries generally at the expense of the incumbent firm. This occurs because the incumbent firm does not recognize the threat posed by the innovation due to two main reasons. First the disruptive innovation possesses a different package of performance attributes not all of which are valued by existing customers; therefore the incumbentâs current customers do not initially find it attractive. Second the performance attributes of the innovation that existing customers do value which are often weak in the innovation improve at such a rapid rate that the new entrant can later move up and capture the incumbentâs existing customers.Disruptive innovators typically either enter at the low end of the market or create entirely new markets. Both of these scenarios are characterized as markets not well served by current solutions. Incumbents therefore have a tendency not to take serious notice of the innovation because either they are not losing current customers to it or when they are they are customers who buy low-margin products. Losing such customers has the paradoxical effect of increasing the incumbentâs average margin thus improving its bottom line. As such the financial signals that incumbents receive create Christensenâs âdilemmaâ whereby incumbent firms often do not recognize the threat. In addition incumbents often have difficulty adopting disruptive innovations themselves because as these innovations initially serve the existing customers poorly to adopt them could mean the loss of existing revenues through cannibalization. Conversely new entrants have no current customers to lose removing any hesitation to invest in the innovation.Source: Clayton Christensen The Innovatorâs Dilemma (New York NY: Harper Business 2001).Exhibit 2: Netflix Subscriber Growth (millions) Over TimeSource: âNetflix Subscribers from 2001 to 2011 (in 1000)â Statista accessed November 12 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/272551/subscribers-of-netflix-since-2001/; Jeff Dunn âHereâs How Huge Netflix Has Gotten in the Past Decadeâ Business Insider January 19 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/netflix-subscribers-chart-2017-1.Exhibit 3: Netflix and its Competitors 2017Exhibit 3 (continued)Note: n/a = not available1 âMovie/TV Show Countsâ JustWatch accessed July 1 2017 www.justwatch.com.2 Mark Fahey âNetflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Dealâ CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html.3 Seth Fiegerman âNetflix Nears 100 Million Subscribersâ CNN April 17 2017 accessed July 2017 http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/17/technology/netflix-subscribers/index.html.4 âNumber of Netflix Streaming Subscribers in the United States from 3rd Quarter 2011 to 2nd Quarter 2017 (in Millions)â Statista accessed July 2017 https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us.5 Mark Fahey âNetflix vs Amazon: Estimating the Better Dealâ CNBC April 22 2016 accessed July 2017 www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/netflix-vs-amazon-estimating-the-better-deal.html. 6 Stephanie Pandolph and Jonathan Camhi âAmazon Prime Subscribers Hit 80 Millionâ Business Insider April 27 2017 accessed July 2017 www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-subscribers-hit-80-million-2017-4.

Six years earlier in December 2011 de Silva had founded SFC with the vision to help non-profit organizations (NPO) and students. His goal originated from his early life experience having grown up in a neighbourhood affected by social issues such as gang violence and drug-related crime and from the frustration related to attaining work experience for even an entry-level position. SFC exclusively hired students to help them gain professional experience while also helping NPOs tap into the energy and ideas that Canada�s youth could offer. On September 1 2017 de Silva was excitedly preparing his team based in Kingston Ontario to work on projects for the sixth consecutive year. He was happy to reach this milestone but wondered whether his for-profit firm which was dedicated to providing consulting services to NPOs would be feasible over the long term given the current and potential market the skills and resources required the presence of competitors its past financial performance and the recent success and failure of new project acquisitions. De Silva had to ensure that the long-term business model would be feasible; moving forward with a venture that was not feasible over the long term could damage his professional reputation and waste a great deal of time and money.The Canadian Non-Profit IndustryNPOs were corporations that existed for purposes other than to generate profit. In terms of percentage of total work force Canada had the second-largest NPO sector in the world with over 170000 organizations approximately half of which were registered charities. All NPOs had various benefits in common such as tax exemption status; however only registered charities could issue donation receipts for income tax purposes. Charities generally fell into the following categories: advancement of religion (e.g. churches) relief of poverty (e.g. food banks) advancement of education (e.g. universities) and other purposes that benefited the community (e.g. libraries). Specific examples of NPOs included social recreational and hobby groups (e.g. the Canadian Automobile Association) amateur sports organizations (e.g. the Pan American Games) and festival organizations (e.g. the Toronto Caribbean Carnival).The total annual operating budget for the Canadian charitable sector was around CA$228 billion with a little more than half of that amount for wages and benefits. A charity�s operating costs were typically broken down into program costs (i.e. services provided to beneficiaries) administrative costs (e.g. salaries other than for fundraisers office supplies Internet access website hosting and others) and fundraising costs (i.e. costs directly attributed to raising funds such as marketing printing mailing and salaries for fundraisers). Given the extremely crowded sector fundraising costs had almost doubled over 10 years from 18 cents to 35 cents spent to raise one dollar. Third parties such as Money Sense magazine graded and ranked charities based on how much of the raised donations went toward programs rather than administrative and fundraising costs adding pressure on charities to fundraise more efficiently. Charities could also be scrutinized by the Canada Revenue Agency for inefficient fundraising and risked losing their charitable status. Although the non-profit sector employed 2 million people approximately half of Canadian charities were run entirely by volunteers. The total time contributed by Canadian volunteers was equivalent to half a million full-time jobs. The Canadian charitable sector drew an estimated $246 billion in annual revenues with about two-thirds coming from all levels of government. Almost all government funding (90 per cent) came from provincial bodies. When considering only so-called core NPOs (i.e. excluding hospitals universities and colleges) government funding accounted for one-fifth of total revenues whereas almost half of all revenue was generated from sales of goods and services. Other sources for core NPOs included membership fees (16 per cent) donations from households (12 per cent) and investment income (5 per cent). Some NPOs also generated revenues through social enterprises which were separate for-profit entities. The social sector was large but it was also very fragmented with 80 per cent of charities generating less than $500000 annually and only 0.5 per cent generating more than $1 million annually. The top 1 per cent commanded 60 per cent of total revenues. Donations came from three main sources: individuals (e.g. annual giving monthly giving and wills) corporations (e.g. employees giving to match corporate programs sponsorships check-out charities and cause marketing) and foundations (e.g. public and private charities whose purpose was to fund other charitable purposes). While donations could be monetary some were in-kind donations such as office supplies and canned food.A View of the Market for Non-Profit ConsultingIn Canada the management consulting services market was estimated to be worth $12 billion with almost 10 per cent of consulting services going to NPO clients. De Silva wanted to better understand the consulting market for NPO clients so his team conducted a survey of Ontario NPOs in which he asked what services they thought they would most benefit from (see Exhibit 1). After de Silva and his team compiled the survey results they discovered that more than one quarter of respondents found fundraising and fund development most beneficial with marketing and communications cited by approximately 25 per cent of respondents and partnerships selected by 15 per cent as most beneficial. The survey also asked NPOs about their satisfaction levels with consulting firms if applicable. About 80 per cent of respondents were very satisfied or satisfied with consulting services and only 20 per cent remained neutral.Although de Silva knew that global consulting firms such as McKinsey & Company had social sector practices he chose direct competitors that specialized in NPOs to define SFC�s target market. It was more strategic and defensible to build and grow a brand that was specialized rather than one that was generalized. SFC had more than 10 direct competitors in the Greater Toronto Area alone (see Exhibit 2). Most firms offered a broad range of services including marketing and communications strategic planning and fundraising; others specialized in areas such as corporate citizenship or human resources. NPO clients varied in type (e.g. social services education health arts and religion) and size (i.e. from local to national).De Silva examined three firms in particular: The Goldie Company (Goldie) was the longest-running consulting firm for NPOs. KCI Ketchum Canada Inc. (KCI) was the largest one. Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits (Endeavour) worked only on a pro bono basis. Although Goldie was the oldest firm with over 50 years of service KCI was also a seasoned firm with over 25 years of service. Endeavour which had only 10 years of service was highly localized to the Toronto area. In contrast Goldie had four offices across Canada and KCI had seven offices in various locations from Vancouver to Halifax. The senior leadership teams at KCI and Goldie were very similar consisting of staff with decades of NPO experience and professional accreditations such as the Certified Fund Raising Executive (CFRE). Endeavour was entirely volunteer-run and had a younger and less sector-experienced team. Goldie�s main point of differentiation was its decades of fundraising experience. For example the company had once helped a small hospital foundation raise $10 million within two years. KCI positioned itself as a �thought leader� in the sector and boasted the largest NPO data bank in the country with billions of dollars raised by its clients. Endeavour set itself apart from professional firms with its free volunteer-run services.SFC�s Business ModelBased on SFC�s business model the company charged its NPO clients a fee for developing innovative marketing strategies that helped them raise more funds and awareness. SFC developed these strategies by first collecting information about the client and its external environment through interviews surveys and secondary research. To do so SFC used a five-C�s research approach: company customer collaborator competitor and context (see Exhibit 3). SFC then analyzed the information using quantitative and qualitative business frameworks such as the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and used insights to identify and prioritize the main problems faced by the NPO. Strategies to address these problems were accompanied by implementation plans and measures of success. Brainstorming and using business best practices were some of the ways that SFC developed and vetted strategies. In addition to long-term projects that ran between five and eight months on average SFC also offered a workshop that lasted two to three hours over a few weeks. The affordable workshop was offered for a fee of $300 to $400 and was essentially a scaled down version of a long-term project that was priced at $2500 to more than $10000.SFC�s business model differed from competitors who had many years of NPO experience and credentials such as the CFRE. These firms typically provided expertise on traditional fundraising methods such as grant proposals and monthly giving programs. They often lacked experience however in youth-oriented trends social media and engagement which were key trends for the NPO market. Although some pro bono firms such as Endeavour provided a wide range of services they could not match the dedication and expertise in strategic marketing provided by professional firms such as SFC.SFC had the skills and knowledge to uniquely help NPOs raise more funds and awareness by drawing on the complementary skill sets of its team members who were undergraduate commerce and graduate Master of Business Administration students. The undergraduate students� strength was in youth-oriented trends and engagement and facility with social media. These strengths helped NPOs connect better with youth who used online channels to spread awareness. Awareness could lead to support relationships and donations. Undergraduates were also knowledgeable about fundraising and sponsorship through their student clubs which sought corporate support to fund their events. For example the Queen�s Marketing Association Conference was Canada�s largest such conference attracting over 150 students from across Canada and sponsorship from corporations such as Unilever Nestl� S. A. and International Business Machines Corporation. However undergraduates lacked years of professional consulting experience and were not as dedicated to their roles or to the company as more senior team members were given the students� temporary involvement.The lack of professional experience among undergraduate students was addressed by partnering them with the MBA students who usually had some professional experience for mentoring of their younger colleagues. The MBA students also drew on their business experience to help NPOs with discovery sessions (e.g. asking the right questions to understand the NPO�s current situation) market analysis (e.g. understanding donors and NPO competition) problem identification (e.g. understanding why a NPO was not achieving organizational goals) and measuring success (e.g. establishing short- and long-term key performance indicators to determine how well strategies were working).With this business model SFC�s team of more than 100 members had worked on over 60 projects with more than 60 clients from London to Ottawa including organizations as small as Youth Diversion in Kingston and as large as the Ottawa Senators Foundation. SFC built its client list mostly by acquiring new customers with John Paul dedicating more than half of his weekly hours to this activity. Due to the Canadian anti-spam Legislation e-mail marketing became more challenging and slowed business development substantially. Some help came from existing customers who referred SFC leading to 10 per cent of new projects. About the same number of projects were new projects from previous customers. The number of projects from referrals or repeat clients would have been higher had it not been for the high turnover rate among executive directors at NPOs including SFC's clients. Director turnover occurred at about one third of all SFC�s clients annually. Executive directors at NPOs were key decision makers in securing projects for SFC. With their turnover John Paul spent extra time tracking them to their new organizations or building relationships with the new directors. This extended the sales cycle significantly.SFC was chosen as one of Canada�s 10 Most Remarkable Small Businesses by The Globe and Mail among over 120 organizations that were nominated.SFC�s Financial PERFORMANCEBeginning in 2014 SFC saw increasing revenues leading to a profitable year in 2015. However the next year reverted to a negative cash flow. After launching a promotional workshop service in late 2013 de Silva expected higher revenues from long-term projects which materialized in 2015. That year long-term projects accounted for 84 per cent of total revenues versus 76 per cent in 2014. In 2016 however the workshop service represented 100 per cent of total annual revenues.SFC�s main expenses consisted of travel costs such as gas parking hotels and meals; payments to consultants and to the managing director; administrative costs such as office supplies meeting expenses computers cell phones and printing; and other miscellaneous expenses such as promotional costs and banking fees. SFC�s income statements from the previous three years showed travel expenses increasing substantially from 2014 to 2016 as a percentage of total expenses which was based on de Silva�s increased business development efforts and meetings with clients. Similarly administrative expenses increased. However payments to consultants decreased substantially in 2016 as de Silva took on more consulting responsibilities with the smaller projects (see Exhibit 4). SFC�s Success in Client AcquisitionIn June 2015 de Silva emailed Kingston area NPOs pitching SFC�s low-cost high-value marketing workshops on branding corporate sponsorship and social media. Each email had the same basic content but was personalized to each NPO. To help make future workshops more effective he included an online survey for the NPO executives with questions such as: What topics would you most like to see covered? What is the ideal length of time for a workshop? He also included a link to an article about SFC that depicted the organization as a source of value rather than just a costly service. Juanita Colbert the executive director of a rural Kingston essential skills organization called Pittsburgh Township Literacy & Skills (PTLS) made the effort to contact SFC to confirm that she had completed the survey and offered to forward it to other NPO executives which de Silva greatly appreciated.Two months after initial contact de Silva�s average time between contact points he learned that PTLS was seeking funding from existing donors to pay for consultants to develop a marketing strategy and plan. This was SFC�s specialty so he eagerly expressed interest in bidding for the project and scheduled a call. The next day de Silva spoke with Colbert for about 30 minutes to get a better understanding of her organization and its needs. As he did with all discovery types of calls de Silva prepared for his discussion by reviewing the NPO�s website and social media feeds. He also prepared one of his five-C�s framework documents (see Exhibit 3) which included a set of questions for a structured approach to the call. His curiosity often helped him pursue various different paths of questioning depending on the prospective client�s answers to de Silva�s questions.De Silva learned that PTLS was having difficulty getting clients and meeting government quotas. If this issue continued the NPO could lose its Ontario government funding and could be forced to shut down. He asked what they were doing to get new clients. Colbert explained that they mainly relied on referrals from other agencies including the Ontario government initiative Job Skills which offered free job search support. For example when a Job Skills client expressed an interest in a position but lacked basic skills required for that job the applicant was referred to PTLS or other similar agencies. PTLS also used promotional posters flyer inserts in local newspapers online advertising Facebook and its website for marketing purposes. Other topics covered in de Silva�s call included whether enough potential clients were available the reasons why a client would choose PTLS over a competitor the organization�s marketing budget and other relevant matters. De Silva also used the meeting to explain how SFC could best meet the needs of PTLS. He talked about SFC�s consulting process being based on research and analytics how it differed from other firms by having a team of undergraduate commerce and graduate MBA students and how SFC�s founding stemmed from de Silva�s growing up in a socially disadvantaged neighbourhood. He explained how his background helped him relate to the important work PTLS was doing.After the meeting he emailed Colbert thanking her for her time and mentioned that a project proposal would be sent to PTLS the next day. He reviewed his meeting notes and felt that the organization�s best approach would be interviewing current clients to understand what had brought them to PTLS how they like PTLS so far and whether they would recommend the NPO to others. He wanted to get a more well-rounded understanding by also interviewing employees volunteers and partners as well as conducting secondary research on the NPO�s surrounding area including infrastructure and demographics.De Silva included in the proposal an estimated project time frame and breakdown of 100 total people hours which included 45 hours for research 20 hours for analysis and 35 hours for strategy and implementation formulation. PTLS�s budget for the project was $500 including sales tax. Although this was far below market rates he saw this project as useful experience for SFC. The proposal was forwarded to a private funder for approval but after three weeks had passed without a decision de Silva contacted Colbert for an update and forwarded her a relevant article about essential skills trends in Ontario. A short time later SFC�s proposal was approved and de Silva called PTLS to discuss next steps. Colbert first explained to de Silva why SFC was chosen among all bidders on the project. She liked his personal story of growing up in a socially disadvantaged neighbourhood and felt that his personal connection to social causes would make him relate better to PTLS and its clients who came mainly from backgrounds similar to his. She also thought his company�s name conveyed a specialty of working with social causes. Colbert was impressed by de Silva�s questions and his efforts to listen and understand PTLS�s needs and current situation. She was glad he avoided suggesting a social media solution for PTLS before he fully understood the organization.Colbert also informed de Silva that the project�s budget had been increased five-fold to $2500 which de Silva would use for three $300 honorariums one each for three students who would each work about 10 to 15 hours on the project. The rest would be invested into SFC. Less than a year after the project was completed Colbert was excited to report that SFC�s strategy had already led to a 76-per-cent increase in program registrants which made de Siva proud of his team�s work.SFC�s Failure in Client AcquisitionDespite previous success gaining new clients and projects de Silva and SFC began struggling to secure clients and projects. On March 23 2016 for example de Silva received an email with a request for proposal (RFP) from Virginia St. Bernard a manager at Gananoque Public Health (GPH). GPH was seeking a social marketing consultant to help the organization better reach and engage young adults age 18 to 29 who lived in apartments condos and other multi-unit dwellings (MUDs). She found SFC�s service provider listing on the online job posting website CharityVillage which referred to itself as �Canada�s favourite site for non-profit professionals.� The goal of the project was to turn young adults into advocates for smoke-free housing after 38 per cent (roughly 1 million) of Ontarians living in MUDs were exposed to second-hand smoke from neighbouring units. In contrast 80 per cent of MUD residents had indicated a preference to live in smoke-free housing which was in very short supply. GPH attributed the short supply of smoke-free housing to landlords and property managers who either believed that it was illegal to institute a smoke-free policy or were concerned about the vacancies that a smoke-free policy would create. GPH felt that tenants were unaware that they could express a preference for smoke-free housing or that they did not want to wait until smoke-free housing became available.To achieve the project�s goal GPH was seeking a consultant who would use a �cascading influence model� to develop a social marketing strategy in collaboration with a working group that included GPH staff and a focus group of young adults called planners. The model�s six to 10 planners would apply a social marketing strategy to have 10 to 200 young adult advocates engage and raise awareness among Ontario�s young adults. GPH suggested that additional channels could be used as part of the strategy including online housing search platforms such as Kijiji and large housing providers such as Homestead.The project included four major deliverables: 1) a social marketing planning framework to lead the working group throughout the project; 2) facilitating the working group and project through in-person meetings conference calls shared online spaces and emails; 3) a social marketing strategy that included messaging channels and potential partnerships; and 4) a written report documenting the process findings and recommendations for next steps.GPH defined the ideal consultant�s background as follows: 1) proven knowledge of social marketing principles and practices ideally in public health; 2) extensive experience in multi-stakeholder group facilitation; 3) proven knowledge of young adults as a target market; and 4) ability to complete projects on time on budget and within specifications. To complete the RFP the prospective consultant needed to include four key items: 1) a resume that demonstrated meeting or exceeding the background requirements noted above; 2) a detailed plan and description of how the deliverables would be achieved; 3) the total cost and breakdown for the contract; and 4) two references preferably from the public health field.After reviewing the RFP de Silva submitted questions to St. Bernard on three different dates. On March 24 he asked how it was determined that the �cascading influence model� was the right approach and whether GPH was open to other approaches. She replied that the model had been used by GPH and other public health organizations for years. Although GPH was open to new ideas it felt that the model was best for this situation. On April 6 de Silva asked whether GPH would recruit the planners whether space would be provided for the in-person meetings and whether those meetings would only take place in Gananoque. St. Bernard replied the next day to confirm that GPH would recruit the planners and that 10 people were already interested. Meeting space would be provided in Gananoque but the meetings could also be located in Belleville if necessary. On April 9 de Silva asked how the RFP requirement for �a detailed plan and description of how the deliverables will be achieved� differed from the required deliverable of �a social marketing planning framework to lead the working group throughout the project.� On April 10 St. Bernard replied as follows: �The plan to achieve the deliverables is the plan on how to achieve the social marketing plan. We are looking for an explanation of how you plan to achieve all the pieces of the project. One of the pieces is the social marketing planning framework.�On April 13 the RFP�s deadline de Silva submitted SFC�s proposal highlighting key SFC accomplishments that directly addressed GPH�s needs (see Exhibit 5). He offered to discuss the proposal and address any questions. The project cost breakdown was $19000 for consulting fees $1000 for travel costs (including gas and hotel expenses) and $2600 for sales tax. Of the total fee 10 per cent was due on acceptance of the proposal and another 10 per cent was due upon completion of the social marketing planning framework. The remaining 80 per cent was due upon submission of the final deliverables which was targeted for mid-September. The project leaders would be de Silva and an MBA student from Queen�s University who had over eight years of provincial health care management experience. The plan for her salary and working hours was not finalized by the RFP submittal date.The contract was expected to be awarded on April 22 but de Silva had not received a response to his RFP by April 23 so he assumed that SFC was not selected for the contract and asked St. Bernard for feedback on the RFP for future reference. Four days later St. Bernard confirmed that another agency was a better fit with GPH�s objectives and had been awarded the contract. Although feedback was not normally provided St. Bernard sensed that SFC could use some feedback as a provider in its early stages. She stated that many of the other proposals were significantly longer with more detail about their relevant experience. They suggested plans for the new public health program using descriptive examples of similar previous work. Further most of the applicants did not contact St. Bernard prior to the deadline but still seemed to understand GPH�s needs. Other than SFC�s questions she only received a question about budgets. She said there was nothing wrong with asking questions but some of the questions de Silva sent made her believe he was unclear about what GPH needed. She also felt that his tone was �curt� or �aggressive� when he asked how one of the deliverables was different from one of the RFP requirements. St. Bernard also seemed to disapprove of de Silva questioning the �cascading influence model� approach given GPH�s many years of experience in public health communication and behaviour change theory.Next steps for SFCAfter six years of efforts to build and develop his venture de Silva was suddenly uncertain about SFC�s future. Was the long-term business model feasible? Given the current and potential market did SFC have the skills and resources required to compete? De Silva was under pressure to determine whether SFC had a future.Exhibit 1: Social Focus Consulting survey resultsWhich consulting services are most beneficial to Ontario�s non-profit organizations?Source: Created by the authors using data from the company�s survey.Exhibit 2: Competitor consulting firms in the Greater Toronto AreaSource: Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits SAMPLE Project Application and Instructions November 2015 accessed April 8 2018 https://endeavourvolunteer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Client-Application-Form-2015.pdf; �Our Services� Fundamentals accessed October 16 2017 https://www.fundamentals.solutions/our-services.html; �Clients� Fundamentals accessed October 16 2017 https://www.fundamentals.solutions/clients.html; �Services� Peacock accessed October 16 2017 http://peacockinc.ca/services/; �Clients & Testimonials� Peacock accessed October 16 2017 http://peacockinc.ca/clients-testimonials/; �Services� The Offord Group accessed October 16 2017 www.theoffordgroup.com/services/; �Clients� The Offord Group accessed October 16 2017 www.theoffordgroup.com/clients/; �Mendicant Group� Mendicant Group accessed October 16 2017 mendicant.ca; Mendicant Group �Our Work: Client List� Mendicant Group accessed October 16 2017 https://mendicant.ca/clients.html; �KCI Ketchum Canada� LinkedIn accessed October 10 2017 www.ca.linkedin.com/company/kci-ketchum-canada; �Clients� Ketchum Canada Inc. accessed October 17 2017 http://kciphilanthropy.com/lang/en/#panel-5-b; �Services� Harvey McKinnon Associates accessed October 17 2017 www.harveymckinnon.com/services/; �Our Clients� Harvey McKinnon Associates accessed October 17 2017 wwwharveymckinnon.com/about-us/our-clients/; �Our Services� The Goldie Company accessed October 18 2017 http://thegoldiecompany.com/our-services/; �Case Studies� The Goldie Company accessed October 10 2017 http://thegoldiecompany.com/case-studies/; �Welcome to an Agency with Benefits� Blakely Journey accessed October 30 2017 http://blakelyjourney.com/#talk-to-us; �Our Work� Manifest Communications accessed October 17 2017 http://manifestcom.com/change/our-work/; crawfordconnect Introducing crawfordconnect June 2017 accessed April 8 2018 crawfordconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cc-Brochure-June-2017.pptx.Exhibit 3: Social Focus Consulting Five-C�s framework (Selection)Company PerspectiveChallenges?GoalsMission Vision Values?Programs and Services?Level of impact?

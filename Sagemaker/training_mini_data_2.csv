CP had built the country’s first transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Its board of directors was the target of a proxy battle for control of the firm initiated by Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. (Pershing Square) in March 2012. Both CP and Pershing Square had made presentations to proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Proxy advisors provided voting recommendations to clients such as private funds and institutional investors. As part of their analysis the proxy advisors received information from management and from the dissident shareholder Pershing Square. Due to the lack of voting direction by management and CP’s high level of institutional ownership Smith believed that the recommendations of proxy advisors would be key in the proxy contest but she also needed to perform her own analysis of the intrinsic value of CP shares under the scenario of the status quo with CP’s current management and strategy in place versus a potential shakeup as suggested by Pershing Square.One statement in Pershing Square’s dissident presentation which had been sent out on January 24 2012 stood out for Smith: “Canadian Pacific is 70 per cent the size of Canadian National yet has an enterprise value 40 per cent as large due to its inferior profitability and asset utilization.”Class I North American RailroadsRailroad companies were ranked by revenues with Class I railroads being the biggest and Class III railroads the smallest. In the United States a Class I railroad had at least US$250 million in sales; in Canada a Class I railroad had at least CA$250 million in sales. The United States and Canada had six Class I railroads: Union Pacific CSX Norfolk Southern Canadian National Railway (CN) CP and Kansas City Southern (plus BNSF a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway). Rail was an integral part of the transportation network in North America for goods grains and commodities. For example more than two-thirds of U.S. coal was carried by rail. Rail was typically used as part of intermodal operations facilitated by the use of standardized containers that could be moved from trucks to rail to ships. The single most important measure of profitability in the railroad industry was the operating ratio defined as the firm’s operating expenses as a percentage of its total revenues. A lower operating ratio was desirable and firms targeted operating ratios below 80 with a figure in the mid-70s being more desirable. Components of these operating expenses included major categories such as labour materials fuel and depreciation. Of operating expenses labour could account for more than a third and fuel could account for a fifth.Operating ratios at these six major railroads had improved as non-core infrastructure was divested investments were made in more efficient equipment and new operating procedures were adopted. For example CN’s operating ratio declined to 63.6 per cent in 2010 from 97.1 per cent in 1992. Over the same period CP’s operating ratio dropped to 77.6 per cent from 95.9 per cent (see Exhibit 1). Canadian Pacific RailwayThe Canadian Pacific Railway was incorporated on February 16 1881 with the intent of building a transcontinental railway in Canada. As a condition of joining Canada’s confederation in 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were promised rail links with Quebec and Ontario. But government mismanagement resulted in little progress on the project until a group of businessmen founded CP. A century later in 1986 CP was the nation’s second-largest firm with $15 billion in revenues and had become a conglomerate with subsidiaries in energy commodities hotels and ships. With the goal of unlocking shareholder value Canadian Pacific’s parent company spun out its five subsidiaries—CP Pan Canadian Energy Fording Coal CP (later Fairmont) Hotels and CP Ships—into separate companies on October 3 2001. CP had a 14700-mile (23657-kilometre) network of railroads and intermodal transportation links from the Port of Vancouver in Canada’s West to the Port of Montreal in Canada’s East and to the U.S. industrial centres of Chicago Newark Philadelphia Washington New York City and Buffalo. This network transported bulk commodities merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. In 2011 CP’s strategic goal was to “become the safest most fluid railway in North America” focusing on five areas: service safety productivity and efficiency people and growth.CP’s board included members of the country’s business elite. For example John Cleghorn was the former chairman and chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada the country’s largest financial services company. Frederic J. Green had been the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) since 2006 (see Exhibit 2).CP faced a challenging first six months in 2011 as a result of disruptions to its operations due to severe winter weather and flooding. These delays limited the speed at which its trains could travel and productivity had suffered. The firm worked in the second half of 2011 to restore service and its reputation for customer focus. Management stated:Despite these challenges we were able to complete our planned capital program in 2011. Our continued work on building new sidings and extending our current ones to support our long-train strategy paid dividends; CP set a new full-year record in train weights in 2011. In addition we set full year records in both terminal dwell and car miles per car day as a result of implementing our First Mile-Last Mile program in Canada. We expect further improvements as we continue to tighten standards in Canada and roll out the program in the U.S. We completed the second phase of our Locomotive Reliability Centre strategy which will reduce the number of major locomotive repair facilities from eight to four highly efficient super shops with improved repair capabilities. These improved efficiencies will allow us to do more with less and to reduce our asset pools and associated costs.CP has signed several commercial agreements with customers terminal operators and ports that will drive improvements in supply chain performance. In early 2012 we announced a new five-year agreement with Canadian Tire and a ten-year agreement with Canpotex. In addition CP has worked with its customers leveraging technology to enhance car request management and implementing new productivity tools. Our scheduled grain program has been successfully implemented in Canada and the U.S. program will be implemented by August 2012. We are also developing new volumes of Powder River Basin coal for export off the west coast of British Columbia.In 2011 CP’s accomplishments includedManaging overall indebtedness by repaying US$246 million of maturing 2011 debt and by calling US$101 million of 2013 debt; Making a $600 million voluntary prepayment to its main Canadian defined benefit pension plan; andDelivering consistent dividend growth by increasing its quarterly dividend to common shareholders by 11 per cent from $0.27 to $0.30 in 2011.CP announced a goal of bringing its operating ratio down to the range of 70–72 per cent for 2014 and continued improvement beyond 2014. It aimed to reduce the operating ratio to the range of 68.5–70.5 per cent by 2016. According to CP’s position much of the difference in operating ratios compared with other railroads was due to external factors such as legacy pension costs; tighter curves and steeper grades that required slower speeds and more locomotives respectively; and greater competition along its routes.Between April and September 2011 the trading price of CP’s common shares declined from approximately $63 per share to a low in late September of just below $49 per share. CP’s stock price performance for the 10-year period 2002 to 2012 was roughly similar to a Toronto Stock Exchange index but fared much lower than CN’s performance (see Exhibit 3). Pershing Square Capital ManagementWith a corporate partner Leucadia National William Ackman founded Pershing Square Capital Management (Pershing Square) a hedge fund in 2004 with US$54 million of his own capital. Pershing Square was known for taking large positions in targeted firms and being actively engaged in their management. Recent activist campaigns included Target Corp. Canadian Tire Wendy’s (forcing the company to spin-off Tim Hortons) and most recently J.C. Penney. Ackman’s track record included successes and failures. After a months-long debate between Target Corp.’s management and Ackman shareholders voted down Ackman’s effort to gain board representation at their annual meeting in Waukesha Wisconsin. In a preliminary tally of voting more than 70 per cent voted in favour of the company’s proposed slate of directors and the same margin voted to keep the size of the board the same. Target Corp. had urged its shareholders to vote in favour of a proposal to set the size of the board at 12 and to vote for the company’s nominees.In a regulatory filing released October 28 2011 Pershing Square indicated it owned an aggregate 20.7 million common shares (which included 2.65 million common shares underlying a call option) representing 12.2 per cent of CP’s outstanding common shares. The firm had begun buying CP shares in September 2011 investing $1.1 billion in total for an average price of $54.46 per common share. Pershing Square’s intent according to the filing was to discuss with CP’s management its board and other shareholders ways in which the business could be improved.Ackman’s chief recommendation was to install Hunter Harrison as CP’s new CEO. With an established track record as CN’s chief operating officer and then its CEO Harrison had a reputation for improving CN’s productivity and profits. He had reduced staff levels and introduced the concept of precision railroading which involved putting operations on a strict schedule. His drive for efficiencies had even led to the implementation of penalties for customers who did not load or unload their freight on time. The Role of BoardsA board of directors was generally accepted as being necessary to manage the agency relationship created by the separation of ownership and management and was a legal requirement for incorporation. A board was ultimately responsible to the shareholders for all aspects of the corporation but would delegate most of the operating responsibility to professional management. Thus in any firm a board had specific responsibility for hiring performance evaluation compensation and succession of the CEO. A board might also choose to require management to obtain the board’s specific approval before proceeding with certain types of initiatives such as strategic changes major financial commitments and significant acquisitions. In those areas management was responsible for initiating proposals and implementing board-approved decisions; the board of directors was responsible for choice among and/or ratification of management recommendations and monitoring their implementation by management. From a corporate governance perspective boards were being encouraged to re-evaluate the meaning of the phrase in the Canadian Business Corporations Act (see Item 122 (1) (a) page 88) “act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation.” One perspective was that it meant in the best interests of the shareholders commonly known as the shareholder primacy norm. A second perspective was that it meant in the best interest of all stakeholders which was known as the plurality perspective. This view included shareholders debtors communities provincial and federal governments the environment customers suppliers employees managers members of boards and other stakeholders. A third perspective was that the corporation was viewed as a legal entity in and of itself and that the phrase literally meant in the best interests of the corporation as a legal entity. According to this perspective boards could make decisions that would sustain the corporation and be to the detriment of all other stakeholders including shareholders and debtors.The TimelineIn late September 2011 funds controlled by Pershing Square began acquiring common shares of CP at prices of approximately $50 a share approximating the two-year low in CP’s trading price. By October 18 2011 Pershing Square had acquired more than 5 per cent of the outstanding CP shares prompting an obligation to file a Schedule 13D report with the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States where its stock was listed for trading. By the time that report was filed on October 28 2011 Pershing Square’s interest exceeded 10 per cent resulting in an obligation to file an early warning report with securities regulators in Canada where its stocks were also listed for trading which ultimately was filed five days later. Pershing Square disclosed in those reports its belief that CP’s shares were undervalued and that it was engaging in discussions with management the board and other shareholders regarding CP. Subsequent negotiations between CP’s board and Pershing Square broke down and by early January 2012 the two sides were entrenched in their positions and the public was aware that a proxy battle was imminent. CP’s board decided to address its investors and the public by publishing an Open Letter to Pershing Square on January 3 2012. In it CP’s board aimed to correct what it felt were inaccurate comments by Pershing Square and reiterated CP’s invitation for Ackman to join its board subject to a few restrictions. Ackman’s response provided in an Open Letter to CP on January 9 2012 indicated that Pershing Square felt its media statements were accurate. He went on to assert that Pershing Square intended to transform CP’s culture and operations with the goal of turning it into one of the best railroads in North America. Ackman also defended his decision to put forth Harrison as CP’s new leader. Pershing Square’s nominees for the board included three independent Canadian business leaders (see Exhibit 4).Pershing Square sent a requisition for a shareholder meeting to CP on January 23 2012 but when CP later that same day announced that its annual meeting would be held on May 17 2012 Pershing Square withdrew its requisition. Pershing Square filed a dissident information circular on January 24 2012 and began holding public investor meetings to build support. CP filed its proxy circular on March 22 2012 and began holding its own public investor meetings. Various proxy battles followed intended to gather enough shareholder votes to win corporate votes (see Appendix 1).Smith Gathers Information for her ReviewSmith supplemented her analysis with an overview of current economic conditions. She noted that the Government of Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond had a yield of 1.79 per cent at the end of April 2012. In Canada real gross domestic product was expected to achieve annual growth of 2 per cent in 2012 and then increase to an average annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent between 2013 and 2016. Canadian exporters were forecast to be negatively affected by a slowdown in the Euro zone and China and the Canadian dollar was expected to be at or around parity to the U.S. dollar until 2016. In the United States the economy was in the midst of a broad-based recovery with the unemployment rate trending downward. The United States was expected to grow at a slightly faster pace—2.3 per cent per year from 2013 to 2016 (see Exhibit 5) as real private consumption rose and as exports grew especially to emerging markets.What Smith read about Ackman’s public statements seemed to provide reassurance that he did not want to take over the entire board:Pershing Square—What a vote for the Nominees for Management Change (NMC) does NOT mean: Not a change of control; NMC will be five of 13 or 15 directors. Pershing Square would have two of 13 or 15 Board seats (proportionate to ownership). The entire refreshed Board will make the CEO hiring decision.In contrast she sensed frustration on Green’s part when he stated that bringing Harrison’s management methods was counter to the culture he was trying to build at the firm. Green stated:You can work your way across the breadth of stakeholders whether it’s communities governments customers or shareholders people see the risk attached to this proposal. The venom that exists in the shipper community towards the dismissive attitude that Mr. Harrison brought to the marketplace is what it is.CP’s income statements balance sheets and cash flow statements provided Smith with a great amount of financial information (see Exhibits 5 6 and 7 respectively). Smith also read that some believed it would be difficult for Harrison to transfer his methods from CN to CP. First CP’s railroads traversed tougher terrain in contrast to the easier routes taken by CN. Second CP had higher labour costs and was in discussions with its union to improve productivity including implementing a 12-hour workday and new rules on vacations. The Teamsters union represented 4800 CP conductors engineers and rail traffic controllers. To show his interest in the top job Harrison had purchased $5 million worth of CP shares earlier in 2011.Ackman believed that despite the differences between CN and CP the latter could be more profitable arguing that under Harrison’s leadership it could achieve an operating ratio of 65 per cent by 2015. Green countered insisting that an adversarial attitude would be unproductive as 80 per cent of its business was subject to direct competition. The Oliver Wyman Group an independent consultant hired by CP to gauge the feasibility of both plans concluded that Harrison’s target was “not possible” whereas CP’s was both “reasonable and achievable” and also took into consideration the steeper grades and greater curvature of CP’s network which the consultant estimated that it would add about 6.7 per cent to its operating ratio. “Curves and grades [are] physics and the dismissive comments by Harrison indicate a clear lack of research or understanding or both” Green said.Smith Estimates CP’s ValueSmith at GBR Capital wanted to value CP’s shares based on the status quo and current management versus Hunter Harrison as CEO implementing a cost-cutting program (for simplicity as of December 31 2011). In doing this valuation Smith needed to develop two sets of projected cash flows and review information on comparable railroads. She created a set of estimates that included the status quo and a more optimistic forecast that assumed Harrison would become CEO and implement a new strategy. The status quo forecast—from 2012 to 2016—would have revenues at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rising 4 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 80 per cent and decrease to 76 per cent by 2016. Depreciation would start at $600 million and capital expenditures at $1.1 billion. Both figures would rise by $25 million each year. The more optimistic forecast included revenue projections that also started at $5.6 billion in 2012 and rose by 5 per cent per year. The operating ratio would start at 76 per cent and decrease to 68 per cent by 2016. Her estimate of depreciation expenses would not change. She estimated capital expenditures in 2012 at $1 billion rising by $25 million a year reflecting the conjecture that Harrison would be focused on cutting costs and investing capital more efficiently. Smith gathered comparative information on competitive firms (see Exhibit 9). She contemplated how best to use this information to estimate intrinsic values under the two scenarios.Smith planned to estimate intrinsic values using a discounted cash flow approach as well as relative valuations. She assumed a tax rate of 25 per cent. She planned to use the capital asset pricing model to estimate the cost of equity using a risk-free rate of 1.79 per cent a beta of 1.3 and an expected market risk premium of 5.0 per cent. CP’s before-tax cost of debt was 6 per cent. Smith ignored any changes in working capital which she assumed would not be material. Under both scenarios Smith assumed a growth of free cash flows beyond the next five years at 2 per cent. She also pondered what kind of return equity investors might garner over a five-year horizon under the two scenarios assuming Pershing Square’s average acquisition price.In the short term Smith faced the proxy vote decision. She needed to send in GBR Capital’s votes on behalf of her fund. While her main aim was to make a decision that would maximize value for GBR Capital’s investors Smith also questioned the extent to which her decision should factor in CP’s corporate governance issues.Exhibit 1: CaNadian pacific AND Canadian national railway financial performance and OPERATING RATIOS 2007–2011 (in CA$ millions)Source: Canadian Pacific 2007 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2007/AR2007.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2008 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2008/AR2008.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2009 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2009/AR2009.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2010 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2010/AR2010.pdf; Canadian Pacific 2011 Annual Report accessed July 23 2017 http://s21.q4cdn.com/736796105/files/doc_financials/Annual-Report/2011/AR2011.pdf; Canadian National Railway Company 2007 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2007-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2008 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2008-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2009 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2009-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2010 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2010-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den; Canadian National Railway Company 2011 Annual Report  accessed July 23 2017 https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cn.ca%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FInvestors%2FInvestor-Annual-Report-Archive%2FEnglish%2F2011-CN-Annual-Report.pdf%3Fla%3Den.Exhibit 2: Frederic J.

"shareholder meeting or prepare to vote at a company-called shareholder meeting. The proxy battle is the efforts by management and the dissident to gather enough shareholder votes and proxies to win the corporate vote. Usually the proxy battle is a vote to replace members of the board of directors (BOD). The dissidents will attempt to persuade existing shareholders to vote out the company’s board or a portion of the board and possibly change management so that the company can embark on the dissident suggested strategy. This “attack” may result in resistance from the company’s BOD sometimes known as entrenchment. The dissatisfied shareholders try to persuade other shareholders to allow their proxy votes to be used to support proposed changes to the company’s board members. The shareholders trying to change the board members may opt for 100 per cent change or a portion thereof. More recently dissident shareholders have had success changing 50 per cent of the board members to achieve their corporate directional change and have had an easier time convincing proxy advisors to support less than 100 per cent board change allowing for some continuity with the existing board and new board members. Even with a few new board members after a proxy battle returning board members are typically more receptive to shareholders’ proposed changes making it easier to implement them. The company may move in a new direction as decided by the BOD and recommended by the dissidents that started the proxy battle.Management and dissidents use solicitation methods to influence shareholder votes for agenda items proposed at the meeting most importantly BOD members. All shareholders have voting rights based on their share position holding. Registered shareholders are shareholders that hold their shares directly with the company’s transfer agent. The company has access to their name address and share position. Non-registered shareholders hold shares though a broker or custodian and the company does not have direct access to them or their share position. These shareholders would include retail shareholders that purchase shares through their broker and institutional shareholders including pension funds and mutual funds that are managing stock on behalf of groups of individuals but the institutional investor fund manager has the voting authority. In many cases institutional investors defer voting authority for routine meeting agenda items to one of the two proxy advisors in North America Glass Lewis or Institutional Shareholder Services. For a proxy battle the institutional investor will often direct its voting decision but consider the advice of the proxy advisor. Based on share price and buying power institutional shareholders carry much more sway in the voting outcome than retail shareholders.To help facilitate voting management and/or the dissident may hire its own proxy solicitation firm that contacts shareholders soliciting their vote. The proxy solicitor compiles a list of shareholders and their approximate share positions and attempts to contact the shareholders to state the case that they represent. The proxy solicitor (or solicitors) will also arrange a conference call or in-person meeting with the proxy advisors to allow their client management or the dissident to present a report on their position.Ultimately all shareholders submit their votes to the public company’s transfer agent for tabulation. The tabulation results are shared with the company throughout the process and final results are sent to the corporate secretary at the proxy cut-off date as outlined in the proxy circular. Dissidents and their proxy solicitors may scrutinize and challenge the votes after a meeting to confirm that they accept the outcome or to note that they think the outcome was unclear (i.e. if they think shareholders voted multiple times or if the votes seem irregular). Directors are approved based on the votes received.Because most retail shareholders are passive investors gaining retail shareholders’ attention is difficult. Shareholders typically agree to the recommendations mailed to them without examining the proxy circular but they also have little impact on the outcome due to their small shareholding. Appendix 1 (continued)Institutional shareholders consider board and management changes very carefully and will also rely on proxy advisors’ opinions. They are active investors/voters and they can swing outcomes because of their large share positions. Institutional advisors will also consider management recommendations in making their final decisions which depend on resolving two questions: “Who does management want on the board and why? Is there some reasonable solution or outcome with the vote that the institutional investors can support?”Management can rely on a universal proxy to present both its recommendation and the activist’s recommendation on the same form. The universal proxy lists all nominees both management and dissident for the board of directors on one proxy form. Shareholders have the option to choose from the list those whom they want on the board up to the maximum of positions available (i.e. 22 nominees for 17 positions). Management’s recommendation is for its proposed BOD but shareholders have the option to pick and choose which individuals they wanted to comprise the BOD. Without a universal ballot the shareholder can be presented with a stark choice of the following two options: vote on the dissident’s proxy form voting “for” or “withhold” against the dissident nominees; or vote on management's proxy voting “for” or “withhold” against the management nominees.In Canada there is no restriction on a dissident including management’s nominees in its proxy. For example without a universal proxy a dissent such as Pershing Square could suggest the Canadian Pacific BOD individuals it wanted to keep on the new BOD. In the particular situation at hand acting pre-emptively Canadian Pacific adopted a universal proxy that included Pershing Square’s nominees. This move placed the responsibility of deciding on the new board on shareholders. Source: Created by the case authors.""",1,WHITE,SOUTH AMERICA,WOMAN,,

Commonly available bundles include a sofa set and a coffee table; a wedding planning service that includes photography catering and logistics; a washing machine and refrigerator sold as a package by an electronic goods reseller; and a tax consultancy service and an investment advisory service offered together by a consultant. Bundles differ in the way the constituent products or the bundle components are sold together or bundled. Historically firms that have monopoly power over one component have used bundling to extend their monopoly to other competitive markets. Such a bundling strategy is called pure bundling and is largely considered anti-competitive today. Pure BundlingPure bundling is the practice of selling two or more different products only as part of the same package and not separately. In the past many firms have used pure bundling to great effect. For example Microsoft’s strategy of bundling its proprietary Windows operating system with its Internet browser Internet Explorer had a dramatic effect on competition in the Internet browser market. Microsoft never intended to sell Internet Explorer separately but only as part of the Windows operating system and Internet Explorer bundle. However given that pure bundling is considered anti-competitive and hence illegal instances of pure bundles are currently rare. Nevertheless pure bundling by virtue of being the most basic and primitive form of bundling provides a sound foundation for understanding and elucidating the working principles of two advanced forms of bundling: price bundling and product bundling. These advanced bundling strategies are defined and discussed below. Typically bundles are sold at a price discount which serves as an incentive for consumers to buy the bundle versus buying the components separately. In essence the price discount acts as a glue that makes the bundle components stick together as part of the same package. Such a bundling strategy is known as price bundling. Price bundling does not necessitate a firm having monopoly power on any one of the components and is therefore applicable to modern-day competitive markets. Price BundlingPrice bundling is the sale of two or more separate products at a price discount without any integration of the components. In reality most bundles conform to the price bundling strategy wherein consumers reserve the option to buy either the entire bundle or any one of the individual components separately. A classic example of a price bundle is the McDonald’s meal combo consisting of a burger fries and a drink. This combination comes at a price discount over the sum of the individual prices for the burger fries and the drink when bought separately. Other examples may include a bundle comprising a clothes dryer and a washing machine that are sold at a discount by a consumer goods reseller. Price bundling is also known as mixed bundling. In the definition for price bundling lack of integration implies the bundle components lack complementarity or interdependency. In other words any type of product can be bundled and sold as part of the same package as long as a price discount is offered on the bundle purchase over and above the sum of the individual prices of each of the components. Such a strategy will work whether or not the components are integrated so long as the price discount is offered. However a firm can incentivize consumers to buy a bundle (instead of buying the components separately) by integrating the components in a meaningful manner. That is the components are glued together by the integration created by the seller among the components. Such a bundling strategy is called product bundling. Product BundlingProduct bundling is the integration and sale of two or more separate products in the same package at any price. Product bundles may include a sofa set and a matching coffee table wherein the matching feature integrates the two furniture items by virtue of the aesthetic appeal the components jointly present to consumers. Such a strategy may allow a firm to command a higher price for the entire bundle compared with for instance a bundle comprising the same sofa set and a standard coffee table that does not match the design of the sofa set but is of comparable quality. The bundle consisting of the sofa set and the standard coffee table in this case cannot be sold at a premium over the sum of the individual components prices but only at a price discount as an incentive to consumers. In summary while a sofa set and a matching coffee table that is sold at a price premium constitutes a product bundle the same sofa set and a standard coffee table sold at a price discount constitutes a price bundle. Of course the firm may choose to sell the sofa set and the matching coffee table at a lower price; however in that case the firm will leave money on the table by choosing not to appropriate (for whatever reasons) the higher value created by virtue of the matching design that enhances the aesthetic appeal of the bundle. Another example of a product bundle is an all-inclusive wedding planning service. The greater convenience associated with only one firm handling a large emotionally charged and—ideally—once-in-a-lifetime event such as a wedding can increase consumers’ propensity to avail the services of the firm. In this case too the firm stands to earn greater profit from the added value created by the convenience to the consumer and the reduction in the consumer’s psychological cost (i.e. stress) associated with managing such an event. Product bundles differ fundamentally from price bundles not only in terms of the type of incentive used to bundle the individual components (i.e. price incentives for price bundles versus non-price incentives for product bundles) but also in terms of the customer segment each bundling strategy appeals to and its working mechanism. In this context it is worth mentioning that in all definitions of the three forms of bundling thus presented the word separate (and separately) implies the existence of independent competitive markets for each of the bundle components—e.g. a competitive market for operating systems and a competitive market for Internet browsers. In other words while pure bundling necessitates a firm having monopoly power over at least one of the components in the bundle price bundling and product bundling impose no such restrictions. In this note these issues are addressed and elucidated as are the working mechanism of each of the three bundling strategies through a combination of graphical illustrations and spreadsheet simulations wherever necessary. The following section presents the working principles of the three bundling strategies starting with pure bundling followed by the price bundling and the product bundling strategies. The concluding section of this note discusses the strategic marketing implications of bundling. BUNDLING WORKING PRINCIPLESThe Pure Bundling Working PrincipleThe working principle of pure bundling relies on the mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus (the difference between a consumer’s reservation price or maximum willingness to pay for a product and the price charged by the firm for the product) from the bundle’s higher-valued component to the lesser-valued component(s). Pure bundling as opposed to selling products separately (i.e. unbundling) earns the highest profit when consumers’ reservation prices for the component products are perfectly negatively correlated as illustrated graphically in Exhibit 1A. Exhibit 1A is a scatter plot of reservation prices for two separate products a package of jelly beans and a bar of chocolate for three customers named Rahul Neil and Amber represented by the three dots in the plot. From Exhibit 1A we can see that while Rahul loves chocolate very much he does not like jelly beans as much. The opposite holds true for Amber while Neil values both products equally. Further in this case it is assumed that the consumption of any one of the two products does not affect the enjoyment of the other in any way i.e. the reservation prices of each of the products are independent of each other. In the current context it is assumed that the consumption of jelly beans neither compromises nor enhances the consumption of the chocolate for any one of the consumers and vice versa. In Exhibit 1A the reservations prices for the three consumers are perfectly negatively correlated i.e. the three dots representing the three consumers fall exactly on the same straight line AB. In this example by setting a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can appropriate all the consumer surplus from the consumers in the market i.e. the firm can price discriminate perfectly (see Exhibit 1A). The firm maximizes profit without any “wastage” of consumer surplus. In fact by bundling a firm can earn higher profits as compared with selling the jelly beans and the chocolate separately (i.e. unbundling). A numerical proof of these results is presented as spreadsheet simulation exercises in the Excel workbook titled Bundling Exercise A provided along with this note. Further in Exhibit 1B for any combination of individual prices that sum up to the total bundle price of $10 or for any partition of the total bundle price any given consumer say Amber can offset a deficit in consumer surplus on one of the two confectioneries by the consumer surplus enjoyed by her on the other. In other words Amber compensates for her relative dislike of jelly beans by transferring her surplus desirability for chocolate in justifying her decision to consume both confectioneries. Exhibit 1B illustrates this mechanism. The famous scrumptious buffets served at Las Vegas casinos offer a real-life example. These buffets can simultaneously cater to dessert lovers (assuming these consumers despise salads) and health-conscious salad eaters (who consider desserts to contain no nutritional value) as well as those who love to eat both salads and desserts. When consumers’ reservation prices are positively correlated however bundling does not provide any additional advantage over selling the components separately. Please see Exhibit 2 for a graphical illustration and refer to the Excel workbook titled Bundling Exercise A for a numerical proof and illustration. The Price Bundling Working PrincipleFor a price bundling or a mixed bundling strategy the price discount is the only factor motivating bundle purchase as opposed to for instance the added value that consumers may find in the joint consumption or usage of the bundle components (e.g. the all-inclusive wedding service discussed earlier). However the price discount may not be a sufficient inducement for consumers who may find greater value in purchasing only one of the components versus the entire bundle. Intuitively these consumers have a very high valuation for only one of the components in the bundle and a very low valuation for the other. In this case the firm stands to gain by selling the higher valued products separately to these specific consumers. In other words the higher the heterogeneity in reservation prices among the consumers the higher the probability that a mixed bundling strategy as opposed to a pure bundling strategy will earn greater profit. Further mixed bundling may earn more profit compared with pure bundling when consumers’ reservation prices are not perfectly negatively correlated and/or the marginal costs of production of the components are non-zero. These assertions are explained and illustrated graphically in Exhibits 3 and 4. For numerical proofs and illustrations refer to the workbook titled Bundling Exercise A which also includes a provision for comparing the efficacy of the price bundling and the pure bundling strategies on the same set of consumers. Further the second workbook titled Bundling Exercise B provides the opportunity to conduct Monte Carlo simulations based on random draws from a normally distributed population of reservation prices from 10 consumers to determine the optimal bundle and component prices for a mixed bundling strategy. The simulations can be run for different sets of population parameters (e.g. the mean and standard deviation of reservation prices). In Appendix 1 the average profitability from mixed bundling from two such simulation runs are compared for two different dispersion (i.e. standard deviation) parameter values of reservation prices. The Product Bundling Working PrincipleFor product bundles consumers find greater value in the joint consumption of the bundle components versus consuming the components separately; in this situation the assumption of demand independence or independence of reservation prices does not hold. By combining products imaginatively firms can create bundles that are valued more than the sum of their components. The higher reservation price or desirability for the bundle provides firms with the opportunity to earn greater profits than when such joint effects are non-existent (e.g. the sofa set and the standard coffee table). The working mechanism of product bundling is illustrated in Exhibit 5.In Exhibit 5 Panel A two consumers—Rihaan and Roshni represented by stars—remain below a generic bundle price line AB and hence do not buy the particular bundle as the sum of their reservation prices for the bundle components is lower than the total bundle price. However consumers Rahul and Amber represented by dots remain on line AB and hence can buy the bundle; the sum of their reservation prices for the components equal the bundle price. However if all four consumers find greater value in jointly consuming the two bundle components (e.g. the consumers enjoy having milk and cookies together more than having each of the products separately) all four consumers will migrate toward the east or the north or anywhere in between as indicated in Panel B in Exhibit 5 depending on their relative desirability for the components (milk and cookies). The outcome is that at least some of the consumers who were not buying the bundle thus far can buy the product bundle now as illustrated in Panels B and C in Exhibit 5. Given this outcome the firm can subsequently raise the price of the entire bundle to capture the value which is created by shifting the bundle price line AB to the right to AB* as shown in Panel C. A significant implication is that having a consumer surplus on at least one of the bundle components is no longer a necessary condition for bundling to become a viable strategy. Panels B and C also suggest that product bundling can serve as a potent strategy to expand into a new consumer segment (Rihaan and Roshni) that thus far remained untapped. DISCUSSIONIn this note the economic logic of bundling is enunciated using a basic two-product bundle under two fundamentally different assumptions in terms of the interaction between consumers’ reservation prices. Pure bundling and price (mixed) bundling assume an independence of reservation prices or demand. Under this condition bundling can succeed through the mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus as discussed earlier in the note. The mechanism of the transfer of consumer surplus opens up an interesting possibility when consumers are presented with only a single consolidated price for the entire bundle—i.e. the seller does not disclose the prices of individual components. In this situation the consumer can mentally partition the consolidated bundle price in a manner that makes it easier to justify the act of purchasing the bundle. For instance the consumer can purchase a bundle consisting of a hedonic product and a utilitarian one by psychologically assigning a lesser price for the hedonic product to assuage any feeling of guilt associated with the purchase (thereby justifying the purchase). The act is reminiscent of self-price discrimination wherein a consumer pays different prices (albeit mentally construed) for the components although the total price remains constant under all circumstances. When consumers self-segment in this manner without persuasion from the firm in the form of advertisements or sales interactions the cost of selling may reduce for the firm. Further bundling may lower costs for a firm by reducing consumer heterogeneity. Considering the entire bundle as the unit of demand and analysis the same product (i.e. the bundle) can be sold to all consumers in the market regardless of the difference in their reservation prices for the individual bundle components so long the reservation prices are perfectly negatively correlated. In this regard bundling can be considered as the antithesis of segmentation a concept that provides the basic logic behind creating consumer segments such that consumers belonging to a particular segment are homogeneous but sufficiently heterogeneous across segments. This situation is paradoxical as on one hand bundling reduces consumer heterogeneity (i.e. the bundle can be sold to all consumers in the market) while on the other hand bundling thrives best under consumer heterogeneity (i.e. the greater the heterogeneity in the component reservation prices the higher the probability that bundling will earn greater profit compared with unbundling). Although pure bundles are rare in practice nothing prevents firms from creating product bundles by imaginatively combining products that provide greater value to the consumer through joint usage purchase or consumption. Creating such bundles is however not as trivial as setting prices for a price bundle; it requires managerial skill and a deeper understanding of consumer psychology and behaviour. Product bundling is thus better suited for competition. Price bundling or mixed bundling on the contrary being much easier to implement than product bundling remains a highly imitable strategy.Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon) issues specific guidelines for sellers who use product bundling to sell merchandise on Amazon. In its product bundling policy Amazon mandates that the bundles that sellers intend to sell must consist of products that are highly complementary—i.e. the consumer must find greater value in the joint usage of the components in the bundle. Amazon further mandates that such a bundle should be listed under a unique product identifier and that none of the product identifiers from any of the components can be used to identify the bundle. In other words Amazon considers product bundles as unique products in themselves. Apart from aiming to provide greater value to consumers Amazon’s product bundling policy also serves the sellers’ interests. The assignment of unique product identifiers protects the bundle and the seller from adverse price competition by making it difficult for competitors to find and compete against the seller’s bundle listing. By virtue of its uniqueness a given product bundle may also enjoy a greater chance of being featured in Amazon’s coveted Buy Box. (Products featured in the Buy Box have a greater probability of being purchased by a consumer.) Multiple sellers offering the same product simultaneously compete for the Buy Box; only one is selected from among many to be featured in the Buy Box based on a set of criteria instated by Amazon. In summary by being unique a product bundle enjoys a better chance of being sold. In conclusion understanding how bundling works and simultaneously remaining cognizant about the limitations and applicability of the various bundling strategies thus discussed managers can use bundling to create greater value price discriminate and reduce costs thus improving profitability. What Is a Bundle and What Is Not a Bundle?Can a car comprising an engine a suspension system a chassis and wheels be considered a bundle? Or can a smartphone be considered a bundle when it as part of the same device offers the functionalities of a personal digital assistant a camera and a recorder over and above the ability to communicate with other users? Intuitively perhaps a car and a smartphone do not represent bundles but individual products. The examples of the car and the smartphone have a subtle difference: while a car cannot run without any of the components mentioned a cellular phone can still provide the basic functionality of a phone without the other components listed above. Although from this perspective the car may not constitute a bundle a smartphone can still be considered a bundle given that it combines separate products—a camera a personal digital assistant a recorder and so on—as part of the same device. However consumers necessarily expect and consider such features and functionalities to be integral parts of a smartphone—i.e. smartphones are not smartphones without such functionalities. Consequently product norms set by firms and as understood by consumers determine what constitutes a bundle (or not). At the core of this argument lies the perceived ability to separate components a factor that reflects the prevalent norm in the market. Such a norm is a joint outcome of a firm’s strategic marketing efforts and consumer preferences—i.e. an amalgamation of the market-driving and market-driven factors prevalent in the market fundamental to value creation.APPENDIX 1: COMPARISON OF TOTAL PROFITS FROM MIXED BUNDLING ACROSS TWO DIFFERENT CONSUMER SEGMENTSIn this appendix a histogram of maximum profit from a Monte Carlo simulation conducted with 100 random draws (or samples) from a population of normally distributed reservation prices using the template provided in Bundling Exercise B. The histogram is presented in Exhibit 6A. The average profit that could be earned from a population of consumers having normally distributed reservation prices a mean of 400 money units and a standard deviation of 10 money units was 6510 money units. In this example the average price commanded by the bundle was 693 money units and the prices for product 1 (P1) and product 2 (P2) were 367 money units and 379 money units respectively. The implication is that given the demand characteristics in the population a mixed bundling strategy would require firms to offer a 7.5 per cent price discount ([(367 + 379) − 693] ÷ 693) on the sum of the individual prices for P1 and P2. The simulation was repeated with a lower-dispersion parameter (i.e. standard deviation) value for consumers’ reservation prices across (not along) the bundle price line. All other parameters in the model remained unchanged. Dispersion was controlled by reducing the standard deviation pertaining to the error term. While the first run was conducted with a value of 50 money units for the standard deviation for the error term the second was conducted with a value of 5 money units for the same parameter. The histogram corresponding to the second run is presented in Exhibit 6B. The average profit that could be earned in this case was 6853 money units. In this example the average price commanded by the bundle was 692 money units and the prices for product 1 (P1) and 2 (P2) were 358 money units and 356 money units respectively. The implication is that given the demand characteristics in the population a mixed bundling strategy would require firms to offer a 3.2 per cent price discount ([(358 + 356) – 692] ÷ 692) on the sum of the individual prices for P1 and P2. An independent sample t-test conducted on the maximum profit data from the two populations returned a statistically significant difference at the 5 per cent level of significance indicating that the average maximum profit from a population of consumers having less dispersion across the bundle profit line is greater than the average maximum profit from a population of consumers having higher dispersion in reservation prices across the bundle price line. In other words bundling becomes a more potent method of price discrimination (and hence offers more profit) as the dispersion of consumers’ reservation prices decreases across the bundle price line. EXHIBIT 1A: PURE BUNDLINGBy charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle a firm can sell the bundle to all three consumers appropriate all the value from the market and make a profit of $30 (3 × $10). For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. If the firm wanted to sell the jelly beans and the chocolate separately to all the consumers it would need to price the jelly beans at $1 and the chocolate also at $1. At these prices the firm will make a total profit of $6 ([3 × $1] + [3 × $1]). Therefore by bundling the firm can earn $24 more ($30 − $6) as compared to selling the jelly beans and chocolates separately.

For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. If the firm wanted to sell the jelly beans and the chocolate separately to all the consumers it would need to price the jelly beans at $5 and the chocolate also at $5. At these prices the firm will make a total profit of $30 ([3 × $5] + [3 × $5]). Therefore by bundling the firm cannot earn any more than by selling the jelly beans and the chocolate separately (unbundling).

The marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero for the sake of simplicity and exposition. Next the profitability of the mixed bundling strategy is determined as follows:With a price bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle $8 for the jelly beans and $8 for the chocolate the firm can earn a total profit of $46 ([3 × $10] + [2 × $8]) or $16 more ($46 − $30) than the total profit that can be earned using pure bundling. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.EXHIBIT 4: PRICE (MIXED) BUNDLING WITH POSITIVE MARGINAL COSTSWith a pure bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can sell the bundle to only four consumers and make a profit of $24 (4 × $6) wherein the marginal cost of production is assumed to be $2 for each of the two products. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.Exhibit 4 (Continued)Next the profitability of the mixed bundling strategy is determined as follows:In a situation of price bundling by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle $8 for the jelly beans and $8 for the chocolate the firm can earn a total profit of $36 ([3 × $6] + [2 × $6] + [1 × $6]) or $12 more ($36 − $24) than the total profit that can be earned using pure bundling. Source: Created by author using hypothetical data.EXHIBIT 5: PRODUCT BUNDLINGWith a pure bundling strategy by charging a price of $10 for the entire bundle the firm can sell the bundle to only two consumers and earn a profit of $20 (2 × $10). For the sake of simplicity and exposition the marginal cost of production is assumed to be zero. With a product bundling strategy however the desirability of milk and cookies increases by $2 as consumers find higher value in consuming milk and cookies together. The firm’s advertising may have been effective in persuading consumers to consider the greater enjoyment possible from consuming milk and cookies together. Thus by charging a price of $12 for the entire bundle the firm can now sell the bundle to all four consumers and earn a total profit of $48 (4 × $12) or $28 more ($48 − $20) than the total profit possible with pure bundling. Most importantly through product bundling the firm is also able to sell its products to consumers Rihaan and Roshni who consumed neither cookies nor milk to begin with.

Before returning to Canada to check on his first start-up he sat down at a Nairobi coffee shop to do a final assessment of all the data he had collected. Janssen had taken three unique approaches to learning more about Kenyan farmers: primary interviews a survey and his own attempt at chicken farming. He was pretty sure he knew what his new venture would offer the market but he wanted to review the data one more time. As he sipped on some coffee grown just outside of Nairobi and ate a chapati Janssen decided to use design thinking principles to synthesize the data and solidify the value proposition of his new undertaking.PRIMARY INTERVIEWSDuring the trip Janssen connected with people at all stages of the supply chain. Finding information was easy: Kenya had a strong culture of communal support. Janssen’s findings provided deeper insights into the macrodata he had previously reviewed. Some of Janssen’s key learnings pertained to the following.PopulationJanssen learned that a culture of land inheritance meant that farms remained small and therefore could not reap the benefits of scale (see Exhibit TN-1). As one farmer told Janssen “I have already split half my land among four of my children and the other half will go to the next four when they come of age.”Climate ChangeThe farmers also told Janssen about their experiences with the changing climate. To them it now seemed like every season was different from what they were used to. This made it difficult to effectively plan what to grow and it led to many farmers losing their crops to drought or torrential rain. The farmers Janssen met did not have the educational resources to find the technologies that would mitigate climate risk. Talking to one chicken farmer he was told A flood last fall destroyed much of our communities’ grain supply so the cost to feed my chickens has been high eliminating my profits! Some of my neighbours have begun feeding their chickens household food waste. For some this killed their chickens and for others it worked so I do not know if this is a good option!Market AccessJanssen spoke with farmers whose only means of selling outside their town was via a broker who visited seasonally with a non-negotiable price. While some of the coffee farmers Janssen met participated in co-operatives to improve their bargaining power he did not find similar arrangements between produce and livestock farmers. Janssen thought that there might be an opportunity to improve co-operation between these farmers similar to what had occurred in the coffee market. Some of the young start-up farmers that Janssen connected with in cities told him how they had mastered taking care of their fruits and vegetables but they could not find a consistent buyer who would purchase their produce in bulk. Yet when Janssen asked what they had done to promote their businesses the farmers had often spoken with their immediate community members but done little to formally market their products. Janssen knew that the demand existed because a vegetable canner in Nairobi had told him that his business frequently experienced shortages for the produce it processed. Janssen sensed that there were gaps in many farmers’ knowledge of how to participate in formal markets. Asking a few farmers if they had considered purchasing storage silos or water pumps provoked laughter: “No we can’t afford those. However recently many of us have been using credit to purchase fertilizers for our plants so we can harvest more.” Connecting with the microloan community in Nairobi revealed that the cost of performing due diligence in rural communities was generally considered the primary barrier to increasing the supply of capital for African farmers.Mobile PhonesJanssen was with the farmer Charles Mwangi one day when he came to truly appreciate the unique role that cell phones played in Kenyan society. A young man David Nganga approached Mwangi and Janssen because he had previously agreed to purchase a few of Mwangi’s chickens. After seeing the chickens Nganga and Mwangi exchanged a few words and Nganga left. “The deal fell through?” Janssen asked. Mwangi replied No David currently has his line of credit SIM card but does not want the bank to see the transaction on his account. You see Equity Bank [Equity Bank Kenya Limited] gave David a line of credit for buying fertilizer from a supplier in town but David doesn’t need fertilizer right now. So he is going to go to the fertilizer shop ‘to pay’ them and then they will give him cash to pay for the chickens. Janssen was with some dairy farmers one day when he saw how the growing prevalence of smartphones was affecting farming: “You see Janssen my friend who works at Tuskys [a Kenyan grocery chain] told me how cheese is growing in popularity. I used YouTube to learn how to make cheese and now I am turning a portion of my milk into cheese every week and selling it to a few restaurants in town.”EducationWhile harvesting maize with some women one afternoon Janssen learned about extension workers. He asked the women how they learned to farm: “We learned from our mothers and our fathers and from each other!” “Did any of you go to school for farming?” Jansen asked. “No but sometimes extension workers come by with information for us on how to improve our farms. The problem with them is that sometimes they demand money and they bring education that does not actually solve our problems.” University students shared with Janssen their dreams of working for large agrochemical and energy companies. Janssen could not help but feel like the universities were not training students to meet Kenya’s primary agricultural needs. He recalled when he had been conducting research on microfranchises in Nairobi after graduating university. Microfranchise owners had articulated to Janssen their goals of attending or sending their children to university and yet no one ever spoke of attending trade schools or technical colleges. One evening Janssen was talking with some friends he had made on the rooftop of his hostel’s restaurant. Atieno Barika and Collins were all unemployed university graduates who each ran several different businesses to earn their incomes. Atieno ran a small chicken farm in Nairobi as well as a fruit stand; Barika owned a plumbing installation company and vegetable plot; and Collins operated a butcher shop and managed a hotel. They all shared the same sentiment: “Our university educations did not teach us to do what we do now—we taught ourselves.” Janssen concluded that the tertiary education system in Kenya was improving people’s aptitude for learning and problem-solving but it was not disseminating the practical skills people needed to build the nation.Emerging Services for FarmersAlthough current start-ups were creating value for farmers Janssen felt that these services had two shortcomings: First they failed to leverage the strong sense of community that Janssen had been observing through his interactions in Kenya. Second the dominant services were SMS (short messaging service) based. SMS-based platforms would lose supremacy in the long term given the anticipated increase in the use of smartphones and mobile Internet networks.FURTHER RESEARCHSurveysJanssen performed a lean market research experiment using Facebook Ads and Google Forms. Using Facebook’s targeting capabilities Janssen promoted surveys to females and males aged 15–65 who had previously demonstrated an interest in farming through their “likes” and group memberships. Naming the company eLengo Janssen collected unique and valuable data on the needs of Kenyan farmers. “Lengo” meant “aim” or “target” in Kiswahili so it was a fitting name for a company aimed at helping farmers achieve their business goals. Janssen needed help estimating the potential market for a smartphone-based platform. Assume Kenya had a population of 55 million people 40 per cent of whom had a smartphone and that this data otherwise represented smartphone users in Kenya. What services could Janssen offer to what markets? Using this data for whom should Janssen design a minimum viable product (MVP)?  WhatsApp Messenger Minimum Viable Product Within the survey Janssen also invited people to join WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp) chat groups. Ninety-eight per cent of survey respondents signalled that they would like to join these groups. WhatsApp groups allowed Janssen to test his hypothesis which was that by bringing people with similar interests together and leveraging the Kenyan culture of communal support active communities would develop. With prompts from Janssen groups soon confirmed the hypothesis. Janssen began seeing the sharing of expertise and educational resources within the WhatsApp groups (see Exhibit TN-2).Chicken Farming ExperimentWith the survey revealing that chicken farmers would be the optimal first target market Janssen decided that if he was going to teach others how to raise chickens he should probably first learn how to raise them himself. Janssen asked his friend David Otieno if he would like to use his plot in Nairobi to try to raise chickens with Janssen providing the initial investment. Otieno agreed and Janssen arranged to send 50 chicks to Otieno’s plot. Janssen attempted to manage the farm remotely but it took only a few weeks to realize that raising a flock of healthy chickens was a genuine challenge. In week two temperatures dropped one night and 20 of the chicks died. This cold spell gave another 10 influenza killing them in the next two weeks. Just when Janssen thought that 20 birds may reach maturity Otieno called him one morning to report that almost all of the remaining birds had been attacked by some other animal in the night. With almost all of his birds now dead Janssen found a new appreciation for the challenges of raising animals.FINDING A VALUE PROPOSITIONAs Janssen finished his coffee he thought about how he knew the resources and processes he would be able to leverage but he needed to determine what value proposition he could offer the Kenyan agricultural market. Janssen considered which potential business models he should use to serve this market as well as which ones would be profitable. He decided to use design-thinking frameworks to identify key opportunities in the market.Exhibit TN-1: SurveysExhibit TN-1 (Continued)Exhibit TN-1 ContinuedSource: Adapted by the authors from Google Form surveys conducted by Chris Janssen ~April 25 2018.Exhibit 2: Sample WhatsApp ConversationSource: Adapted by the authors from WhatsApp conversation ~March 15 2018.",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,

It was pushing electric vehicles (EVs) because of its global commitments to control carbon emissions as well as its high dependence on imports to fuel its economic growth. India’s oil import bill in fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 was expected to be US$90 billion further rising to an estimated $160 billion by 2030. The spike in oil prices following the United States’ move to impose sanctions on Iran in May 2018 had given a new momentum to India’s ambitious EV program which aimed to reduce oil imports and pollution cut emissions and boost energy security.The government had launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 in 2013 to achieve national fuel security by promoting hybrid and EVs in the country. In the government’s annual budget for FY 2015/16 the NEMMP had initiated a scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) which proposed achieving six million–seven million sales of hybrids and EVs in India year on year from 2020 onwards by providing various fiscal (e.g. tax holidays inexpensive land and power availability duty exemptions etc.) and non-fiscal incentives (e.g. waiving road tax and registration charges for electric vehicles) worth ₹87.3 billion to EV firms until 2020.Many Indian and foreign automobile firms were finding these initiatives very lucrative and were formulating strategies to aggressively foray into this proposed EV environment. One automobile firm that was quite optimistic about the Indian government’s EV endeavour was Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited (MEM). MEM was the pioneer of EV technology in India. Under the brand Mahindra Electric MEM had a wide variety of EVs spanning personal and commercial segments. According to MEM’s chief executive officer (CEO) Mahesh Babu the firm’s vision was “to become a leading brand in providing customised electric mobility experiences through cutting edge technology.” Babu’s vision was backed by MEM’s holistic efforts in creating a comprehensive road map for establishing a robust EV ecosystem.Though it seemed that there was a perfect fit between MEM’s vision and the Indian government’s EV initiative plans to seamlessly move to EVs ran the risk of total breakdown as multiple government departments were presenting disparate views on the EV road map creating confusion among stakeholders. In September 2018 many macro and micro issues were present in the overall environment that was being created for EVs. Would companies like MEM be able to effectively formulate strategies and compete successfully in this dynamic and changing business environment? COMPANY BACKGROUNDMEM was part of the Mahindra Group (Mahindra) conglomerate which was started in 1945 and had become a $19-billion global federation of companies by 2018. It operated in 20 key industries such as automobiles information technology financial services and hospitality many of which were fairly recent inceptions. Mahindra’s EV initiative began in 2010 when it acquired majority stake in Reva Electric Car Company India’s leading EV manufacturer at that time. The acquired firm was renamed Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles. By 2016 the firm had branched out to produce a wide variety of EVs. It had also entered powertrain and drivetrain technology and provided mobility solutions to enable shared electric mobility. As its product portfolio expanded (see Exhibit 1) the firm rebranded itself as Mahindra Electric Mobility (MEM). In FY 2017/18 MEM sold 4000 EVs nearly a third of which were cars; the rest were electric rickshaws and vans.Mahindra had planned to cumulatively invest ₹35–₹40 billion in MEM’s EV business out of which ₹8 billion was to be invested in product development and capacity expansion. Mahindra aimed to have at least four new EV models on the road by 2021. The remainder would be put toward developing a battery-module plant that would have the capacity to make half a million battery modules a year. The plant would also house a battery module pack line. In 2018 MEM joined hands with LG Chem Limited to develop lithium-ion batteries for its EVs. The entire facility for both module and pack was expected to begin production in the last quarter of FY 2020. The intent of the company was not only to drive and lead the EV market in India but also to act as a supplier of components. MEM was also developing infrastructure to support an electric-led mobility system. MEM EVs were expected to have an output in excess of 35 kilowatts (kW) per hour and would likely be priced at about ₹1.1 million.Anticipating higher demand MEM had commenced work towards increasing production capacity for EVs from 5000 units a year in 2018 to between 60000 and 70000 units a year. Despite the limited success of its EVs in the Indian market thus far the company was expecting huge demand from taxi operators and others in the fleet segment. In 2018 MEM had a pilot project running with 100 electric cars in association with Ola Cabs (Ola) a leading Indian cab aggregator in the central Indian city of Nagpur. It had formed a similar association with Uber Technologies Incorporated (Uber) to deploy EVs in the major Indian cities of Delhi and Hyderabad. MEM had already supplied 500 EVs to an electric-cab service provider Lithium Urban Technologies and had landed an order for 1000 electric cars from Bangalore-based fleet operator Baghirathi Travel Solutions. In addition MEM was partnering with Italian design house Pininfarina which Mahindra had acquired in December 2015 to develop an electric sports vehicle. MEM had also helped Ford Motor Company in developing an electric version of its Aspire entry-level sedan which would hit the market by 2019. In September 2017 the two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding to explore joint work on EVs and to approach global distribution as a team.Babu had been with Mahindra for 18 years and had worked in the design and development of engine and vehicle platforms—from frugal three-wheelers to Mahindra’s flagship models. He was a Fulbright scholar and had completed a program in leadership management at the Tepper School of Business Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Under his leadership MEM had launched four new models including the award-winning e2oPlus. Babu had been instrumental in shaping the electric-mobility solutions of the future through path-breaking initiatives in the commercial-fleet space and by expanding the electric portfolio of both low- and high-voltage drivetrains.THE INDIAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND Electric vehiclesThe Indian automobile industry was worth $93 billion in 2018. It commanded 22 per cent of India’s manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) and contributed 7 per cent to the country’s overall GDP. The automobile industry and its over 10000 component manufacturers collectively employed about 30 million people. The firms in India had exclusive distributors for their range of vehicles and a multiple-brand distribution network in the automobile industry was not the norm. Nearly 70 per cent of passenger vehicles (PVs) sold in India fell into the category of small cars. Electric cars accounted for less than 0.1 per cent and overall EV sales were only 1 per cent of the 3.268 million passenger-vehicle sales in India in 2017. Ninety five percent of EVs on Indian roads were low-speed electric scooters powered by lead-acid batteries whose speed was less than 25 kilometres (km) per hour. In such a scenario the Indian government’s EV push was dictated by an urgent concern about rising pollution levels in most Indian cities in addition to its international carbon-reduction commitments and the pressure of the oil import bill.As a result of the government’s initiative it was expected that by 2030 as many as 40 per cent of new PVs to be sold in the local market would be EVs. Assuming a growth rate of 8 per cent in the PV segment every year about 71 million new vehicles were expected to be added between 2018 and 2030. Of this 28.4 million vehicles were expected to be EVs and the remaining 42.6 million would be equipped with conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs).This would lead to a massive technological shift as ICEs and EV engines had very different powertrains (see Exhibit 2). While a conventional ICE vehicle had 3000 moveable parts EVs only had 30 such parts. The configuration of EVs would be different from the ICE as the engine transmission and exhaust would be replaced with an electric motor inventors battery pack and control unit. Hence the electrical and electronics systems would take precedence over mechanical engineering. On the battery front the economics favoured lithium-ion batteries as their prices had dropped about 73 per cent—from $1000 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2010 to $272 per kWh in 2016. Lithium also had an advantage over oil because it could be recycled for future use. Battery price was an important consideration; creating battery-manufacturing capacity would take up a large part of the investment required to create EVs as nearly 70 per cent of the cost of an EV was contributed by the battery.Experts felt that the cost of batteries might halve by 2020 making EVs more affordable while driving the costs higher for conventional vehicles that had to comply with Bharat Stage 6 emission standards (comparable to Euro 6 emission standards). Hence they believed that EVs would become increasingly viable by 2023 with the Indian manufacturing ecosystem having matured by then. However many also felt that EV technology was still in the evolutionary phase and there were a lot of uncertainties with regards to cost structures and the evolution of the ecosystem. Between complete EVs and ICEs there was another set of vehicles which were called hybrids. These vehicles ran on both battery and ICE and could be an interim solution. INDIAN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVESTo lead from the front in its EV endeavour the Indian government created Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in 2010 formed under the Ministry of Power. It was a joint venture of four national public sector undertakings: NTPC Limited Power Finance Corporation Limited Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. EESL’s objective was to facilitate energy-efficiency projects that would significantly reduce energy consumption and costs. As part of its energy-conservation initiatives EESL had floated a tender for 10000 basic electric sedans in August 2017. Tata Motors Limited (TM) had cornered 60 per cent of the tender and the rest had gone to MEM. EESL had floated its second global tender for procuring 10000 electric cars in April 2018. In May 2018 the Union Ministry of Home Affairs was planning to seek guidance from EESL and switch to EVs replacing diesel-guzzling vehicles including heavy trucks and buses for the seven security forces operating under the ministry. In December 2017 the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises had sanctioned ₹4.4 billion to 11 states to procure 390 electric buses taxis and automobiles as a pilot project under the FAME scheme.To enhance the infrastructure for EVs in India in May 2018 the government proposed setting up EV charging stations every 3 kilometre (km) in cities with over a million people and every 50 km on busy national highways. For the further proliferation of EVs it planned to offer fiscal incentives and facilitated land acquisition for those who were interested in setting up the required EV-charging infrastructure. The government also considered providing subsidies to public sector undertakings in the energy sector such as NTPC Limited the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited to initiate the process of setting up charging stations. Besides these state-run enterprises Indian automakers including Mahindra and TM and cab-hailing companies like Ola and Uber were all interested in setting up charging infrastructure for EVs.As part of the ₹94-billion package for encouraging the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles among Indian consumers and cab aggregators the government was planning to offer incentives of up to ₹250000 for those who would scrap their old gasoline or diesel vehicles and purchase EVs (see Exhibit 3).To incentivize Indian manufacturers in April 2018 the government planned to double the mandatory local content in EVs to 70 per cent in the coming three years and to impose heavy duties on imports. In 2018 the local content in EVs was about 35 per cent as most companies imported batteries which accounted for a major cost of EVs. As per the proposal by 2019 the domestic content in EVs would be increased to a minimum of 50 per cent which subsequently would be increased to 60 per cent in 2020 and to 70 per cent in 2021. COMPETITORS IN THE INDIAN electric vehicles MARKETTata Motors LimitedTM was a part of the $100-billion Tata Group founded in 1868. TM itself was a $42-billion organization. It was a leading automobile manufacturer in India with a portfolio that included a wide range of cars sports vehicles trucks buses and defence vehicles. At the Geneva International Motor Show in March 2018 TM premiered its electric concept sedan—E-Vision—which was set to eventually become the brand’s flagship sedan in the Indian market. TM was operating on three different levels of electrification. The first was a plug-and-play solution with the Electra EV which would power lower-voltage vehicles like the Tiago Tigor Magic Iris and Ace. The next was to modify the new-age Omega architecture for electrification so as to offer longer-range and faster vehicles. Finally TM was looking at a dedicated EV architecture in the mid to long term. TM planned for the majority of its vehicles in India to be electrified by 2022 including mild hybrids hybrids and battery-operated EVs.TM had created an electric-mobility division to have special focus on developing cleaner mobility solutions for the future. Other firms of the Tata Group were roped in to offer a complete turnkey solution: While TM would offer the EV Tata Power Limited would set up charging stations; Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited would build physical infrastructure depots or dedicated EV stations; and Tata Consultancy Services Limited would help develop the required software platform. TM had cornered 60 per cent of the EESL tender. However the electric cars it provided to EESL were only running 70 to 80 km on one charge compared to the initial claim of 130 km per charge. This made EESL question TM on performance criteria. With a price point of ₹1.12 million for each TM electric car this single-charge range was considered inadequate.Maruti Suzuki India LimitedStarted as a joint venture between the Indian government and the Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan in 1981 Maruti Suzuki India Limited (Suzuki) eventually became the largest car manufacturer in India. The Indian government later divested from this venture. In April 2018 Suzuki was the parent company’s most successful subsidiary in the world and at 50.10 per cent it had the largest market share among PVs in India. Suzuki along with Denso Corporation and Toshiba Corporation had pooled $180 million in 2017 to build a plant in India for producing lithium-ion batteries. Suzuki had also partnered with Japan’s largest carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) to roll out a small electric car for the mass segment in India and elsewhere by 2020. Its first affordable EV would be based on technology from parent Suzuki Motor Corporation and was to be made before the products that were going to be developed in partnership with Toyota. Thus the company was working with partners as well as focusing on in-house capabilities to put the ecosystem in place for EVs.Suzuki was likely to have an EV with a power output of 25 to 35 kW per hour suitable for the compact-car segment and possibly priced below ₹1 million. The company was looking for collaborations in the areas of materials handling battery recycling and reuse and charging infrastructure. In addition it would continue to refine its ICE vehicles and make them more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. Hyundai Motor India LimitedHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai Motor Company (HMC). Since its inception HMIL had been the second-largest car manufacturer and the number one car exporter in India. In FY 2017/18 HMIL had about a 17 per cent share in the Indian PV market. India was the third-biggest market for HMC globally behind China and the United States (outside its home market of South Korea) and its share in the company’s global revenue was about 15 per cent. The company sold 680000 million vehicles in FY 2017/18 (including exports). HMC was developing both battery EVs and fuel cell vehicles. HMIL was likely to introduce pure electric and hybrid vehicles in India in 2019—a year ahead of Suzuki. HMIL had developed hybrid vehicles for the domestic market but a spike in the goods and services tax rate for hybrid vehicles compelled the South Korean carmaker to shelve its hybrid vehicles completely and shift to electric ones. It would start with importing completely knocked down units of its Kona Electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2019 and look at local manufacturing as the market matured. The Kona Electric would be priced between ₹2 million and ₹2.5 million. HMIL was planning to invest over $1 billion in India by 2020. HMC’s Kia Motor Corporation was also planning to manufacture an electric car and hatchback in India after its entry in the second half of 2019. However it believed there was a need to address critical issues such as establishing charging infrastructure in India.BYD Auto Company LimitedFounded in 1995 the Chinese firm BYD Auto Company Limited (BYD) was a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Its automobile business included new-energy vehicles like EVs. In India BYD had teamed up with lesser-known Indian firm Goldstone Infratech to manufacture electric cars trucks and other automobiles with fast-charging batteries that could run up to 400 km on a full charge. In 2018 it planned to invest ₹2 billion in establishing a plant in India wanting to make the country its manufacturing hub for exporting EVs to other South Asian nations. BYD planned to manufacture 5000 electric buses per year in India by March 2021 and it would increase localization content to 70 per cent—which in 2018 stood at 35 per cent.Other Prospective PlayersIndian consumer durables maker Micromax Informatics Limited also planned to enter EV and battery manufacturing. It was in the advanced stages of testing formalities for the vehicles and had gotten approval for some of its lithium-ion batteries. It was keen on entering the electric two- and three-wheeler categories where it would compete with the likes of Bajaj Auto Limited Mahindra TVS Motor Company and Piaggio. Many other Indian firms—such as Hero Future Energies Limited Ravin Group Sun Mobility and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited—were also venturing into the domain of battery manufacturing for EVs. Being successful in this arena promised massive rewards as a study done by U.S.-based Rocky Mountain Institute estimated that switching completely to EVs in 2030 could create a battery market of $300 billion in India. If battery manufacturers imported the cells and assembled the battery they could capture only 30 per cent of this value whereas if they imported only the raw materials lithium and cobalt and manufactured the battery locally about 80 per cent of the value could be captured.In line with the Indian government’s push for EVs many foreign firms were also keen on taking initiatives. French company FM Logistic had plans to develop green vehicles for environmentally sustainable road cargo transportation in India. It planned to launch the first electric or hybrid truck in India in 2019. Japanese EV maker Terra Motors Corporation which sold electric rickshaws in the Indian market was looking to shift its operational base to India to expand in Asia. Terra Motors’ research and development centre in India would design products control quality and test specifications of EVs being manufactured in India. The company was looking to introduce in 2019 an electric two-wheeler powered by a lithium-ion battery. The start-up Uniti Sweden had formed a strategic partnership with the Bird Group for its foray into India. It was going to launch an affordable five-seater electric city car with a range of 250 km priced at about ₹250000 in 2020. Many other foreign players such as Renault-Nissan Honda Motor Company Limited Mercedes-Benz BMW Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive had also expressed interest in bringing EVs into the Indian market but were awaiting clarity in government policy before finalizing their next course of action. According to a study conducted in 2016 by Variant Market Research the market in India for lithium-ion batteries was expected to reach $5 billion in 2024 and subsequently grow at 26 per cent a year. As a result many battery manufacturers from various countries like EnerBlu from the United States and Delta Electronics Industry from Taiwan were looking forward to supplying batteries for EV to Indian firms.INDIAN CONSUMERS’ PREFERENCES India was known as a small-car market. However the country was witnessing an SUV rush. In FY 2017/18 PV sales in India grew by 8 per cent to 3.28 million units whereas SUV sales grew by 21 per cent crossing 900000 units. In the pricier segment (₹1.2 million–₹4 million) three out of four cars sold in India were SUVs. From 14 per cent in FY 2009/10 the percentage share of SUVs in PV sales had risen to 30 per cent. Rising incomes and aspirations had led consumers to go from buying small cars to buying SUVs. By showing a preference for SUVs Indian consumers were behaving like their counterparts elsewhere in the world. SUVs had outpaced industry sales in many markets the world over. In Europe from a figure of just over half a million in 2000 SUV sales touched 4.6 million in 2017. The United States showed a jump in SUV sales from 3.4 million in 2000 to seven million in 2017. In the case of China the increase was more dramatic—from 4600 units in 2000 to 10.7 million in 2017. Between FY 2002/3 and FY 2017/8 SUV sales in India showed more than an eight-fold increase (see Exhibit 4). The thrust of SUVs in the forthcoming EV scenario had led companies such as Volvo Cars and BMW to provide hybrid-engine options. HMIL’s Kona Electric SUV would be the company’s first EV in India in 2019. Mercedes-Benz was working on the EQ concept EV range based on its GLC mid-size SUV. TM was designing electric versions of its off-roaders H5X and 45X. MEM was also working on an electric version of Mahindra’s popular KUV100 model.CONCERNSDespite the government’s heavy push experts felt that electric road transportation was yet to become viable in India due to the dearth of infrastructure primarily charging stations. There was concern as to how to electrify small cars and make them affordable. Many firms felt that as far as EVs were concerned there were three major challenges facing them: performance range and cost. According to Kenichi Ayukawa managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki making affordable electric cars was one of the biggest challenges for auto companies especially as vehicle batteries were very expensive and there was no public charging infrastructure. Expert opinion was that the ecosystem to manufacture the battery-management systems power electronics and lithium-ion batteries required for EVs was not yet available in India. On the other hand India’s northeastern neighbour China was already the world’s largest EV manufacturer with almost 60 per cent of the global market share in terms of volume (see Exhibit 5). With active policy support of the Chinese government and large investments in the new-energy space China was likely to emerge as a trendsetter and significant technology driver in the EV arena in coming years. It was also expected to create a huge ecosystem for battery manufacturing recycling and charging infrastructure as well as other related components of the EV package. It was believed that in the future India would have to depend on China for battery imports and that ultimately Chinese companies would dominate the Indian market. This was already being seen in many instances. French carmaker Groupe Renault’s electric version of the Kwid small car intended for India would have batteries and battery-management systems manufactured in China. The current market trend was also showing an increase in the import of automobile parts from China (see Exhibit 6).Experts were also skeptical about the proliferation of EV usage reducing India’s pollution levels as the country met 75 per cent of its electricity needs by burning fossil fuels. It was felt that EVs on roads would only move the pollution off city roads to its hinterlands where the required power was generated. In addition to this for a power-deficit nation like India there would be challenges in ensuring adequate supplies needed to run EVs. Besides issues related to charging infrastructure the need for fast chargers parking spots and swappable batteries required robust solutions and public–private partnerships. Experts felt that the push for EVs was largely coming from the central government and there had been limited policy-level support at the state and municipal levels.The Indian automotive industry came under the purview of the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises and ministries of road transport and highways. It had faced the brunt of intervention from various regulatory bodies in India like the National Green Tribunal; the Supreme Court; the Goods and Services Tax Council; the National Institution for Transforming India; and the ministries of urban development power and environment and forests. This had led to multiple voices sending out multiple messages creating an environment of confusion and uncertainty for the industry.Besides stressing EV usage in 2016 the Indian government also decided that the country would leapfrog from BS 4 emission standards to BS 6 emission standards for all of its gasoline- and diesel-driven vehicles by 2020 which warrantied an investment of more than ₹600 billion. This further stressed the budgets of the research and development departments of many automobile manufacturers including MEM which had to work on both EV- and BS 6-compatible engines for the Indian market. With intensifying competition and a success ratio of just two in every 10 new models introduced in the market return on investment and viability were serious challenges ahead for the vehicle makers.There was also a fear that the industry would be shaken up as close to 60 per cent of automobile industry revenue came from engines and powertrains which would be under threat in the upcoming EV scenario. There was danger that an EV-based automobile environment in India would make many of the casting forging and machining sectors unviable risking about 1.5 million jobs in an already job-stressed Indian market.the WAY FORWARDIn its endeavour to shift 30 per cent of the country’s transport fleet to electric by 2030 the Indian government had initiated plans to provide many incentives to public and private enterprises as well as Indian consumers. Despite the multitude of government initiatives and the serious attempts being made by many automotive firms in India there was still a lack of clarity regarding the various macro- and micro-environmental factors that had to be addressed to make the EV dream a reality in India. As this change in business environment became imminent Babu realized that he would need to study competitors’ initiatives and that MEM would have to formulate its own strategies.

This was the third time in the span of a year that KPMG partners had quit to join rival companies and this exodus was the biggest movement of consulting employees since 2011. This time Deloitte had delivered a big blow to KPMG—hitting its advisory services which were growing rapidly and contributed 38 per cent to its global revenue. Globally KPMG’s advisory services were growing at 11.5 per cent—much faster than its other two functions tax and auditing which grew at 8.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively in 2016. Deloitte gained significantly from this move and emerged as a challenger to Ernst & Young Global Limited (EY) which had the biggest advisory vertical in India with 125 partners. Reeling from the blow the firm had received KPMG management was confronted with the challenge of warding off future poaching attempts and retaining its existing partners. The standard practices to check attrition such as non-compete agreements and non-solicitation contracts had become ineffective for KPMG in this situation.KPMGKPMG was founded in 1987 through the merger of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main Goerdeler and the name KPMG carried the traces of its founding members. Headquartered in Amsterdam the Netherlands the company was one of the world’s Big Four accounting firms. The other three were Deloitte PwC and EY. Driven by its vision to create “a platform which shared the expertise knowledge and experience of professionals across a global network” the company had been helping to build a knowledge-based economy using its expertise and resources.Members of the Swiss KPMG International Cooperative operated as separate legal entities in many countries. The firm offered three major lines of service: audit taxation and advising. Of these auditing was a major service for the company. Its advisory services comprised management consulting risk consulting and deal advising (see Exhibit 1). The firm also provided the latest technology and information services; to help grow its clients’ businesses KPMG provided them with SAP and Oracle consulting services. Globally the company competed aggressively in the market to win clients.In 2010 KPMG was recognized as the world’s most attractive employer among the Big Four firms. In 2016 its total employee strength across the globe was around 174000 people. With revenues of US$25.42 billion KPMG saw a 9.6 per cent increase in its overall earnings that year. However the Europe Middle East and Africa region including India grew by only 6 per cent. KPMG IndiaIn 1993 KPMG entered India and spread to all major cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chandigarh Chennai Gurugram Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Mumbai Pune Noida and Vadodara. The company offered its clients financial and business advisory services risk advisory services and tax and regulatory services. Serving these needs of Indian businesses it created a client base of over 2700 companies in India by 2016 and emerged as one of the leading consultancy firms in the domains it served. Its client list included information technology companies financial services companies and market leaders in several other industry segments. Led by talented professionals in the domain of advisory services the company had edged ahead of its competitors. In 2015 KPMG India won the prestigious “System Integration Partner of the Year” award from QlikTech a leading new-generation business intelligence and analytics platform that offered its clients CXO-level applications and dashboards giving insights into their business operations. Over the years KPMG India had emerged as a top employer and had a strong human resource base of around 10000 employees. LinkedIn listed KPMG as the fifth most attractive company that Indian talent was willing to work with in 2016. Both current and former employees had posted positive views about the company on various online portals highlighting the opportunities it offered for learning and working on challenging projects leading to career growth.  Competition: The Big FourPwC EY Deloitte and KPMG were globally at the forefront of accounting-related services and were known as the Big Four (see Exhibit 2). These firms dominated the industry by their sheer size and global presence. They had a high reputation in the industry as they performed audit tax consulting and transactions services for the many Fortune 500 companies that were their clients.DeloitteBased in New York United States Deloitte was a 150-year-old firm with a presence in more than 150 countries. With its strong network of around 244000 professionals the firm earned $36.8 billion in 2016. By that time the company had been featured 17 times in Fortune’s list of 100 best companies to work for. Deloitte employees enjoyed benefits like telecommuting job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals and on-site medical care facilities. In India the company was first incorporated as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Private Limited (DTTIPL) a private company. In October 2015 the firm became Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP a limited liability partnership. PwC Founded by Samuel Lowell Price in 1849 London-based PwC operated in 157 countries with a large network of 223468 executives. Serving 422 of the world’s Fortune 500 companies the company posted revenues of $35.9 billion in 2016. Ranked 53 on the Fortune 100 list in 2016 the company paid an average of $104772 to salaried employees in the most common jobs. Some of the benefits of working with PwC were unlimited sick days job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals health insurance and sick days even for part-time workers. Incorporated in 2009 in India the firm spread to several large cities including Ahmedabad Bengaluru Chennai Delhi Hyderabad Kolkata Mumbai and Pune.EYA company of about 212000 employees EY had operations in 82 locations and $29.6 billion in revenue globally. Ranked 49 on the Fortune 100 list this Big Four firm offered several options that allowed its employees to work when and where they wanted. Some of the benefits its employees received were telecommuting job sharing compressed workweeks fully paid sabbaticals and discounted gym memberships. Sick leave however was limited to 10 days in a year. The company allowed its employees the freedom to enjoy life’s small wonders as they could take 16 weeks off for parental leave. In India a strong network of 22000 employees worked from various strategic locations namely Chandigarh Kochi Mumbai Bangalore Kolkata Hyderabad Chennai Ahmedabad and Pune; the company’s Indian headquarters were at Gurugram in the national capital region.As an emerging market with audit consulting and advisory services valued at around ₹100 billion ($1492 million) the India market—which was growing at around 10 per cent—was attractive to the Big Four firms and they were each vying for a large share in this market. PwC had recorded revenue growth of 17 per cent for financial year 2015 and was optimistic of growth opportunities in India. During this period EY also reported a spike in its revenue growth to 19.7 per cent and was looking at sourcing 30 per cent of its total revenue from emerging markets including India. Even Deloitte and KPMG encouraged by their fast growth over the years considered India a bright spot for increasing their global revenues.The Poaching EpisodeIn October 2016 when most of the audit firms were making desperate attempts to check attrition Deloitte waged a war to gain a competitive edge in the Indian advisory vertical. It poached 20 partners from KPMG and tried to woo around 300 executives away from the company. Deloitte was purportedly giving the poached executives a significant raise from their current salaries: these partners were offered a salary jump in proportion to the number of team members they could bring from KPMG. This exodus came as a big blow to KPMG especially its advisory services. There was speculation that Deloitte would gain significantly from this movement of partners once these 300 executives had been recruited. While Deloitte already had 55 partners in its advisory vertical the addition of 20 more new partners could take this number closer to EY’s total of 125. With this increased strength Deloitte emerged as a challenger to EY in the advisory practice space. This exodus was the third time within the span of a year that a large number of KPMG partners had quit. Earlier in August 2016 a senior partner had quit KPMG and joined a tax advisory firm run by Dinesh Kanabar a former deputy chief executive officer (CEO) at KPMG. Competitors had also tried to poach the indirect tax team earlier in 2016 by giving each of the team members offers to join them.After this episode Richard Rekhy the elected head of KPMG India decided to retire as CEO of KPMG India well ahead of the end of his second term in November 2020. Rising from the position of the head of risk advisory practice Rekhy had been at the helm of KPMG India since 2012. The mass resignations which had raised questions about his management style led to his retirement. Later the leader of the advisory vertical Ambarish Dasgupta also stepped down. The consultancy business had seen consolidation over the past few years. While some consulting firms were acquired by either the Big Four firms or technology companies many stand-alone firms struggled with revenue and retaining their best talent. Deloitte had been aggressively looking for expansion opportunities in the advisory business and this poaching move was in line with those efforts. Culture at Warring FirmsKPMG had built itself on the principles of integrity openness honesty and flexibility. The company promoted diversity in the workplace and encouraged sharing of knowledge among employees. It was recognized on various social media sites and job portals for its reputation and competitive pay package and for its employees who were described as intelligent talented friendly and down to earth. Posters on these sites said the company had good training and career advancement opportunities. However posters also reported some disadvantages of working with the firm including long working hours (including working on weekends) limited leaves and time-bound projects. Additionally some employees felt they spent too much time travelling and experienced sustained pressure to acquire many skill sets owing to the small size of several teams. Several people from KPMG complained of long working hours and especially of unpredictably annoying schedules between January and April every year rating the company as the least prestigious among the Big Four. A few also talked of lower compensation. In a survey by Vault.com Inc. (Vault) one former KPMG employee observed “Work hours can be very long sometimes depending on the client you get. Investment banking hours with accountant pay can be discouraging and frustrating.” A former employee noted on the Indeed site that the company “overall provides a degree of freedom for individuals to perform but internal employee and talent management processes at least in India are pretty hazy.” Another senior consultant posted about disadvantages of working with the company: “constant travel poor work life balance. No value to others’ time.”On the other hand Deloitte had created an organizational culture of purpose which was aimed at guiding behaviour influencing strategy and transcending leaders. In India its former and current employees had described the workplace as friendly and compassionate. Many of them felt the company gave them a sense of prestige and fostered their professional growth. People working with Deloitte were described as “top-notch highly talented very intelligent.” In the Vault survey from 2016 the company received positive votes for its culture people and opportunities provided in the workplace. It received negative votes especially for long hours lack of focus on regional travel and lack of early global deployment opportunities.Retention PracticesDespite existing retention policies 800 middle and senior executives were reported to have moved to competing firms in 2016. The industry attrition rate was 30–40 per cent higher over the past two to three years. The joining bonus for new executives was equal to a one-year salary which took care of the amount held back by the previous employer. Such employees were lured by fixed appraisals for the next two years irrespective of their performance.  On the other hand the Big Four and other consulting firms offered anywhere between a 30 and 50 per cent jump in salaries to those executives who were poached by competing firms. At times the firms elevated the status of such executives to the level of salaried partners to retain them. To incentivize the partners the firms were also ready to offer the partners 100 per cent of their salaries rather than putting 25 per cent toward capital which had been a typical practice. In addition to these preventive measures the Big Four made the exit rules for employees much stricter. In 2015 consultancies tried to restrict their executives from quitting with newer clauses in their employment contracts which extended the notice period by several months. Accounting firms made such restrictions to ensure that the partners did not poach whole teams leak confidential information or take business away with them. Some firms took even stricter measures to make movement more difficult. Gardening leave had often been waived in the past but the companies stopped waiving this to check attrition. A senior partner who was on gardening leave in 2015 noted “My bonus was held back by my old firm. It was not a small amount it ran into several [tens of millions].”Despite frequent instances of poaching PwC did not extend the notice period. Deepak Kapoor chairman of PwC India said “In PwC we have had a six-month notice period policy for many years for partners and we are not planning to change it. On a philosophical level I firmly believe that everyone should have a right of choice where they want to work.”ClosingHaving incurred losses in the audit business the Big Four firms were looking to expand their advisory businesses. The exodus of 20 partners and 300 other employees posed a challenge to the advisory business of KPMG. A leaner advisory team had dented the company’s competitive edge. Owing to these factors KPMG was forced to focus on resolving its internal issues at a time when the competition focused on clients and industry-related activities. Industry experts believed that poaching was the last resort for any firm but this practice prevailed because the industry did not have enough trained people. The competition could become more intense as this industry was projected to double in size by 2020. Facing the threat of more losses the new leadership at KPMG India had to find ways to retain its partners and defend against any future poaching attempts.

(Xiaomi) in Beijing delivered a speech at Xiaomi’s annual meeting. Lei summed up the company’s performance over the past year but expressed that he was not happy; the company’s efforts had failed to fulfill Lei’s expectations and it led him to reflect on his entrepreneurship journey.Six years earlier 14 people had come together at Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park to start Xiaomi. In time Xiaomi emerged as the leader in the Chinese smartphone market storming its way to the top. Xiaomi had adopted Lei’s “flying pig” theory—the importance of seizing the right opportunity—and Lei’s belief that the Internet was a new methodology that required an advanced way of thinking—focused extreme rapid using word of mouth and user involved. Xiaomi’s approach became a model for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to learn from and emulate. However there was fierce competition in the smartphone business in China. It was not long before Xiaomi encountered opposition from its allies and partner companies. Their products slogans and release conventions all attacked Xiaomi. Some engaged in Pengci marketing that targeted Xiaomi; some companies outright claimed that their products were better than Xiaomi’s. As Xiaomi lost ground it was further subjected to queries insults and slander. Even the accomplished and powerful chair of Gree Electric Dong Mingzhu joined the melee. Xiaomi’s overseas market encountered troubles and the Xiaomi brand suffered a trust crisis. Taiwan fined Xiaomi for misleading consumers with incorrect sales figures and the company was sued for product patent deficiency in India. These problems left Lei feeling dejected. How could Xiaomi meet the challenge of increasing its sales in the international markets?XiaomiWhen Lei was a student at Wuhan University he was impressed by the image of Steve Jobs presented in the book Fire in the Valley and was determined to start his own international corporation. After being CEO at Kingsoft Office for a number of years and an angel investor Lei began to pursue his dream which he had conceptualized 20 years earlier. He saw a space between the costly international-brand smartphones and the inexpensive made-in-China phones and he started Xiaomi with some of his like-minded friends to enter that space. The company’s name—the Chinese word for “millet” a nutritious and inexpensive Chinese staple—reflected the founders’ interest in providing useful products that were affordable. Core Hardware ProductsXiaomi smartphones (including Xiaomi pads) Xiaomi TV (including Xiaomi set-top box) and Xiaomi router were the first business ventures. Xiaomi then developed a smartphone operating system in collaboration with users of its online forum. The phones were also marketed through Xiaomi forum and sold online at MI.com which made Xiaomi phones the first Internet smartphone brand. Xiaomi continued to market sell and develop through these Internet platforms.Xiaomi smartphones achieved terrific growth increasing from a sales volume of 300000 handsets in 2011 to sales of 70.8 million in 2015 an increase of over 200 times. This made Xiaomi the fifth-largest smartphone company in the world after Samsung Group Apple Inc. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Lenovo Group Ltd. Due to the popularity of the smartphone the number of users of Xiaomi’s firmware operating system Mi User Interface (MIUI) also increased to an astonishing figure of 170 million spread over 156 countries around the world.Xiaomi box and Xiaomi TV also served as important ports to attract new users. This was facilitated by high-performance hardware configuration a smooth operating system and much original film and TV content. Xiaomi released its routers to create a cross-platform data centre which enabled users to get data and information from different devices whenever and wherever they needed.Mi User InterfaceXiaomi’s Mi User Interface (MIUI) and its mobile Internet services were the second part of Xiaomi’s “software + hardware + internet” business ecosystem. MIUI was a firmware operating system for mobile devices based on Google’s Android operating system. MIUI had two important features: it could be upgraded swiftly using either a developer’s version that was upgraded weekly or a stable version that was upgraded monthly; and the coding was available as software that could be installed on any Android phone which meant that not only Xiaomi phones but also other Android devices could switch to MIUI.In addition to providing access to the Internet MIUI offered Internet-based services such as intelligent call notification free Wi-Fi unknown number identification and an application store. MIUI also offered comprehensive Internet-based services such as Xiaomi Lifestyle which offered retail products and discounts at restaurants theatres and other venues; Xiaomi Entertainment which provided mainly games and films plus some TV content; and comprehensive financial services for loan financing. All these features had enough potential to generate more income sources for Xiaomi. In 2015 the revenues from Xiaomi Internet services reached CN¥3.82 billion (US$564 million) which was a 150 per cent increase compared to the previous year.Smart Hardware InvestmentXiaomi planned to invest ¥33.9 billion (US$5 billion) in 100 smart hardware companies. Lei pinned his hopes on the smartphone which was the mandatory device that connected all household computerized equipment in the internetworked Internet of Things. Xiaomi gradually built a hardware ecosystem that focused on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) set-top boxes for televisions and smart routers.By early 2016 Xiaomi had invested in 55 smart hardware companies including Huami (wearable technology such as the Mi Band) Qingmi Technology Co. Ltd. (hardware interface devices such as patch boards and cables) Ninebot Inc. (personal transportation devices) Lanmi Technology (Bluetooth devices such as headphones) Zimi Corporation (power banks) Zhimi Technology (air purifiers and fans) and Yunmi Technology (water purifiers). By mid-2016 Xiaomi had already made cumulative shipments of 24 million Mi Band units making Huami the second-largest smart wearable devices company in the world. As a result of the popularity of the Mi Band Huami raised ¥237.3 million (US$35 million) in its Series B round of financing; Huami was seeking to start a new round of financing with a valuation of ¥6.8 billion (US$1 billion).Development of XiaomiWithin its first five years Xiaomi raised five rounds of financing (see Exhibit 1) and its valuation rose from ¥1.7 billion (US$250 million) to ¥305 billion (US$45 billion)—a whopping 179-time increase. This meant that Xiaomi had the highest valuation in the world among unlisted technology companies. Yuri Milner the founder of Digital Sky Technologies Global (DST) who had invested in Facebook Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (US$100 billion companies) assessed Xiaomi’s valuation as having the potential to reach ¥678 billion (US$100 billion).Background of the smartphone businessDevelopment Situation of SmartphoneUnlike feature phones smartphones had an independent operating system. The operating system extended a phone’s basic communication functions by allowing installation of new applications (apps). These enhanced functions mainly depended upon the development of mobile Internet.With the development of technology smartphone functions became more and more powerful allowing many tasks that were normally carried out on a desktop computer to be accomplished on the phone. The feature phone market was gradually being taken over by smartphones. According to the technology research firm Gartner Inc. the total global sales of all mobile phones grew from 1.22 billion units in 2008 to 1.917 billion units in 2015. Shipments of smartphones increased from 140 million to 1.39 billion units while global sales of feature phones decreased from 1.14 billion to 570 million units.The Internationalization of Smartphone BrandsSamsung and Apple were the giants in the smartphone business. According to statistics provided by Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. in 2015 Samsung commanded 23.9 per cent of the world’s smartphone sales and Apple 17.2 per cent. However Apple garnered 91 per cent of the profits of the world’s smartphone sales while Samsung took only 14 per cent. Many smartphone manufacturers were incurring losses.Samsung’s core ability lay in its smartphone vertical industry chain. The company’s key techniques for manufacturing computer chips random-access memory (RAM) data storage screens and other components gave Samsung advantages in product development production quality and price. Samsung launched phones of numerous kinds and levels. Phones with different hardware and at different price points were produced around the globe and heavily promoted with celebrities sportspersons and non-commercial advertisements. The phones were sold internationally through many channels (through agents and direct to consumers who could customize their phones). After earning additional profits and establishing its production cycle Samsung continuously reduced the prices of its old phones to stay in the market and developed new models to replace the old ones.In contrast Apple used the strategy of single-product explosions launching only two or three new phones each year. Apple’s general headquarters was situated in the United States. It focused on design and development of its products purchased raw materials and components from more than 500 enterprises in 31 different countries and completed the assembly process in Foxconn China. The products were then delivered by air transport to various distribution centres around the world. After new products were released at a convention Apple’s iPhones were sold through individual retail traders mass retail traders operators and Apple stores. The relatively high price of iPhones and their consistent popularity around the world brought tremendous profits for Apple.The Internationalization of Chinese Smartphone BrandsThe first Chinese smartphone brands that tried to internationalize were Huawei and ZTE Corporation. They established good business relationships with foreign operators by providing telecommunications infrastructure or producing phones for them. Those foreign operators had abundant users channels and resources which provided Chinese brands with many advantages in broadening their markets. Lenovo accelerated its internationalization in smartphones by purchasing Motorola Inc. for US$2.9 billion. Lenovo acquired 2000 patent rights owned by Motorola and enjoyed 16000 patents owned by Google in addition to acquiring Motorola’s mobile brand trademark portfolios and corporate relationships with more than 50 operators around the world. Coolpad Group Limited (Coolpad) increased its core competitive power by establishing research centres in the United States and India. Coolpad’s dual-SIM dual-standby phone had a leading edge in the smartphone business as a result of its communication-based technology dual system phone security user interface (UI) design and mobile Internet services. Gionee increased its brand popularity by sponsoring the Kolkata Knight Riders a celebrity-owned cricket team that played in the Indian Premier League and establishing and funding a charity that supported under-privileged children diagnosed with leukemia. Arvind Vohra CEO and managing director of Gionee India led Gionee in signing contracts with 10 agencies and developing 35000 Gionee retail stores in India. OnePlus had targeted global markets since its inception. Its invitation system of marketing (similar to that used by Google Glass) delivered OnePlus phones to markets in 17 countries including the United States Great Britain France Germany Italy and India.Xiaomi’s internationalization practiceInternationalization as Both a Dream and a GoalAlthough China was becoming the world’s most influential smartphone market the Chinese market was becoming saturated. China had been in a period of high-speed development of smartphones since 2010. Smartphone shipments grew by 100 per cent each year for the next three years but in 2013 the smartphone market began to decline dramatically. At the end of 2015 the number of phone users in China had reached 1.32 billion about 95 per cent of China’s population. There was almost no room left for the market to grow. With the need for phone replacements decreasing the development of smartphones entered a passive state. The phone business had already completed its regeneration and upgraded at an accelerated speed; the transformation from functional phone to smartphone was basically completed. In the future the development of the smartphone business could only rely on upgrades or regeneration of smartphones.As a result of a gradually saturated market the battle among Chinese smartphone brands was becoming more and more fierce. Many of the vendors who lacked brand popularity innovative power core patents and government allowances were eliminated from the market. Companies like Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp. (LeEco) Meizu Technology Co. Ltd. Coolpad and Lenovo followed Xiaomi by offering similar products at the same price quality and functionality. They came out with good phones at attractive prices which in turn slowly weakened Xiaomi’s competitive power. Xiaomi had captured as much of the market as it could. Xiaomi’s total phone shipments in 2015 did not achieve the company’s target; only 70.8 million Xiaomi phones were sold in that year. That was an increase of 22.8 per cent from 2014 but the year-on-year growth rate in 2014 was 227 per cent. In addition Xiaomi’s relatively low average price and extremely low profit margin had already put Xiaomi in a critical situation. According to a survey completed by International Data Corporation (IDC) the average selling price of a Xiaomi phone in China was US$141 in 2015 while the average selling price of phones produced by Huawei OPPO Electronics Corp. and Vivo Communication Technology Ltd. was US$213 US$231 and US$208 respectively. Considering that the market situation for Xiaomi was alarming and its profit insufficient to support the corporation itself Lei intended to enter the international market rapidly to accelerate Xiaomi’s development and accomplish his dream of internationalization.Xiaomi’s Internationalization TeamIn order to enter the overseas markets Xiaomi initially formed an international management team. In addition to Xiaomi’s eight founders Xiaomi welcomed seven team members with senior work experience in well-known international companies such as Google Tencent and Qualcomm. The team had four foreigners and six people from China returning from overseas work (see Exhibit 2).Xiaomi in Hong Kong and TaiwanBecause Hong Kong and Taiwan were physically close to Mainland China and their systems cultures and commercial traditions were almost identical to that of Mainland China Bin Lin Xiaomi’s international affairs manager targeted the “circle of Chinese culture” markets as Xiaomi’s first overseas attempt. In April 2013 Xiaomi officially initiated its internationalization process.At first Xiaomi tried to sell its products through e-commerce platforms in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong users could buy Xiaomi phones from the Xiaomi website using PayPal for payment. The phones were delivered from Shenzhen to Hong Kong within three days by S.F. Express Inc. Taiwanese consumers could buy Xiaomi phones from the Xiaomi website paying with eATM (a process similar to electronic banking) credit card PayPal or 7-Eleven Bill Pay. At first the delivery process to Taiwan was similar to that for Hong Kong. Later Xiaomi established its own warehouse in Taiwan and goods were delivered by T-Cat Express Delivery Service from the warehouse to anywhere in Taiwan (with the exception of some remote areas) within 24 hours.In addition to promoting phones on its own website Xiaomi also collaborated with local operators and e-commerce platforms. Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited was the first dealer to carry Xiaomi phones in Hong Kong. Consumers could purchase Xiaomi phones from Hong Kong Telecom by Internet or telephone order or in an offline store. In Taiwan Xiaomi first collaborated with FarEasTone Telecommunications. In Taipei Gaoxiong and Yilan advertisements for contract-free Xiaomi phones were on almost every taxi. Xiaomi next established collaborative relationships with Chunghwa Telecom Taiwan Star Telecom and the biggest electronic platform in Taiwan PChome Online Inc.In order to provide better services and communicate with users Xiaomi opened its MIUI forum and Facebook account for Xiaomi fans in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Moreover Xiaomi organized many kinds of offline activities to interact with users. To improve users’ experience Xiaomi was planning to build “Xiaomi homes” and “Xiaomi smart appliance experience halls” in Hong Kong and Taiwan.Xiaomi in India and Southeast AsiaAfter gaining some experience in Hong Kong and Taiwan Xiaomi made plans to enter larger markets. After a comprehensive evaluation three factors emerged for the choice of new markets: the proportion of young people in the population a fast-growing period of e-commerce and operators’ relatively weak control over phone-selling channels. Lin decided to focus on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets first.In 2014 Xiaomi started to sell its phones and smart hardware in Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Thailand the Philippines and India. First Xiaomi launched its official website in these countries and partnered with local e-commerce platforms. For example Xiaomi initially signed up exclusively with Flipkart which was the biggest e-commerce platform in India and then established strategic relationships with two major e-commerce platforms Amazon.com Inc. and Snapdeal. Second Xiaomi established an overseas service team and outsourced after-sales services to local companies. For instance after-sales service in India was outsourced to GadgetWood eServices Pvt. Ltd. Third after considering the underdeveloped logistics and payment systems Xiaomi reached an agreement with electronic commercial platform Lazada Group to sell Xiaomi phones in the Philippines Indonesia and Malaysia. Lazada built a giant warehouse for Xiaomi in those countries and established internal transportation teams to deliver Xiaomi phones to the consumers the very next day. The popularity of credit cards in Southeast Asia was comparatively low so Lazada allowed its consumers to use electronic bank payments cash on delivery and other modes of payment. Moreover Lazada provided customer services in the local language.In India Xiaomi not only tried to promote its smartphones by using full-page newspaper advertisements but it also organized large “Xiaomi fan festivals.” Xiaomi attracted more people to take advantage of time-limited and quantity-limited discounts on different products. At the Xiaomi 4i release convention in New Delhi for the first time Lei greeted his Indian Xiaomi fans by repeating the same words in his imperfect English with a heavy Hubei accent: “Are you OK?” A video clip of the greeting was adapted into many different versions and went viral on the Internet—a perfect viral marketing campaign for Xiaomi.Permeating Other MarketsIn 2015 Xiaomi continued to explore the overseas markets but cautiously; the progress decelerated. On February 12 2015 Xiaomi held a low-key meeting with U.S. press at the W San Francisco Hotel but Xiaomi only opened its smart hardware—including the power bank Mi band and in-ear headphones—for sale in the United States. All products were to be delivered from China to U.S. consumers within seven working days if possible. There was no free delivery service (the cost of delivery was US$5 plus US$10 for every 500 grams) and custom duties were to be paid by the consumer. After three months Xiaomi released its products in the United Kingdom Germany and France. The product type and the mode of sales deliveries and payments were similar to those employed in the United States. On June 30 2015 Xiaomi held a grand launch ceremony in São Paulo Brazil and presented a series of products including the Redmi 2 smartphone to Brazilian consumers. In September 2015 Xiaomi reached an agreement with Mobile in Africa (MIA) Group to provide selling marketing and after-sale service in 50 countries in sub-Saharan Africa before the end of 2015. Xiaomi’s first release in Africa was limited to the Redmi 2 and Xiaomi Mi 4 smartphones available in South Africa Kenya and Nigeria.Xiaomi’s internationalization dilemmaTrust CrisisXiaomi held three Internet purchasing activities in Taiwan in December 2013—flash sales that offered a specified number of phones (10000 10000 and 8000 respectively) at a discounted price. The marketing known as “hunger marketing” was meant to use a fast sell-out to enhance the perceived popularity and value of the phones. According to Xiaomi each purchasing event sold out in minutes: 9 minutes and 50 seconds for the first event 1 minute and 8 seconds for the second and 25 seconds for the third. Xiaomi claimed that a total of 28000 phones were sold over the three events. After receiving complaints from the public the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission investigated. According to the Commission Xiaomi sold a total of 26220 units online not the 28000 claimed. Xiaomi therefore closed the online sales when there were still phones available violating Taiwan’s Fair Trade Act. An additional 1750 phones had been reserved for certain qualified buyers but this information was not included in Xiaomi’s advertising. The Commission concluded that Xiaomi cheated 30 customers of purchases and made “a false untrue and misleading representation with regard to quantity of product when conducting online sales promotion activities.” At its meeting on July 30 2014 the Commission passed a resolution fining Xiaomi NT$600000 (US$20000).Product Patent DeficiencyTelecommunications equipment vendor Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson (Ericsson) filed a suit against Xiaomi in the High Court of Delhi in December 2014. Ericsson claimed that Xiaomi had violated Ericsson’s patent for a telecommunications technique. Ericsson tried over three years to initiate negotiations authorizing Xiaomi to use the technique but Xiaomi never responded to the proposal. So Ericsson sued Xiaomi hoping for a complete ban on Xiaomi phones in India. On December 11 2014 the court granted Ericsson an injunction barring Xiaomi from importing and selling phones in India until the dispute could be resolved. The court sent supervisors to Xiaomi’s offices in India to oversee Xiaomi’s compliance with the injunction. The result was that Xiaomi’s single-quarter sales in India dropped dramatically by 46 per cent. Xiaomi appealed the injunction pointing out that some of its phones were made with another company’s chips. The court narrowed the ban prohibiting Xiaomi from importing or selling only phones that contained components related to the dispute with Ericsson. Xiaomi could continue to import and sell phones with Qualcomm chips in India.Since Xiaomi’s first patent application in December 2010 Xiaomi submitted a total of 6773 patent applications. As compared to Ericsson’s and Apple’s patent holdings there was still a long way for Xiaomi to go but research and development required a large research staff and huge financial resources. Moreover the periods of research and patent issuance were relatively long. It was extremely difficult for Xiaomi to surpass the super patent giants. This problem restricted overseas sales of Xiaomi phones for a long time.Unsatisfactory SalesXiaomi’s overseas sales through the Xiaomi website and collaborative e-commerce platforms were constantly unsatisfactory; Xiaomi had to seek help from local operators and dealers. Because India was Xiaomi’s most important overseas market the company pursued agreements with telecom operator Bharti Airtel and smartphone store chain brand The MobileStore Limited which had over 800 offline stores in India. But the effects were still unsatisfactory. Xiaomi consistently refused to publish its total overseas sales numbers but a comparison of two IDC surveys that include Xiaomi’s overseas sales shows that Xiaomi’s overseas shipment in 2015 totalled 5.9 million phones which was only 8.33 per cent of the total Chinese overseas smartphone sales. In the same period Huawei sold 43.7 million phones accounting for 41 per cent of the total Chinese overseas smartphone sales (see Exhibit 3).According to the Wall Street Journal Xiaomi’s market shares in other countries in 2014 were 16 per cent in Singapore 7.6 per cent in Taiwan 6.7 per cent in Hong Kong 4.4 per cent in Malaysia 1.6 per cent in India 0.7 per cent in Indonesia and 0.3 per cent in the Philippines. In India for example Xiaomi only sold three million phones in a year compared to India’s yearly total smartphone sales of 80–100 million. Xiaomi’s market share was very small behind Samsung’s 23 per cent and Micromax’s 17 per cent. Moreover more and more Chinese smartphone brands were entering the Indian market putting tremendous pressure on Xiaomi.Jun Lei’s ConcernsLei’s disappointment was obvious when he finished his speech at the annual meeting. His dream was becoming more and more difficult to pursue. Lei reached out to co-founder Wanqiang Li asking him to return to Xiaomi. In 2011 Li had been responsible for the formation of Xiaomi’s web operations marketing service business logistics and other businesses. But in October 2014 Li had suddenly announced his resignation; he wanted to build new products in Silicon Valley for a period of time. Li suggested to Lei two strategies: (1) Seek offline partners and establish an international strategic alliance. Offline partners could provide more channels to Xiaomi and the partners could share the risk of expanding into overseas markets. (2) Develop MIUI and its peripheral smart hardware allowing Xiaomi to pursue a new market share and reduce patent disputes.Which strategy should Lei choose or was there a better way?Exhibit 1: Financing of Beijing Xiaomi Technology Co.

Adopting unique business practices such as using old aircraft paying labour with hourly wages rather than salaries and unbundling airline fees it grew from just one aircraft in 1998 to 84 aircraft by the end of 2016 targeting primarily 19 tourist destinations and 92 under-served cities (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Furthermore the base fares of Allegiant were not only the lowest in the industry but also half the price of the round-trip fares provided by any other low-cost domestic airline in the United States. In addition Allegiant offered the convenience of nonstop flights to vacation destinations across the United States. Further it created value for leisure travellers by providing complete travel solutions at affordable prices: it partnered directly with hotels and car rentals to provide complete low-cost vacation packages to consumers. Consequently for 53 consecutive quarters until March 31 2016 Allegiant reported no losses. Allegiant also received various awards. In 2010 it was recognized as the best low-cost airline by Aviation Week. Furthermore Forbes named Allegiant one of America’s best small companies for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012. However by 2014 customer complaints were also highest for Allegiant among all budget airlines. In 2015 it was one of the lowest scorers on the customer satisfaction index among all major U.S. airlines (see Exhibit 3). After September 2015 other problems arose with Allegiant such as delayed and cancelled flights several emergency landings labour issues and pilot strikes. Even though Allegiant started taking corrective actions by July 2016—for example raising pay for pilots and buying new aircraft—the company’s fast pace of profitable growth and low customer satisfaction continued to puzzle the entire U.S. airline industry. What was so unique about Allegiant’s strategies that it could offer the lowest possible airfares and also become a profitable airline while competitors were struggling to earn good margins? How did Allegiant remain so profitable despite such poor customer satisfaction scores? Further would it be able to sustain its profitability in the long run?COMPANY BACKGROUNDAllegiant was founded in 1997 by Mitch Allee Jim Patterson and Captain David Beadle. However Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. who was previously associated with ValuJet Airlines (ValuJet) and West Air Co. Ltd. and was also one of the largest creditors and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Allegiant gained control of the airline in December 2000 immediately after Allegiant filed for bankruptcy. Immediately after taking control he looked for low-cost strategies to build Allegiant’s revenue. Gallagher decided to “. . . go where they ain’t” and therefore targeted markets like leisure travellers who were not served by larger commercial carriers. Allegiant therefore launched its services in smaller towns or cities such as Colorado Springs Colorado; Casper Wyoming; and Appleton Wisconsin as these cities did not have the population base to support regular airline service. In March 2002 the airline acquired its first MD-80 aircraft; these aircraft were old used and less fuel-efficient. Allegiant took on new destinations cautiously typically starting with a few flights per week and it did not sign any long-term agreements with airports. When Allegiant had enough travellers in a set timeframe it invested more in that destination; otherwise it left the market easily. By 2004 with this approach of cautious growth Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas its major hub. In 2006 it became a public limited company and was registered as Allegiant Travel Company. This company name signalled Allegiant’s intention to provide not only low-cost air travel but also overall economic vacation deals through partnerships with hotels car rentals and entertainment service providers. While other small airlines were selling their MD-80s to buy Boeing and Airbus aircraft Allegiant maintained its strategy of using old less fuel-efficient (but cheaper) MD-80s. In 2011 to further support its growth to additional cities it purchased 13 MD-80s from Scandinavian Airlines. By 2015 Allegiant had a fleet of 80 aircraft—of which 51 were MD-80s—and was flying to 88 destinations in the United States (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Allegiant’s unique initiatives resulted in high profitability profit margins and earnings per share all of which grew tremendously in 2011–2015 (see Exhibit 4). UNIQUE ELEMENTS OF ALLEGIANT’S STRATEGYFocusing on Untapped Consumer Segments Allegiant Airways did not focus on high-fare-paying business travellers the segment that was the emphasis of traditional commercial and some low-cost airlines. Allegiant was more interested in offering low-cost travel services to passengers who would have their Disney ticket in their back pocket and a sunscreen tube and bikini in their carry-on bag. It thus focused on cost-conscious leisure travellers residing in smaller cities with populations less than 900000 who wanted to fly to vacation destinations such as Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix Orlando or Honolulu (see Exhibit 5). Allegiant connected these travellers who would otherwise not fly to leisure destinations at costs as low as $200 for a round-trip journey. Competitive AdvantageAccording to Andrew Levy former president of Allegiant one advantage at Allegiant was that it was clear about its target passengers: “We’re not trying to be everything to everybody which is what the rest of the industry has always tried to do.” Further elaborating on Allegiant’s strategy Levy noted “We’re not taking share [from other airlines]. We’re stimulating new demand.” Before Allegiant these cost-conscious leisure travellers were not flying at all because traditional airlines considered smaller cities’ airports to be unprofitable.Consequently by June 2014 Allegiant had a monopoly over 90 per cent of the routes it was flying; only 10 per cent of its routes overlapped with other ultra-low-cost carriers and full-service carriers in the U.S. aviation industry. Furthermore its route economics were different from those for ultra-low-cost carriers because the company focused on leisure travel. For example Allegiant flew mainly during weekends and did not require quick turnaround time. Other ultra-low-cost airlines such as Spirit Airlines (Spirit) and Frontier Airlines (Frontier) had to focus on quick turnaround and flight frequency as they targeted both leisure and business travellers. However given that Allegiant primarily catered to smaller cities it had a low market share in the U.S. airline industry (see Exhibit 6).In 2014 when Allegiant explored launching international flights to vacation destinations in Mexico Canada and the Caribbean it clearly indicated that it would grow only to the extent it could manage operations profitably. According to Allegiant the firm could afford slow and manageable growth as it perceived no competition from other airlines given their non-overlapping airline routes.Unique Low-Cost InitiativesFleet and Frequency ManagementTo lower costs Allegiant did not purchase new aircraft. It purchased a fleet of MD-80s which in the airline industry were called the “jalopy of the skies.” These were typically old aircraft that were dumped by commercial airlines due to rising fuel prices. Although MD-80s were less fuel-efficient than other aircraft Allegiant still saw potential for cost saving: old MD-80s were available for $3 million whereas a new aircraft would have cost $1 billion. Further analysis by Allegiant indicated that MD-80s had plenty of reliable life as they were on average used for 34000 cycles whereas the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permitted up to 60000 cycles. Additionally Allegiant did not offer frequent flight services on a daily basis but rather offered more flights on weekends; it could follow this model because of its emphasis on tourism. Instead of offering three flights per day it served consumers just three days a week. Furthermore flight frequency even depended on the season since tourism was a seasonal business. For example in March 2013 the average aircraft utility was seven hours per day while in September it was four hours per day. Allegiant aircraft also did not require quick turnaround time due to the low frequency of use. With these measures in place even though MD-80s were older and less fuel-efficient aircraft they remained a good fit with Allegiant’s business model. Consequently the company’s return on investment and assets was one of the best in the industry (see Exhibit 6). Allegiant also had other cost-saving measures in place such as using airports in smaller cities. These airports charged lower landing fees and their security was relatively cheaper. For example in 2015 surcharges for the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport in Florida amounted to $1.60 per passenger whereas it was $5.50 per passenger for the larger Tampa International Airport Florida. In larger cities Allegiant used secondary airports and rather than maintaining permanent kiosks for tickets and other services it rented counters. Human Resource ManagementThe biggest overhead cost in the airline business after fuel costs was labour. To minimize this cost Allegiant relied more on variable pay proportionate to number of hours worked with some minimum basic pay. Furthermore Allegiant avoided the cost of overnight stays by staffing crews for full-day round trips. Consequently by 2015 Allegiant had one of the highest revenue per employee ratios in the industry due to labour productivity initiatives (see Exhibit 6). Allegiant’s low-cost philosophy was also reflected in its organizational culture. Even the CEO Gallagher did not have a private office or special parking space. He worked in the open with other employees. Conference meeting rooms were small. Top executives eschewed luxury cars; they did not wear expensive watches and shoes but opted instead for casual clothing. As one of the executives commented they believed in spending money on things that were important not for show.Frugal In-Flight ServiceAllegiant was also frugal with its in-flight services. Seat reclining options were removed in order to save weight and fuel expenses. Similarly seat pockets were removed to make the task of cleanup easier. Since serving hot beverages consumed more fuel and required maintenance such services were not offered even on a paid basis. It further saved costs by not providing amenities such as Wi-Fi.Revenue StrategyAllegiant did not consider itself an airline company only but rather a provider of complete travel solutions. As former president Levy commented “We do not view our business as [just] the transportation of people from point A to point B.” He further added “We view that as an important part of a broader relationship with our customers.” Since its target consumers were leisure travellers it partnered with several hotels car rental companies and entertainment event sponsors to make these services available at a lower cost. These agreements were essential to its business model: unlike other airlines Allegiant did not consider vacation packages to be secondary services but viewed selling these packages as important as selling air seats. Allegiant did not rely on third parties and had direct contact with more than 400 hotels; the hotel module was built into its reservation system. Allegiant promoted these hotels and third-party services heavily on its website. Revenue from non-fare services was $5.87 per passenger in 2009 and it increased to $41.20 in 2012. In 2014 Allegiant booked 595000 hotel nights and 844000 car rentals across various tourist destinations. Since 2011 earnings from such services represented one-third or more of the company’s total revenues (see Exhibit 4).Allegiant’s strategy also relied on reducing its base airfare. To do this the company unbundled all amenities that a full-service carrier or even a low-cost carrier would offer with charges included in the ticket price such as free carry-on baggage. Apart from the typical low-cost model Allegiant also charged fees on other elements of service. For example if a consumer purchased airline tickets with a credit card a processing fee of $8 was charged. Similarly if tickets were booked through call centres a $15 fee was charged. Even carry-on baggage was not free of cost.Focus on Customer Value CreationIn 2013 in collaboration with the consulting firm Heart+Mind Strategies Allegiant conducted a study to explore important factors consumers considered while availing vacation travel. The majority of the participants indicated that low fares and value for money were the most important factors. Further nine out of 10 travellers were willing to drive a little farther to secondary airports to use ultra-low-cost airlines. They further indicated their desire to give up basic amenities in return for lower base fares.Allegiant believed that it empowered their customers to choose the amenities they wanted and pay accordingly. Thus by lowering base fares and eliminating free amenities Allegiant believed it provided consumers with increased flexibility. Levy mentioned that customers trusted Allegiant for its outstanding value on flights. However as a travel company and not just an airline Allegiant wanted to provide customers with value in all aspects of travel. In 2010 Allegiant therefore updated its logo and debuted a new tag line “Travel is Our Deal” to reflect the exceptional travel deals that it provided. Allegiant promised that it had the lowest prices on air and hotel vacation packages and it further offered customers free round-trip tickets if they found a better deal somewhere else. Apart from low fares Allegiant also provided leisure travellers the convenience of nonstop flights. Thus a passenger could cover the distance between Peoria and Las Vegas in fewer than four hours at a price of $130 instead of the seven hours including layovers provided by other traditional airlines at a price of $320.Focusing on customer service Allegiant offered paperless mobile boarding pass capability to travellers in 2014. Allegiant specifically worked with small to mid-sized airports to introduce the technology. The self-service technology helped Allegiant further lower costs and pass on the benefits to consumers. In September 2016 Allegiant launched a co-branded Bank of America MasterCard. This was again unique because unlike business travellers leisure travellers travelled just once or twice a year. Thus frequent flyer reward points would not have been valuable to them. Those who used the co-branded card for an annual fee of $59 were given three points for spending on Allegiant two points for dining and one for other purchases on the card. One air ticket was made complimentary if the cardholder chose a four-day hotel package or car rental through Allegiant. All these value-adding initiatives resulted in more passengers using Allegiant thereby resulting in a high load factor (see Exhibit 7). Marketing and Promotion In 2010 Allegiant started focusing on social media and improved its website’s appearance. It launched a social media advertisement featuring employees who highlighted Allegiant’s commitment to offering the best travel deals for consumers.As Allegiant was expanding it also decided to improve its media presence dramatically. In August 2013 Allegiant launched its first national television advertising campaign. Since Allegiant was known for its ultra-low fares and exceptional value deals its first advertisement was called “Here Is the Deal with Free Sodas” which educated consumers about Allegiant’s approach to saving money for consumers. The advertisement explained how the free soda offered on other airlines was already included in a passenger’s ticket price but on Allegiant there were no such charges. The advertisement clearly conveyed the message “[Y]ou only pay for and get what you want.” As Allegiant continued its growth it launched a second set of national advertisements in 2015 with the slogan “Listen to Your Wallet.” In this campaign the objective was to differentiate Allegiant from other low-cost carriers and tell consumers that affordable travel was possible with Allegiant. Allegiant simultaneously released ads on social media sites such as YouTube Facebook and Twitter receiving positive comments from fans and followers. Additionally Allegiant’s popularity in small cities soared primarily through word of mouth. Whenever Allegiant added a new route or a new service it aimed to attract free publicity in local newspapers by sending Las Vegas showgirls to pose with airport directors. According to the company such stunts created sufficient buzz among potential travellers.Allegiant also promoted live shows which involved passenger participation and were held on their planes. In 2014 shows like “Game Plane” and “Antiques Roadshow” were shot entirely on their planes with cash prizes and trivia contests to entertain customers. According to Allegiant shooting game shows on the plane was appealing to passengers on board for vacations. In June 2013 Allegiant launched the “Dodge High Fares!” campaign which ran through July and August during the dodge ball season in the United States. The advertisements were broadcast on television radio and social media across 29 cities where dodge ball tournaments were held. As part of this campaign Allegiant also announced free round trips to contest winners. Allegiant realized that a potential set of Allegiant customers were also sports enthusiasts. Consequently in 2016 it partnered with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and announced that it would be the official passenger airline of NASCAR. Allegiant also reported its sponsorship of NASCAR for the next three years thus enhancing affordability and convenience of air service for NASCAR fans.Allegiant also engaged in community outreach as it expanded its business. In May 2012 Allegiant partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the United States providing $250000 worth of donated travel wish destinations. In addition Allegiant made cash donations of $150000. The relationship with the charity was depicted on its aircraft: newly acquired aircraft were painted with the name of the charity. Allegiant also contributed one dollar from every in-flight snack purchase to the charity. Similarly Allegiant worked with the Boys’ and Girls’ Club of Broward County surprising 100 students with free airfare as a reward for running fitness programs. In 2016 Allegiant launched promotional offers during the summer refunding $140000 worth of fares to randomly selected passengers.ISSUES FACING ALLEGIANTHuman Resource IssuesGradually several difficulties emerged at Allegiant. First it experienced staffing issues. Though Allegiant was a profitable airline pilots felt that they were underpaid. After three years of negotiation pilots decided to strike concerning this issue in 2011; however Allegiant managed to get a court ruling prohibiting them from striking. Nevertheless the issue reflected poorly on Allegiant’s performance and its stock price went down by 16 per cent. In the midst of this chaos many pilots also decided to resign. Between 2011 and 2014 their resignation rate increased by 600 per cent.Customer Service IssuesStaffing issues caused problems on the customer end as well. Customers often complained that flights were delayed and airline employees provided them with little information. As one customer stated “It was pretty apparent most of the staff is very inexperienced and they just don’t really know what they're doing.” Allegiant had on-time performance for only 76 per cent of its flights on its most busy 20 routes in the United States. At times passengers were also told that flights had to be cancelled either because pilots were overworked or because other crew were not available. A consumer watchdog forum commented that Allegiant’s tagline should have been “Travel is our deal but not on time.”Allegiant did offer some customer support by providing hotel accommodation when flights were significantly delayed. However this arrangement was available only to those who were staying farther than 50 miles from the airport of departure. Although consumers found value in flying with Allegiant the long flight delays bothered them. As one consumer noted “I had no problems with Allegiant. . . . Even after purchasing two checked bags I saved over $400 on my flight going back home. However I dislike having to worry about whether my flight will be delayed.” In fact these customer service issues have reflected poorly on Allegiant. Between January 2013 and July 2014 out of 15 carriers that served Cincinnati (one of the major hubs for Allegiant) Allegiant recorded the maximum number of customer complaints per 100000 customers (see Exhibit 8). Apart from being the most profitable airline it was also dubbed the most hated airline. Growth IssuesIn March 2016 Allegiant announced that it was adding three new cities and connecting them to 22 routes. Allegiant had already grown from 195 routes in 2012 to 296 routes in 2015 (see Exhibit 2). Allegiant’s goal was to expand 10–15 per cent each year to maintain pace with operational issues. However critics believed that Allegiant was showing signs of stress due to its uncontrollable growth. They drew parallels between Allegiant and ValuJet an upstart airline in the 1990s that Gallagher current CEO of Allegiant had helped co-found. Like Allegiant it grew quickly and faced similar problems of not having adequate personnel. Along with the decreasing life of Allegiant’s aircraft and its continued expansion Allegiant was also dealing with flight safety issues.Safety IssuesBetween September 2015 and January 2016 Allegiant experienced several emergency landings and delays caused mainly by mechanical issues. The Aviation Mechanics Coalition specifically documented 98 instances of maintenance issues during this five-month period 35 of which were related to engine function failures. What is known as catastrophic engine failure in the aviation industry was also reported twice in this time period. Instances of cabin pressurization and smoke problems were also reported. Pilots believed that Allegiant’s approach to maintenance was not up to industry standards and was dangerous. Allegiant was highly cost-conscious; consequently rather than employ its own maintenance crew it outsourced maintenance to third-party contractors who Allegiant pilots claimed were inexperienced in working on the aging MD-80s. Even Allegiant’s own mechanics mentioned that the culture at the firm was to “just move the metal” and push the aircraft to the next station. THE ROAD AHEADDespite all these issues in an industry where other airlines struggled to at least recover costs Allegiant’s earnings kept soaring (see Exhibit 4). By March 31 2016 it had reported profits for 53 consecutive quarters. In 2015 Allegiant’s profit increased by 154 per cent reaching a value of $220.4 million. Overall its profit margin was 15 per cent higher than that of traditional airlines. Allegiant’s profit sustainability index was found to be 8.8 mainly owing to labour productivity. In mid-2016 Allegiant was in the process of hiring new pilots raising their salaries and buying new aircraft. Nevertheless Spirit among others was competing closely with Allegiant by offering low base fares and flying some overlapping routes. For example in 2016 Spirit added to its portfolio new routes over which Allegiant previously had a monopoly such as routes from Akron Ohio to Fort Lauderdale Florida and from Akron Ohio to Myrtle Beach South Carolina. Expansion by another ultra-low-cost airline Frontier also resulted in route overlap with Allegiant such as from Cincinnati Ohio to Tampa Florida. Furthermore compared to Allegiant both Frontier and Spirit had more frequent flights on their overlapping routes.Allegiant might have had a cost advantage due to lower fuel prices (see Exhibit 9); however with rising wage and aircraft costs due to salary hikes and new aircraft purchases poor customer satisfaction scores and increasing competition how long would Allegiant be able to maintain its profitability?Exhibit 1: Total In-Service Aircraft and Average AgeSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 2: Leisure Destinations and Cities ServedSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Company 2014 Annual Report May 2015 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant  Travel Company 2013 Annual Report May 2014 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 3: Customer Satisfaction IndexSource: Developed by the authors based on information in Kathryn Vasel “Spirit Airlines Scores Dead Last in Customer Satisfaction” CNN Money April 26 2016 accessed August 24 2016 http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/26/pf/best-and-worst-airlines-customer-satisfaction/; “Benchmark by Industry: Airlines” American Customer Satisfaction Index accessed September 29 2016 http://theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=147&catid=&Itemid=212&i=Airlines.Exhibit 4: Financial Data (as of December 31 2015) Note: All data in $000s except for Total Ancillary Revenue as Percentage of Total Revenue Earnings Per Share and Operating Margin.Source: Developed by the authors based on information in Allegiant Travel Company Annual Report 2015 May 2016 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Travel Company 2014 Annual Report May 2015 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual; Allegiant Travel Company 2013 Annual Report May 2014 accessed October 4 2016 http://ir.allegiantair.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=197578&p=irol-reportsannual.Exhibit 5: Catchment Area of AllegiantSource: Developed by the authors based on information in “Allegiant: A Successful Niche Player with Wider Lessons for the World’s Airline Industry” CAPA: Centre for Aviation April 14 2014 accessed September 26 2016 http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/allegiant-a-successful-niche-player-with-wider-lessons-for-the-worlds-airline-industry-162353.Exhibit 6: Financial comparison with competitors (as of September 30 2016)Note: ROA = return on assets; ROI = return on investment.Source: Developed by the authors based on information in “Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT)” Yahoo!

The explosion that followed killed 47 people and destroyed half of the municipality’s downtown. At least 30 buildings were lost including the local library. More than 100 businesses were shuttered or displaced. At the time Canadian city planners and railway managers had just been given recommendations crafted by the Proximity Initiative a collaborative effort between the Railway Association of Canada (RAC) and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) intended to tackle so-called proximity-to-rail issues. These Guidelines for New Development in Proximity to Railway Operations (“Proximity to Rail”) included a call to further push development back from train tracks by setting new setback standards for building on private and public property in proximity-to-rail operations.Thanks to urban growth and railway expansion the need to better address the conflicting interests that existed between population centres and railway operations—ranging from noise and vibrations to blocked roads and public safety—had been on the rise for decades. The Lac-Mégantic tragedy galvanized this need. In early 2015 Montreal made headlines by becoming the first major Canadian city to adopt the Proximity Initiative’s guidelines. Around the same time Calgary City Manager Jeff Fielding sat in his office contemplating staff recommendations that essentially favoured following Montreal’s lead. Calgary and the province of Alberta had recently been affected by several disasters including a historic flood in the city and throughout southern Alberta in 2013 and a significant wildfire in northern Alberta in 2011. The City of Calgary was lauded for its response coordination and recovery activities in these disasters. Years of intentional investment in comprehensive emergency management—preparedness mitigation response and recovery—had proven indispensable as these disasters hit the city and province. These disaster preparedness practices ensured comprehensive land use planning decisions that included life safety considerations such as first response access economic diversification resulting from a wide economic base and the pursuit of a vital and sustainable community. Looking out at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) line that ran through the downtown core of his city a community built on the historic contributions of rail oil and agriculture Fielding understood the controversy that would be generated by imposing the Proximity to Rail guidelines in his municipality. There had to be a better approach more suited to Calgary’s specific context.Calgary’s Centre City or downtown was the business and cultural heart of the city. The Municipal Development Plan identified a goal to accommodate 232000 jobs and 70000 people in the downtown within the next 60 years. Founded on the principles of sustainable development and guided by a philosophy of fiscal responsibility and managed growth these densification goals required city planners to provide “leadership on growth and change within a strategic framework that achieves the best possible social environmental and economic outcomes while operating within the City’s financial capacity.” This was to be sought through purposeful and dense residential and commercial development. Fielding was interested in building stronger relationships with the community to attract development and retain investment in the City. Implementing the Proximity Initiative’s guidelines while intended to limit potential safety risks in the case of a derailment or volume release would simultaneously limit urban development opportunities particularly within the downtown. The guidelines were not standards required by law nor were the guidelines developed with significant and relevant contribution by the City of Calgary. The guidelines did not consider balancing public safety with the economic diversification specific to Calgary’s context. Fielding concluded “We would have to think harder about a solution for Calgary.”RISK ASSESSMENTThe Proximity Initiative was created to help RAC and FCM members address conflicting interests including the transport of dangerous goods via rail through population centres. The Proximity to Rail guidelines were created to help municipal and provincial governments mitigate the effects of having new development in proximity-to-railway operations. The report strongly recommended municipalities take a proactive approach to identifying and planning for potential conflicts between rail operations and new development in proximity-to-rail corridors. The report emphasized the urbanization of cities the interest of municipalities to curb urban sprawl the demand for new forms of residential properties and the conversion of commercial and industrial properties in proximity-to-rail locations to residential uses. The guidelines were specifically not intended to be applied to locations where proximity issues already existed as these had to be addressed on a site-specific basis. The tabled guidelines however required no significant adjustment to railway operations while asking municipalities to accept the potential loss of development options along rail corridors. And while the proposed setbacks could limit the damage of a common derailment or volume release the guidelines would not appreciably limit the risk of catastrophic rail accidents. Risk in a municipal context was generally assessed on its likelihood or probability—how realistic it was for risk to occur in relation to other contributing factors—and according to its impact—what the effects of the risk would be on life safety property the environment and the economy. The probability of a catastrophic rail event was low relative to other major events and catastrophes that Calgary could face. However the impact of a train derailment or volume loss on life safety property protection and environmental preservation was understood to be potentially significant. A derailment was not out of the range of possibilities—for example during the 2013 flood event a rail car derailment occurred that could have resulted in a threat to life safety and brought about severe environmental consequences. However the City of Calgary and external partners including the rail industry had trained and exercised for exactly such an event and they were able to mitigate the impact of the derailment during an exceptionally trying time—in the midst of a disastrous flood event. Meanwhile the effects of imposing the Proximity to Rail guidelines within the city’s downtown core presented a real threat to economic and environment vitality.Fielding was certain that following the guidelines would limit development opportunities particularly within the downtown core while doing little to lower the risk of train derailment or reduce the amount of hazardous materials travelling through Calgary. He believed that to address proximity in what he considered a responsible manner Calgary needed a different approach. The approach had to recognize the value of the rail industry to Calgary and influence the RAC to bear a share of the responsibility associated with conducting its operations in a heavily populated area. Additionally the approach should refrain from creating additional development industry pressures not grounded in defensible risk reduction and should avoid losing the confidence and trust of the city’s planning and emergency response staff who had worked hard on preparing recommendations that aligned with the guidelines suggested by the FCM. Importantly Fielding was not willing to sacrifice public safety to support real estate values and land development opportunities. “As city manager and a member of the Canadian Institute of Planners” Fielding said “I am responsible for upholding professional standards.”CALGARY’S STEEL SPINECalgary lands were originally inhabited more than 8000 years ago by the First Nations people and were called Moh’kinsstis the traditional territory of the Blackfoot people. Calgary owed its name to Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who saw the local landscape and rivers as an ideal location to build a fort. Known as “The Elbow” or “Bow River Fort” the police detachment was later briefly dubbed “Brisebois” by Inspector A.E. Brisebois. This did not impress Colonel James Macleod who preferred Calgary the name of his home in the Scottish Highlands. However although the fort gave Calgary its name it did not spawn the city. Calgary had become what it was now because of its steel spine. In 1883 the arrival of the CP railway facilitated travel across Alberta which led waves of pioneer ranchers from across the world to settle near the fort. With a population of 4000 Calgary was officially proclaimed a city in 1884. Ever since the railway had played a major role in local development.At one point CP owned most of Calgary’s downtown where the signature street was named after the company’s first president Lord Mount Stephen. The Calgary Tower was funded by a CP subsidiary in 1968. The community of Mount Royal was built to house CP executives. The city’s grid and streetcar routes were designed to transport rail workers to the company’s Ogden Yard which opened in 1912 when CP was the largest employer in Calgary. As the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) put it in a special report on the city’s development “The CPR has shaped Calgary’s evolution more than any other corporation over the past 100 years. Some might even say Calgary’s entrepreneurial spirit is a legacy from the CP’s pioneer vision of building a transcontinental railway more than 100 years ago.” With its head office in Calgary CP remained a major employer and taxpayer in the city of 1.3 million. There were 158 kilometres of rail lines in Calgary of which 7 per cent ran through the downtown core all at grade level.Thanks to urban expansion the relationship between Calgary and its steel spine had never been closer. In 2004 a team of city planners and community members offered a variety of competing ideas to transform the city’s “Midtown” district most of which involved moving rail operations. According to media reports the cost of these ideas proved prohibitive partly because “CP’s position was [that] somebody else would have to pay for all the relocation cost and they would still retain ownership of the land.” This focused ideas on redeveloping land near existing tracks. As the CBC noted in a special report on the City’s changing relationship with rail operations downtown land in close proximity to rail that was once mostly surface parking lots had in recent years “become construction sites for major new offices hotels condos and museums.” The National Music Centre for example was built on a formerly barren surface parking lot across from rail tracks. Even CP had redeveloped property in close proximity-to-rail operations transforming Ogden Yard into a head office campus.Simply put Calgary’s long-range planning goals had long been entwined with the CP operations that literally run through the heart of the city. These operations created the potential for more adverse effects for Calgary from any implementation of the new proximity guidelines than for its municipal peers. The period of economic success that preceded the oil market crash saw Calgary experiencing long-awaited development interest and permit submissions within the Centre City including some properties along the rail lines. With the economic downturn however these permits were at risk of being withdrawn. As a result railway setback guidelines had to be considered in the context of the additional development pressures they represented for Calgary during changing economic conditions. DERAILED COLLABORATIONIn 2003 the FCM and the RAC signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a solution that could be commonly applied in a fair way “to mitigate the impacts of locating new development in proximity-to-railway operations.” The FCM–RAC Proximity Initiative Steering Committee was established in 2004 with an equal number of FCM officials and senior RAC railway representatives as well as members of the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators and observers from Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Agency. In 2013 after almost a decade of collaboration on the issue new guidelines were released to assist municipal governments and railways in reviewing and determining general planning policies and provisions for the conversion of land in proximity-to-rail operations.The stated objective was to ensure quality of life by mitigating railway-oriented effects such as noise vibrations and safety hazards. The tabled guidelines included six primary recommendations (see Exhibit 1) primarily intended for new residential development. The most contentious for Calgary was the call to establish the following new setback standards for building on private and public property in proximity-to-rail operations. Freight Rail Yard: 300 metresPrincipal Main Line: 30 metresSecondary Main Line: 30 metresPrincipal Branch Line: 15 metresSecondary Branch Line: 15 metresSpur Line: 15 metresMeasured from railway property lines instead of tracks these recommended setbacks would obviously allow railway managers to breathe easier by providing an additional buffer zone on municipal land expanding the distance between communities and rail corridors and freight yards permitting the dissipation of rail-oriented emissions vibrations and noise. They further served railways by pushing urban development back potentially limiting disaster-related costs and damages. But while setbacks served the interest of railways they wiped out development opportunities near rail operations while doing nothing to prevent rail incidents or events. “The proposed common guidelines” Fielding noted “mitigate impact not risk. They don’t reduce the chances of having derailments or explosions in my city caused by operator error travelling speeds failure of rail or track infrastructure or dangerous cargo.” While tasked with finding workable solutions that were fair to both urban development and railway operations the Proximity Initiative collaboration effort was challenged from the start by different needs conflicting agendas and uneven levels of influence.  Originally formed as The Canadian Railway War Board in 1917 to coordinate rail activities and ensure the efficient movement of troops and supplies during the First World War the RAC represented more than 50 freight and passenger railway companies that moved 75 million people and CA$250 billion worth of goods in Canada annually. Until 2000 the organization—formally incorporated in 1953—had dealt primarily with member services and operational issues at the national level as well as the coordination of standards on a continental basis. At the start of the new millennium however RAC received a new mandate which included public policy advocacy on behalf of its members who had a common interest in limiting regulations and cost increases related to proximity issues. The well-funded RAC railway industry organization was formed to protect the bottom line of its membership by opposing the “frenzied lobbying or exaggerated anecdotal complaints from interest groups” when fighting an earlier version of Bill C-52 An Act to Amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act. On the other side of the Proximity Initiative table was the FCM which counted about 2000 local governments across Canada as members representing 91 per cent of the Canadian population. Varying in size location and economic health each of these municipalities had unique challenges and interests especially when it came to proximity-to-rail issues. In a submission outlining its guidelines to the Canada Transportation Act Review the FCM–RAC Proximity Initiative argued its model of collaboration “demonstrates that municipalities railways and government can work together to improve rail safety.” At the time the proposed guidelines were widely supported by railways but had been adopted only by the cities of Windsor London Ottawa and Montreal. The federal government was therefore urged to work with provincial governments which held land planning jurisdiction to help advance common land use planning practices and avoid a city-by-city approach to proximity issues. In other words the people behind the new guidelines wanted to ensure rail interests were not affected by any municipality that considered the new guidelines a harder pill to swallow.MIXING SEMINAL MOMENTS WITH PUBLIC POLICY MAKINGThe magnitude of the Lac-Mégantic disaster—which was alleged to have been the result of a criminal failure to apply backup hand brakes on a train carrying dangerous materials and that was left unlocked and unattended on a main rail line up a hill next to a residential area—highlighted the need to ensure that railways did not unreasonably threaten public safety. In addition to killing dozens of people and causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage the oil train explosion—which could be seen from space—led to the evacuation of about 2000 people roughly a third of Lac-Mégantic’s population. Local land and waterways were contaminated. Family members of missing people were forced to provide DNA from belongings such as toothbrushes to help identify burned bodies at least in the cases where remains recovery was considered possible. As one disaster worker noted few people were wounded in the fire because “They’re all dead.”Following the incident the transport of dangerous cargo by rail became a political hot potato particularly in Canada where pipeline capacity did not meet the needs of an energy sector that served as an important economic pillar. This was amplified by increased media coverage of rail incidents and disasters and of political campaigning for the next federal election. On July 23 2013 Transport Canada issued an emergency directive that among other things required at least two people to operate trains carrying dangerous materials and prohibited the practice of leaving trains with dangerous materials parked unattended on main lines. In April 2014 the Canadian government ordered a phase-out or retrofit of older DOT-111 oil-by-rail cars.On February 20 2015 the federal government introduced the Safe and Accountable Rail Act. Amending the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act Bill C-52 strengthened the liability and compensation regime for federally regulated railway companies. It primarily aimed to establish minimum insurance levels for freight railway operations; to establish that a railway company “is liable without proof of fault or negligence for damages resulting from an accident involving crude oil; [to] increase the industry liability insurance coverage; and [to] establish a fund financed by levies on shippers to cover the damages resulting from a railway accident involving crude oil that exceed liability insurance coverage.”Bill C-52 was widely seen as sensible because Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway filed for protection from creditors following the Lac-Mégantic incident leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs and legal claims unpaid. The company’s insurance policy had a per-occurrence limit of just $25 million. But in March 2015 demand for regulatory action intensified after four North American oil-train events occurred in a matter of weeks. Noting the trains in question were travelling at moderate speeds and hauling CPC-1232 tanker cars which were supposed to be safer than the rail cars involved in Lac-Mégantic critics insisted much more needed to be done. As the CBC noted For some this raises questions about rail safety train speeds and length tanker-car standards and stabilizing the oil within the tankers. For others it means we should be talking about pipelines again. “Slowing down is one option” said Ian Naish a former director of rail and pipeline investigations at the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. “Shorter trains might be another option but that will cost money. And then dare I say it another option is pipelines or some other mode of transportation.”When it comes to pipelines versus rail it’s not comparing apples to apples. When a pipeline leaks more product is spilled but it’s not likely to explode. When an oil car derails there is a higher chance of loss of life or destruction of property but the spill is relatively contained. It really depends on what you’re worried about—cost CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions safety or the environment? “This is a discussion we absolutely need to have” said Michal Moore director of energy and environmental policy at the University of Calgary. “It needs to start with safety but also needs to consider what transfers and stores the highest volume of [oil] material at the lowest possible cost.”In April 2015 Federal Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced a 64-kilometre-per-hour speed limit on trains carrying dangerous goods through urban areas with a population of 100000. She also called for increased inspections of key routes used for transporting dangerous goods. At the time the Canadian National Railway (CN) and CP had already imposed a 56-kilometre-per-hour speed limit which was still twice the speed some critics considered safe.In July 2015 as ongoing cleanup operations in Lac-Mégantic were temporarily halted and church bells rang 47 times to mark the disaster’s anniversary federal opposition leaders attacked the ruling Conservative Party for failing to ensure Canadian communities were protected from rail operations. Claiming the Harper government was not doing enough then Liberal leader Justin Trudeau told the nation “Every possible precaution must be taken to ensure such an incident is never repeated.” Meanwhile Tom Mulcair leader at the time of the New Democrat Party (NDP) promised that an NDP government “would build a railway bypassing Lac-Mégantic which has already paid a high price in human lives.” Raitt defended the government. “Safety is Transport Canada’s top priority” she insisted. “And in the wake of the accident we took immediate concrete action to further protect Canadians and maintain the safety and integrity of the Canadian rail system.” In the aftermath of Lac-Mégantic politicians and industry leaders were pressured to do something—or appear to do something—to make the public safer. In this charged environment many lost sight of the fact that the new proximity guidelines would cost some municipalities a great deal while failing to address any of the issues that critics insisted needed to be addressed to reduce the risk of rail car derailments and/or explosions. These issues included train speeds train lengths car standards infrastructure maintenance and volatile cargo. The relatively low risk of a catastrophic accident posed to Canadian communities by well-managed railway operations was also lost in the heated public discussion. According to a government report on rail safety while the transport of regulated dangerous goods by CN and CP had increased by almost 60 per cent between 1997 and 2006 (in terms of thousands of freight cars moved and millions of revenue ton miles) reportable incidents involving regulated dangerous goods declined considerably. Furthermore while Canada had experienced rail disasters more deadly than the 2013 incident which put the spotlight on proximity issues Lac-Mégantic had been the worst since Confederation. The deadliest rail incident in Canadian history occurred in 1864 when a Grand Trunk train with more than 350 passengers flew off a raised bridge and plunged into the Rivière Richelieu near Mont-St-Hilaire Quebec killing an estimated 99 people. With 48000 kilometres of track Canada had one of the largest rail networks in the world. Nevertheless in the five-year period from 2010 to 2015 the nation experienced 20 train derailments significant enough to be reported in the media (see Exhibit 2). Fewer than 100 people were injured as a result of these incidents and 51 people killed including the 47 fatalities in Lac-Mégantic. Meanwhile the number of Canadian motor vehicle fatalities in 2013 alone was 1951 while the number of serious injuries caused by automobile mishaps topped 10000. In the 2010 to 2014 period there were more than 8000 Canadian fatalities and more than 45000 serious injuries due to automobile-related incidents. “Calgary” Fielding noted “probably faces more risk from tanker trucks on city streets than rail explosions.” Hazard identification and risk analysis had long been undertaken at the City of Calgary including the development of a principal corporate risk summary that included the analysis of natural human-caused economic social and environmental risks. An annual risk assessment was conducted by the director of Emergency Management and was integrated into this corporate risk summary. The City administration understood the importance of analyzing and preparing for the likelihood and impact of a derailment or mass volume release along the rail lines. The steps the City had been taking to mitigate rail risk included derailment exercises and training by emergency response personnel and emergency management partners land use policy collaborative planning and permit review and ongoing relationship development with the rail industry. Furthermore a quarter century ago as a condition of subdivision application approval the City of Calgary implemented a minimum 27.5-metre distance setback from the boundary of the railway right-of-way to the closest part of any habitable building in residential areas. This was with the intent of reducing proximity-to-rail risks.  In the midst of other cities adopting the guidelines and Calgary determining what to do with them two specific commercial and residential applications for development immediately adjacent to the rail lines were submitted to the City. As part of their applications the developers had been asked by the City to provide a risk assessment. Each developer used a separate methodology resulting in different risk results. From this and contextualized with the interests and objectives of the Municipal Development Plan it became evident there was a need for a consistent methodology and base line understanding of the risk probability and impact to life safety property protection and environmental preservation. In 2015 Progressive Conservative MPP (member of provincial parliament) Lisa Thompson whose Ontario riding included Walkerton held a press conference to warn policy makers about the tendency of tragic events to lead to solution-making for the sake of solution-making. Noting that the Walkerton tragedy had led to waves of costly regulations all designed to somehow ensure that an incident caused by neglecting to adhere to existing rules never happened again Thompson called on all politicians to look closely at the “ridiculousness of regulations” that followed Walkerton.Though not minimizing the primary importance of life safety for both response personnel and the public Fielding felt the same way about the new proximity guidelines based on the probability of a derailment or disaster and the management of that specific risk.  CHALLENGING CONVENTIONAL PRACTICEAs an experienced city manager Fielding was aware of rail safety issues when contemplating the dilemma he faced by raising his concerns over the new proximity-to-rail guidelines and challenging his staff to be comprehensive about defining and managing the risk. Prior to becoming the city manager for Calgary he had been the city manager for Burlington Ontario where three VIA Rail Canada employees were killed and dozens of passengers hospitalized after a train came off its tracks in 2012. Less than three months after the Lac-Mégantic incident several rail cars full of flammable liquids derailed in Calgary as a slow-moving train left CP’s Alyth Yard located just five kilometres east of the downtown core. But the new proximity guidelines had been issued months before Lac-Mégantic generated increased demand for regulatory actions to improve public safety. And Fielding could not help but notice that implementing them would not limit the risk of death and destruction caused by similar disasters. A 30-metre setback for example did not reduce the destruction caused when a “tsunami of fire” sparked by human negligence rolled through a populated area. That had been the situation in Lac-Mégantic where waves of spilled oil sparked a fire three times the height of downtown buildings generating heat two kilometres away. In some cases people were forced to jump from the upper floors of downtown buildings to escape the sea of fire that rolled into buildings and storm sewers and re-emerged as towering flames from chimneys and street manholes. The problem of course was that others did not see things the same way as Calgary’s city manager owing in part to the magnitude of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy. “I needed people to look at the probability and impact of the risk materializing—to consider many options that may not have been part of conventional thinking” Fielding noted. The City’s administration continued to work collaboratively with external stakeholders to find solutions to the fundamental issue: How would The City of Calgary support the continued development and economic value of lands in proximity to rail while protecting public safety and buildings? Fielding continued to put this in context with maintaining relationships to support a diversified economy accommodating growth within the major urban centre and retaining Calgary’s vision of being a “great place to make a living a great place to make a life.”EXHIBIT 1: PROXIMITY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONSPolicy Recommendation 1: Municipalities should establish minimum setback requirements through a zoning bylaw amendment.Policy Recommendation 2: Municipalities should consider amending their Official Plan or other appropriate legislation to require noise impact studies as part of any re-zoning or Official Plan amendment near railway operations.Policy Recommendation 3: Urban Design Guidelines for development near railway corridors would be a valuable tool in suggesting building layout and design. Alternatively municipal planners should pay close attention to these issues through a site planning process. Jurisdictions that do not allow comprehensive site planning may wish to consider amendments to their land use planning legislation. Comprehensive zoning for podiums would be a valuable tool for areas in proximity to railway operations that municipalities have identified for redevelopment. Urban Design Guidelines can also speak to appropriate built form including podium design setbacks step backs etc. At minimum municipal planners should secure podium massing as part of a site-specific zoning bylaw amendment. Balconies can be regulated through zoning if administered comprehensively and can be secured as part of a site-specific zoning bylaw. Urban Design Guidelines should also speak to appropriate balcony design (e.g. recessed versus protruding balconies). Urban Design Guidelines should contain comprehensive information on best practices for landscape design and appropriate types and species of plants. Urban Design Guidelines can speak to materiality. Some jurisdictions such as Ontario allow municipalities to regulate external materials through the site plan process. This practice should be encouraged and jurisdictions ",,,,,

The student was also given a list of eight of the country’s main industries. As an exercise the student was then asked to identify which company operated within which industry. The exercise would test the student’s understanding of how a company’s financial data can be specific to a particular industry. Using only financial figures could the student identify within which industry each company operated? Company and Industry CharacteristicsThe student knew that companies could be categorized in many different ways: financial non-financial manufacturing service and others. Financial characteristics of companies could vary widely for various reasons. However the most important differentiation for a company’s financial data was usually due to the industry within which it operated and the strategies the company adopted.Each industry also had its own characteristics some of which were obvious and could be easily identified. For example a pharmaceutical firm would normally have much higher research and development costs than a consulting firm. Other characteristics could be identified based on industry experience. For example companies in some industries carried high inventory whereas companies in other industries had essentially no inventory. Therefore it was feasible that a company could be identified through its financial statements or ratio analysis. The Eight CompaniesFor the exercise the student was provided with the balance sheets of all eight companies labelled only as A to H (see Exhibit 1). Because each company was listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange its financial data was publicly available. The data was also taken from the income statements of each company and provided in a standardized format (see Exhibit 2). In addition 13 relevant financial ratios were also provided to the student which would be helpful information for the exercise (see Exhibit 3).Companies that operated within the same industry could sometimes differ from each other based on their location structure or strategies. However the eight companies in the student’s assignment were considered typical companies that reflected their respective industry. Each company could therefore be seen as an example of that industry’s norm. The Eight IndustriesThe eight companies operated within eight different industry sectors in Pakistan. A brief description of each company and its industry was provided to help the student understand the characteristics of that particular industry:Commercial bank—Despite being a bank this company represented the most comparable financial statements and ratio categories of a non-financial company. It was one of Pakistan’s largest banks for Internet banking remittances MCB (or Master Cell Bank) mobile retail banking and bank accounts. The company was established in 1947 the same year that Pakistan was established. Its customer base exceeded seven million with over 1400 branches in Pakistan and abroad.Luxury hotel chain—This company managed six luxury hotels in major cities with a total of 1445 rooms and provided international standards in luxury hotel accommodation across South Asia.Hospital—This medical care centre was formed by a team of expatriate health care professionals in 1985. Its 550-bed quaternary health care facility offered international standards in major surgery to local and global patients.Food and beverage company—As a leading provider of quality foods and beverages in Pakistan with four major production facilities this company aimed to enhance quality of life for its customers and to contribute to a healthier future for the country.Oil and gas exploration service company—This company started as a pioneer of the natural gas industry and became a leader in the energy sector in the 1950s contributing 16 discoveries in exploration in just the previous five years. The company negotiates with owners of onshore and offshore acreage that is believed to contain oil and gas and secures leases and permission to drill.Textile composite exporter—This leading exporter of textile products had a composite unit that made everything from cotton to finished goods. It also had 40 retail stores across the country.Pharmaceutical firm—This science-led global health care company conducted research to develop and manufacture innovative pharmaceutical medicines vaccines and consumer health care products.Fertilizer company—As one of the biggest fertilizer companies operating in Pakistan since the 1950s the primary segments of this company included fertilizers crop science and agricultural services that covered a complete range of agriculture products to empower farmers. The company mainly sold its products through distributors.The student had all the information necessary for the exercise. The next step was to begin the process of analyzing the financial data provided for companies A to H (see Exhibits 1 to 3) and matching each one with the eight industries described above.

9B18M128,By Product IVEY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS FOUNDATION COPYRIGHT © NOTE 1: UNDERSTANDING THE CASE METHODA case or case study is a real business story that requires you to step into the role of a manager or a member of the management team that faces a dilemma or the role of a consultant assisting an organization that faces a dilemma. Acting in that role you are tasked with resolving the issues or problems that the profiled organization is facing at a particular moment in time. Alternatively you are asked to evaluate and choose among opportunities that exist for the organization at a specific point in time. Those issues and opportunities may be confined to a specific discipline in business such as accounting marketing human resources or strategic management. However the challenges often involve several disciplines reflecting the multi-faceted nature of business in practice.The case method involves learning by doing. It provides you with an opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to real-life and realistic situations. Listening to class lectures reading about various business subjects and performing quantitative and qualitative analyses to solve well-defined problems are all valuable learning tools; however management skills and knowledge cannot be developed by these methods alone. Management requires more than applying a storehouse of prepackaged solutions or standard answers. Each situation faced by management has its own variables unique to the situation. Using the case method provides you with valuable opportunities to develop and practise skills you will need in those situations.INTRODUCTION TO UNDERSTANDING THE CASE METHODThis note introduces you to the case method. It provides an overview of the steps used in case analysis and the types of case assignments you might encounter. It is designed to help you develop a basic understanding of the case method and to guide you in approaching your first few cases. Subsequent notes provide more detailed guidance about individual steps in the process.purpose of the case methodCase analysis is used as a teaching and learning tool to practise the art and science of management. The situations described in cases are less structured than the typical problems and questions found in most textbooks. There is not necessarily one right answer to resolving the issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) faced by the organization in the case. While some answers could be better than others there is no answer key at the back of the book to tell you whether you have made the right choices.The organization described in the case might be familiar to you and you might even be able to find out what the organization actually did in the situation described in the case; however the approach taken by the organization is not necessarily the one you should recommend. Also because cases describe relatively current or recent situations enough time might not have passed since the decision point in the case to allow you—or others in the business world—to evaluate whether the organization made the best possible choices. You are asked to draw your own conclusions and support them with your own analysis.Learning with the case method will help you develop essential management competencies skills and abilities. You will use technical analytical problem-solving and creative skills. You will hone your written and oral communication skills by writing reports participating in class discussions and making presentations. You will develop your ability to work effectively with others by preparing team case reports and presentations.Along the way you will learn about a wide variety of industries organizations and management issues.reading a caseBefore reading the case itself read the course requirements in the syllabus or on the course website. In addition to understanding the general purpose of the case method it helps to know what your instructor wants you to do with the case—prepare for a class answer questions perform a complete analysis prepare a written report or presentation or undertake some combination of those tasks.When you read the case for the first time resist the temptation to highlight important facts and to begin doing analysis and generating alternative solutions. If you use a highlighter on the first read you will soon find yourself highlighting most of the case especially in a short case that is rich in details. Instead during the initial read establish who the decision maker is and what decision needs to be made. Highlight any questions raised by the principal actors or characters: they usually indicate what work is expected (e.g. answers to specific questions specific types of analysis or evaluation of specific alternatives). Identify key goals of the organization industry key success factors (if they are made explicit) and important constraints (e.g. the urgency of a decision or the lack of resources or expertise). Develop a preliminary understanding of the issues facing the decision maker.Then read the case more carefully a second time. Armed with an initial understanding of the issues you are now prepared to assess the relevance and importance of specific case facts. Highlighting the case facts at this stage will help you to be able to quickly extract them and use them effectively in your analysis. During your second read of the case you can also gain a better understanding of the issues and begin to consider what analysis to perform with the case facts you have identified as relevant and important.Subsequent reads of the case will likely be confined to rereading specific sections of the case as you undertake the analysis described briefly in Section 3 and described in more detail in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054.analyzing a caseOver the course of your business studies you will face a variety of cases. Most of the cases will be in written format but cases can also be provided as videos. The length of cases will vary as will the breadth and complexity of issues they cover. As well some cases will direct and limit the scope of your analysis while other cases will pose general questions that require a more skilled approach to case analysis.Regardless of the size and scope of the case case analysis involves four basic steps:Identify the issues problems and opportunities.Analyze the issues problems and opportunities.Develop and evaluate alternative solutions.Make recommendations for action.Especially for complex cases a case analysis is usually an iterative process. While an essential first step is to identify the issues to be resolved analysis of those issues can refine the issues that were initially identified leading to a revised issue statement.scope of the case guide seriesThis note and others in the Case Guide Series are designed to provide an overview of the case method. They provide a general template or pattern for case analysis that you can apply in various courses throughout your business studies. There is no one right way to analyze a case just as there is no one right answer or solution to the issues presented in a case. You will encounter a variety of situations issues tasks and topics that all require you to use judgment in applying the guidelines provided in the Case Guide Series.The Case Guide Series covers five separate tasks that can form part of your case assignments.Case analysis: For all case assignments you will be required to analyze the case by performing one or more of the steps described in Section 3 (i.e. identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternatives and recommend a course of action). Analyze in the broad sense refers to the full process of applying the case method. Analyze can also specifically refer to the case analysis step of probing into and dissecting issues. In both contexts analysis is a critical component of the case method so it is discussed first and receives the most attention. (See Note 2—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054 and Note 7—“Common Tools for Case Analysis” No. 9B18M059.)Class discussion: In some courses instructors will use discussion of the case to apply and supplement the lecture material; in other courses instructors will use discussion of the case as the main pedagogical tool. To benefit from the discussion and to provide meaningful input it is important to adequately prepare. (See Note 3—“Preparing to Discuss a Case” No. 9B18M055.)Report writing: You could be asked to prepare a written case report—either individually or as part of a small team. For this task the emphasis is on organizing your analysis and findings in a written report that effectively communicates those findings to the reader. In most instances you will be asked to play a specific role (e.g. the internal manager who is the decision maker in the case or an external consultant to that decision maker) and to write a report to a specific reader or group of readers (e.g. the vice-president of marketing or the board of directors). (See Note 4—“Preparing a Written Case Report” No. 9B18M056.)Oral presentation: You could be asked to present your analysis and findings to the class either individually or as part of a small team. The goal in this exercise is to develop and deliver a concise presentation that captures the main thrusts of your analysis and presents them in a professional and engaging manner. Here too you will usually be asked to play a specific role and to present to a specific target audience. (See Note 5—“Making an Oral Case Presentation” No. 9B18M057.)Case exam: Your instructor might use the case method as a testing or examination tool. The goal in this situation is to showcase your analytical and writing skills under the time pressure of an exam setting. It will be important to read the case intentionally so that you can isolate relevant facts and data identify issues decide on the appropriate qualitative and quantitative analytical tools to use and perform the necessary analysis. Time management will be crucial so that you can complete all required steps including providing appropriate recommendations and a plan for their implementation. (See Note 6—“Preparing for and Writing a Case Exam” No. 9B18M058.)When completing any of the above tasks follow the specific instructions provided by your instructor in the course syllabus or course package. These specific instructions always supersede those contained in the Case Guide Series. Different instructors have differing expectations which is good practice for the workplace where you will need to give careful consideration to the preferences of your supervisor or client—in terms of both content and style.case analysis and academic integrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.NOTE 2: PERFORMING A CASE ANALYSISIntroduction to Performing a Case analysisFor all case assignments you will be required to analyze the case by performing one or more of the basic steps of analysis (i.e. identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative solutions and recommend a course of action). Analyze in the broad sense refers to the full process of applying the case method. Analyze can also specifically refer to the case analysis step of probing into and dissecting issues. In both contexts analysis is a critical component of the case method. This note of the Case Guide Series guides you through the specific process of analyzing a case. This method for basic case analysis can be used for several purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation and writing a case exam.identify the issuesThe first step in analyzing the case is to identify the organization’s issues problems and opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) that you will attempt to resolve. A clear understanding of the issues is paramount; otherwise your analysis and your generation of alternative solutions will lack the necessary focus. Although some cases will direct your attention toward specific issues (especially early in your business studies) a considerable degree of judgment is usually required to identify the issues.Pay Attention to QuestionsQuestions from three sources provide important clues about the key issues:The principal actors or characters in the case. These clues are musings or direct questions raised by the principal actors themselves. You can usually find these clues at the beginning and end of the case but they might also be sprinkled throughout the case. Your instructor. Questions can often be found in the syllabus or course package or on the course website. These questions are sometimes intended to limit your analysis to issues that fit within a specific topic of discussion. At other times these questions are intended to focus your attention on the most important issues.The author of the case. In cases presented in textbooks the case author sometimes provides attention-directing questions at the end of the case.If in your analysis of the case you have not answered all of the questions posed in the case or in your course syllabus you have likely either omitted an important issue or become sidetracked by minor issues. Moreover even if you have resolved some issues if you have not addressed all of the questions posed in the case or in your course syllabus your analysis will likely fail to totally satisfy your instructor—and later your supervisor or client. Especially in upper-level courses where the cases are in general more complex your instructor could expect you to look beyond the more obvious issues or those suggested by the case principals to consider issues that people close to the situation could have overlooked. You should address these supplementary issues in addition to not instead of addressing the specific requests posed by principals in the case or by your instructor.Distinguish Symptoms from IssuesTo correctly identify issues it is important to distinguish between symptoms and underlying causes. Your goal should be to focus on the underlying causes. To uncover them ask the question “Why?” until you can no longer provide a satisfactory answer.For instance an organization might be suffering from low productivity. Asking why productivity is low might lead you to conclude that employee morale is low and that employees are not motivated to perform well. Probing further you might find that both of these issues arise because the reward system does not adequately recognize good performance. Low productivity and employee morale are symptoms of the underlying cause.Alternatively an organization might be plagued by low customer retention. Asking why customers are going elsewhere might lead you to conclude that customer service is poor product defect rates are high existing competitors have improved their product and a new competitor has entered the market. The last two items are root causes because asking “why” will not lead to further answers. Therefore they are issues to resolve even though they are not within the organization’s control. Asking “why” for the first two items might lead you to the third issue namely that the company’s goals and reward systems emphasize efficiency rather than product quality. Limit Issues to a Manageable SetOnce you have identified the issues you might need to reduce them to a manageable size to enable you to effectively carry out the subsequent steps in case analysis. For some cases you might be required to resolve a single issue. However you should still identify sub-issues and decide which are most important and which you have the time and space to tackle. For example the issue might be to set an admission price for a new museum. Possible sub-issues to consider include fit with the mission of the museum customers’ ability and willingness to pay the possibility of differential pricing (e.g. lower rates for students) competing forms of entertainment and their admission prices costs that need to be covered by the admission price and the break-even point. To identify the most important sub-issues consider the information in the case the questions discussed in Section 2.1 and the nature of the course. Other cases might present multiple issues. You might find it helpful to look for relationships among the issues and cluster them under one overarching issue. For instance in an organizational behaviour case you might be able to trace several issues—such as unclear decision making processes inability to deal with job stresses and inability to delegate—to the root issue of inadequate training of managers. Dealing with one issue is easier than dealing with three separate issues and will lead to better solutions.Other cases might not have an overarching issue; instead you might face a seemingly unconnected set of distinct issues. You will then need to prioritize the issues using the questions referred to in Section 2.1 and your judgment so that you give adequate time and attention to the most important issues.Analyze the IssuesAnalysis involves examining the issues in detail. It requires that you dissect the issues and consider them closely to understand their nature and key elements.Use Case FactsOne aspect of analysis is using case facts to develop a detailed understanding of the issues. You can use the case facts to help build logical arguments develop findings and draw educated inferences rather than casual guesses. For instance if the issue in an organizational behaviour case is inadequate managerial training facts from the case should indicate that the training provided to managers did not sufficiently clarify decision making processes or how to delegate tasks or both. Or for a marketing case an issue with increased competition might be supported by the case facts describing the entrance of new competitors into the market new products introduced by competitors or price reductions offered by competitors.Many important case facts are contained in a case’s figures and exhibits. These case facts could include data about the worldwide market size the competition the company’s revenues and profit industry sales product prices or organizational charts. Study each figure or exhibit to determine the key insights it offers. Go beyond the specific facts highlighted in the body of the case; figures and exhibits usually include additional facts that can be interpreted in other ways to enhance your analysis. Use Business Concepts Models and ToolsAnother aspect of analysis is the use of business concepts models and tools to analyze the issues. For example in an organizational behaviour case you could use equity theory or expectancy theory to explain why an organization’s reward system has been unsuccessful in motivating employees. In a marketing case you could apply the model of a product life cycle or the concept of a target market; you could also calculate market share and changes in market share. To analyze issues in an accounting case you could use tools such as contribution margin analysis or capital budgeting. In an integrated strategic management case you might apply the concepts of value chain and competitive advantage compute financial ratios and apply tools such as a competitive position matrix and Porter’s five forces framework.You will sometimes be given directions to apply specific concepts or tools; other times you are expected to use your discretion in selecting the most relevant concepts or tools to apply. For some cases the analysis will largely rely on qualitative models and tools. However many cases will involve both qualitative and quantitative elements.Note 7 of the Case Guide Series—“Using Common Tools for Case Analysis” No. 9B18M059—describes some common qualitative and quantitative tools for analyzing issues and possible courses of action.Use Outside Research SparinglyAnalysis might also include conducting and integrating outside research—for example researching the industry and competitors—to supplement the information provided in the case. However for many cases you will encounter in your studies you will not be asked to obtain outside research beyond any background knowledge required to understand the facts of the case. This approach is consistent with the requirement that you put yourself in the role of either the manager or a member of the management team making the decision. You are asked to make that decision based on the same information the actual managers in the actual organization had at that actual point in time. Develop and Evaluate the AlternativesIn this step of a case analysis you first identify alternative solutions to address the issues you previously identified and analyzed and then evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. The best alternatives will resolve more than one of the identified issues.Develop Alternative SolutionsWhen identifying alternative solutions go beyond the status quo (which might or might not be a viable solution depending on the company’s situation) and beyond identifying a poor alternative and a very good one. Strive to develop multiple viable alternatives that are not chosen with a bias toward or against a particular course of action. Creative thinking will enable you to develop novel approaches. Avoid a premature evaluation of the alternatives and try to develop as many alternatives as possible.Even if you know the course of action the organization ultimately chose resist the temptation for that knowledge to bias your development and evaluation of alternatives. This topic is further discussed in Section 5.3.Evaluate the Alternative SolutionsAssessing the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative solution represents another form of analysis as is quantifying the financial impact of an alternative solution. Some of the case analysis tools described in Note 7 can be used to analyze alternative solutions in addition to being used to analyze issues.When you evaluate your alternatives present a balanced assessment of both the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons). Use of biased or one-sided arguments undermines both the usefulness of your analysis and its credibility. Where possible suggest how to overcome any significant disadvantages. If you have difficulty generating pros and cons establish a set of criteria for decision making and use those criteria to identify pros and cons. For example in a strategic management case decision criteria might include the degree to which the actionfits with the organization’s mission value proposition and goals;fits with stakeholder preferences;is profitable;increases market share;enhances the organization’s brand;capitalizes on specific external opportunities;helps to mitigate external threats;uses internal strengths;avoids or mitigates internal weaknesses; builds on an existing competitive advantage or helps to create a competitive advantage;requires additional resources and competencies;can be accomplished within the organization’s existing structure; ormitigates or increases risks including environmental and reputational risks. The principal in the case or the questions in your syllabus or course pack might have alerted you to some of the decision criteria to be applied. If so be sure to use those as your starting point in establishing a set of decision criteria. Measuring alternatives against decision criteria also helps to keep the analysis consistent reducing bias. For instance by applying the criteria you avoid citing a loss of market share as a disadvantage of one alternative but overlooking the same disadvantage in another alternative that is your implicit favourite.When identifying pros and cons be as specific as possible. For instance instead of stating that an alternative will be unprofitable indicate that the alternative will result in net losses of $72800 and $52500 in years one and two respectively. Instead of claiming that an alternative will increase market share indicate that it will increase market share by an estimated three to four per cent by year five. Rather than arguing that an alternative will capitalize on an organization’s strengths indicate the specific strengths that will be capitalized on and how they will be leveraged. When working with financial measures if you can incorporate all of the information about revenues and costs into a profitability measure it is unnecessary to then itemize individual revenues or expenses as pros and cons. Doing so would be redundant and is not nearly as valuable as doing the financial analysis required to determine profitability.Your evaluation of alternatives should also go beyond obvious disadvantages such as being “costly” or “time-consuming.” A costly alternative might still be highly advisable especially if it generates sufficient advantages. Almost all courses of action involve some cost and time so clearly distinguish how these factors vary from one alternative to the next and when possible provide evidence. For instance one potential product line might require a significant push by the sales department to make it successful whereas another might not require as much effort because it fits better with the organization’s existing product lines and target market.Once you begin to evaluate your alternatives you will probably be able to quickly discard a few alternatives after some preliminary analysis. For instance in a strategic management case one alternative could lie far outside the organization’s existing competencies and contradict one or more of the organization’s clearly stated goals. Discarding one or more unsuitable alternatives will allow you to focus your detailed analysis on the more feasible and more helpful alternatives. Nonetheless some preliminary analysis is important to ensure that you do not rule out options too quickly as a result of your own biases.It can sometimes seem expedient to group a few alternative solutions and evaluate them as a package. However evaluating combined alternatives can be difficult because each component usually has its own pros and cons. Also evaluating packaged alternative solutions often obscures some of the issues resulting in an evaluation that is less thorough than if each alternative had been evaluated separately. Therefore it is usually preferable to wait until the recommendation phase to combine alternatives.Use Case Facts and Business Concepts Models and Theories to Evaluate the AlternativesWhen evaluating alternative solutions you will have another opportunity to introduce key facts from the case and to apply concepts models and theories from the course to support your analysis. Some of those concepts and models will tie directly to the decision criteria referred to in Section 4.2.For instance in a strategic management case alternatives can be evaluated by assessing their fit with stakeholders’ preferences and by identifying resource gaps that would need to be filled to implement each option. In an organizational behaviour case if negative group norms are an issue you could use theory to propose ways to build positive norms such as rewarding desired behaviour and providing feedback about unacceptable behaviours. In a human resource case you could evaluate alternative ways to recruit new managers by considering the theoretical pros and cons of various recruitment techniques and assessing their prospects for success given the company’s specific needs and circumstances. In a finance case solutions could be evaluated against the company’s required rate of return or payback period. In a marketing case you could demonstrate how a proposed product is designed to meet the needs of the firm’s current target market or how its short development time would allow the firm to begin selling the product before its competitors do. The examples in the preceding paragraph illustrate that the evaluation of alternative solutions usually involves some additional analysis. The analysis of the issues and of the alternative solutions should fit together; the concepts models and theories used to analyze the issues should be consistent with those used to evaluate alternative solutions. The goal in both exercises is to provide analyses that demonstrate sound argument and logic and are supported by careful use of the case facts and appropriate analytical techniques (some of which are described in Note 7).RecommendationsApply Criteria for Making Sound RecommendationsThe last step of case analysis is to choose your recommended solution to the issues. Your recommended solution will often consist of a combination of alternatives because issues are usually not so simple that a single solution will suffice. Your goal is to develop recommendations that are useful given the issues that you are trying to resolve; consistent with your analysis; reasonable given the organization and its environment; feasible given the organization’s resources; and convincing to your reader. Articulate the decision criteria (e.g. those listed in Section 4.2) that you have established and applied in developing your recommendations. If the principal in the case has established the decision criteria your recommendations should explicitly address how your recommended solution meets those criteria.Craft Your RecommendationsYour recommendations should include sufficient operational-level details to enable their implementation. For example specify who should implement the recommendations how when and in what priority. You might want to develop a more complete implementation plan and attach it to your report as an appendix after briefly referring to the plan in the body of the report. This approach helps to build a convincing persuasive argument for your recommendations.If you are specifically asked to design a separate implementation plan your recommendations will be more general and the details regarding who how when and in what priority will be included in the implementation plan.Your recommendations should address all the issues you identified and should be both supported by and consistent with your analysis. Where appropriate demonstrate how and why your recommendations would be acceptable to key individuals in the organization. Ensure that the organization is financially able to implement the action plan and has the expertise time and other organizational resources necessary to do so.Base Your Recommendation on the Information You HaveAvoid recommending that further information be obtained or that additional analysis be completed. Instead base your recommendation on the information you have even if you believe more information is needed. Managers rarely have all of the information they desire. If further analysis is absolutely essential your recommendation should specifically state what should be done why and by whom.If the assigned case study is based on actual events you might already know the course of action that management chose or you might be able to obtain this information through further research. Resist the temptation to recommend this alternative which assumes that management made the best decision. Base your recommendation on the information that management had at the time it faced the decision and on the analysis that you conduct. Onl,,,,,
" time allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s actual chosen course of action. Even years later we might not know whether outcomes would have been better for the organization had another alternative been chosen.Evaluate Your RecommendationsBefore finalizing your recommendations take time to evaluate your recommended solution by asking the following key questions:Does the recommended solution address the issues identified in the analysis?Is there theoretical support for the solution?Does the recommendation address the pros and cons identified when you evaluated the alternative solution? Does the recommendation suggest how to mitigate or overcome the most critical disadvantages including any risks posed to the organization? Does the recommended solution meet organizational goals? Is the recommended solution financially viable? Is it feasible from a resource perspective?Is the recommended solution acceptable to various stakeholders of the organization (e.g. management employees shareholders and customers)?Does the recommendation provide sufficient details to enable the organization to implement it? Being able to answer these questions affirmatively will help your recommendations meet the key criteria of being useful consistent reasonable feasible and convincing.Variations on performing a Full Case AnalysisThe basic four steps (identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative solutions and recommend a course of action) are required for a full case analysis. This section discusses two variations to a full case analysis: analytical cases and partial case analysis.Analytical CasesSome cases might not describe the issues to be resolved but might instead describe issues either in the context of a success story or in a situation where it is too late to resolve the issues. In such cases the focus is on analyzing what can be learned from the organization’s successes or failures so that future prospects for success can be enhanced or similar predicaments can be avoided or better handled by either the organization in the case or others. Business concepts models and tools should still be applied. For example the leadership of an organization could be analyzed to identify which styles of leadership were evident and their effectiveness in the circumstances described in the case. Alternatively a corporate initiative might be analyzed to determine its effectiveness in addressing resistance to change and its application of other change management principles. Partial Case AnalysisDue to time or space constraints your instructor might require only a partial case analysis. For example you might be asked to focus only on identifying and analyzing the issues. Alternatively the case might clearly define the issues and you might be asked to only identify and evaluate possible alternative courses of action. Another form of partial case analysis is a “directed case” in which you are directed to answer a specific set of questions about the case.Even though a full case analysis might not be required it is still important to see how the task you are asked to perform fits within the larger picture of a full-fledged case analysis involving the four steps discussed above.NOTE 3: PREPARING TO DISCUSS A CASEIntroduction to Preparing to Discuss A Case in ClassThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note helps you to adequately prepare to discuss a case in class and to provide meaningful input to the class discussion. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific. Prepare before ClassTo benefit from many of the opportunities of the case method you need to do your own analysis before class and make your own decisions based on that analysis. Read the case once for familiarity and a second time to gain a full command of the facts so you have good insight into the issues. As you read the case the second time highlight the key points and make notes based on your assigned tasks. If questions about the case are provided in the course syllabus they are intended to be used only as guidelines to identify the issues and some of the analysis to be done. You are still required to come to your own conclusions regarding the issues and relevant analysis. In most instances you are expected to do a full analysis of each case: identify the key issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”); analyze the issues using case facts and relevant business tools concepts and models; develop and evaluate some alternative solutions (again drawing on case facts and appropriate tools concepts and models); and recommend a course of action. Prepare two or three pages of notes to take to class. These notes will give you talking points for the class discussion. Use your notes in class to keep track of the points your colleagues raise and to quickly identify opportunities to add to the discussion. As you track the discussion you can formulate arguments to challenge your colleagues’ analysis of the case or to revise your own thoughts about the case. Due to time or space constraints your instructor might require only a partial case analysis. For example you could be asked to focus only on identifying and analyzing the issues. Alternatively the case might clearly define the issues and you could be asked to only identify and evaluate possible solutions. Another form of partial case analysis is a “directed case” in which you are directed to answer a specific set of questions about the case. In such cases your preparation for class should focus on the partial analysis you have been directed to perform.Contribute to In-Class DiscussionYour willingness to participate in the discussion of a case will enable you to consider a variety of viewpoints and insights and thereby gain the full benefits of the class’s collective knowledge and experience.In class the instructor’s role is to facilitate discussion often by asking questions. Students should do most of the talking and you should be prepared to provide supporting reasons for your views. You are expected to show respect for others’ opinions but you are also encouraged to challenge each other. Similarly you are expected to be willing to submit your analysis and conclusions to scrutiny by others without becoming defensive. Several good plans of action are usually possible so do not refrain from taking and maintaining a minority position provided you can defend your position using sound analysis. On the other hand feel free to change your position and recommendations as others’ views emerge and a more complete range of information is assembled. Due to time constraints it is impossible to discuss every aspect of a case in class. Therefore your instructor might steer the discussion in a particular direction or the discussion might centre on only one or two steps of the case analysis; for example identification and analysis of issues might be the focus of one case while on another occasion the issues might be clearly defined and your task could be to focus on developing possible solutions. Nevertheless you are welcome to introduce additional ideas other issues or a new alternative for instance. Doing so will help to avoid feeling frustrated because some of your best ideas are not discussed. While your instructor might not be able to discuss your ideas to your complete satisfaction you can enrich the discussion by noting additional aspects of the case that are worthy of more consideration.Generally the class as a whole will perform a more thorough and creative analysis than would be possible by any one person working alone or by any given small team of students. Therefore do not be discouraged because you did not consider a particular solution. As new ideas are raised be prepared to supplement or adjust your prepared analysis and recommendations. Listen to others in ClassListening to others in class is hard work. Use active listening techniques apply listening etiquette and refrain from activities that will prevent you or others from hearing what the speaker is saying.Use Active Listening TechniquesListen for the ideas the speaker is presenting not just the words being spoken. Link what one speaker is saying to what others have already said. By doing so you can build on their arguments or dispute their conclusions by making direct reference to their statements.Listen critically for the main argument the speaker is presenting so you can understand how the speaker’s argument differs from yours and how the speaker uses case facts concepts and models in analysis. Recognizing the logic of the speaker’s argument aids you in structuring your own argument in response.Active listening helps you build on analyses and arguments presented by previous speakers. Ask questions that clarify a speaker’s use of case facts concepts and models and that clarify the conclusions drawn by the speaker. Briefly summarizing a previous speaker’s comments in your notes ensures that you have understood what a colleague has said. This summary can also help you to establish and refine agreement among class members at various stages of the case discussion process.Avoid making judgments about a speaker’s ideas; quick judgments limit your willingness to hear what the speaker is saying which can lead you to discount the value of your colleague’s contribution to the case discussion. Having preconceived ideas about what a speaker might say can cause you to tune out of the conversation; and when you tune back in you could have missed a critical component of the speaker’s argument.Finally approach a discussion with an open mind: you might discover during the class discussion that you misinterpreted a fact or misapplied a concept or model and that the analysis alternatives and recommendation provided by others is more appropriate than yours.Use Listening EtiquetteListening etiquette begins with focused attention on the speaker. Allowing colleagues to share what they have diligently prepared shows respect for the time they have spent preparing and recognizes the value of their thoughts and contributions. Give feedback to the speaker through your body language: maintain eye contact with the speaker nod and smile when appropriate and physically lean into the conversation. Show respect by allowing the speaker to completely finish speaking. A pause could simply be the speaker taking an opportunity to gather thoughts not an indication that the speaker has finished talking. Appropriate listening etiquette requires that you do not carry on side conversations while a speaker has the floor. Side conversations distract not only the speaker but also those around you and could prevent a speaker’s ideas from being understood by the entire group. Appropriate listening etiquette also requires that you not be distracted by electronic devices. Ensure that your laptop is open to your notes and the case. Turn off your cellphone and put it out of sight. When your attention is distracted by electronic devices you also distract those around you and interfere with the collective understanding of the case.Good listening etiquette helps you to develop essential management competencies skills and abilities. Your technical analytical problem-solving and creative skills will be sharpened as you evaluate your own analysis against that of your colleagues.Enhance the Quality of Your Class ParticipationThere is no one single way to earn high marks for preparation and participation. However the following guidelines can enhance the quality of your class participation:Identify the most important issues including those that might have been overlooked by those closest to the situation.Provide supporting arguments for any statements you make or conclusions you draw but be clear and to the point.Share appropriate analyses; for example bring your proposed organizational chart or your financial analysis on a flash drive or at least be prepared to share a few key specifics of your analysis. This is a clear way to demonstrate your preparation.Come to a decision and be prepared to give your recommendations. Any analysis you have completed is of minimal value if it does not culminate in a decision. Participate in all phases of the discussion—identification and analysis of the issues development and evaluation of alternatives and development of an action plan.Interact with other students. Ask them to provide support for their arguments. State why you disagree with their opinion. Build on their analysis but avoid merely repeating what they have said.note 4: preparing a written case reportintroduction to Preparing a written Case ReportThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in preparing a written case report by applying the four steps of case analysis described in Note 2.The report described in this note assumes that you are performing a full case analysis (rather than doing a partial case analysis or taking an analytical approach). The guidelines relating to format organization and written communication are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which might differ and be more specific.Play Your Assigned RoleFor each case assignment you will be asked to adopt a specific role as a student consultant employee or manager who is writing a report to a specific person or persons. Depending on your assigned role your analysis could be written as a report to your instructor your supervisor the board of directors or to the client who engaged you as a consultant. In this note we generally refer to the person who will receive the report as the reader. It is important that before you begin writing your report you have a clear understanding of who will be reading your report and that person’s (or those persons’) needs and expectations. Your report should be written with your reader(s) in mind. Your audience is reading the report to gain an understanding of how you propose to solve an issue. They are pressed for time and are often inundated with information. They want their information quickly and easily without having to bring extra thought to the process of reading. The following are some suggestions to make your report reader-friendly:Avoid jargon inside terminology and undefined abbreviations.Keep your sentences simple and straightforward use paragraphs to group similar thoughts and keep your paragraphs short.Make the information easy to find by using headers and page numbers clear and informative section headings and accurate cross-references.Avoid decorative elements and be generous with white space—extra lines—between sections so your reader can easily see how information is clustered.Always use professional tone and tact. However if you are playing the role of an external consultant you can be a little bolder in making your points than if you are playing the role of someone from within the organization—especially when writing to a supervisor.Identify the IssueSBe ClearA high-quality case report focuses on the most important issues and clearly identifies those issues at the start of the report. Without a clear statement of the issues problems and opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) that you intend to address your report will wander aimlessly from one topic to the next and be of limited value to your reader.Settle on a Manageable Set of IssuesIt is important to arrive at a set of relevant issues that are manageable within the size constraints of your written report. (See Note 2 for more information about evaluating and prioritizing issues.) In a short report (e.g. 1000 to 1500 words) you can usually effectively address only two or three issues. In a longer report (e.g. 2500 to 3000 words) you might be able to address five or six issues. Focusing in-depth on a few key issues is generally more productive than a cursory analysis of many issues. Particularly in long or complex cases you will need to make choices among the issues and determine priorities.Use Your Issue Statement to Let the Reader Know What to ExpectAn easy way to let the reader know what to expect in the upcoming analysis is to ensure that the issues you identify are the same issues that you subsequently analyze. Something you first identify as an issue might sometimes dissipate or diminish in priority after you begin your analysis and other issues might surface. This change in priorities is part of the normal iterative process of case analysis. Although you should begin your draft report with a clear issue statement the issue statement will evolve to a certain degree as you complete your report. Double-back after you have completed your initial analysis of the issues and revise your issue statement accordingly. In the final version of the report the issues you identify at the start of the report should be in absolute agreement with your subsequent analysis and recommendations.For a complex case your issue statement should also identify the sub-issues associated with each issue. Noting the sub-issues will help to prepare the reader for the analysis section. For instance the owner of a business might contemplate whether to expand to the United States. As an issue statement the question of whether to expand to the United States is superficial and can be made more precise. A full issue statement might include whether the company has the resources to successfully execute such a move whether the American market is more attractive than the Canadian one and whether such a move fits with the preferences of others who own a significant share of the company. The reader of the report is then set up to expect for example a resource gap analysis; an analysis of market size growth trends and the degree of competition in both the American and Canadian markets; and an analysis of stakeholder preferences. To provide another example a 1999 strategic management case about WestJet Airlines Ltd. asked two questions: “Should WestJet move into Eastern Canada? If so how soon and to what extent?” For that particular case a sample issue statement might beThe main issue facing WestJet is whether to move into Eastern Canada. Three key factors to consider in this decision are the degree to which such a move will require the company to deviate from its successful Southwest model how the move would fit with corporate goals and the level of competition WestJet would face in Eastern Canada compared with in Western Canada. The second issue facing WestJet is to determine the timing and magnitude of any eastward expansion that would be compatible with the company’s goals and resource constraints and align with competitors’ plans and capabilities.This issue statement provides a logical foundation for the following analyses: an assessment of what the Southwest model involves and how it gives WestJet a competitive advantage; an assessment of goals such as keeping debt low and continuing to grow in Western Canada; and an analysis of the competition posed by Air Canada and other low-fare entrants in both Eastern and Western Canada.Although the issue statement does not explicitly lay out the types of analyses that will follow in the report it should provide enough hints and clues that a reader will not be surprised to find a section on “The Southwest Model” or “Analysis of the Competition.” This approach to building an issue statement also ensures that you are being deliberate in selecting and applying various analytical tools and models.Remember a reasonable degree of clarity about the issues is necessary to begin preparing your case report but expect your understanding of the issues to evolve as you progress through your analysis. Ensure that your final issue statement reflects your refined identification of the issues and accurately orients the reader to the rest of the case report.Analyze the IssuesTest the Case FactsTo produce a high-quality report you need to present the case facts in a way that contributes to your analysis and adds value to your report. Avoid merely reiterating or rehashing case material. When you restate case facts be sure they form part of a logical argument and are accompanied by inferences and findings. To ensure that you are using the case facts appropriately read each sentence in your report that includes a fact from the case and ask yourself “What’s my point?” If the answer to this question is not addressed in the same sentence or in the next few lines of the report either delete the fact or explain the inference that you intended to draw. For example there is little value in repeating that “the company currently holds a five per cent market share in Canada” unless you use that fact to support say the contention that the company has room to grow its Canadian customer base prior to expanding into the United States. You do not need to use a formal footnote when referring to material from the case. Direct quotations from the case should be acknowledged by citing the page number of the case in the body of the report but keep direct quotations to a bare minimum using them only where special emphasis is desired.Use Business ConceptsBusiness concepts that are used as part of your analysis should add value to your report and be relevant to your reader. Avoid discussing theories or models unless you explain them sufficiently and fit them to the situation in the case. For example discussing what constitutes a competitive advantage is of little value unless you then proceed to use the VRIO model developed by Jay Barney to illustrate that the organization’s resources and capabilities are valuable rare inimitable and that the firm is organized to exploit those resources and capabilities.The required level of explanation depends on the reader’s knowledge educational background and organizational position. You might not need to explain common business terms but do not assume that your reader is familiar with academic or business models such as Victor Vroom’s expectancy theory or the growth–share matrix developed by Boston Consulting Group. Some business terms such as competitive advantage and core competencies are widely used but different people might understand them differently. When in doubt briefly explain a term. For example you might specify that an organization’s competitive advantage refers to how it intends to attract customers by offering something that is of value to them and differs from what its competitors offer.Specifically and deliberately apply business concepts to the case. For example a discussion of Raymond Vernon’s model of a product life cycle should categorize the company’s products into various life cycle stages and assess the implications of having two-thirds of the company’s products in the maturity and decline stages.A case report is not an academic research report; avoid writing that is overly theoretical and academic. Considerable skill is required to successfully integrate business theory so that it is perceived as practical and not overly conceptual. At the same time you want to show your instructor that you are able to apply the course material and demonstrate to the intended reader that you have the appropriate expertise relevant to the situation.Use External Research SparinglyTo keep your task of writing a case report more manageable most of your reports will not require external research. When your instructor does request external research the results of your research should also be presented to add value to the report making it clear why the research is relevant to the situation. Never append external research to your written report without using that research to help dissect issues or build arguments. Acknowledge the source of any external research with a reference note (e.g. a footnote endnote or in-text citation).Adhere to Length ConstraintsYour instructor will usually set a word or page limit for your report. Learning to be concise and efficient with your writing will prepare you for writing excellent reports for busy professionals.The analysis portion of your report should be substantial. Together with the evaluation of alternatives it will form the bulk of your report. However because of length constraints be judicious in deciding how much and which parts of your analysis to include in your written report.Some of the analysis is mainly for your own benefit—helping you understand the organization and its industry—rather than being of value to the reader. Your instructor might ask you to include such analysis in an appendix with appropriate references to the appendix in the report. Alternatively your instructor might ask you to exclude such analysis from the report to make room for analysis that will be of more value to the reader.Develop and Evaluate Your AlternativesDepending on how long your report is and how complex the issues are you could evaluate as few as three or four alternatives or as many as seven or eight. It is rarely possible to do a good job of evaluating more than eight alternatives.Sometimes it can seem expedient to group a few alternatives together and evaluate them as a package. However it can be difficult to evaluate combined alternatives because each component usually has its own pros and cons. As well evaluating packaged alternatives often obscures some of the issues and results in an evaluation that is less thorough than if each alternative had been evaluated separately. Therefore it is usually preferable to wait until the recommendation phase to combine alternatives. Rather than providing a complete evaluation of the pros and cons of all your alternatives it might be sufficient to only briefly mention some of the alternatives and give a short rationale for why they were discarded early in the evaluation process.Since analysis of alternatives is a key part of any written report ensure that you sufficiently discuss your selected alternatives in the body of the report. Listing the pros and cons in bullet form or presenting such information in tables is an efficient way to evaluate alternatives. However avoid using phrases that have ambiguous meanings such as “requires additional resources” or “uses core competencies.” Such phrases leave the reader to draw inferences. Instead specify the resources that are required or the core competencies to be used.Using lists and tables can also have disadvantages. Too many lists and tables can lead to a report that appears cluttered and is difficult to read. However a report that is text-heavy can also be cumbersome to read. Therefore strike a balance. For instance discuss key pros and cons in paragraph form and supplement the text with a table containing additional pros and cons. Avoid duplicating content in both paragraphs and tables. To help evaluate your alternatives establish a set of decision criteria and use those criteria to identify pros and cons. Measuring alternatives against decision criteria also helps to keep the analysis consistent reducing bias. (Evaluating alternatives is discussed in detail in Note 2.)Make RecommendationsIn general avoid introducing new analysis or new alternatives in the recommendations section of your report.Your recommended solution will be one of the alternatives or a combination of the alternatives you evaluated. In some instances in an effort to keep a report short you might be asked by your instructor to combine your evaluation of alternatives with your recommendations and present only the solutions you recommend for adoption.Your goal is to develop recommendations that will be useful given the issues that you are trying to resolve; consistent with your analysis; reasonable given the organization and its environment; feasible given the organization’s resources; and convincing to your supervisor or client. Your rationale should capture the main reasons for adopting your recommendations and show how you have mitigated any significant drawbacks.Your recommendations should be specific enough that they provide the organization with an action plan including who will implement the recommendations how when and in what priority. In addition to discussing the basic plan of action in the body of the report it is helpful with lengthy cases to provide an implementation chart in an appendix to capture the details at a glance. Some instructors prefer that you separate your recommendations and implementation plan into two sections of your report and provide a more expansive action plan with priorities for implementation detailed timelines and personnel assignments.Content and Format of your ReportLengthYour instructor will specify the number of pages or words for each case assignment. Adhere to the restricted length by organizing your report effectively prioritizing your material avoiding repetition and choosing your words carefully. As discussed in Section 3.2 select a manageable set of issues and ensure your set of alternatives is also workable.Presenting some of your analysis and findings in figures or appendices is an economical use of space often allowing you to present more information in less space than you could in the body of your report (see Section 7.11).FontUse the font specified by your instructor in the assignment or course syllabus or on the course website.SpacingUnless your instructor directs you otherwise reports should be double-spaced. In business reports are normally single-spaced; however double-spacing is usually used in academia to allow room for your instructor to provide feedback.Page NumbersThe executive summary which appears directly after the cover page is not numbered nor is it calculated in the page count or word count. The remaining pages should be numbered but the page number should not be shown on the first page. Pages containing appendices should also be numbered using Roman numerals. Appendices are not included in the page count or word count although your instructor might set a separate limit on the number of appendices or the number of pages used for appendices.Headings and SubheadingsUse headings even in short reports; include subheadings in longer reports. Headings and subheadings improve readability by informing your reader what to expect and by keeping your reader oriented within the structure of your report. They make it easier for a reader to return to the report and quickly find needed information. Headings and subheadings also help you to organize your thoughts more carefully keeping you and subsequently your reader focused.Cover PageA professional report should include a cover page that identifies the name of the person or persons for whom the report is prepared the name of the person or persons who prepared the report the date and the subject of the report as shown in the following sample.	REPORT	TO:		Jordan Kerr President Kerr Manufacturing Ltd.	FROM:		Nancy Drake Eagle Consulting Group	DATE:		September 20 2017	SUBJECT:	Customer Retention DifficultiesExecutive SummaryAn executive summary is required unless your instructor specifies otherwise. Write the executive summary after you complete the rest of the report but place it immediately after the cover page and before the report’s main content.The executive summary is designed to outline the report’s most important issues and recommendations. It should stimulate the reader’s interest in the rest of the report (e.g. by including profit projections for your recommendations or for indicating the projected growth in market share) convincing the reader that reading the whole report will be worthwhile and valuable.For the size of report you will produce while a student the executive summary should not exceed one page (250 words). For a very long report (e.g. 40 or 50 pages) a two-page summary might be justified.IntroductionThe first section in the report is a brief introduction which should capture the purpose and scope of the report. The purpose of the report states why you have been asked to write the report. The scope identifies what you will do in the report (e.g. identify issues analyze those issues and develop and evaluate alternatives).The introduction should never include a salutation such as",,,,,,
“Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam.”The introduction is not a brief summary of the case. Your supervisor or the person who hired you as a consultant is already familiar with the facts. However a sentence or two in the introduction about the company’s current situation helps to explain the purpose of the report. As discussed in Section 4.1 case facts should be included in the report only to make a specific point. Therefore do not spend time and words reiterating case facts in the introduction.Depending on the style preferred by your instructor and the complexity of the case identifying the issues can form a key part of the introduction to your report. Usually though you will identify the issues in a subsequent section that focuses exclusively on identifying the issues. The latter approach generally is favoured because it more clearly distinguishes the issues for both you and your reader.In general the introduction should not exceed a half page in length (125 words). If you identify the issues in your introduction the introduction could be as long as a page (250 words).Body of the ReportThe body of the report is typically divided into sections for issues analysis of issues alternatives and recommendations. Especially for the analysis and alternatives sections use subheadings for each issue and each alternative to make your report more readable and user-friendly. Subheadings also help you to organize your thoughts (see Section 7.5). Similarly use paragraphs to separate each group of related thoughts from the next. Use of many short paragraphs will also make your report more readable.If your report includes figures or appendices make specific reference to the figure or appendix at the appropriate place in the body of your report. This reference directs the reader to link the content in the body with the supplementary information.ConclusionThe final section in a written report is the conclusion. This section should provide a very brief (no more than a quarter to a half page) summary of the main findings of the report. The conclusion should also convince the reader that it would be beneficial for the organization to adopt the recommendations in the report. The conclusion should follow strictly from your analysis and avoid introducing any new material since you will have already clearly built your argument in the analysis section of the report.Figures and AppendicesThe Purpose of Figures and AppendicesFigures or appendices are used to capture some of your analysis or recommendations in a form more succinct than prose. Quantitative analysis is usually best presented in figures and appendices. Some forms of qualitative analysis also lend themselves to figures or appendices such as a complete Porter’s five forces analysis or a resource gap analysis. Appendices are also used to present external research organizational charts and other supplementary information. There is no value in reproducing exhibits from the case itself in your report. Instead refer directly to exhibits contained in the case using a phrase such as “Exhibit 3 in the materials provided to us” or “case Exhibit 3.”Depending on the size of your report some items should be incorporated within the body of the report while others should be appended to the back. It is conventional to include relatively short charts or tables or small graphs within the report and to attach longer items to the back of the report. Depending on your instructor’s preferences small charts tables and graphs within the body of a report are referred to as figures illustrations or exhibits; exhibits sometimes refer to material appended to the end of a report but more commonly that content is referred to as appendices. Whatever terminology you use be consistent throughout the report. Each appendix is usually considered to be a stand-alone item that the reader can refer to both during and after reading the body of the report. To help draw the reader into the appendix and to make key information readily accessible in the body of the report figures can be used to summarize key items from an appendix. For example a figure can summarize three or four key financial ratios that are provided as part of a comprehensive ratio analysis shown in the appendix. To use figures and appendices effectively limit their number to suit the size of your report. Also be sure to refer to material from these items in the body of the report.Quantitative Figures and AppendicesQuantitative figures and appendices should provide a level of detail that is suited to the audience and allows the information to be presented in a readable font (at least 10 points and depending on the font preferably 11 or 12 points). For example a board of directors will not want to review dozens of pages of detailed spreadsheet analysis. The board will expect the report writer to make judicious choices about the number of scenarios and level of detail to present. On an income statement it is generally sufficient to display four or five expense categories rather than list the 15 or 20 individual expense items and to state items in thousands or millions of dollars to reduce the number of digits displayed. It will also likely be sufficient to display the most likely worst-case and best-case scenarios. However your supervisor or your instructor might want to see more analysis and a greater level of detail than a board member would require. All quantitative appendices should include a clear trail of assumptions calculations and explanations. For example if your pro forma (forecast) income statement projects a growth in sales of five per cent for each of the next two years clearly state this assumption and explain why this assumption was used (e.g. it represents the average growth rate for the past three years or it is the projected increase in demand for the industry). For financial statements the clearest trail is established when you provide an additional column for assumptions. Alternatively beside each relevant line item insert a superscript reference number that corresponds to a numbered note at the bottom of the financial statement.Numbering of Figures and AppendicesSequentially number (or letter) all figures and appendices to correspond with the order in which they are discussed in the report. Label figures and title appendices to show at a glance what they contain; e.g. “Figure 1: Growth of Market Share 1995 to 2015” or “Appendix 1: Porter’s Five Forces Analysis.”Figures and appendices should also be professional in appearance and format. Word processing software offers a wide range of colours and designs for charts graphs tables and illustrations; however unless you are providing the printed copy of the report (and thus have control over the final appearance) avoid the use of colour and keep illustrations simple. Also avoid the use of special effects such as drop shadows and special complex or elaborate shapes. Use shading (i.e. fill) in tables and illustrations only when absolutely necessary. The width of borders should be between 0.5 and 1.0 points in size. When designing tables use only the borders you need to separate rows and columns. Too many lines vertical or horizontal add clutter to content and often make a table more difficult rather than easier to read.Figures and appendices are typically not included as part of the prescribed word count; however your instructor might prescribe a separate limit on the number of figures and appendices.Writing Style Grammar and SpellingBasic Criteria of a Well-Written ReportYour report should be well-organized and well-written. Careful attention to grammar—including sentence structure paragraph structure word usage and punctuation—and spelling is essential. Your instructor might evaluate this aspect of your report separately or might show an explicit deduction from your overall grade in an effort to emphasize the cost of poor organization faulty grammar and misspellings. A poorly written report will have a negative impact on the reader that will adversely colour the reader’s view of the entire report. For your work to be perceived as professional competent and credible your report needs to be well written.While spell-checkers and other electronic tools are of some value they do not detect all types of errors (e.g. using “weather” instead of “whether”). It is also helpful to have someone else review your report for readability clarity spelling and grammar. However a review by another person does not replace the need to take the time and effort to carefully review your own work. Plan your time to allow at least a day or two between finishing your first draft and editing your report; otherwise you might simply see what you saw the last time. It can also be helpful to read your report aloud or to read the paragraphs in reverse order from the end to the beginning. Finally you should print and proofread your report. Your eyes and brain have the ability to notice things in a printed copy that are not seen on a screen. Prepare and proofread figures and appendices with the same care as applied to the body of the report.Use of “I Think” and “I Believe”Avoid the tendency to preface conclusions and recommendations with phrases such as “I think” “I believe” or “We are of the opinion that.” The entire report represents your thoughts beliefs and opinions. It should be clear from the context whether you are citing facts or drawing a conclusion. While qualifying expressions can be used occasionally for special emphasis their overuse leads to a report that appears tentative.Formal versus Informal ReportsWhen deciding on the tone of a report consider the audience the customary style within an organization and the preferences of your supervisor or instructor. A report to a board of directors of a large corporation should use more formal language than a report to a small business owner. For example it is more formal to write “The report recommends that the organization [do X]” than to write “I recommend that the organization [do Y].”If your report is directed to your supervisor or a client who is the owner of a small business use of “I” or “we” is generally acceptable. As well when addressing the recipient of the report it is generally acceptable to use “you.” However if the sentence refers to the recipient’s department or organization as a whole use “the department” or “the company” or a shortened version of the company name.Opinions differ on whether it is acceptable in a report to use the passive voice (e.g. “It is recommended that”). In general the active voice (e.g. “We recommend that”) is more compelling than the passive voice and it demonstrates more confidence in and ownership of the recommendations. The active voice is also easier to read and generally uses fewer words.Professional Language Tone and TactUse Professional LanguageThe report should use professional language that is both concise and clear. Say something well the first time and you will eliminate repetition and make room for new content. Keep your sentences short. Ensure that each word communicates the meaning you intend.Avoid flowery language. Remember that you are writing a business report not an English essay. Also avoid trite expressions colloquialisms and slang. For example use the word “receive” instead of “get;” use “will earn a profit” instead of “will make money;” use “high risk” rather than “big gamble.”Use words such as never always and very sparingly to avoid exaggeration and generalization. Such words are often unnecessarily inflammatory. As such they might cause the reader to become defensive and they might reduce your credibility.Avoid the use of technical language that your reader will not understand unless you have explained such terms. This guideline also applies to use of theories and models. While you are required to use course concepts in an academic case report (in your role as a student) you are also required to apply them in a way that makes them understandable and relevant to the report recipient (in your assigned role as a subordinate or a consultant).For instance in an organizational behaviour case you might choose to apply expectancy theory to explain why employees are not motivated. It is sufficient to state (with appropriate support) that employees do not believe that behaviours being asked of them will lead to customer satisfaction or they do not believe that their supervisors will reward improvements to customer satisfaction or they do not value the organization’s rewards. Simple clear conclusions are preferable to a theoretical outline of what expectancy theory is and what it says about motivation.Also avoid the use of jargon or “business speak.” Jargon obscures your intended meaning and creates the potential for misunderstanding. Jargon also changes with generations; using jargon that might be understood by a young generation of business people might leave an older businessperson frustrated and feeling excluded. Similarly jargon does not usually translate well or consistently across languages and is potentially confusing excluding or even offending to an international reader. Instead of “reaching out” or “touching base” “contact” the person. Rather than pursuing “buy-in” “seek agreement” on a course of action.Use big words only to the extent that you can do so effectively. In general clarity and conciseness are more important than trying to impress your supervisor client or instructor.Use Constructive LanguageSince a case report culminates in recommended alternatives for action the goal is to be persuasive. Throughout the report be positive constructive tactful and considerate of the reader’s feelings so as not to alienate the reader.Although one important facet of the report is to identify issues care should be taken to avoid overly negative language especially when the report is addressed to your superiors. For example rather than stating that “management has failed to recognize that the current strategy is no longer effective” state that “due to significant changes in the external environment the company has reached the stage where a new strategy is required to ensure its ongoing success.”Avoid accusatory statements such as “poor management” or “management has neglected to.” It is more appropriate to state for example that “there were insufficient controls in place” rather than “there was a lack of internal controls” or “management failed to establish internal controls.” Using appropriate language and tone will make the reader more receptive to what you say in the report about various issues. It will also make your analysis and recommendations more credible.Use Must and Need SparinglyAlso related to tone and tact is the use of the word must. In general avoid telling the recipient of the report what the person must do. Overuse of that word reflects a lack of distinction between essential actions and suggested recommendations. As well must has the connotation of ordering or commanding action. Your reader will react more positively just as you would to phrases such as “I recommend” “It would be beneficial to” or “The company should” rather than being told what the reader must do.It is also preferable to use wording such as “Your department should” rather than “Your department needs to.” Reserve need to and needs to for actions that are absolutely essential to emphasize their critical nature. Use “I recommend” for actions that would be prudent or wise.Case Reports Written by TeamsTeam MeetingsIf you are assigned to complete your case as part of a team plan to meet at least twice and perhaps three times to discuss the entire case. Set an agenda for each meeting and hold each other accountable for being prepared. For example the goals of the first meeting might be to identify the issues and begin to analyze them. Prior to that meeting each member of the team should read the case at least once preferably twice and make some preliminary notes.The goals of the second meeting might be to develop and evaluate alternative solutions and to draft recommendations. Prior to that meeting individual team members might be assigned the task of completing more in-depth analysis (e.g. calculating financial ratios comparing the firm’s product offering and value proposition to those of key competitors). Some team members might be assigned the role of capturing what was accomplished at the previous meeting by drafting one or more sections of the report.The agenda for the final meeting might be to review the draft for consistency clarity grammar and so on and to finalize the report.BrainstormingOne of the key benefits of working in teams is the ability to generate more ideas and to benefit from each another’s ideas. For this advantage to be achieved it is helpful to use a technique called “brainstorming” when identifying the issues and especially when generating alternative solutions. Brainstorming attempts to come up with as many ideas as possible by holding off on any evaluation or criticism of the ideas until a later time.The Task of Writing the ReportThe duty of writing the report can be split or rotated among team members but the final product should represent a team effort and not simply be a piecing together of several individually-crafted sections. The latter approach usually leads to inconsistencies such as analyzing issues that were not mentioned in the identification of issues failing to solve issues that were analyzed or not using much of the analysis contained in appendices. Some editing of a written draft should occur at a subsequent meeting or by means of circulating the draft to all members of the team. The final report is the responsibility of the whole team not the individuals who are assigned all or part of the writing task. Your instructor might require all members of the team to sign off on the report to acknowledge this shared responsibility.Case Analysis and Academic IntegrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.Note 5: making an oral case presentationIntroduction to Making An Oral Case PresentationThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in making an oral presentation to your instructor and class colleagues. The note covers the purpose of a presentation and provides guidelines for preparing and presenting a case to a classroom audience. The note also provides general guidelines related to format organization and verbal communication skills. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific.Purpose of a Case PresentationEspecially in the business world an oral presentation is typically used to highlight the main findings in an accompanying written report. However the oral presentation is distinct from the written report largely because information presented orally is perceived and absorbed differently from information provided in writing.An oral presentation should provide a broad overview of the main issues and recommendations. It should not provide the same level of detail as a written report so be discerning in choosing which elements of your case analysis to emphasize. The overall goal of a presentation is to convince your audience that you understand the key issues and have a logical and feasible action plan for resolving them.Criteria of a Good PresentationA good presentation conveys information in a format that enables your audience to comprehend the intended message. With any communication information is encoded by the sender transmitted using one or more media and decoded by the receiver. At any point in the process communication can be disrupted hindering the clarity of the message. A communication disruption can occur for a variety of reasons including the amount of information being conveyed the presentation tools and techniques being used and the skills of the presenters. Good presenters are aware of the potential disruptions to a message and craft their delivery to minimize those disruptions.For each case you will be asked to play a specific role as a student consultant employee or manager who is writing a report or making a presentation to a specific person or group or both. Depending on the directions of your instructor you will be presenting to your instructor a manager a board of directors or a client who engages you as a consultant. A good presentation addresses the needs and knowledge of the intended audience. However while the presentation (and accompanying report) might be intended for one individual you should present to the entire audience in the room. For instance if the presentation (and accompanying report) is being directed to the vice-president of marketing address your presentation to the vice-president and thank the individual for “inviting the rest of the management team to the presentation.” Always use professional tone and tact. However if you are playing the role of an external consultant you can be a little bolder in making your points than if you are playing the role of someone from within the organization—especially when presenting to a supervisor. Content of a Case PresentationPresentation of a Full Case ReportOnce a case analysis is complete and the report has been written review the report and identify the key portions that the individuals reading the report need to know. These highlights will form the outline of your presentation and will help you to present what is written in the report and avoid introducing different material. Your audience will read your report to gain greater understanding of the information included in your presentation. A full case presentation typically consists of three parts: the issues key alternatives and your recommendation.First describe the issue or issues you identified as being key to the case. Briefly provide your reasons for selecting those issues reflecting the theories and models you used during the analysis stage (see Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054). Be mindful of your audience and offer your theoretical analysis only if it adds value. Use of too much theory especially when it is not well applied undermines your expertise and credibility. It is inappropriate and impractical to repeat all the theoretical analysis contained in the report or to cover it in detail during a presentation. Second present the key alternatives you identified as being possible solutions to the issue or issues providing a brief rationale for each. Restraint is key: do not include in your presentation everything contained in your report. A presentation is a high-level review of your report mainly focused on what you identified as the issues and ways to resolve them.Finally offer your recommendation. Persuade the audience that the solutions you have chosen will best resolve the issue. Anticipate objections the audience might raise and counter them in your presentation before they are raised.As you structure your presentation use the slide sorter capability of the presentation software to bring a logical flow to the content. Once you have the high-level points outlined on slides you can easily write the script for the presentation since you will be writing with the end of your presentation (i.e. your proposed solution) in mind.Presentation without a Case ReportIn some courses your instructor will ask you either to complete only specific components of a full case study or to present the case without writing a full report. If you are presenting only individual components of a case analysis performing a full analysis as outlined in Note 2 (identify the issues analyze the issues develop and evaluate alternative and recommend a course of action) will better equip you to present the analysis of the specific components your instructor requires. For example if you are presenting only the issues your preparation should include analysis of those issues so you can confidently present the issue statement. If only the presentation is required it is essential that you have a sufficient understanding of the underlying issues and analysis to select the most appropriate material for your presentation. Because you will not have a written report to use as a roadmap for the presentation it is crucial that you follow the four case analysis steps in Note 2 so that your understanding is sufficient to present the case in a convincing manner and so you can support your recommendations with sound logic. Provide enough detail in your presentation to assure your instructor that you understand the issues and have applied appropriate theory; at the same time avoid overwhelming your audience with too much content and theory.AudioVisual AidsYour presentation should be accompanied by audiovisual aids such as presentation slides (e.g. PowerPoint Prezi or Google Slides) video clips a blackboard or whiteboard a flipchart or handouts. These audiovisual aids can give your audience an outline of your presentation and show them some details (e.g. a ratio analysis or market share analysis) or an illustration (e.g. an effective advertisement). However use audiovisual aids thoughtfully; avoid diverting your audience’s attention from both you as the presenter and the main message you are communicating. The focus should be on the content not on the technology being used to present the content.Presentation slides should be simple and use at least 28-point font. Choose a sans serif font for text. It is simpler cleaner and easier to read on a screen. It also does not pixelate when enlarged by the projector making it clearer to read even for the audience at the back of the room. Use short phrases that supplement—and do not reiterate—what you are going to say. Do not fill the slides with text or your audience will be more focused on reading the slides than on listening to you. It might be necessary especially with slides containing financial statements to break the statements into sections on two or three slides. When communicating a message that contains financial data consider whether a pie chart or graph might better convey the message.Animations should be used with caution; they can be distracting and cause your audience to focus more on the graphics than on the content of your presentation. Use subtle transitions and animations with bullet points “appearing” or “wiping in.” Avoid animated graphics or cartoon clip art; they quickly become annoying to the audience and reduce the professionalism of your presentation. If you use a graphic or photograph use high-quality images that will not pixelate or degrade as they are resized on the screen.Know the room in which you are presenting especially how the lighting affects the room’s projection screen. The room’s lighting will dictate the colours you choose for the background and font in the presentation. For example if the room has windows choose starkly contrasted background and font colours so the text does not get washed out by the light making it difficult for the audience to read.If you prepare your slides using your own computer and software preview your presentation in the school’s lab to ensure that your presentation is compatible with the version of software available in the classroom and that your computer is compatible with the projection system. If you have the opportunity preview the presentation in the room in which you will be delivering the presentation so you can assess whether the content of the slides is readable. If you intend to use a blackboard or whiteboard plan how you will use it. Include in your speaking notes a quick sketch of what you intend to write on the board and the location of each component you will write. This preparation enhances your professionalism and keeps the presentation moving.Presentation SkillsThe role identified for you in the case or by your instructor will guide how you approach your presentation. Nonetheless some key skills are required for all presentations.During your presentation speak loudly enough to be heard by all members of your audience. Use an expressive voice speak at an appropriate speed (which might feel unnaturally slow) pause where appropriate for emphasis or to allow your audience to absorb information and make regular eye contact with members of the audience. Remember that you are the authority on the subject so do not just read what you have written in your report. Choose words and structure your sentences to serve the nature and capacity of the audience. Keep in mind that people’s ability to absorb information is lower when the information is presented orally rather than in writing.While it can be more comfortable to stand behind the podium where you can read from your notes step out from the podium—at least periodically—to connect with your audience. Be comfortable. Become a professional and polished version of yourself. If you are holding cue cards or speaking notes keep them still as you refer to them so they do not draw attention away from the message you are communicating.Presentation skills improve with practice. Script adjust and practise your presentation until it fits the time you are allotted. By exceeding the time limit you reflect a lack of preparation. Your instructor might cut you off or if more than one presentation is scheduled in the class period you might infringe on the time allotted to the next presenter.Handling Audience QuestionsA presentation usually includes time at the end for questions and answers but some presenters prefer to take questions throughout the presentation. Whichever you choose let your audience know at the start of the presentation how you will be taking questions. Some presenters take a mixed approach responding to brief questions of clarification during the presentation but reserving more detailed comments and questions until the presentation is finished. This approach works well in classroom presentations when the whole class is responsible for interacting with the presenter.The ability to listen can set you apart as a business professional and active listening skills enable you to understand what members of the audience are asking. Be present and listen fully to the question; if you start formulating an answer before the audience member has finished asking the question you risk responding inappropriately or incompletely.Acknowledge the audience member and the question. Move toward the person who asked the question—this is a perfect opportunity to move away from the podium. Establish eye contact with the person during the question and the first part of your answer then broaden your attention to other audience members. Thank the individual for the question and if other members of the audience might not have heard the question repeat it so all can hear. If the question refers to an option you considered but did not discuss during the presentation respond,,,,,,
"appropriately and explain why you did not include the topic in the presentation or why you discarded the alternative. If the question raises a point you had not considered thank the questioner for the input and acknowledge that you did not include it in your evaluation. If time allows discuss the topic further.Always be gracious courteous and professional.Team PresentationsIn the case of a team presentation all members of the team should be involved in some aspect of the presentation and the transition from one presenter to the next should be as seamless as possible. Each member’s part in the presentation should be agreed on in advance to avoid both duplication and omission of material. As you prepare the presentation identify each member’s strengths and weaknesses so that you can capitalize on individual presentation skills and specialized understanding of the content. During the presentation team members who are not speaking should avoid being a distraction. Stand back from the speaker and remain still. Do not whisper among yourselves stand in an awkward place or fidget. Where possible play an appropriate supportive role; for example distribute handouts or run the slide show to free the speaker of these duties. To ensure your presentation is professional script and rehearse the presentation several times including transitions from one presenter to the next.Role Of The AudienceAs a member of the audience you are actively involved in the presentation. Your preparation of the case for class discussion should equip you to critically evaluate the presenter’s approach to the case. (See Note 2 and Note 3 of the Case Guide Series—“Preparing to Discuss a Case” No. 9B18M055.) Your instructor might also evaluate your preparation and participation in the class.Just as the presenter plays an assigned role so too should the audience members. For example if you are taking the role of the board ask questions that board members would ask. Such questions might ask about the level of risk assigned to a course of action the estimated return on investment and the impact on other stakeholders of the organization should the recommended solution be implemented.Listen actively focus on the speaker allow the speaker to completely finish listen for the ideas being presented and listen critically for the presenter’s main arguments. Good questions are a challenge to formulate and they should respond to the content you heard from the presenter. Bring a two- or three-page summary of the case to class and make notes in the margins of that summary to compare what the speaker presents against your own preparation of the case. Ask questions that clarify the presenter’s position so that you can persuasively argue your own position.Again at all times be gracious courteous and respectful of the presenter and of other audience members.Dress for SuccessAttire for presentations should be appropriate for a business setting and should also reflect your audience. Appropriate attire includes dress pants skirt dress shirt blouse and/or tie. Jackets are optional except for when you make a formal presentation to a board of directors. Your clothing should not distract audience members from focusing on the content of your presentation; it should also reflect the highest regard for professionalism.Note 6: preparing for and writing a case examIntroduction to Writing a Case ExamThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note guides you in preparing for and successfully writing a case exam. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific. Purpose of a Case ExamThe task of performing a case analysis might form part or all of your examination for a course. If it forms only part of your exam your instructor will likely use short cases or direct you to restrict your analysis to specific tasks. If performing a case analysis represents the entire exam you should expect a longer case with less direction although your instructor might still provide a set of questions to guide your analysis. A case exam is designed to test your ability to apply the case method under constraints of time and resources. If an exam is performed in a closed-book setting you are expected to remember and understand course concepts models and theories well enough to apply them to the assigned case. If an exam is performed in an open-book setting you must still have sufficient knowledge of concepts models and theories to be able to recognize which are relevant to the case and where to find them quickly in your notes or text.Your instructor’s decision to evaluate your performance using a case exam indicates that the main learning outcome is application of the course concepts models and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than memorization and recall. This approach is also consistent with the classroom discussions if your course has made significant use of cases. Preparing for a Case ExamStudying for a case exam is unlike studying for other types of examinations in that the goal of a case exam is application rather than memorization or recall. It also differs in that you do not know what type of questions to expect on the exam. For both of these reasons you are limited in terms of what you can study before the exam. If the exam is open-book your preparation should include determining the material you are most likely to want to use and how you will access it quickly.Reread Notes and TextsReread your notes and reread your text in anticipation of the course concepts models and theories you are most likely to be asked to apply in the case exam. Your priorities should be guided by the following:Course learning outcomes in your course syllabus or on the course website.The types of cases assigned throughout the course—the size of case nature of issues topics covered and types of industries.While a case exam will not ask you to recall specific facts from cases used in class cases used in class do provide some important clues regarding the issues you will encounter on the case exam.Types and depth of analysis required during the course—full case analysis partial case analysis or simply answering questions.Due to time limits in a case exam you will not be expected to apply the same depth of analysis that you would be expected to apply in class discussion written reports or presentations. Nonetheless a case exam will often require that you perform all of the usual steps of analysis. If all steps are not required your instructor will usually alert you to this requirement before the exam. (For a discussion of partial and full case analysis and directed cases see Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054.)Concepts theories and models emphasized in class discussions especially those that were discussed frequently.Any instructions your instructor provides about the focus of the case exam.Practise Writing a Case under Exam ConditionsIt is useful to review one or two of the cases discussed in the course and redo the analysis under the time constraint imposed by the exam. Because you will be familiar with the case consider giving yourself less time than will be available for the exam. Also simulate exam conditions including whether it is closed-book or open-book.Practising for an exam helps you assess which case analysis steps will require better time management during the exam. Practice also gives you some confidence that you can perform the expected analysis within the allowable time.Writing a Case ExamWriting a case exam can be an anxious time given the time constraints and the uncertainty of being thrust into a new situation. Successfully writing a case exam requires that you remain calm and manage your time wisely.Read the InstructionsCarefully read the instructions to maximize your opportunity to excel in the exam.Your instructor will likely provide some questions either at the end of the case or in a separate document. In a directed case your assignment might simply be to answer those questions. In a case requiring partial or full case analysis the questions should help you to identify key issues and the analyses you need to perform. For example questions such as “What threats are posed by traditional and non-traditional competitors?” and “Is the company’s competitive advantage sustainable? If not how can it build a sustainable competitive advantage?” help you to identify potential issues as being increasing competitive threats and lack of a sustainable competitive advantage. The questions also suggest two types of analyses that might be helpful—a competitive position matrix and a competitive advantage analysis. Questions such as “What are the pros and cons for the company focusing on a niche market?” or “Assess the potential of increasing the number of product lines” help direct your attention to two potential alternative solutions for evaluation: serving a niche market or increasing the number of product lines.In addition to carefully reviewing any questions provided by your instructor look for instructions regarding:the role you are to assume when performing the analysis and writing the report;steps in the case method that are required for the exam;key issues; andthe format of the report.For example consider these instructions:Acting in the capacity of a consultant write a report to James Alou chief executive officer who has asked you to evaluate the proposed new sales incentive plan for Andover Manufacturing Inc. (AMI).Your report should identify the issues associated with the new incentive plan analyze the issues and present appropriate recommendations. Each recommendation should be justified by clearly identifying which issue or issues the recommendation is designed to address by presenting its major advantages and by addressing any significant disadvantages. It is NOT necessary to present possible alternatives that you do not recommend.An appropriate heading introduction (which can include identifying the issues) and brief conclusion are required. An executive summary is NOT required.These instructions specify the role you are to play (a consultant). They direct your attention to evaluation of the new incentive plan and suggest that there are issues related to that plan. The instructions also restrict the steps you are to perform in completing your analysis. Lastly the instructions provide guidelines for the report format.Watch for additional instructions regarding numbering of pages required page headers and assembly of your exam.Read the CaseGive yourself time to read through the case twice. In your first read skim the case. Your goal during the first read is to develop a preliminary understanding of the issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”) facing the decision maker. In the first read resist the temptation to highlight text in the case except for key questions raised by the principal actors or characters. Questions raised by the principals are important to note because they help you to identify key issues. (For further information about how to read a case see Note 1 of the Case Guide Series—“Understanding the Case Method” No. 9B18M053.)Your second read of the case should be more deliberate to help you gain a better understanding of the issues and any potential solutions proposed by the principals. You should also identify relevant analyses to perform and case facts that you can use when performing those analyses. Highlighting the case at this stage will help you use the case facts effectively. In a three-hour case exam you should spend no more than 45 minutes reading the case.Prepare an OutlineWhile preparing an outline of your report can appear to be an extra step that consumes valuable time taking 15 minutes to briefly map out key parts of your report helps you to allocate your time and will likely save you time later. An outline provides a valuable roadmap to keep you focused allowing you to move methodically from one step to the next. It prevents you from losing sight of excellent ideas and becomes especially important as you begin to feel more rushed toward the end of the exam.Your outline should identify the main parts of your report the key issues important points for your analysis of the issues and the tools you intend to use and at least some alternative solutions—particularly those raised by the principals in the case or identified in questions that accompany the case.Your outline could also include key decision criteria to use when evaluating the alternative solutions you develop (see Section 4.4.5 or Note 2 Section 4.2).Write Your ReportWhen writing your report start each section on a separate page and double-space your answer. This format will allow you to easily add more material later without crowding what you have done so far. Remember to use proper report format unless otherwise directed. Here again it is important that you have carefully read the instructions so that you do not spend time on tasks that do not help you earn marks.Refer to Note 4 of the Case Guide Series—“Preparing a Written Case Report” No. 9B18M056—for more information about the required components of a report and how to write an effective case report. Bear in mind that an instructor generally scales back the expectations for a report written under the time pressure of an exam. Prioritize and Manage Your TimeAllocate your time to the most important tasks: the analysis of issues and the evaluation of alternative solutions. For the introductory paragraph and the conclusion do just enough to achieve their required purpose. Provide an executive summary only if your instructor directs you to provide one. During an exam as long as you identify the key issues and key alternatives it is generally better to analyze fewer issues and alternatives well than to attempt to deal with too many issues and alternatives which might result in you running out of time. Here your report outline will come in especially handy; refer to it to stay on track.Identify the IssuesKeep your identification of issues brief and to the point so that you avoid repeating content when you perform the subsequent analysis. Also ensure that your set of issues is manageable.Analyze the IssuesUse concepts models and tools to analyze the issues so that your analysis reflects the necessary rigour to demonstrate your mastery of course concepts. However here again adhere to your outline so that you do justice to all of your chosen models and tools.Identify Alternative SolutionsIdentify any potential solutions that were considered by the principals in the case or that were suggested by your instructor in the directions and questions provided to you. Since keeping things the same is seldom a viable alternative you are generally better to allocate your time to alternatives that offer some improvement. Identify other alternatives as long as your set of alternative solutions is still manageable. Evaluate Alternative SolutionsEvaluate how effectively potential solutions will resolve one or more of the issues you have identified. Establish your set of decision criteria to help you quickly generate the pros and cons of your proposed solutions and to evaluate your alternatives consistently. For example in a strategic management case decision criteria might include the degree to which the action:fits with the organization’s mission value proposition and goals;fits with stakeholder preferences;is profitable;capitalizes on specific external opportunities;builds on an existing competitive advantage or helps to create a competitive advantage; orrequires additional resources and competencies.It is especially important when performing a case analysis in an exam setting to choose a manageable set of criteria so that you can fully capitalize on a framework for developing pros and cons. (See Note 2 for detailed information about evaluating alternatives.)Make Your RecommendationIn an exam setting the most important parts of your recommendation are what you recommend and a brief summary of why—specifically how your recommendation resolves the issues you identified. As time allows you can fill in the who how and when. If your instructor requires an implementation plan consider using a chart which is the most efficient way to complete this task during an exam especially as your time draws to a close.Note 7: USING common tools for case analysisIntroduction to Common Tools for Case AnalysisThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note provides you with a few of the more popular tools used in case analysis and guides you in using those tools.The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific.horizontal AnalysisThe data presented by the case author(s) in figures and exhibits will provide you with some of the best opportunities for value-added analysis. Reorganize and summarize the data. Perform additional calculations. Draw new comparisons. In doing so you will be able to interpret existing information in new ways and provide support for new findings.When data are presented in numerical form a logical first step in analyzing the data is to compute percentage changes from one year to the next or to assess the magnitude of the differences between one company and the next. Look for trends such as whether the company is gaining or losing market share compared with its competitors and whether sales are growing or shrinking and the rate of change.When calculating year-over-year percentage changes the earlier year’s number forms the base:For example suppose you are given the following numbers:The percentage decrease in sales from 2015 to 2016 The percentage decrease in sales from 2016 to 2017  For the two-year period:The percentage decrease in sales from 2015 to 2017 From the above horizontal analysis you can conclude that sales are declining at an increasing rate.VERTICAL ANALYSISVertical analysis or common size analysis expresses each item on a financial statement in terms of a percentage of a base amount. The base for income statement items is usually sales. For example you can calculate cost of goods sold (COGS) or other expenses as a percentage of sales. Potential bases for statement of financial position (balance sheet) items are total assets or total liabilities. For example you can calculate inventory as a percentage of total assets or you can calculate current liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities.Vertical analysis facilitates comparison between one business and its competitors of different sizes. It also allows a business to compare its own results from one year to the next. For instance if sales were higher one would expect COGS to also be higher. By expressing COGS as a percentage of sales we can determine whether sales price increases are keeping pace with cost increases.For example suppose you are given the sales numbers in Section 2.1 and the following numbers:You might note that for 2015 and 2016 COGS as a percentage of sales was fairly steady but in 2017 the percentage rose significantly to 47.9 per cent. Referring back to Section 2.1 you might also note that sales had declined from the previous two years leading to questions about not only the drop in sales but also the reasons for the sharp increase in COGS.RATIO ANALYSISIn many cases it is beneficial to analyze an organization’s financial performance by performing ratio analysis. Ratios show the relationship among selected items of financial statement data as expressed by a percentage rate or proportion. Ratios are useful only if they are compared to ratios of prior years ratios of competitors industry standards and forecast ratios. Be judicious in both your calculation and interpretation of ratios to ensure that your financial statement analysis adds value to your report. The most valid external comparisons involve companies within the same industry or industry benchmarks produced by such organizations as J.D. Power or Deloitte. General benchmarks known as “rules of thumb” are sometimes available; however industry benchmarks take precedence over general benchmarks since ratios can be expected to vary considerably from one industry to the next. When a ratio mixes balance sheet (statement of financial position) values and income statement (statement of earnings) values use an average of the balance sheet values. (This approach is used because an income statement provides information about a company’s performance over a period of time whereas a balance sheet is comprised of values at one point in time.) When the value at the beginning of the time period is unavailable (e.g. when only two years’ data are available and you are calculating comparison ratios for two years) use year-end values as a proxy for the average. However the more asset values fluctuate over that period of time the more use of a year-end value distorts the picture.The following formula is used to calculate the average of balance sheet values:where one year’s beginning value is the prior year’s ending value.Provided below are the formulas and brief interpretations of three types of ratios—profitability or activity ratios liquidity ratios and solvency ratios.Profitability or Activity RatiosProfitability ratios measure a business’s ability to generate earnings from providing goods and services. Profitability ratios can be useful for comparing a business’s present and past performance or comparing a business with that of its competitors or industry benchmarks during the same period in time. The three main profitability ratios are return on assets (ROA) return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS). As will be shown below in Sections 4.12 through 4.18 changes to ROA can be explained by calculating other ratios.Return on Assets Return on assets (ROA) indicates the profitability of a business relative to the assets invested in the business. An ROA of 10 per cent indicates that for every dollar invested in assets the business earns 10 cents in profit. Instead of net income (also referred to as profit or earnings) income from continuing operations can be used to provide a better benchmark for future comparison since discontinued operations will no longer be available to generate profit.						ROA depends on two factors: profit margin and asset turnover. Thus the equation for ROA can also be stated as follows:Profit Margin Profit margin indicates the profitability of a business relative to its sales revenue and reflects how well a business is controlling its various expenses. Expressing net income relative to sales revenue provides a more meaningful comparison of the business’s performance from one year to another than merely comparing net income in the two years. A profit margin of 12 per cent indicates that for every dollar of sales revenue the business has 12 cents left in profit after all expenses are deducted. Profit margin in turn can be dissected to analyze how well individual expenses are being controlled.Gross Profit Margin  Gross profit is a preliminary measure of profitability. It measures a company’s ability to maintain an adequate selling price above its cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross profit also measures the company’s ability to pay operating and other expenses. If the gross profit margin is 30 per cent the business has 30 cents left from every dollar of sales revenue to pay operating and other expenses. In other words for every dollar in sales revenue it costs the business on average 70 cents to make or buy the products it is selling leaving 30 cents to pay operating expenses such as wages and rent and other expenses such as interest. A declining gross profit margin is a sign that selling prices are not keeping up with increases in COGS.Expense Ratios Expense ratios measure the portion of income that is spent on specific expenses. An expense ratio that is higher this year than the previous year could indicate that the company has potential problems with controlling costs in individual expense categories such as selling expenses administrative expenses and interest expenses. However increasing the amount spent on expenses could also be the key to future growth as would be the case for example if the business significantly increased its advertising and promotion expenditures or added new salespeople in an effort to increase sales.Note that although you can calculate an expense ratio using COGS the result would be the complement of the gross profit margin (i.e. if the gross profit margin is 34 per cent then COGS is 66 per cent of the net sales).Asset TurnoverThe asset turnover ratio the second main determinant of ROA measures how well a business uses its assets to generate sales. If the asset turnover ratio is 8.33 per cent the business is generating 8.33 cents in sales for every dollar invested in assets. Thus the two keys to improving a company’s ROA are to improve the profitability of each sale of a good or service and to sell more goods and services in the first place.Inventory TurnoverThe inventory turnover ratio measures the average number of times inventory is sold during the period. The higher this ratio the more quickly inventory is being sold and therefore the more efficiently inventory is being used to generate sales.The days in inventory ratio measures the average age of the inventory—the average number of days products remain in inventory measured from the time the company produces or purchases the product to the time the product is sold to customers. Days in inventory is an easier ratio to interpret than inventory turnover but calculating days in inventory relies on first computing inventory turnover.Receivables Turnover The receivables turnover ratio measures the number of times on average that receivables are collected during the year.The average collection period shows the average number of days it takes a business to collect accounts receivables from customers. The average collection period should be evaluated in relation to the business’s credit terms; for many businesses accounts are due within 30 days.The average collection period is the easier of the two ratios to interpret but it cannot be calculated without first computing the receivables turnover.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) is the second main ratio that helps to assess the profitability of a business. It measures the return on shareholders’ equity—the profit relative to the investment of common shareholders (the true owners of the corporation). Because preferred dividends are reserved for and are paid out to preferred shareholders they do not belong to the common shareholders and are subtracted from income before calculating ROE.A ratio of 17 per cent indicates that for every dollar invested by common shareholders the corporation earns 17 cents in profit. ROE is affected by two factors: ROA and debt to total assets. Thus to improve its ROE a firm can improve its ROA increase its use of debt financing (known as increasing the use of leverage) or both. However more reliance on debt financing also increases the risk that the organization will be unable to make interest and principal repayments.Earnings per ShareThe third main measure of profitability is earnings per share (EPS) which looks at profitability from the perspective of common shareholders who are the residual owners of the corporation. It expresses net income on a per share basis. EPS is widely used to compare profitability from one year to the next or to compare actual profitability against expected profitability. The calculation looks simple but several accounting rules are applied to determine both the numerator (the income available to common shareholders) and the denominator (the weighted average number of common shares).EPS is the only ratio that public companies are required to publish in their financial statements. Announcements of expected or actual EPS can cause stock prices to fluctuate as the market reacts to the company’s initial projections and its subsequent performance against those goals. However because companies each have widely varying numbers of common shares EPS cannot be used for intercompany comparisons. Price-Earnings RatioThe price-earnings (P/E) ratio looks at the market price of shares compared with earnings expressed on a per share basis. A P/E ratio of 10 indicates that an investor is willing to pay $10 for every $1 the share currently earns. The P/E ratio is a measure of investors’ beliefs about the company’s future earnings potential. A high ratio indicates investors have confidence in the company and expect significant growth in profitability. Therefore they are willing to pay a higher price for shares. It might also indicate that the shares are overvalued in the marketplace making it a good time to sell those shares. A decreasing ratio indicates declining investor confidence. The average P/E ratio over the past 80 years has ranged between 14 and 15.Liquidity RatiosLiquidity ratios evaluate a company’s ability to pay its short-term debts as they come due. The ratios can be used within a company to track a business’s performance by comparing the ratios over periods of time. The ratios can also be used to assess a company’s performance compared with the performance of another company or compared with industry benchmarks. Current RatioCurrent assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash sold or used up within one year of the organization’s financial statement date. Current liabilities are debts that are expected to be paid within one year of the organization’s financial statement date.The current ratio measures a company’s current assets against its current liabilities. A current ratio of 1.8 means that for every dollar of current liabilities the business has $1.80 in current assets. A general rule of thumb is that this ratio should be at least 1.5 to 2.0 although as noted earlier industry benchmarks always take precedence over general rules of thumb. Acid Test Ratio (Quick Ratio)The acid test ratio assesses a company’s ability to pay its current liabilities with short-term assets that can be quickly converted to cash. An acid test ratio of 0.9 means that for every dollar a company has in current liabilities it has 90 cents in highly liquid assets to pay those current debts. As a rule of thumb a minimum healthy ratio is 0.9 to 1.0.The current ratio and the acid test ratio both measure a business’s short-term ability to pay its current debts as they come due. However the acid test ratio is a more accurate measure of liquidity because it excludes current assets that are not quickly turned into cash (e.g. inventory) or intended to be turned into cash (e.g. prepaid insurance and supplies). The inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover ratios discussed earlier as activity ratios (see Sections 4.1.6 and 4.1.7) are also liquidity ratios because a business’s ability to pay off its own current liabilities depends to a great extent on how quickly it can sell its inventory and in turn how quickly it can collect payment from its customers. For example if days in inventory is 53 days and the collection period is 45 days the business needs to wait a total of 98 days (days in inventory + collection period) before cash is available to pay its own suppliers and to pay other operating expenses.Solvency RatiosDebt RatioThe debt to total assets ratio (also referred to as the debt ratio) measures the percentage of a business’s assets that are financed by creditors. The ratio indicates how heavily a business relies on debt financing. A ratio of 0.55 means that for every dollar of assets 55 cents is financed by debt; or expressed another way 55 per cent of a business’s assets are financed by debt.The level of debt that a business can handle depends on its earnings. As well more capital intensive industries generally use more debt financing. However in general as the percentage of debt to total assets increases the risk also increases that the business may be unable to meet its maturing obligations and ongoing intere",,,,,,
"t payments. In general 0.60 to 0.70 is an acceptable level.Debt to Equity RatioThe debt to equity (D/E) ratio is a variation of the debt ratio. Where the debt to total assets ratio measures how much of a company’s assets are financed by debt the D/E ratio measures how much of a company’s debt is covered by shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings). A ratio of 0.7 means that for every dollar of shareholders’ equity there is 70 cents in liabilities. A high D/E ratio usually means that a company is being aggressive in using debt financing to leverage growth.Both the debt to assets and debt to equity ratios are sometimes calculated using long-term liabilities instead of total liabilities.Times Interest EarnedWhere EBIT refers to earnings before interest and taxes.The times interest earned ratio (also known as the interest coverage ratio) is one measure of a corporation’s ability to generate sufficient earnings to make interest payments as they come due. An acceptable range is typically 2.0 to 3.0 although again the suitability of this range varies by industry.Assessing ProfitabilityIf you are asked to evaluate the profitability of a specific alternative course of action your approach should depend on the level of detail provided in the case facts. A simple measure of profitability is to calculate the contribution margin (CM) of individual products.Variable costs are those costs that vary directly on a total basis with increases or decreases in sales such as labour or materials. As production volume increases total variable costs increase proportionately; as production volume decreases total variable costs decrease proportionately. Fixed costs are those costs that do not vary on a total basis with changes in sales; rather they need to be paid regardless of the level of business activity. Total fixed costs remain the same as long as sales fall within a relevant range of production. Examples of fixed costs include rent insurance utilities and property taxes.Variable costs per unit do not change as production volume changes while fixed costs per unit do change as production volume changes.You can calculate the contribution margin to compare the profitability of different services or products. Obviously the larger the margin the better for the company; but in any event a positive contribution margin is required to help cover the fixed costs associated with production and distribution. Another simple measure of profitability is to calculate the gross profit margin (see Section 4.1.3). Contribution margin is the better measure of profitability for decision making purposes—especially because it can be used to perform break-even analysis—but it requires having sufficient information from the case to distinguish between variable and fixed costs. Calculating the gross profit does not require the same detail.Finally if sufficient information is available in the case pro forma (forecast) income statements should be prepared for each alternative course of action you are evaluating.Break-even AnalysisOne of the most helpful management accounting tools for case analysis is break-even analysis. While the goal of a business is not to just break even (i.e. earn zero profit) knowing the break-even point for a specific product or a group of products helps to measure how risky a given new product venture might be. If expected sales do not exceed the break-even point a business will need to reconsider the product’s price find ways to reduce costs or both.A helpful variation on break-even analysis is to calculate the sales (in units or dollars) required to reach a target level of profit.Market Potential and Market Share Market potential (MP) is an estimate of the revenue a company can expect to make from a product or service it plans to market.Where	N = total number of customers 	P = average selling price 	Q = average annual consumption quantity	MS = market share which is the actual percentage of industry sales captured by a companySWOT AnalysisA SWOT analysis is an evaluation of the strengths (S) weaknesses (W) opportunities (O) and threats (T) faced by an organization. It is a popular tool for analyzing an organization’s internal and external environments to identify various issues. A SWOT analysis can also be used to generate pros and cons when evaluating alternative courses of action.Although strengths and weaknesses are listed first in the acronym the assessment of opportunities and threats (i.e. the external analysis) is usually performed before the internal analysis.Opportunities represent conditions in the external environment that an organization can take advantage of (by formulating and implementing appropriate strategies) to enhance its competitiveness profitability and overall success. Opportunities should not be confused with alternatives. For example an increase in the demand for dark chocolate because of its cancer-fighting antioxidants and heart-healthy properties represents an opportunity (a favourable environmental condition). To take advantage of this opportunity a confectionery company might consider alternatives such as switching some of its milk chocolate production capacity to dark chocolate or acquiring a company that specializes in the manufacture of dark chocolate.Threats represent conditions in the external environment that endanger the competitiveness profitability and success of the organization. For example the increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes pose threats to a confectionery company. Opportunities represent possibilities while threats pose constraints. Both are conditions that are outside an organization’s control. Strengths are activities the organization does very well or characteristics that enhance its competitiveness. Strengths can be found in skills expertise physical assets human assets or competitive advantages. Weaknesses are activities the organization does poorly (compared with its competitors) resources it lacks or internal conditions that make the organization vulnerable. These are areas that an organization can improve on; for example a retail business is vulnerable if it does not have an online sales presence but its competitors do.PESTLE AnalysisA PESTLE analysis (see Figure 1) identifies changes and trends in six segments of the general societal or macro environment: political (P) economic (E) socio-cultural (S) technological (T) legal (L) and environmental (E). The analysis is also variably referred to as PESTEL (or PEST analysis if only the first four factors are considered). It evaluates the potential impact of changes and trends in the environment on both the industry and the organization considering how the changes and trends affect supply demand competition and each element of the company’s value chain.A PESTLE analysis can be used as a stand-alone tool or it can be used in conjunction with a SWOT analysis to enhance the thoroughness of external analysis by more methodically identifying opportunities and threats.Figure 1: PESTLE AnalysisIn the body of a report use PESTLE to identify only the most important external forces. For example for an automobile manufacturer the most relevant forces might be abandonment of free trade agreements (P); increasing interest rates for car loans (E); pressure to use rapid transit systems (S); development of self-driving cars (T); higher damage awards for product safety violations (L); and lower emissions requirements (E). If it adds value to your report a more extensive description of external forces can be put in an appendix. Porter’s Five Forces Framework Porter’s five forces framework (see Figure 2) is used to evaluate five competitive forces that influence an industry’s profit potential or attractiveness and to identify where economic profit lies in an industry’s value chain (see Section 133.1). A five forces analysis can also be used to identify specific opportunities and threats in the industry such as introduction of a substitute product or increased competitive rivalry.Figure 2: Porter's Five ForcesThe threat of new entrants increases when barriers to entry are low for example whenthere are no economies of scale related to production marketing or distribution;product differentiation is low so new firms do not have to spend heavily on branding;capital requirements are low which makes entry into an industry less risky;switching costs are low so new firms do not need to offer major improvements to get a customer to switch brands; orfirms have easy access to distribution channels. Intensity of industry rivalry increases for example whenthe number of competitors increases;competitors are equal in size and capability; demand for the product is growing slowly; orcustomers’ costs to switch brands are low.Threat of substitutes (products that provide similar benefits) is high for example whenthe relative price of substitute products decreases; orcustomer switching costs are low.Supplier power is high for example whena supplier group is dominated by few companies;the supplier group’s product is unique;there are no or few substitute inputs; orsuppliers pose a credible threat of integrating forward into the organization’s business.Buyer power is high for example whenthe buyer group is concentrated or buyers purchase in large volumes;products purchased are undifferentiated;buyers earn low profits which creates pressure to lower purchasing costs; orbuyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward to make the organization’s product.In the body of a report Porter’s five forces analysis should be used judiciously to highlight key forces that make an industry attractive or unattractive to enter. For example in analyzing whether a restaurant should expand into catering an organization would encounter an unattractive industry characterized by high threat of new entrants (capital requirements are relatively low and product differentiation is hard to achieve); fierce rivalry (many restaurants are doing catering and demand for catered meals is growing slowly); high supplier power (there are only a few commercial food service companies); high buyer power (there are many caterers for buyers to choose from and often they offer the same type of food); and a moderately high threat of substitutes (going to a restaurant cooking yourself). A more complete Porter’s five forces can be placed in an appendix if you deem this to be value-added. Stakeholder AnalysisA stakeholder analysis identifies the relevant internal and external stakeholders (e.g. customers shareholders employees distributors suppliers and the local community) and what they need or expect from an organization as it pertains to the dilemma under consideration.After identifying potential stakeholders and their interests a company can either align its actions to meet the interests and needs of the stakeholders or it can manage its relationships with stakeholders by addressing the consequences of the company’s actions on the stakeholders.A grid similar to that shown in Figure 7 for resource gap analysis can be used to summarize the existing preferences of various stakeholders the new required preferences (i.e. to align with a particular alternative) major gaps between stakeholder expectations and corporate actions and ways to reduce those gaps. Industry Key Success FactorsIndustry key success factors (KSFs) identify what a company needs to succeed or win in the industry. KSFs include product qualities organizational capabilities resources and market achievements that combine to create value for customers and are critical for long-term competitive success in the industry. An industry usually has only two or three KSFs; rarely are there more than five or six.Identifying KSFs allows a company to assess its performance against industry KSFs. A company wants to perform well on all KSFs and be distinctively better on one or two to develop a competitive advantage. Value Chain AnalysisIndustry Value ChainAn industry value chain (see Figure 3) consists of the activities that contribute to the process of firms within an industry providing a valuable product or service. Most businesses buy products or supplies from another company transform them and then sell them to customers. Therefore an industry value chain includes the firms’ own value chains as well as the value chains of their suppliers and distributors.Figure 3: Industry Value Chain13.2	Organization Value ChainAn organization can use a value chain analysis to systematically identify its own capabilities and competitive advantages. Part of a sample value chain analysis for an organization is provided in Figure 4. The analysis is designed to evaluate the value chain of Birks Group a Canadian jewellery company. Analyzing Birks’ value chain identifies where the company’s primary and supporting activities can be leveraged and integrated to add value and build an advantage over a competitor.Figure 4: Value Chain Analysis Birks Group Competitive Position MatrixA competitive position matrix identifies competitive dimensions that add value and are important to the customer. Potential dimensions include price delivery price/quality mix product/service characteristics product/service scope and geographical scope. The matrix uses these dimensions to compare the positions of competitors in an industry (see Figure 5). Competitors with similar characteristics and market positions can be grouped to make competitive analysis more manageable.Figure 5: Competitive Position Matrix Canadian Furniture Retail Strategic Cluster Map A strategic cluster map (or strategic group map) provides a convenient visualization of the competitive position of various firms in the industry but the map limits the choice of competitive dimensions to two (see Figure 6).Figure 6: Strategic Cluster Map Canadian Furniture Retail Resource Gap AnalysisA resource gap analysis identifies an organization’s major gaps in resources and skills. It can be used to analyze issues and to develop the pros and cons for alternative courses of action.In Figure 7 a partially completed template for a resource-gap analysis identifies gaps in a university’s ability to serve adult learners through a continuing education program. Figure 7: Resource Gap Analysis Core CompetenciesCore competencies are skills and capabilities that an organization uses exceptionally well such as developing curriculum for a diverse audience or delivering instructional content using user-friendly online platforms. Analysis of an organization’s core competencies can be used to identify strengths as part of a SWOT analysis. When core competencies involve competitively important value chain activities the competencies can evolve into competitive advantages. Competitive Advantage Analysis: VRIOThe VRIO framework developed by Jay Barney suggests that resources and capabilities may offer a competitive advantage if they are valuable (V) rare (R) and inimitable (I) (i.e. difficult to imitate) and the firm is organized (O) to capitalize on those resources and capabilities. Resources are valuable if they contribute to meeting customers’ needs at the price that customers are willing to pay. Resources are also valuable if they enable a company to develop alternatives to exploit opportunities mitigate threats and improve efficiency or effectiveness. Resources and capabilities are rare if only a few competing firms possess them. Resources and capabilities are inimitable if they are costly and difficult to imitate. Resources could be inimitable because they are physically unique; have been built up over time based on specific experiences (e.g. unique historical conditions); result from interpersonal relationships group norms or culture (social complexity); or because it is difficult to identify the resource its value or its competitive advantages (causal ambiguity). Finally resources and capabilities provide a competitive advantage only if the firm is organized—that is the firm has the necessary structure such as the appropriate employees management organization control systems reward systems and culture—to capitalize on its resources and capabilities. Case Analysis and Academic IntegrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.",0,,,,,

Davies was the president of Wellington Brewery a well-established craft brewery located in Guelph Ontario Canada. Wellington Brewery had recently completed a successful expansion of its operations. The expansion had taken place during a period of explosive growth in Canada’s craft brewery industry. As part of the expansion project the company had increased the size of its premises by 1700 square metres (18300 square feet). It had also upgraded its facilities with new state-of-the-art equipment for brewing canning and water treatment. The expansion process had successfully transitioned Wellington Brewery from a small company to a medium-sized operation. Within only a few years the craft brewery’s operations had expanded significantly. Among its greatest assets Wellington Brewery acknowledged its employees cutting-edge equipment and product quality and consistency. In fact the brewery sought to create consistently handcrafted beer products with every batch and never took shortcuts in the brewing process. The recently upgraded equipment significantly increased the company’s efficiency in the beer-canning process and improved quality control of the product. These enhancements clearly supported Wellington Brewery’s overall goal of expansion across the entire Ontario market. The brewery already performed exceptionally well locally. The next step was to continue expanding beyond its own community and throughout the province.Wellington Brewery faced strong competition from other craft breweries in the province but also from giant multinational “macrobreweries.” However the company boasted a competitive advantage over macrobreweries simply due to its smaller scale which allowed the craft brewery to offer more expensive and exquisite ingredients in its beer such as interesting fruits and carefully chosen additives to brew a selection of unique-tasting small-batch craft beers. After completing its recent expansion project Wellington Brewery faced the challenges of an unpredictable and oversaturated market. Ontario’s craft brewery industry was characterized by unexpected growth shifting consumer preferences and intense competition for shelf space at limited retail outlets. Davies urgently needed to plan his company’s continuing expansion and ensure that Wellington Brewery remained relevant and financially strong during challenging times.INDUSTRY BACKGROUNDThe Beer Industry in CanadaIn 2018 the global beer market was worth CA$895 billion and was expected to continue growing. Of the estimated 25000–30000 breweries around the world most produced less than 1000 hectolitres (hl) per year. Beer was Canada’s most popular alcoholic beverage. In 2018 Canadian beer sales reached $20.2 billion and were forecasted to reach $22.1 billion by 2023. The Canadian beer market was dominated by two multinational companies—Molson Coors Beverage Company and Labatt Brewing Company Limited (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev). These two industry giants controlled 50 per cent of the Canadian market while the myriad of much smaller craft breweries together accounted for only approximately a 9 per cent share. Between 2016 and 2018 Canada saw a 30 per cent increase in the launch of new breweries reaching a total of 901 companies in the industry. Despite this increase however beer consumption in Canada remained relatively flat over the previous decade and dropped by 0.7 per cent during 2019. This trend was attributed to various factors including an increasingly health-conscious consumer base; lower drinking rates among younger customers; and growing cider wine and spirits industries. Non-alcoholic beer also saw tremendous growth in 2018 with a 31 per cent growth in total volume.The beer industry was unpredictable for various reasons: consumption seasonality explosive growth changing consumer preferences (e.g. products being made sustainably) aggressive innovation from smaller breweries and uncertain Canadian and provincial regulations. Until 2015 only the government-owned Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) and The Beer Store (TBS) were authorized to sell alcoholic beverages. In 2019 TBS accounted for 63 per cent of total beer sales in the province which was a decrease from 66 per cent in 2018. TBS traditionally sold mainstream beer brands in packages of 24 bottles whereas the LCBO offered over 28000 alcoholic beverage products including beer in individual cans or small packs. The LCBO also acted as wholesaler to approximately 450 grocery stores in the province. In 2019 the LCBO’s sales of beer wine and cider to grocery stores grew by 60.8 per cent for a total of $246.7 million. That same year grocery store sales represented 80 per cent of its market share gain by volume. The LCBO’s e-commerce channel was also steadily growing by 72 per cent year-over-year reaching $19.5 million in 2019. The price of alcohol was regulated and consistent throughout the province regardless of the specific retailer. The LCBO reported directly to Canada’s Minister of Finance and provided $6.39 billion in revenue. In 2019 the LCBO transferred $2.37 billion in dividends to the Ontario Government. For convenience beer distribution channels in Canada were classified into two categories: on-premises and off-premises. On-premises locations which allowed consumers to drink beer directly included bars and restaurants. Off-premises locations which allowed consumers to purchase beer but not to directly consume it included the LCBO TBS grocery stores and e-commerce outlets. In 2018 the LCBO and TBS were the most popular off-premises beer distribution channels generating $5.0 billion in sales. On-premises locations such as bars and restaurants generated $9.0 billion in beer sales. Craft BeerThe craft brewing industry a sub-sector of the overall beer industry offered premium beverage products. From 2014 to 2018 the Canadian craft beer industry experienced significant growth almost doubling in revenue from $1.0 billion to $1.9 billion. Although a comprehensive definition for the terms “craft brewery” or “microbrewery” was not officially established microbreweries were understood to represent companies that produced less than 50000 hl annually. The federal government typically licensed craft breweries that produced 400000 hl or less per year and were independently owned and operated. For example Brick Brewing Co. Limited (renamed Waterloo Brewing Ltd. in 2019) in Kitchener Ontario was a certified craft brewery. Most craft breweries in Canada produced 5000 hl or less per year. Companies that produced over 400000 hl such as the two multinational beer companies that dominated Canada’s beer industry were categorized as “macrobreweries.” In contrast the Canadian craft brewing industry was highly fragmented with hundreds of small breweries typically focused on serving local communities although some of the larger craft breweries catered to the entire province. Ontario was home to 315 breweries but only two-thirds of them sold their beer in retail outlets such as the LCBO TBS or grocery stores.Craft beer consumers whose tastes changed rapidly were mainly interested in the experience locality and the variety of products that craft breweries offered. In contrast to macrobrewery customers these consumers also tended to have less brand loyalty and to prefer ale to lager. Sales of ale the most consumed craft beer grew from $905.2 million in 2014 to $1.7 billion in 2018. Emerging and alternative trends in the industry included canned nitrogenated beer and non-alcoholic beer.Despite environmental uncertainty and regulatory constraints affecting the entire industry the Canadian craft beer industry continued to grow. Reasons for growth included changing demographics consumer preferences for unique products and new experiences and overall support from vital retail partners. Specifically in Canada the growth of the craft beer industry was influenced by the country’s generally favourable demographic social political economic and environmental characteristics (see Exhibit 1).BRENT DAVIES WELLINGTON BREWERY’s PresidentWellington Brewery earned $10 million in revenues in 2019. It was one of Canada’s oldest and largest independently owned craft breweries. The brewery was initially known for its darker craft beers which were offered throughout Canada’s most populated province Ontario. Davies started working at Wellington Brewery in 1995 but left the company in 2000 to pursue a career in the chemical industry. However in 2010 Davies returned to Wellington Brewery as partner and vice-president with responsibilities in the company’s sales and marketing divisions. In 2016 Davies was appointed president. At the time he owned 60 per cent of the brewery and held 90 per cent voting rights. The remaining control of the company was spread among small investors with limited voting rights.In addition to his close affinity with the business Davies had a passion for beer and a deep understanding of consumer choices. During his interactions with customers at the LCBO stores he would often ask people why they chose a specific product. He was proud of Wellington Brewery’s award-winning beers and sought to expand people’s palette with high-quality tasting products. As the brewery expanded Davies knew that upcoming decisions were critical. He believed that any decisions about the business strategy and long-term vision would need to respect yet help evolve the company’s culture. COMPANY BACKGROUNDWellington Brewery’s expansion in 2015–16 increased the organization’s annual brewing capacity from 24000 hl to 80000 hl. In addition to state-of-the-art brewing equipment upgrades the company purchased a second building to make room for offices and inventory a new canning line to increase efficiency and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The company also installed a complete water treatment system to improve the longevity of the equipment and to reduce water usage and waste. As of 2019 the brewery employed 45 staff including full-time and part-time positions depending on the seasonality of the business. Wellington Brewery’s respect and pride in its employees was reflected by the company’s impressive retention rate. For example the brewery’s vice-presidents of finance sales and brewing had been with the company for an average of 16 years. Its experienced staff helped Wellington Brewery master the challenging product submission process through the LCBO as Davies explained: Because we’ve been around so long we know the process to plan timing-wise. We got it so our last couple brands—our product launches—we were early to market and we had things well in advance to LCBO. We got approvals through and we got it out there.Long-tenured employees contributed to corporate memory provided stability within the business facilitated creativity and readily provided their expertise. However Davies was aware that long-time employees could also be more resistant to change and more heavily relied upon rather than establishing more automated processes. Wellington Brewery’s top management team described the company culture as “very family and community-oriented.” This type of culture worked well as long as the company remained relatively small. However with the expansion of the brewery and additional staff added to the team Davies acknowledged the need for a more balanced approach between focusing on maintaining a “family” feel and integrating more structured roles into the business. Davies noted that “when you’re small everybody’s doing everything. But now the thing is you can’t. You can’t do everything. You can’t have those pressures all the time.”Some members of the top management team were responsible for multiple managerial roles which reduced their ability to take on additional tasks or projects. The brewery had to start implementing its new inventory management system but it was difficult to find the right time and the right person to manage the project which incurred delays. That person would likely to be selected from among the busiest people in the company. Stress and confusion arose in reporting lines due to multiple roles held by some employees. Davies felt that a revised organizational structure was needed to support growth plans formalize processes clarify roles and responsibilities and reduce employee workload. COMMUNITYThe community was a crucial element of the craft brewing industry. Craft beers were locally handcrafted authentic products. Wellington Brewery maintained its connection to the community through engagements in local events charitable work and donations to local causes. Davies felt that “those decisions kind of become stand-in for a lot of things I think are really important and in broader relationship building.” Some initiatives included collaborations with local organizations such as donations to Pride support groups based on the sale of a specific beer brand or hiring local artists to design beer coasters. Despite its goal to expand across the entire province Wellington Brewery was eager to retain the local brand feel and connections it had established within its community. A craft brewery’s community was dependent on location size and strategy. Some regions and communities were more receptive than others to craft beer. In fact the number of Canadian beer drinkers that consumed craft products ranged widely from 26 per cent to 50 per cent of the population depending on the geographical location. Therefore craft breweries needed to decide whether to focus their efforts on competing in a popular craft beer market or instead tap into a smaller market and build up the brand by educating new craft beer consumers. In Ontario’s highly competitive Toronto market for example a craft brewery’s community could vary from the entire city to a geographical portion such as east Toronto or the downtown core or even a specific neighbourhood such as The Danforth or Etobicoke. A brewery could focus on specific stores within a small area to sell its products to a targeted consumer group. Alternatively it could instead cater to a much broader range of consumers. For example Waterloo Brewing Ltd. chose to expand its market share by acquiring province-wide distribution rights for several major beer brands including Laker Seagram Coolers and LandShark. Smaller breweries looking for growth needed to be more creative due to their limited access to capital. An alternative to acquisition was to develop long-term sustainable relationships with retailers outside the community. To achieve this craft breweries could leverage their existing connections with local LCBO stores and licensees to help them expand. Other options included sponsoring events and sports teams outside their city and developing innovative methods for bringing people from outside the community to the brewery. The craft brewery industry was generally collaborative. Companies often relied on each other during times of need and shared their knowledge at professional events. These practices helped produce resourceful teams and promoted rapid pivoting when information was needed. For example when Wellington Brewery’s equipment was experiencing rapid degradation due to the city’s hard water the company’s vice-president of brewing and another employee leveraged their expertise to build a network of contacts who worked in wastewater management and water treatment services. Using this knowledge the company was able to assess the problem and procure a new water system. One employee outlined his experience: It all ties back into [the fact that] we always try to get people out in the community to try and learn to make better beers. The [brewery] would put me out in trade shows to connect with people and network. So if any of these things come up I know who to contact.PRODUCT FOCUSWellington Brewery was customarily known as an English-style craft brewery with ale as its featured beer type. In the past several years its product line focused on three core brands and an assortment of experimental small-batch and seasonal beers. The company’s high-volume production brands—a traditional ale an India pale ale and a lager—were aimed at a wide consumer base and required different brewing strategies than its low-volume production brands which were usually experimental beers aimed at consumers seeking a novel beer-drinking experience. Therefore the two different product lines required the company to attract two different customer segments which also divided Wellington Brewery staff members. A senior executive felt that staff members were conflicted between “putting out products that sell versus products that are innovative.” Davies agreed that producing award-winning experimental beers would build “street cred” (short for “street credibility” or acceptability among fashionable beer consumers) and thus draw more customers to the brewery. However he also recognized that although lager was not Wellington Brewery’s choice of beer type it represented the largest beer market segment and could be an important source of revenue for the company. Because traditional ale products had always been associated with Wellington Brewery’s identity adding a lager to the product mix would require a significant shift in business culture.COMPETITORSWellington Brewery viewed the two international macrobreweries Molson Coors Beverage Company and Anheuser-Busch InBev as major competitors in Canada’s overall brewing industry. Wellington Brewery’s mainstream beers were intended to increase sales and faced direct competition for shelf space from the two brewery giants. However over the previous three years the overall craft brewery segment had helped flatten Canadian sales volumes of the two multinational breweries which reflected a consumer trend away from traditional beer consumption.Wellington Brewery saw all other craft breweries as collaborators but it nonetheless competed against local and nearby craft breweries. For example Guelph’s innovative small-batch craft brewery was home to Royal City Brewery and Fixed Gear Brewing while in nearby Waterloo the mid-sized multi-branded brewery Waterloo Brewing Ltd. had earned annual revenue of $53.7 million in 2019. Guelph was also home to Sleeman Breweries (owned by Sapporo Breweries) a large traditional brewery that sold both domestic and imported beer products.THE PRODUCTION OF BEER Beer had been produced in Canada since 1646. Key ingredients in the production of beer included malts (i.e. converted grains often barley) hops (i.e. flowers of the hop plant) and yeast. Specific temperatures and times depended on the beer’s recipe. Yeasts were re-added throughout the process to produce sugars some of which transformed into alcohol. The company’s brewmaster would create recipes for traditional beer (e.g. lager or ale) or experimental beer (e.g. sour fruit beer) by using a variety of additives and customizations. Compared with both smaller craft breweries and larger traditional breweries Wellington Brewery’s advantage was its ability to produce large amounts of experimental beer although some ingredients and additives proved challenging to scale for high volumes.The addition of new canning and brewing equipment enabled Wellington Brewery to significantly increase its efficiency. The company went from producing 20 hl per large batch in six hours to 40 hl per large batch in only two and a half hours. The new equipment also helped increase malt-processing efficiency and reduce water waste. Brewed beer sat in tanks for approximately two to four weeks until it was ready for packaging. In recent years cans had become the predominant packaging choice over glass bottles. The shift to cans provided a more environmental option and resulted in a better-tasting product. Cans could block ultraviolet light more effectively than bottles which helped limit product spoilage. Wellington Brewery employed a pilot system to experiment with different combinations of ingredients. Its low-volume capability allowed the company to produce single products or “one-offs” and later scale up to large volumes. Wellington Brewery was thus able to quickly react to consumer trends and release new products each week in the company’s brewhouse. These frequent releases provided an opportunity to experiment gauge customer reactions and collect customer preference data at a relatively low cost. Impact of REGULATORY CHANGES Both provincial and federal governments regulated the sale of alcohol in Ontario. An annual excise tax was based on the beer’s alcohol percentage and production volume. In 2018 and 2019 Canada’s alcoholic beverage industry faced various challenges and some opportunities due to legislation changes. Legalization of cannabis in Canada went into effect in October 2018 and cannabis-infused beverages were allowed to be sold starting in December 2019. These legislative initiatives provided opportunities for craft breweries to enter the new cannabis-infused beverage market. In addition the sale of beer in grocery stores which had started in December 2015 had reached an Ontario government goal of enabling 450 grocery stores in the province to sell beer. This new market segment provided access to a new retail option for many breweries across Ontario. In 2016 the sale of alcohol was made available by mail directly to consumers which opened a new opportunity for many breweries to set up an e-commerce platform. Discussions had also begun on the topic of making the sale of alcohol available in Ontario’s numerous convenience stores although no decisions had yet been made on this potential new distribution outlet.Wellington Brewery’s management team had not yet expressed an interest in the cannabis-infused beverage market. However grocery store sales provided high margins and e-commerce was an especially promising sales vehicle for the upcoming Christmas holiday season so the company decided to enter both of these markets. Discussions by Ontario’s regulators on the prospect of allowing beer sales in the province’s convenience stores were still in early stages and remained unpredictable. Wellington Brewery was also licensed for the sale of cider but had yet to decide whether or not to diversify into this segment which could be an important consideration if a drop in beer sales occurred. However the company was comfortable remaining focused on beer production at this stage. As Davies noted the company had “historically done beer very well and still [saw] lots of room to grow.”WELLINGTON BREWERY’S SALES MIX AND DISTRIBUTIONWellington Brewery generated revenues from both on-premises sales channels such as the company’s onsite brewhouse or licensees (e.g. bars and restaurants) and off-premises sales channels such as retailers. The brewhouse was the company’s most profitable revenue source but represented only a small portion of total revenues whereas off-premises retailer sales channels such as the LCBO and e-commerce generated greater revenue amounts that were fundamental to the company’s growth. Another important revenue channel was contract brewing which referred to Wellington Brewery offering its brewing premises and expertise to other breweries that did not have their own facilities. The breakdown of Wellington Brewery’s sales mix consisted of approximately 25 per cent LCBO 30 per cent licensees 25 per cent contract brewing 10 per cent TBS and 10 per cent brewhouse revenue. Although macrobreweries typically sold their product in standard cases of 24 beers through TBS craft brewery sales consisted mainly of low-number packs or single-unit sales. Therefore the craft brewery segment’s relationship with TBS was increasingly becoming insignificant. In contrast the craft brewery segment’s relationship with the LCBO licensees contract brewing and e-commerce was critical (see Exhibit 2). The LCBOThe LCBO dominated retail distribution in Ontario. Getting a product onto the retailer’s shelves was challenging for craft breweries. The LCBO used a web-based product submission process called the New Item Submission System (NISS). This process required a new product to pass through a series of stages ranging from setting price parameters to product tasting which lasted at least six weeks. Several factors affected a craft brewery’s ability to be accepted and remain active in the LCBO stores. After a product was accepted its shelf space was reviewed weekly. The LCBO preferred stocking beer products in cans of 473 millilitres and required a minimum of 20 litres of the product to be sold in each store within a specific period. Each year a random sample from every product listed on the LCBO was sent to its quality assurance department for analysis of alcohol content and packaging. If a product’s alcohol content was found to be over its advertised level by as little as 0.5 per cent the entire listing could be removed from the shelves. Therefore Wellington Brewery made consistency a critical aspect of its business.Before completing the NISS process a craft brewery needed to establish a relationship with LCBO’s head office and individual store managers. Dedicated brewery sales teams participated in ongoing relationship-building efforts and presented their new products. This process was labour-intensive and competitive. Shelf space at the LCBO stores was limited and macrobreweries occupied a considerable amount of the available space. Davies was aware that new-product applications to the LCBO were required for both core and seasonal brands. The LCBO maintained an updated product-need item list through the NISS to guide new-product submissions. As Davies explained “the better a product’s performance ratio the better chance it had at getting a subsequent product in or in scoring a seasonal listing.” Wellington Brewery modified its tactics over time to maintain a positive relationship with the LCBO. For example the company decided to adopt the LCBO’s preferred format of 473-millilitre cans for its beer. As well the company used its own distribution service rather than a third party to better leverage opportunities to build rapport and connections with buyers. Among other strategies Wellington Brewery offered tasting notes and comparable products to the LCBO store managers and ensured quality and consistency through lab testing before submission of its products. The LCBO also offered companies monthly in-store marketing opportunities such as product sampling services and end-of-aisle placement. However the cost of these promotions was usually too high for craft breweries such as Wellington Brewery and was therefore used mainly by macrobreweries.LicenseesAccording to Davies retail sales channels tended to provide higher margins for the brewery than licensee sales channels such as bars and restaurants. However licensees also served a critical purpose of promoting a local presence and collecting valuable information about consumer trends product sales and competitors. Therefore Wellington Brewery opted for a relatively high portion of its product distribution through licensees compared with most of its competitors. Its sales mix was set at approximately 60 per cent retail and 40 per cent licensees compared with the sales mix of most competitors at 80 per cent retail and 20 per cent licensees. However securing permanent beer brand placement on-tap at a licensee such as a bar or restaurant was becoming increasingly difficult. As Davies explained macrobreweries tended to offer financial incentives to licensees to gain on-tap brand placement which craft breweries were unable to afford. As well with licensees frequently rotating their beer taps and adding new product lines the required amount of beer from each brewery could drop significantly. Therefore although Davies delivered beer kegs to licensees in person to build connections and gather information he was also working diligently to grow Wellington Brewery’s retail presence especially through the LCBO. The aim was to gradually reduce the company’s dependence on licensees and contract brewing. To achieve this goal the business needed to find ways to make its core brands self-sustainable by generating consistent and long-term revenue through higher-margin retail channels while reducing reliance on lower-margin revenue streams. Contract BrewingContract brewing provided a crucial revenue source for many breweries despite its low margins. Wellington Brewery provided its production facility and expertise at a cost to breweries that did not have their own brewing premises which helped counter lower-than-expected sales of its own product. However contract brewing did introduce various challenges. The process was labour-intensive and tended to require extensive mentoring especially for less established contract breweries. There was also a potential impact on Wellington Brewery’s financial situation if a contract brewery was unable to pay for the services rendered. From a list of up to eight contract brewery prospects Wellington Brewery narrowed its focus on only a couple of well-paying partners which provided both significant benefits and potential risks. For example despite a favourable working relationship with one major contract partner Wellington Brewery suffered a revenue shortfall when the contract brewery’s production was unexpectedly reduced to 60 per cent of its 2019 forecast as a Wellington Brewery senior executive explained: We were actually able to negotiate a really good rate. Because they are so big their beer is cheaper to make per litre than some of our other contracts in the past and we actually didn’t have to eat too much on the margin to get this huge sum of volume. The problem is it leaves us very much exposed. [If] they don’t get their forecast right it has huge implications for your financial forecasting and that’s basically what happened.E-CommerceThe introduction of e-commerce as a new off-premises retail option was both beneficial and challenging for craft breweries. Difficulties included regulated mandatory shipping through Canada Post standard shipping fees added to orders (as opposed to being built into the selling price) the cost of packaging and the labour-intensive processing of online orders which required different packaging and shipping processes than the company’s usual format. Wellington Brewery initially chose to use Shopify Inc. (Shopify) as its e-commerce platform and engaged in benchmark research to generate ideas for the packaging processing and shipping of beer. The brewery was still looking for ways to improve the end consumer’s online ordering experience when customers purchased Wellington Brewery products. For example through Shopify’s data analytics services Wellington Brewery identified a recurring issue with dropped online shopping carts during the checkout phase. The company assessed the problem and addressed the issue by finding a mutually beneficial revenue and costs solution involving shipping and processing fees which was passed onto the consumer. MANUAL PROCESSES AND INSIGHTS FROM DATAWellington Brewery conducted various manual processes to support routine tasks and operations. The manual processes included tracking inventory on paper and then physically verifying the amounts forecasting sales using Microsoft Excel recording licensee payments using Excel and telephone calls recording production amounts on paper and in ",,,,,
xcel and extracting sales data from the brewhouse point-of-sales system (TouchBistro) and inputting it into Excel. Wellington Brewery deemed these manual processes suitable and efficient because new beer recipes were frequently created and modified which was convenient for its current legacy systems to create in-depth reports. Additionally manual processes enabled interaction and promoted data analysis. However with the organization’s expansion and growth automated processes would inevitably become critical to improve overall efficiency. Davies was hoping to improve the manual processes by leveraging digital technology to increase efficiency save time and produce additional data. In recent years Wellington Brewery had started using data for sales-based tracking and to identify comparable products for submission to the LCBO. For example the company was using the DigThisData platform a business software-as-a-service application for alcohol vendors to regularly monitor LCBO and TBS data. The software provided performance competition and product data with a two-week delay. Wellington Brewery used the data to better position its products and improve sales forecasting. Wellington Brewery also used Ekos an ERP system designed for the craft brewery industry that involved complex implementation and time-consuming project management. However Davies was not sure the Ekos ERP system was the most suitable choice for the company’s needs. Marketing DataWellington Brewery collected marketing data through its own monthly newsletter to customers analytic data provided by the Shopify platform and Google Analytics. The company’s marketing department also remained abreast of new trends by monitoring secondary research data such as Beer Canada reports US market reports international trends and relevant social media activity. The objective was to continue expanding strategically across the province and build the brand’s reputation. Monthly campaign budgets were determined on an ad hoc basis depending on current needs. Davies hoped to find creative ways to communicate Wellington Brewery’s history and value proposition across the province without sacrificing its strong local presence. CONCLUSIONWellington Brewery’s business strategy was fluid. The company was proactive in assessing risk and in finding ways to improve cash flow. The major recent expansion had been successful but it had required Wellington Brewery to incur considerable costs. The highest priority at this point was to recuperate those investment expenses. Davies was prepared to use all available information to devise a strategic path forward for his company. EXHIBIT 1: DOING BUSInESS in CANADACanada was a North American country that shared its southern border with the United States. The country’s demographics were diverse. In 2019 it had a population of over 37 million people of which almost 90 per cent were either immigrants or descendants of immigrants. Canada’s population included over 100 indigenous tribes comprising approximately 250000 indigenous Canadians. Canada was democratic country with a parliamentary system in a constitutional monarchy. As Canada was a member of the British Commonwealth its reigning monarch was Queen Elizabeth II although her role in terms of Canada was limited. Canada was organized as a federation with 10 provinces and three territories and three government levels: federal provincial or territorial and municipal. Canada had maintained strong political stability and was considered one of the safest countries in the world. Canada was a good place to do business. It featured a growing global trade network that provided Canadians with access to global market opportunities. Specifically Canada had 14 free trade agreements in place with 51 countries giving it preferential access to international markets. The Liberal Party of Canada led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been in power since October 2015 during which time several major regulatory laws and changes had taken place that impacted the food and beverages industry. Specific to the beer industry policies governing alcohol availability were set and enforced by provincial liquor control or licensing boards. In all jurisdictions except the province of Alberta these same provincial boards were responsible for the sale of alcohol through their own network of retail stores. Regulations regarding the sales of beer had been revised to allow beer sales in grocery stores and convenience stores in Ontario starting in late 2015. Alcohol sale regulations varied widely across all Canadian provinces and territories with Ontario having the most complex system. Therefore doing business in multiple jurisdictions was usually limited to larger businesses and smaller craft breweries tended to sell their products only within their own province. Canada was one of the top trading nations in the world. Canada’s gross domestic product was expected to increase by 1.8 per cent in 2020 and 1.9 per cent in 2021 consisting of only minor improvements from the 2019 gain of 1.7 per cent. Healthy labour markets and modest increases in consumer spending were likely to benefit Canada’s economy. Labour laws and regulatory changes continued to have an impact on Canada’s workforce. The government intended to modernize federal labour standards to benefit Canadian workers and assist employers. Existing and upcoming changes included improving eligibility for entitlements helping with work–life balance providing fair treatment and compensation for unpredictable (e.g. short-term contract seasonal) work ensuring sufficient notice and compensation when jobs are terminated and improving the administration of labour standards.Business investments in Canada had trended downward in recent years and Canada’s trade sector would continue to be impacted by minimal global growth. In contrast interest rates were not expected to change in 2020 as global economic conditions stabilized. As one of Canada’s key provinces Ontario produced 37 per cent of the national gross domestic product and featured distinctive exports manufacturing expertise resources and innovation trends. Ontario was known for its manufacturing industries including medical devices biotechnology pharmaceuticals and information and communications technologies. Additionally the province was home to more than half of Canada’s best farmland. It featured more than 50000 farms that produced almost 25 per cent of all farm revenue in Canada.Many of Canada’s manufacturing sectors were shifting toward Industry 4.0 digitalization automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and business systems to drive innovation. It was becoming increasingly affordable for companies to make the digital shift as consumers become more technology-savvy than ever. Exhibit 1 (Continued)Canadians were increasingly relying on mobile devices for everyday living—especially shopping. Increasingly consumers relied on mobile payments navigating the Internet on a smart phone and numerous other mobile platform services. Software-as-a-service technology and data warehouse management solutions provided companies with new sources of data and analysis for higher efficiency and trend monitoring. Artificial intelligence and data analytics were key drivers of digital transformation and automation for businesses both internally and throughout the supply chain. Several cultural trends were likely to impact future Canadian businesses. First millennials (people born between 1980 to 2000) were at the forefront of the consumer revolution and were often characterized as being frugal shrewd and lacking in brand loyalty. They were most likely to use smart phones social networking and online shopping. Increasingly Canadians were seeking personalized and immediate interaction with instant access to information and goods such as Amazon.com Inc.’s promise of next-day delivery on many of its products. Canadians were also exercising more consuming more natural and organic products and choosing products based on dietary restrictions.Canada was North America’s largest country by area with vast natural open spaces. Despite some environmental concerns such as pollution of natural regions and rapidly changing weather patterns numerous tourists chose Canada for its natural landscape and scenery. Climate change clean fuels carbon tax strategy air quality environmental testing and renewable energy developments were among its environmental concerns. Businesses in Canada increasingly sought green options to become more environmentally sustainable with initiatives such as reducing single-use plastics improved waste diversion sustainable food initiatives use of nuclear power and electric transportation.Source: e-Visa “General Information about Canada” e-Visa.ie accessed July 14 2020 https://e-visa.ie/canada/general; Government of Canada “Spotlight on Market Diversification” November 20 2019 accessed July 13 2020 www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/guides/spotlight-pleins_feux/spotlight-diversification-pleins-feux-diversification.aspx?lang=eng&utm_source=business&utm_medium=slideshow-en; Government of Canada “Prime Minister Justin Trudeau” June 9 2013 accessed October 20 2020 https://pm.gc.ca/en/prime-minister-justin-trudeau; “Beer Sales Guide to the Provinces and Territories” CBC News April 16 2015 accessed December 15 2020 www.cbc.ca/news/business/beer-sales-guide-to-the-provinces-and-territories-1.3036387; Conference Board of Canada “Canadian Outlook Summary: Winter 2020” December 17 2019 accessed July 14 2020 www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10543; Government of Canada Employment and Social Development Canada “Labour Program: Changes to the Canada Labour Code and Other Acts to Better Protect Workplaces” November 7 2018 accessed July 17 2020 www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/laws-regulations/labour/current-future-legislative.html; Government of Ontario “About Ontario” June 5 2013 accessed July 14 2020 www.ontario.ca/page/about-ontario; Tetra Pak INDUSTRY 4.0—Opening a Door to New Opportunities for the Food and Beverage Industry 3 accessed January 3 29021 www.tetrapak.com/content/dam/tetrapak/publicweb/us/en/automation/tetra-pak-industry4-whitepaper.pdf; PwC Industry 4.0: Building the Digital Enterprise Industrial Manufacturing Key Findings 5 accessed January 3 2021 www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/industrial-manufacturing/publications/assets/pwc-building-digital-enterprise.pdf; Business Development Bank of Canada “5 Consumer Trends that Will Transform Your Business” 2017 accessed July 14 2020 www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/marketing-sales-export/marketing/pages/5-consumer-trends-watch-out-for-2017.aspx; ECO Canada “Environmental Trends 2020” blog January 31 2020 accessed July 16 2020 www.eco.ca/blog/environmental-trends-2020.EXHIBIT 2: WELLINGTON BREWERY’S SALES CHANNELSNote: N/A = not applicable.Source: Company files. endnotes,1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,,

He had invited all key personnel of the DMRC to discuss the strategy to make its recent takeover of the Delhi Airport Metro (DAM) viable. Since its inception in 2008 DAM had operated on a public–private partnership model yet it was continuously operating at a loss. The DAM ran from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) to the New Delhi railway station which was 17 kilometres away. There were many challenges before Sharma including a low occupancy rate of the DAM unsustainable revenues and an inability to meet operating expenses. Because any new metro line also had significant capital expenditure it was going to be difficult for Sharma to come up with the necessary changes to make the venture viable—unless a reduction in operating expenses supported them. How the company should rationalize the fare increase non-fare revenue and attract more people to the DAM were some immediate questions that he and his team had to address to revive the company that they had taken over. The Indian EconomyDespite a slowdown in world economies after the 2008 crisis India had kept the pace of economic growth alive and was projected to overtake both the United Kingdom and France in 2018 to become the fifth-largest economy in the world with a nominal gross domestic product of US$2.9 trillion. In a period when several developed countries were witnessing slowdowns in growth the Indian economy recorded high rates of growth among the emerging economies second only to China. The National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi found itself uniquely positioned as the world’s second most populous urban agglomeration. Beginning with mid-1991 the government made some radical changes in its policies related to foreign trade foreign direct investment exchange rate industry and fiscal discipline. Migrants preferred to reside in the affordable suburbs. As per the 2011 Census of India Delhi had the highest population density out of all Indian states and Union Territories with 11297 people per square kilometre (km2) compared to the national average of 382 people per km2. The task of providing an efficient mode of transportation in such a densely populated city made the DMRC a lifeline in the NCR. the DELHI AIRPORT METRO LINEBetween 2000 and 2010 international traffic quadrupled at IGI in Delhi while the number of domestic passengers many of whom flew in and out of Delhi on single-day trips increased by seven times. Before February 2011 commuter services to the airport were limited to expensive taxis and unreliable public buses leaving most passengers frustrated and dissatisfied. The XIX Commonwealth Games were to be held in New Delhi in October 2010. This event was expected to attract many athletes officials journalists support staff and spectators. The anticipated increase in air traffic created the need for a rapid transit system to connect the Delhi airport to various parts of the city. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) awarded the contract to expand the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) in order to accommodate the projected traffic and bring its services in line with international standards. The airport was about 17 km southwest of the New Delhi railway station near Connaught Place—one of the city’s busy business districts. Because airport traffic faced congestion the AAI desired a dedicated rail connection to the airport. In November 2004 the AAI commissioned the DMRC and RITES Limited to prepare a detailed project report.A new terminal of the airport—Terminal 3—was to be constructed and connected to the city centre by a new state-of-the-art mass rapid transit system similar to those in Singapore and Hong Kong. The AAI sanctioned the project in April 2007. The DMRC was commissioned to complete tasks with long lead times including land acquisition and the civil construction of tunnels viaducts and stations. It was funded through viability gap funding provided by the federal government and by grants from the Delhi Development Authority and DIAL. The DMRC also commissioned two electrical substations to supply electrical power to the DAM.The DAM was financed through a public–private partnership using a hybrid build-operate-transfer model. The private concessionaire was responsible for providing tracks signals power distribution systems and rolling stock and for operating the line for 30 years.Reliance Infrastructure Limited established Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAM) as a special purpose vehicle in which it held a 95 per cent stake. The remaining 5 per cent of the equity was owned by the Spanish company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA (CAF). CAF also supplied the rolling stock for the DAM. The concessionaire possibly expected high returns from the project and therefore quoted negative viability gap funding. In August 2008 a concession agreement between the DMRC and the concessionaire was signed. The line started functioning in February 2011.Colloquially dubbed the Orange Line the DAM operated between Dwarka metro station via the IGI and the New Delhi Railway (NDRU) station in the city centre. Both ends connected it to the DMRC network’s Blue Line (East–West Corridor) and Yellow Line (North–South Corridor).Delhi Metro Rail CorporationThe DMRC was registered on May 3 1995 under the Companies Act 1956 with equal equity participation of the government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the federal government to implement the dream of constructing and operating a world-class rail-based mass rapid transit system. The DMRC introduced comfortable air-conditioned and eco-friendly services in India for the first time. It completely revolutionized the mass transportation scenario in the NCR and set a standard for all future metros in the country. It became a benchmark for the execution of a huge and technically complex infrastructure project within a given budget and timeline by a government agency. The DMRC also ran five other regular metro services (the Red Yellow Blue Violet and Green lines) in Delhi and the NCR.Takeover of the Delhi Aiport Metro by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation On July 1 2013 control of the DAM was handed over to the DMRC from the private sector concessionaire who had found it difficult to operate profitably.At the time of the takeover it was found that the Delhi Metro Airport Express Line (DMAEL) was not able to generate even 25 per cent of the traffic estimated. DMAEL losses amounted to about ₹40–₹50 million each month and the project had become financially unviable. On June 27 2013 the concessionaire served notice to the DMRC that it intended to cease operations on the DAM effective July 1 of that year. After detailed deliberations the DMRC claimed that this violated the concession agreement which subsequently led to arbitration proceedings.The DMRC decided that it would be in the public interest to take over the DAM operations. At the time of the takeover capacity utilization (passenger kilometres as a percentage of capacity kilometres) was well below initial expectations (see Exhibit 1) and the ratio of operational expenditure to operational revenue (operating ratio) was about 2.7. The initial attempts made by DMRC to revive the DMAEL did not have the desired results (see Exhibit 2).The IssuesThe DMRC recognized that they needed to consider a two-pronged approach to improving the operating ratio—namely increasing revenue while reducing costs. Revenue was generated from two sources: fare-box revenue (from passenger kilometres) and non-fare-box revenue (mainly from property business leasing and advertisements on trains and stations). Both depended on footfall traffic.Fare-Box Revenue Optimization StrategiesWhen the DMRC took over the DAM they had many questions to answer and problems to solve. At times Sharma thought that there were too many permutations and combinations available to try. The first issue was to increase train occupancy. One option was to see whether the train timings could be changed to suit commuters who could be feeders to these trains. For example passengers arriving in the morning at the New Delhi Railway Station could become feeders to DMAEL trains going to the airport. Were there any other consumer groups who could become feeders to these trains in order to increase the occupancy? A second issue was to alter the fare (reduce or increase) to make it viable. The minimum fare was ₹30 and the maximum was ₹180 (see Exhibit 3). Should the DMRC make the DMAEL more affordable or should they convert it into a premium service? How frequently could fares be reduced or increased? What should the targeted earnings be to make it sustainable? Should the company aim for profits? The third issue concerned whether anything could be done about the frequency and speed of the trains. What was the ideal number of trips to make the DMAEL viable or even profitable? There were six stations on the Delhi Airport metro line (see Exhibit 4) and the weekly traffic pattern suggested that some stations were underutilized (see Exhibit 5). Another issue was ideal train timing. Other metro services typically had a recess from midnight until 6:00 a.m. Should the DMAEL follow suit or—keeping international flights in mind—should it operate at all hours of the night? If yes what would the ridership be and which consumer groups would prefer to ride during the night? Were there any international passengers? Should there be differential pricing for foreigners?Fourth could a terminal station of the DMAEL be used as a hub where other metro lines converged and fed into the DMAEL? What about the anticipated growth of DIAL? Terminals 1 and 3 of the airport were currently operating; however there were plans to start a new Terminal 2 (due to a serious rise in passenger traffic at IGI). Should they consider the option of connecting Terminals 1 2 and 3 and running shuttles between these terminals in addition to the regular DMAEL line? The fifth and most important area to examine was people’s willingness to travel by the DMAEL. Sharma was considering having some market research done to find out customer pain areas in order to ascertain why they did not travel by airport metro—even though the other metros were overcrowded.Non-fare-Box Revenue Optimization StrategiesIn the concessionaire’s business plan non-fare-box revenue was estimated to contribute 74 per cent of total revenue by 2014 but this could not be realized due to low traffic. At the time of the DMRC’s takeover non-fare-box revenue was only ₹7.3 million each month. Sharma was thinking of developing the DMAEL space like a shopping complex or the duty-free section of the airport. The challenges of such an ambitious plan included selecting tenants to occupy the retail space for shops and developing a business value proposition for them including the tenant mix space and crowd management and the revenue-sharing model they would implement with the tenants. For example the crowds at airport shopping or duty-free areas were typically easy going as most people there had clear ideas about when they needed to catch their flights. On the other hand a typical DMAEL metro passenger would be in a hurry to catch their train. A customer may become relaxed upon reaching the airport terminal as the customer would then be able to browse items that were available. In addition such a space for the DMAEL would start competing with the airport’s own shopping area which was presumably better designed with open spaces and a comfortable shopping experience. Therefore making such a development viable was a challenge. Another aspect of non-fare-box revenue optimization was the usage of free space for advertising. The DMRC needed to decide what kinds of advertisements could be shown in the proposed shopping space which products or services shown by such advertisements could be made available to consumers at DMAEL terminal stations and what the advertising mix should be. Cost Optimization The DMAEL had three major operational costs—namely labour maintenance and energy. In each of these three areas there was scope for reduction or optimization. Sharma had to decide which types of jobs could be outsourced keeping security in mind. Personnel were deployed in the areas of supervisors and managers ticketing and security services driving maintenance and housekeeping. DMAEL also had to find ways to reduce electricity consumption both during travel as well as at the stations. The way aheadSharma had a major task before him yet he was confident that he and his team of experienced professionals drawing on their experiences from DMRC operations would be able to optimize the DMAEL system to convert it into a successful model of public transportation with a far-reaching impact. “Let’s buckle up and do it” he said.

She wondered whether pearls presented a good market opportunity in the West. At markets in China she consistently found cultured freshwater pearls that would cost far more in Canada. This experience led her to wonder whether this industry was attractive to enter on a wholesale basis or perhaps at the retail level. Or was there a reason why pearls—such an old and timeless product—did not present more of a dynamic market opportunity in the West?PEARLS THROUGH THE AGES Pearls were one of the three biogenic gemstones the other two being amber and ammolite. As the sole gem made by a living animal pearls needed no polishing or cutting. Their desirability both in current and ancient times made them distinct. Pearls were less associated with scandals than diamonds. In fact pearls were said to “appeal to the better part of human nature.” The word “pearl” was a synonym for being uncommon and highly valued. Of all jewellery pearls had the longest proven history. They had been popular with women in Roman and Elizabethan times and often before that as a symbol of purity or wealth. When Christopher Columbus undertook his search for a shortcut to the East and its riches sponsored by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain pearls ranked at the top of the two monarchs’ wish lists. From ancient times to the 1970s the primary sources of commercial pearls were the Persian Gulf the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar between southeastern India and western Sri Lanka.formationDuring the pearl formation process in both saltwater oysters and freshwater mussels a foreign object entered the mollusc which could not eject it. As a result of the irritation nacre (the same ingredient for growing a shell) was secreted around the object until eventually the layers formed a pearl. The nacre reflected light and lent pearls their lustre and even iridescence. In nature only one out of every 10000 wild oysters contained a pearl.recent history and pricesIn the 20th century Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel played a key role in giving pearls mass appeal. She would wear multiple pearl strands that combined real pearls—cultured or natural—and plastic ones. Although she brought great popularity to pearls using them for both high fashion and fast fashion the effect was to make pearls ubiquitous and too common. Pearls even became associated with being old-fashioned and unstylish. However in recent decades pearls had experienced something of a renaissance.Although earlier fashion trends had favoured pearl strings “big South Sea cultured” pearls became very popular in the 1990s. As a result a necklace made of either large South Sea cultured pearls or black Tahitian cultured pearls could fetch a high price of £150000—10 times as much as a much rarer natural pearl necklace. However natural pearls later regained their superior prestige.The La Regente pearl which the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once gave as a gift to his second wife had been sold three times by Christie’s auction house. It sold for US$143000 in 1987 for $859000 in 1988 (after its origin had been verified) and for $2.5 million in 2005—the highest price ever paid for a pearl at an auction. In comparison the highest price ever paid for a diamond was $71.2 million.Hong Kong and the Middle East constituted the main locations for buyers with India not far behind. According to one expert “prices will stay high because [pearls] are so genuinely rare. Like all markets it fluctuates a little bit but I think after 100 years of solitude from the early 20th century to the early 21st century. . . the world has moved on and realized how precious they are.” In February 2009 the Dubai Pearl Exchange opened.cultured pearlsAs far back as the fifth century the Chinese inserted small lead Buddha images into freshwater mussels in an attempt to create Buddha-like cultured pearls. Around the end of the 19th century English marine biologist William Saville-Kent at work for the Australian Fisheries Department successfully experimented with a “tissue graft” technique in pearl oysters. In 1916 Kokichi Mikimoto of Japan patented his technique for culturing spherical pearls in 1916 and revolutionized the pearl world. Because his pearls seemed perfect in terms of colour lustre and shape the “natural-pearl lobby” proclaimed his pearls to be fake.In the early 20th century excess harvesting harmed many oyster habitats. Cultured pearls started to be mass-produced at around the same time that commercial-scale natural pearl harvesting stopped. The price of natural pearls fell precipitously regardless of their new scarcity. Although natural pearl prices eventually rose again natural pearls remained by historical standards rather cheap in the 2000s—close to early 20th-century prices.In 2009 according to official figures China was producing 1500 tonnes of freshwater cultured pearls per year (although some estimates were closer to 3000 tonnes). In 2010 China produced 20 tonnes of saltwater akoya cultured pearls. That same year Australia produced 10 tonnes of South Sea saltwater cultured pearls. Top-quality Chinese freshwater pearls could feature amazing shades of peach and apricot or compete with saltwater akoya peals in the roundness of shape and lustre. This competition caused anxiety for Japanese producers because the Chinese pearls could cost one-tenth of the Japanese pearls. Treatments such as polishing bleaching and dyeing were commonly applied to pearls both in China and beyond.In 2017 the global production of cultured saltwater pearls amounted to $400 million with South Sea pearls occupying $230 million of this amount. Yet cultured saltwater pearls by volume amounted to no more than “5 per cent of what China produces in its freshwater” according to an analyst at the Gemological Institute of America.pearl types and qualitiesPearls made without any human intervention were called natural pearls. They were extremely rare. Cultured pearls on the other hand—sometimes mistakenly referred to as “fake pearls”—were much more common and fell under two categories: freshwater and saltwater pearls. Oysters could produce only one saltwater pearl every two and a half years and saltwater pearls were more expensive than freshwater pearls.Mussels produced freshwater pearls in hatcheries and each harvest could produce 20 or more pearls which were smaller than saltwater pearls. Each batch of pearls required 18 to 24 months to grow. Freshwater pearl mussels were nucleated with 1-millimetre (mm) squares of mantle tissue within the body of the mussel.Keshi pearls were produced by various types of oysters and freshwater mussels. These small irregularly shaped pearls developed when a foreign object planted in the mollusc was rejected which produced a pure nacre pearl with significant lustre.Chinese artificial lakes and reservoirs were the primary sources of freshwater pearls. In contrast saltwater pearls—such as the classic iconic akoya pearl and Tahitian and South Sea pearls—developed in inlets atolls and bays in many international locations.The value of a pearl was appraised according to characteristics such as size (bigger was better) shape (rounder was better) number of flaws (fewer was better) lustre and colour. Unlike diamonds pearl grading was not standardized. Button- and teardrop-shaped pearls were significantly cheaper than round pearls. Most freshwater pearl harvests contained semi-baroque and baroque (irregularly shaped) pearls. Although sought after genuine round freshwater pearls constituted less than 3 per cent of the yearly harvest. The most common freshwater pearl inclusions or blemishes were chalky spots.The three primary species of oysters producing cultured saltwater pearls were (1) the Pinctada fucata which made the small and round akoya pearls used by the jewellery house Mikimoto; (2) the Pinctada maxima which could reach the size of a dinner plate and made the white South Sea pearl (the industry’s largest and most lustrous); and (3) the Pinctada margaritifera which made black Tahitian pearls.The broad hierarchy of pearls by market value was South Sea first Tahitian next then akoya and freshwater pearls after that. South Sea pearls ranged from approximately 9 to 19 mm Tahitian pearls were approximately 9 to 12 mm in size and akoya pearls were approximately 5 to 10 mm. Freshwater pearls varied considerably in size.According to the head of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain: There are so many different kinds of pearls available and most people don’t know the difference between natural and cultured saltwater and freshwater cultured cultured with natural colour or the various treatments that are used. They don’t understand what these things mean and how they can affect what a pearl is worth. If Li did pursue the pearl business she knew it would be worthwhile to complete a pearl certification course such as the specialist course offered by Pearls As One.Scientific modifications went well beyond dyeing to create new possibilities. Chinese producers used various culturing techniques and nuclei to grow hollow soufflé pearls with iridescent colours Edisons Ming pearls ripples and giant fireballs. Some Chinese freshwater pearls had sizes colours and lustres approximating those of South Sea pearls. However not everyone was as optimistic about these mussel-grown luxury pearls.environmentalism and pearlsOysters were an effective barometer of the fitness of the waters they lived in. “You can only produce high-quality [saltwater] pearls by working in a pristine marine environment” according to Laurent Cartier a pearl sustainability researcher. He believed that the pearl industry was being significantly affected by climate change. Increasingly frequent hurricanes and typhoons could decimate harvests rising carbon levels led to ocean acidification that hindered oyster shell formation and increasing ocean temperatures could harm oyster shells. The saltwater pearl industry had a natural interest in sustainable practices in order to ensure the survival of the product.Prior to pearl farming pearls had to be discovered in nature. This meant that many thousands of oysters or mussels had to be opened to find a tiny amount of pearls which led to centuries-long overfishing and exploitation of oysters and pearls. Thus some argued that the farming of cultured pearls had exerted a greatly positive effect on pearl oysters and had instilled in pearl farmers an interest in maintaining and even improving marine ecosystems. In some cases as in the Kimberley Coast (which led Australia’s pearl industry) pearls overlapped with natural resources and their extraction threatened ecosystems.Freshwater pearls were generally produced in football-field-sized ponds in China and other places. The mussels were grown in old rice paddies that had been excavated and flooded to become artificial lakes. Although freshwater mussels were less dependent on a pristine environment than saltwater oysters there was still a need for clean water; however industrial pollution from neighbouring areas—quite outside the control of pearl farmers—could hinder freshwater pearl development. Some farmers in China found it impractical or uneconomical to grow freshwater pearls and had migrated to other industries. Freshwater pearl farms could sometimes grow other products concurrently with pearls.Some pearl processors who received the pearls from freshwater and saltwater pearl farmers practised unsustainable techniques such as the use of bleaches and dyes.Ultimately although sourcing certifiably sustainable pearls could offer differentiation it was nonetheless a great challenge. Li might be able to find saltwater pearl farmers who used demonstrably sustainable techniques but her research did not yield any leads for sourcing sustainable freshwater pearls—the type of pearl that would likely be her main focus if she pursued the pearl business. Therefore a sustainability angle did not provide any obvious and feasible niche and might not even be possible with many of the pearls.optionsLi realized that she had various decisions to make. She first needed to decide whether to enter the pearl industry at all. Was it sufficiently attractive? If she did enter the pearl business should she focus on wholesale or retail sales or both? Should she open an online store or have a physical location (possibly seasonal) at a mall or farmers’ market? Maybe she could sell pearl jewellery to a corporate gift program or via house parties. What kind of jewellery would she offer (e.g. earrings necklaces rings)? Would she make any of the jewellery herself? Should she target in-home jewellery makers? What segment of the market would she target (e.g. high-end fine jewellery lower-end fashion or costume jewellery)? How would she differentiate her business? Perhaps she could leverage the link between pearls and classical or vintage fashion. Her preliminary investigation suggested that it could be quite easy to source a large quantity of relatively inexpensive cultured freshwater pearls from China that would be attractive to regular consumers. However sourcing good saltwater pearls was exponentially more difficult. Li realized that she had many questions to resolve if she proceeded with her venture.retail prices and experienceIn considering the prospect of retailing pearls in Canada Li visited various malls to examine the prices and service. It quickly became apparent to her that sales staff at most jewellery stores—even at big iconic chains—lacked extensive knowledge of both pearls in general and of particular store offerings. At the first store she visited—a key international jewellery retailer—one of the sales staff said “Some of our pearls are freshwater and some of them are cultured” when in reality all freshwater pearls sold in stores were cultured. This salesperson grew visibly annoyed at the prospect of answering questions. Li did not dare add the topic of saltwater pearls into the mix. She did however find out that this store sold 6-millimetre to 7-millimetre (mm) freshwater pearl silver stud earrings for CA$120 and 9-mm to 10-mm freshwater pearl silver stud earrings for CA$159. The store also sold a strand necklace of 6-mm pearls for CA$199 and a silver pendant with one 6-mm pearl for CA$160.The staff at the second store she visited was somewhat more knowledgeable about pearls and its pearl products and seemed to know the difference between freshwater saltwater cultured and natural pearls. And yet pearls did not claim any special place among the store’s offerings nor elicit any enthusiasm which was perhaps representative of the “timeless-yet-forgettable” positioning of pearls in the minds of many consumers. This store offered 7-mm to 8-mm freshwater silver stud earrings for a range of CA$90 to CA$120 and an 8-mm freshwater pendant with silver and zirconium (“fake diamonds”) for CA$150. It also offered a freshwater pearl strand necklace with 9-mm to 10-mm pearls for CA$249 and an akoya saltwater strand necklace with 9-mm pearls for CA$899.Li wondered whether something about this mall was not conducive to pearls or luxury items and so she decided to visit a more upmarket mall. In the second mall she entered a more recently launched international chain store and found the sales staff to be enthusiastic and the offerings to be simple elegant and affordable. Sample products included silver drop earrings with 7-mm freshwater pearls for $35 a 45.7-centimetre freshwater pearl strand made with silver for CA$99 and a 10-karat gold strand necklace with freshwater pearls for CA$219. The products were more modern and the sales staff more effective in the new store and yet she knew she could source pearls for lower prices. She also felt that it was very unlikely that a general jewellery store would take any special interest in promoting pearls.In fact it became apparent to Li after some reflection that pearls offered a story like that of no other product and that this story was left untold and undersold by jewellers. What kind of difference could it make to have a knowledgeable staff member who could talk passionately about pearls? Perhaps a kiosk in a mall or farmers’ market could for example show videos of pearl farming in the South Pacific in order to elicit curiosity from shoppers. Improving the sales experience and accessibility of pearls did not need to be prohibitively expensive or difficult. She imagined mothers and daughters coming to her booth and making impulse purchases that were luxurious exotic and exciting—and yet affordable.online offeringsOnline retail was an option that could be relatively easy to implement. Pearl Paradise a $20 million business run by the pearl expert Jeremy Shepherd had a huge selection of relatively affordable and quality pearl items. The online store’s products included 7.5-mm to 8.0-mm AAA-quality freshwater pearl stud earrings for $105 7.0-mm to 7.5-mm white Akoya AA+-quality pearl stud earrings with 14-karat gold for $125 and an 8-mm to 9-mm white Freshadama pearl pendant for $201. Most pendants used a somewhat larger and more valuable pearl than would be found in necklace strands and earrings. Pearl Paradise also offered a 7.5-mm to 8.0-mm 45.7-centimetre long AAA-quality freshwater pearl strand necklace for $253.Another online retailer Pearls Only offered 7-mm to 8-mm AA-quality freshwater cultured pearl silver earrings for CA$75 7.5-mm to 8.0-mm AA-quality Japanese akoya cultured pearl white gold earrings for CA$185 a 9-mm to 10-mm AA-quality freshwater cultured pearl pendant for CA$85 and a 7-mm to 8-mm A-quality freshwater cultured pearl strand necklace for CA$79 to CA$95.The online giant Amazon.com Inc. offered a white AAA-quality freshwater round cultured pearl necklace for CA$160 Ever Faith 925 sterling silver AAA-quality freshwater cultured pearl button stud earrings for CA$18 and 6.0-mm to 6.5-mm white akoya AA+-quality cultured pearl stud earrings in 14-karat gold for CA$99.Peoples Jewellers sold 7.0-mm to 10.5-mm button freshwater pearl front/back silver earrings for CA$109 and 7.0-mm to 7.5-mm akoya pearl stud earrings in 14-karat gold for CA$119. It also offered a set of a 6-mm to 8-mm freshwater pearl and crystal bead necklace a bracelet and earrings in sterling silver for CA$249.Michael Hill International Ltd. sold simple drop freshwater pearl silver earrings for CA$29. It also offered a freshwater strand necklace with a 10-karat yellow gold clasp for CA$199 and a pendant with a cultured freshwater pearl and cubic zirconia in sterling silver for CA$59.possible wholesale pricesFreshwater pearls were abundant and readily available online as could be confirmed by a quick Internet search. This availability partly reflected the much higher yield of freshwater mussels than saltwater oysters. However it seemed to Li that there was a dubious element to many of the listings she found online and was particularly pronounced in the case of eBay Inc. (eBay) which featured a large amount of fake pearls from China. Both freshwater and fake pearls were regularly sold as saltwater pearls on eBay. The site’s review system was often “gamed” so that sellers pushed back hard against negative reviews and would simply give partial or full refunds rather than allow a negative review. This response allowed them to keep selling mislabelled items. It seemed to Li that sourcing pearls cheaply beyond freshwater pearls was not necessarily easy.Li considered her options for sourcing pearls. Having determined that eBay was out of the question she decided that she could source pearls and pearl-based jewellery from a Hong Kong-based dealer. She could buy loose 7.0-mm to 7.5-mm freshwater pearls at $4.30 for round pearls $1.20 for drop-shaped pearls and $0.70 for button-shaped pearls. The button shape best described the pearls she had purchased in China at seaside markets for a low price. A loose round-shaped 7.0-mm to 7.5-mm akoya saltwater pearl would cost her $10.70. She figured that selling the more luxurious Tahitian or South Sea saltwater pearls was beyond her purview although she could possibly make them available for special orders. Li also realized that sourcing reliable wholesale pearls—beyond freshwater pearls—was not easy for someone lacking connections in Hong Kong and Asia. She would likely need to attend a trade fair in Hong Kong or Guangzhou and negotiate with multiple suppliers to secure the best prices and a reliable supply.sample orderTo gain more clarity on actual quality true prices and product range Li investigated a variety of websites in China. In July 2018 she placed a modest order with one of the companies she had researched. Before shipping the supplier provided Li with the following terms for all orders: all items are “silver white” except the button pearl and akoya pearl; all pearls are freshwater except the akoya pearl; all pearls are grade AA; the buyer is responsible for the entire shipment from door to door (referred to as EXW or ex works) excluding transfer commission shipping insurance or tax; prices vary due to metal prices and exchange rate; minimum order quantity is five pieces in silver; lead time of two to three weeks after payment may be affected by order quantity; packaging includes a small plastic bubble bag and carton but no jewellery boxes; shipping takes three to five working days to most countries; and payment is required before production.The product arrived in good order and quality was as promised. In fact the local jeweller who seemed very knowledgeable about pearls even commented about the high quality of the akoya pearls. In addition Li felt that she had a clear idea of the total landed costs for each product including all transportation and related fees (see Exhibit 1). decisionBy August 2018 Li would need to make a decision. She could enter the pearl industry perhaps by opening a kiosk in a mall or a market. But what about an online store? Also would she make the jewellery herself or source it directly from China or Hong Kong? Or should she just stay away from the business altogether? It was possible that although consumers enjoyed the look of pearls—which had positive symbolic classical upmarket tropical evocations—they would not be receptive to shopping at a booth or making an effort to seek out the product. Maybe there was a reason why the pearl market had endured stagnation and malaise. And yet she could not help wondering whether a pearl product that was updated for current consumers (i.e. was affordable stylish and accessible) was exactly what people wanted whether or not they realized it.EXHIBIT 1: BREAKDOWN OF ORDER COSTSNote: Adjusted amounts allocate all costs for shipping duties taxes and other fees to each product in equal proportions; actual costs are marked with an asterisk (*); customs clearance fees in countries other than Canada are not shown; for the currency exchange calculations in this exhibit US1 = CA$1.33 on June 25 2018; HST = harmonized sales tax.Source: Created by authors based on Jane Li’s order.

The company which Souvaliotis had formally launched in January 2015 had been on a roller-coaster ride since its inception and was about to implode. The Ministry of Health of the province of Ontario which was Carrot’s single largest client had just informed Carrot that it was unable to identify any new source of funding with which it could sustain the company’s rewards program. The imminent departure of the ministry meant that nearly 750000 of the 1.1 million users of the company’s mobile app would suddenly experience an almost 100 per cent reduction in the rewards they were receiving daily for participating in the rewards program. Consequently Carrot’s own annual revenues which stood at about CA$6.7 million for the 2018 year would also be reduced by 70 per cent.Having first launched the app in the province of British Columbia in March 2016 and then in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) in June 2016 Carrot had expanded into the much larger market of Ontario in the summer of 2017. The success of the enterprise depended on continued participation (in terms of revenue commitments) by a variety of government departments at both federal and provincial levels. The Ontario Ministry of Health’s decision to not commit additional funds for the program had put the company’s larger expansion plans on hold. Only a month earlier Carrot was not only aggressively pursuing the launch of its app across the rest of Canada but also planning to expand into key international markets.Souvaliotis summarized the company’s options:My immediate priority is to bring some order to the chaos in which we suddenly find ourselves. But I should also consider five critical and likely overlapping options. First do we continue to fund most Ontario users’ daily rewards ourselves for the sake of protecting user engagement and safeguarding enterprise value—and for how long? Second do we stem the flow of red ink by introducing a freemium version of the app? Third do we pivot towards new geographies to broaden our revenue base? Fourth do we diversify our business model by exploiting new verticals and pursuing clients beyond the government sector which has been the bread and butter of the business since launch? And finally do we sell Carrot to strategic investors who may be able to better leverage what we have built so far?The CANADIAN HEALTH & WELLNESS INDUSTRYThe health and wellness industry in Canada had revenues of $22.5 billion in 2019. Its products and services included 14 categories such as beauty from within bone and joint health immune support and weight management. The industry was growing at a combined annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent and was driven by two population segments—millennials (aged 18–34 years) and baby boomers (aged 45–64 years).According to a Goldman Sachs study millennials were exercising more eating smarter and smoking less than previous generations. A survey conducted by Statistics Canada had shown that many baby boomers on the verge of retirement intended to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. The same survey had shown that nearly one in every four Canadians would reach the age of retirement by 2030 and therefore would by necessity begin to pay greater attention to their physical well-being.Between 2000 and 2018 Canada’s population had grown 20 per cent—from 30.7 million to 36 million; however health care costs had increased by 70 per cent during the same period to $242 billion. One of the major cost drivers was the prevalence of chronic ailments such as cancer diabetes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases; treatments for these ailments required an above-average length of stay in hospitals and an increase in the resources consumed per patient.Tobacco smoking alcohol consumption physical inactivity and unhealthy eating were the four risk factors that were common to chronic diseases. A provincial government study in Ontario had shown that the loss in productivity per annum due to disability and premature mortality arising from each of these factors amounted to $7.0 billion for tobacco smoking $4.5 billion for alcohol consumption $2.6 billion for physical inactivity and $5.6 billion for unhealthy eating. The study had also identified a sedentary lifestyle independent of physical inactivity as a risk factor for chronic diseases. A sedentary lifestyle involved sitting lying down and engaging in activities that expended minimum levels of metabolic energy and kept heart rates low such as watching TV and using a computer.Souvaliotis commented on how behaviour and responsibility could be influenced by both individual Canadians and the government:There was growing recognition that the publicly financed health care system would not be sustainable unless individual Canadians took personal responsibility for their health and wellness. Equally there was a broad consensus that many risk factors could not be adequately resolved unless public policy could “influence” behaviour at the individual level. The traditional policy tools used by the government to influence consumer behaviour included legislation regulation and information provision (through public advertising). The failure or underperformance of those approaches combined with the global emergence of “nudge theory” gradually led policy-makers to consider new approaches like nudging.NudgingPopularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their 2008 book Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health Wealth and Happiness the nudge theory aimed at deploying small tweaks (known as nudges) to steer individuals to engage in desired behaviours like increasing physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet. The goal was to reduce the prevalence of long-term conditions and lower the corresponding financial burdens on health care. If 1 per cent more Canadians met the physical activity guidelines annual savings in health care would be $2.1 billion.A nudge was designed to merely prompt people toward the desired behaviour so that the behaviour itself would happen on its own. As a first step therefore a nudge was crucial and had to have four requirements: (a) not be coercive but sustain the freedom of choice (b) not be like a rebate or discount but sustain the pricing structures of the market (c) not be regulatory but be free of any element of compliance and (d) be transparent. The effectiveness of a nudge depended on the design of the nudge the complexity of the issue and the support and resources available to the experiment.REWARD POINTS ECOSYSTEMSince the 1980s loyalty programs had prevailed worldwide as effective tools for customer acquisition targeting retention and revenue optimization for a wide range of consumer-facing businesses including retailers airlines and financial institutions. Loyalty programs enabled brands to “gamify” their relationships with consumers and thus influence customer behaviour—directly and precisely—while also generating vast customer datasets.In Canada the reward points ecosystem was widespread and 90 per cent of adult Canadians had a loyalty card which represented approximately 22 million consumers. On average Canadians had four loyalty cards in their wallet.Canada also scored among the highest in the world in the percentage of consumers making purchases earning reward points (see Exhibit 1). Examples of popular reward points in Canada included Air Miles (which allowed consumers to earn points from various retailers and use them toward either travel or buying consumer goods) and PC Optimum (which was known for its personalized offers based on shopping habits which it tracked with every purchase).The ecosystem of a loyalty program consisted of four participants: (a) a retailer (or sometimes a group of retailers) which issued loyalty points as a reward to its customers; (b) a rewards provider which accepted those points and enabled them to be redeemed in exchange for merchandise travel or other types of rewards; (c) a program administrator which was most often a third party administering the loyalty program on behalf of the issuing retailer; and (d) a consumer who earned points while shopping and then redeemed those points from time to time for rewards.Souvaliotis commented on the profitability of rewards programs:Loyalty rewards programs are historically highly profitable businesses. Program administrators (and rewards providers) earn significant profit margins through the difference between the “buy” and “sell” values of loyalty points. For instance if a retailer paid $0.03 for every point it issued to its customers by the time that point was redeemed by a customer for a reward its actual redemption value may have been $0.01 (thus earning the program administrator a spread of $0.02 amounting to a 67 per cent profit margin). Most loyalty programs generate additional profits through a combination of “breakage” [the percentage of earned points that were never redeemed by consumers] and “float” [the distance in time between the moment a retailer paid the administrator for the issuance of a point and the moment that point was redeemed by the consumer]. Typically the float would be at least two years for most programs.In Canada an estimated $16 billion in reward points was unredeemed by collectors as of 2017. In addition 55 per cent of collectors did not know their points balance and 41 per cent were unaware of their points value.ANDREAS SOUVALIOTISIn his memoir Misfit: Changemaker with an Edge Souvaliotis described himself as “autistic gay immigrant changemaker.” Born and raised in Greece he had immigrated to Canada in the 1980s as a teenager. After his undergraduate degree in science and a master of business administration Souvaliotis had plunged into an unorthodox career that zigzagged through a range of roles in human resources and marketing eventually taking up executive leadership roles in the technology and marketing industries.In his early 40s Souvaliotis left his corporate career and founded Green Rewards a national eco-consumer loyalty program designed to reward individual consumers for making eco-friendly purchasing decisions. According to Souvaliotis the loyalty program was “the first of its kind in the world.” Consumers were rewarded for making choices such as buying an annual pass for public transport (which pre-empted travel by gas-driven cars) or joining a health club (which set individuals on the path of physical exercise). Within a year Souvaliotis had built a team of 15 “dream employees” working from a large office in downtown Toronto.In September 2008 Souvaliotis sold Green Rewards to Loyalty One the largest loyalty program operator in North America which also administered the Air Miles rewards program in Canada. When Souvaliotis also joined Loyalty One as its Air Miles chief impact officer this new platform gave him an opportunity to market a range of green offers across Canada in partnership with local retailers. Canadians started earning Air Miles as bonus points on purchases of organic foods (at grocery stores) wines with a low carbon footprint (at liquor stores) sustainable paints (at home improvement stores) and switching from paper billing to electronic billing (at credit card companies). Souvaliotis was witnessing a shift in behaviours on a mass scale through small but frequent rewards. The nudge theory was playing out in the marketplace right in front of him influencing shoppers.During his tenure at Loyalty One Souvaliotis oversaw a partnership with the government of Ontario which used Air Miles as an incentive for people to conserve electricity. Till then the provincial government was using advertising (in print and visual media) and cash incentives (in the form of tax rebates coupons and discounts) to promote responsible behaviour among citizens. Launched in 2010 the partnership cut the government’s advertising budget by 65 per cent and prompted Loyalty One to set up a new business division called Air Miles for Social Change. The division collaborated with the British Columbia government to launch a healthy-eating incentive program across the province.CARROT REWARDSCarrot was a subsidiary of an enterprise called Social Change Rewards (SCR) which Souvaliotis had set up in September 2013 after leaving Loyalty One after five years. SCR was a Canada-headquartered for-profit company with a high social and environmental performance mandate. In addition to harnessing the Canadian obsession with collecting rewards points SCR was to leverage another Canadian social habit—attachment to smartphones. Canadians had high engagement with their smartphones with each Canadian spending an average of 3.1 hours daily on their device. Carrot was a mobile-friendly wellness app that rewarded its users for leading healthier lives. SCR was mandated to market the app for the government.Carrot was founded by Souvaliotis in early 2015 as a modern-day replacement for public wellness advertising. Souvaliotis had this to say about that advertising:Public wellness advertising is known to have three shortcomings. The first is cost. Advertising is inherently inefficient because it influences a small minority of its audience. For instance for most types of advertisements the conversion rate is known to be a mere 1 per cent resulting in a 99 per cent wastage. The second is lack of precision. Mass advertisements are considered “blunt instruments.” For instance an anti-smoking mass media campaign in a country like Canada where most citizens are non-smokers would be wasteful because it would be mostly viewed by people who do not smoke. It would also be difficult to target an advertisement only to smokers. The third is lack of impact data. Advertising typically yields no direct data about the response by those at whom it is targeted. At best some forms of advertising could be accompanied by proxy data in terms of demographic or psychographic profiles of those who might have viewed or even acted on an ad. But it is impossible to translate an ad campaign into precise data about behavioural outcomes.The Carrot app was designed to overcome such challenges and according to Souvaliotis was “inherently efficient because users were rewarded when they responded (or acted); it had exceptional targeting capabilities because of its rich and precise user profiles; and it generated a continuous stream of accurate and complete data on user response engagement and action.”The AppCarrot was a free wellness app designed to engage and retain its users through its rewards and incentives. The rewards were offered to users at every interaction with the app—when they downloaded it activated it referred others to it or completed a quiz or any other task through the app. To start the app users had to sync it to the built-in pedometer in their smartphone or to an external device like a Fitbit. The initial thrust of the app was through quizzes. Completion of quizzes led to points. “Steps” was added later. For the first two weeks the app simply tracked daily steps and then came up with a customized goal for each user based on the track record. For each day users reached that goal they received loyalty points. Users received points to dare one another in what was termed the “Step Together Challenge” where two or more users worked together as a team in a competitive buddy system and earned a number of extra points for reaching their goals. According to SouvaliotisCarrot was also not a typical wellness app. It did not say for example “Download this app and you’ll lose weight.” Carrot was a call for action that said “Download this app and you’ll get more points.” Its core value proposition was “Points at every stage.” It did not push users towards a target. It nudged them. It did not say for example “We’ll give you points if you quit smoking.” It said “We’ll give you points if you take a quiz about smoking.” The nuance made it stand out in the world of rewards.Instead of offering proprietary rewards (such as Carrot points) to its users Carrot’s “secret sauce” was to offer Canadians a selection of their favourite everyday loyalty points—frequent flyer miles grocery points gas points and movie points. Four leading loyalty providers—Aeroplan SCENE Petro-Canada and More Rewards—had signed up as rewards suppliers. With something for everyone the app had universal appeal and maximized its reach across important demographic segments of the Canadian population.An obvious secondary benefit was the app’s immediate popularity. While apps typically needed to invest heavily in marketing and awareness the Carrot app was designed to rely on the popularity of its suppliers (i.e. various established reward points programs). The natural economic alignment between those suppliers and Carrot compelled the former to actively promote the app among their members across Canada; the more people who downloaded Carrot the more reward points could be issued (i.e. sold) by those programs.Business ModelCarrot’s business model was uniquely simple—every point earned by a user was paid for by the client (typically but not always a government health agency) which was relying on the Carrot app to promote a specific behaviour. For instance if the British Columbia Ministry of Health asked British Columbians who smoked to complete a quiz about smoking cessation the ministry would pay Carrot for the points its users earned by completing that quiz. Those points would have been purchased by Carrot from the various points providers marked up and resold to the British Columbia Ministry of Health—a simple and transparent revenue model. If users did not do what Carrot’s clients wanted them to do (such as not completing a quiz or not achieving a daily step goal) they would not earn a reward; as such the client would not have to pay for any points. Carrot made money only if the behaviour of users was impacted. The fact that Carrot’s revenue model was 100 per cent success based was important among its mostly government clients.PROGRESSThe Carrot app was an immediate hit. The app’s first launch in British Columbia in early 2016 saw an astonishing 7 per cent of all adults becoming Carrot users within the first 12 months. A few months later it launched in NL and reached 10 per cent population penetration within the first year. Its third and most important provincial launch Ontario in early 2017 drove more than three-quarters of a million Ontarians to become Carrot users within months. A little more than two years after the first provincial launch more than a million Canadians were interacting daily with the Carrot app and earning rewards worth more than half a million dollars per month.Carrot did not advertise its services but instead relied on each of its four vendors to market its services to their own individual user base which was formidable. Sixty per cent of Carrot’s new customer acquisitions every month was through referrals from existing customers which was an indication of its organic growth. Carrot customers covered a wide spectrum across both rural and urban communities and a range of income levels and age groups. Nevertheless 68 per cent of Carrot users at one point were women aged 25 to 44.Carrot drew revenues primarily from a range of federal provincial and municipal government clients. The Public Health Agency of Canada had committed $5 million to the platform upfront most of which was spent on user acquisition and referral rewards—the points users earned for downloading the app or referring their friends. Of the various provincial health agencies that participated in Carrot the largest upfront commitment came from the British Columbia Ministry of Health which committed $2.5 million. The Ontario Ministry of Health’s upfront commitment to the Carrot platform was $1.5 million—a relatively small amount considering the province’s large population reflecting a looming provincial election and a possible change of government.The significant upfront commitments by these government clients made Carrot an atypical health-tech start-up that did not require large amounts of growth capital despite the relatively rapid increase of its overhead expenses. Staff salaries were the main element of cost and the company’s employee count reached 40 by mid-2018. Revenues grew at 30 per cent per annum reaching $6.7 million during fiscal year 2018; however by then the business had absorbed only a little more than $3 million in funding from a mix of private investors and venture capital firms.Carrot’s reputation appeared to be flying high by the end of 2018 with the company receiving the coveted “Canadian App of the Year” award. By August 2018 Carrot had tracked over one trillion steps on its platform and had provided users with 1.5 billion reward points across all client programs. More than one million users had tracked their daily steps and taken quizzes on diet fitness and personal finance to earn reward points.Carrot had also developed an informal work culture that became its unique selling proposition as an organization. Employees were truly unmovable. Souvaliotis had specific views on building the Carrot family:We were known as the only tech start-up in Toronto with zero staff turnover. That was because I was personally keen on ensuring culture as a binding force at Carrot. I did not look at talent as a commodity. It was never like “If I find a better person I will get him or her and get rid of who we have.” I built Carrot into a family. It was a unique company where everyone came and no one left. I did not realize however that my obsession with culture meant Carrot was carrying the risk of what I may now call “performance fog.” When everyone volunteers to carry the load it becomes difficult to identify the weak links in the chain. When the team performs together beautifully rowing in the same direction it becomes difficult for a manager to spot the one who is not pushing the oar as much as the others. It was like kumbaya— let us all sing together around [the] campfire. I was the flag bearer of it. On hindsight I would rather identify the weak link and look for ways to strengthen it than sing kumbaya.Carrot was among the 2500 certified B Corporations (B Corps) that were operating in more than 50 countries across 130 industries. B Corps were businesses that balanced profit with purpose and met the highest standards of social and environmental performance transparency and accountability. Many of them were small businesses but they were a major force in redefining business success and building a more inclusive and sustainable economy.CARROT AT THE CROSSROADSCarrot had become a celebrated Canadian health-tech success story by mid-2018. A UK subsidiary was also in the works as a contract with the UK government for a Carrot replica was being finalized. Yet significant dark clouds had been quickly gathering around the business by then. Carrot had secured its first contract for $1.5 million with the government of Ontario in June 2017 when the Ontario Liberal Party was in power. In the provincial elections held in June 2018 the Liberals had lost out to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Riding on a campaign of cost reductions Doug Ford had become the new premier. Carrot was among the social programs that were subject within months to funding cuts by the new party in power. Unlocking more revenues from the Ontario Ministry of Health had seemed impossible even though that relationship had quickly become the most critical one for the entire platform. According to SouvaliotisThe expansion of [our] client pool has not panned out as planned. We were depending for 90 per cent of revenue on a single client: the government whether federal provincial or municipal. When the funding from the provincial government of Ontario—accounting for more than 70 per cent of the rewards earned by Carrot users every single day—evaporated we were suddenly running on thin ice. The volatility of the client relationship with the Ontario government in turn was spooking investors as well making it impossible to unlock essential and urgent funding for the business. Even after freezing user growth and international expansion the giant revenue crater in Ontario suddenly caused Carrot to be burning through more than $600000 per month.As he reviewed options for the future Souvaliotis was considering five potential paths:Staying the CourseCarrot’s more than 750000 users in Ontario were active loyal and therefore exceptionally valuable as an enterprise asset. According to Souvaliotis “It was so tempting not to mess with the expensive glue that was keeping all those users so perfectly engaged with the app.” That “glue” was the stream of tiny rewards that was going to Carrot’s Ontario users and costing the company about $15000 each day. Whenever Souvaliotis and his team tried to creatively reduce that burn—by changing or limiting the way users could earn rewards through the app—the backlash was immediate and the attrition was measurable. Turning off those rewards entirely until the company found a willing client to pay for them again or a new investor willing to accept that much debt felt like a disaster scenario. If just half of the Ontario users abandoned the app more than a third of Carrot’s enterprise value would be erased in an instant. On one hand it made sense not to rock this giant user boat but in reality the company could afford to keep funding all those rewards for only a few more months. Attracting new investors amid such a crisis without an obvious way to fix it seemed next to impossible.Launching a Freemium Version of the AppAn alternative would be to quickly figure out a way to harness all that user engagement by introducing a freemium version of the app. Souvaliotis and his team did the math: The average user was costing the company a little more than $0.50 per month. So a premium double-your-points version priced at (a seemingly very reasonable) $1.99 per month could be both profitable and popular. Souvaliotis knew he was dealing with several critical questions: Were Canadians so hooked on earning loyalty points that they would be willing to overpay for an opportunity to earn points faster? If users’ monthly subscription fees covered the cost of all the rewards they earned and generated a bit of direct profit for the company would Carrot break even on at least some of its expensive 750000 Ontario users? In a quick survey of a few thousand Carrot users a double-digit percentage of responders had said they would likely upgrade to a paid version if one existed.Pivoting Toward New GeographiesThis option was about replicating the app’s Canadian success elsewhere quickly. Carrot’s linear business model meant that launching a similar version of the app in any new market would likely start generating financial returns right away right from the first user exactly the way it had worked in Canada three years earlier. For many months Souvaliotis’s team had been working on a potential contract with Public Health England an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care of the UK government aiming to launch at least a couple regional pilot versions of the app in different parts of the United Kingdom. The deal was progressing well and all the new British clients showed a great deal of enthusiasm. But a UK launch was still a while away and it was perhaps much longer than that before enough users would start generating profits. Even under the most generous gross margin assumptions several hundred thousand active users would be needed in England to make up for the cost of carrying all those unfunded users in Ontario. Beyond the United Kingdom the Carrot team was in some early-stage dialogues with Germany the United States and the United Arab Emirates. Whether any of those pursuits could help make a difference in the short term for the struggling company back home seemed doubtful.Branching Out to New Verticals and New ClientsCarrot’s main strategy—the nudge theory of introducing sustainable behavioural changes on a mass scale which was the sheet anchor of the strategy of Carrot—was replicable across sectors beyond health and wellness. The company could leverage the core platform of public engagement that it had built up for deployment in the wider commercial world by drawing in financial technology (fintech) brands insurance companies industry associations ride companies and pharmaceutical firms for example. Doing so would not only help serve such clients’ ends but also create multiple revenue streams for Carrot. There were also several departments within the government itself (such as those that focused on promoting financial literacy energy conservation and environmental awareness) that were clear candidates.Carrot could do many different things for many different clients. In fact the expansion was already underway and Souvaliotis was convinced that Carrot’s platform would work no matter what public behaviour it targeted. The questions remained: Could the company expand its client base fast enough? Could those new types of opportunities with new types of clients be identified targeted pitched contracted and implemented promptly to make a difference at a time like this? Could some of these new types of programs be broad enough and “rich” enough (in the rewards users could earn from them) for Carrot to reduce or even turn off the expensive wellness rewards its Ontario users were receiving every day?Finding a Strategic BuyerAnother option could be to find a strategic buyer for whom this unique behaviour-impact platform would make sense. Souvaliotis thought some possible buyers might include (a) an insurance company looking to radically shift its customer relationship interfaces; (b) a fintech company looking to quickly expand its customer footprint in Canada; (c) a retail pharmacy looking to dramatically augment its public wellness strategy and gain a strategic advantage in its relationships with the public sector in Canada; or (d) one of the big loyalty programs looking to pivot and take advantage of the growing wellness wave. All of these scenarios would have been reasonable and in more normal times it would have made plenty of sense for Carrot to demonstrate its appeal proudly patiently creatively and methodically in front of these potential buyers until a tantalizing deal came together. However under the current circumstances with the Ontario part of the business in debt and with the insolvency cliff approaching so quickly that tactic might seem much more like a desperate survival hunt.Would the proceeds of a fire sale make any sense for Carrot’s once proud and ambitious investors? Was there even enough time for such a fire sale?Souvaliotis wondered whether the future held workable options other than those he was considering in dealing with the enterprise he had founded built and nurtured.Exhibit 1: LOYALTY PROGRAM USE BY COUNTRYNote: * Refers to the percentage of consumers who make purchases that earn rewards or benefits at least several times a week.Source: Adapted from KPMG The Truth about Customer Loyalty: The World's Consumers Reveal What Keeps Them Coming Back 3 2019 accessed October 19 2020 https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/11/customer-loyalty-report.pdf.Exhibit 2: CARROT Rewards APP Source: Company files.",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,

The club which had been purchased by Evergrande Real Estate Group in 2010 for US$16 million was now valued at US$282 million according to Forbes. This paled relative to its market capitalization of almost US$3.4 billion in China where the shares were traded on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations Co. Ltd. (NEEQ). As a football fan Li Zhang was considering buying shares in the highly successful football club but he was concerned about the high price for its shares. Was the club really worth this much money? It had been successful on the field but the team had yet to turn a profit. The team’s success on the field was without question: it had won several championships since being purchased by Evergrande Real Estate Group earning its first top-tier title in the 2011 season. The club was the only Chinese football club to win the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League twice: once in 2013 and again in 2015. It was also the first Chinese club to participate in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Club World Cup making its first appearance in 2013. These measures of success stood in contrast to the team’s financial losses of over US$100 million per year since the acquisition in 2010.The DilemmaLi was excited about the possibility of owning a part of Evergrande. However he was unsure about how the football club generated value and thus whether it was worth such a high price. Before investing Li wanted to determine whether Evergrande’s high price was warranted and whether there was still room for the price to increase in the future. To do this he needed to understand how the team was valued. Evergrande appeared to be similar to a technology start-up with negative cash flows early in its development due to a necessarily significant investment in assets (e.g. players) and a large potential for growth in the future. To get started Li dove into the history of football in China in general and of Evergrande in particular. SOCCER IN CHINADespite its many ups and downs soccer was one of the best-supported sports in China. Its predecessor in China cuju or tsu’chu originated in China’s Warring States period in the second and third centuries BC. The sport was initially a military fitness exercise but it became a popular game among the upper classes during the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). The game developed over time and flourished in the Song dynasty (960–1279). The ancient game started to decline in the early Ming dynasty (during the fourteenth century); the Hongwu Emperor felt that cuju could demoralize the army so he banned soldiers from playing it and punished violators by amputation. Interest in cuju was further dampened during the Qing dynasty (about 1636–1912) when the Manchu ruler issued a universal ban on the sport.Modern football was introduced to China through Hong Kong in the late nineteenth century and China became a member of FIFA in 1931. China had to withdraw from FIFA following the founding of the People’s Republic of China but the Chinese Football Association (CFA) rejoined FIFA in 1979. China’s first attempts at distancing soccer from state influence began in the 1990s with the development of a Chinese league system. This marked the start of the professionalization and commercialization of the sport in China. The ongoing role of the government agency the CFA was necessary due to the Chinese law that restricted meetings of 10 or more people without official sanctioning.As soccer’s popularity increased more capital flowed into the industry. To retain the best players football clubs competed by paying high salaries which they financed using debt backed by the state safety net. To rein in this debt in 2001 the CFA introduced a player wage and bonus cap. Some observers believed these actions led to the widespread match-fixing and corruption scandals that rocked the league in the early 2000s. To address these scandals the CFA established the Chinese Super League (CSL) in 2002. Teams wanting to join the CSL had to meet several requirements which were designed to limit future scandals by ensuring the quality of the teams and their organizations. The league’s first season was in 2004 and there were 12 teams. The first season had some scandals as a spillover from the previous system but the league improved and grew with the number of teams rising from 12 to 16 in 2009. In 2010 the league once again faced scandals such as gambling match-fixing and corruption—both within the teams and at the very top of the CFA. At this point the Chinese government stepped in. By 2011 things were seen to be improving and teams were bringing in international stars to increase the calibre of play.The Chinese government continued to work on its mandate to grow football in China. This political support was seen to increase the potential value of the football clubs and to decrease the opportunities for scandals. President Xi Jinping a confirmed soccer fan often made clear his intention for China to become a soccer powerhouse. A crucial aspect of his plan was to develop the CSL into one of the best leagues in the world.Expanding on these efforts in March 2015 Xi’s government unveiled an ambitious plan to address his three wishes: to develop young soccer talent to improve the Chinese national teams and to get World Cup recognition. The reform plan included increasing the number of elementary and middle school soccer programs tenfold to 50000 by 2025 and increasing the separation between politics and the sport by removing the Chinese Football Admistrative Center from the CFA which was done in February 2016. The changes were all targeted at reinforcing the private sector’s confidence in soccer.CHINA EVERGRANDE GROUPGuangzhou-based China Evergrande Group was the country’s largest real estate company in terms of sales with total contracted sales of ¥373.37 billion in 2016. The group was founded in 1996 by billionaire Xu Jiayin who was ranked by Forbes as the ninth-richest man in China in 2016. In recent years China Evergrande Group had been striving to diversify into non-property sectors such as entertainment sports fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) health care tourism and finance. In 2016 the group recorded revenue of ¥211.44 billion and gross profit of ¥59.42 billion. Its core real estate business contributed ¥20.81 billion of profit.The group launched an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong in October 2009 raising HK$6 billion. In Hong Kong the group also had two other listed companies: Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd. and Hengten Networks Group Ltd. a residential community service joint venture with Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Evergrande Culture Industry Group Co. Ltd. the umbrella company for the group’s entertainment businesses was listed on the NEEQ in China. In July 2016 the Hong Kong-listed real estate portion of the group changed its name from Evergrande Real Estate Group to China Evergrande Group to “better reflect the diversified business strategy and corporate identity of the company.”China Evergrande Group’s rapid expansion had been controversial due to its high leverage. With US$78 billion (¥500 billion) in debt outstanding as of the end of 2016 the company was sitting on the second-largest debt among all Chinese companies. In order to begin reducing its leverage it had sold off its FMCG business in September 2016 for ¥2.7 billion. Within less than a week China Evergrande Group also announced that it had sought a backdoor listing of its property subsidiary on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company had already started selling significant blocks of shares of the new entity expected to be valued at ¥195 billion to strategic investors in order to further decrease its leverage. GUANGZHOU EVERGRANDE TAOBAO Football Club (FC)Guangzhou Football Club was founded in 1954 as a member of the Chinese national football league. After a poor performance in the initial seasons Guangzhou Football Club was relegated to the league’s second division. The Guangzhou-based soccer club had inconsistent performance until 1966 when it was forced to stop due to the Cultural Revolution. The club started playing again in 1977. Between 1977 and 2001 the team was demoted and promoted among leagues several times due to inconsistent performance. In 2001 during a period of widespread scandal in the Chinese leagues the team was again taken over by the Guangzhou Sports Bureau because of the number of scandals involving the team.After several challenging years with ownership changing several times Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation took over the club in 2006 and renamed it the Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Football Club. The team started to improve under this sponsorship but in January 2010 ownership of the club was returned to the Guangzhou Sports Bureau due to match-fixing and the team returned to the name Guangzhou Football Club. Two months later Evergrande Real Estate Group bought the soccer club for ¥100 million (US$16 million) and renamed it the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club. Since the acquisition the property developer had been pumping money into the team. Evergrande management suggested that the property company had invested over ¥1.5 billion in the club during the first three years. The investment brought the team results: Evergrande was promoted to the CSL after winning the title in the Chinese second tier league China League One (CLO) in 2010 and it won the CSL championship in each of the following years. It also won the 2013 and 2015 AFC Champions League. However the team’s success on the field had not translated into financial success. The team had not been able to generate a profit since the purchase by Evergrande Real Estate Group. According to Forbes Evergrande had an estimated revenue of ¥380.6 million (or US$57 million) in 2015 but a net loss of ¥953.2 million (US$146 million) for the 2015 season. The next year there was an increase in revenue to ¥561 million (US$88 million) but the team’s financial position did not improve substantially; it still had a net loss for the 2016 season although this had decreased to ¥812 million (US$ 127 million). It was clear that China Evergrande Group was more focused on the team’s success on the field than on its profitability. As Xu Jiayin told the media in 2011 Guangdong TV stations paid the team only ¥40000 for broadcasting each match but in exchange Evergrande got 90 minutes of brand exposure. Advertising boards were ubiquitous in Evergrande’s home stadium and the team had many sponsors that wanted to promote their brands through its matches. This made sponsorship of the team a bargain compared to TV commercial costs of ¥150000 per second.Sponsorship represented more than 70 per cent of the club’s revenue by 2015. Its major sponsors included Dongfeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Co. (Dongfeng Nissan) Unilever and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. The value of being related to a winning football club was increasing; this was consistent with the parent group’s real estate brand increasing to a value of US$4 billion by 2012 making it the most valuable real estate brand in China—it remained the top brand until 2015. Beyond the increase in value of Evergrande’s brand and revenues the external monetization of the football club could be seen in July 2014 when Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) agreed to acquire half of the club for ¥1.2 billion (about US$192 million). After the investment the club added Taobao the name of Alibaba’s online marketplace to its name. On announcing the deal Xu told the press he was planning to seek more investors and eventually list the club. In preparation for the listing on China’s NEEQ China Evergrande Group increased its stake in the club from 50 per cent to 60 per cent for ¥400 million in May 2015 implying a valuation of ¥4 billion (US$630 million).In January 2016 Evergrande raised ¥869 million (US$132 million) from institutional investors through the NEEQ. Following this transaction China Evergrande Group remained as the controlling shareholder with a 56.71 per cent stake and Alibaba held a 37.81 per cent stake implying a valuation of almost US$2.4 billion. The club’s shares first traded on the NEEQ four months later in March 2016 and had a market capitalization of over US$3.3 billion making Evergrande the most valuable soccer club in the world.How did a company losing so much money (US$146 million) have such a high valuation (US$282 million according to Forbes and over US$3.3 billion according to the Chinese stock market)? Why would the owners of Alibaba (the owner of Taobao) pay US$192 million for 50 per cent of the club indicating they valued the asset at US$384 million a couple of years earlier? Successive private capital raisings in China valued the football club at US$1.6 billion in July 2015 and at US$3.3 billion in March 2016 after the IPO.Business Model and StrategyIn January 2015 Evergrande announced its second five-year plan. Its goal was to build an internationally compatible world-class club. The club was ambitious: it wanted to improve its operation to become one of the world’s top 20 clubs within five years and to be comparable to other world-class football clubs. Attendance at CSL games was rapidly increasing (see Exhibit 1) and was comparable to that of some top international leagues. By increasing its visibility and fan base Evergrande could generate revenue and thus value for its investors through two principal means: the sports business and product sales.Sports BusinessWithin the sports business revenue sector the club monetized its soccer team and the brand via sponsorship match-day ticket sales appearance fees match rewards and licensing. The club had both sponsors related to Evergrande’s real estate and other businesses and major international clients including Dongfeng Nissan and Unilever. In 2016 “commercial ads earned the club about 400 million yuan [US$59 million] accounting for more than 70 per cent of . . . total revenue while the second-largest contributor was the 100-million-yuan [US$15 million] in fees and bonus money.” The value of sponsorship and appearance fees for some of the top teams in more developed markets (see Exhibit 2) was very high in some cases generating up to two-thirds of the teams’ overall revenue. The club’s home Guangzhou Tianhe Stadium seated 56000. Evergrande offered both season tickets and single match tickets. The team’s victories on the pitch had given a boost to its ticket sales: match-day revenue in 2015 “saw earnings of 235 million yuan [US$35 million] quadrupling the 55 million yuan [US$8 million]” from 2013. In 2015 Chinese broadcasters paid only US$13 million to show local league games. In 2016 China Media Capital purchased the broadcast rights to the Super League over the next five seasons in a deal worth ¥8 billion (US$1.3 billion). The broadcast rights and appearance fees earned by top global teams (see Exhibits 3 and 4) indicated that these fees could be very valuable. In comparison the broadcast fees earned by Major League Soccer (MLS) in Canada and the United States—a newer league with attendance similar to the CSL’s attendance of approximately 22000 per game in 2015—were just US$90 million annually from domestic TV deals. While Evergrande had made headlines by paying record-breaking transfer fees for foreign soccer stars it had recently changed its strategy working to form an all-Chinese team by 2021. To execute this strategy the parent group invested ¥1.95 billion to build a soccer training school. The club could either keep its players thus saving transfer fees or sell its young players in order to generate revenue. Product SalesAll of the products featuring Evergrande’s brand were sold directly by the club through its online and offline outlets including an online shop on Alibaba’s retail marketplace TMall. While Evergrande remained behind the top European clubs in terms of monetizing its potential value sales figure for the top European teams (see Exhibit 5) suggested the significant potential for a team such as Evergrande. In fact a report by Deloitte highlighted the future potential of the Chinese Super League and suggested that as many as three Chinese clubs could compete for a place in the top 20 global football clubs.ValuationAlthough Forbes had estimated the price of Evergrande at US$282 million Li wanted to understand the difference between this figure and the club’s current market value of over US$3.3 billion. The value of sports teams came from several sources: the marketing value companies derived from having their names associated with successful sports teams; the long-term value that could be generated once the asset’s value could be monetized; and the prestige of owning a rare high-profile asset. According to the club’s financials it was losing money each year. In fact it was losing so much money that its principal investors had to keep injecting equity capital into the organization to keep it afloat. Although the revenue base was increasing it was still far below the high costs being incurred to acquire new assets (players) and grow.Despite Evergrande’s valuation on the NEEQ Chinese soccer’s 10 most valuable teams were worth an average US$130 million each according to Forbes (see Exhibit 6). In the 2015 season Chinese teams generated an average estimated revenue of US$28 million and were valued at an average price to revenue ratio of 4.67. Most of these teams were not publicly listed so Li could only compare the values estimated by Forbes.Looking outside of China for comparable teams there were similarities between the CSL and MLS in the United States and Canada. Both leagues were still in the early stages of development and were known for acquiring star players. The valuations of the teams in these leagues were somewhat similar; the average value of the 10 most valuable MLS teams was US$197million but their average price to revenue ratio was 7.05 (see Exhibit 7).As the next stage of his analysis Li looked at how the more established professional sports teams were valued by pulling together some valuation and financial information on the top European football clubs also from Forbes. The clubs were in mature markets with large well-established fan bases (see Exhibit 8). He hoped this information would allow him to see the potential long-term value of Evergrande. Although most football clubs were private Li was able to get some information on the actual market values of some top European clubs and both their debt and equity costs (see Exhibit 9). This information could be used to do some rough fundamental valuations for Evergrande relative to its European peers.the DecisionWith all of this information Li had to determine whether Evergrande was a good investment at this price. The situation appeared similar to a technology start-up which also tended to burn through cash in its initial years as it built up its assets and customer bases in anticipation of large profits in the future. This raised more questions regarding how to value an asset with significant performance on the field but yet unrealized financial potential and why this value was so different from the valuation provided by Forbes and that of the Chinese stock market.Exhibit 1: Attendance at SOccer Games in Major leagues (thousands)Note: CSL = Chinese Super League; MLS = Major League Soccer; US = United States; CA = Canada FR = France; MX = MexicoSource: Created by the case author using data from Yutao Chen “Infographics: More Football Fans Turning Out for the Chinese Super League” CGTN America accessed August 8 2018 https://america.cgtn.com/2017/07/20/infographics-more-football-fans-turning-out-for-the-chinese-super-league.Exhibit 2: Largest sponsorship deals in soccer (in US$ Millions)Source: Created by the case author using data from Chris Smith “The Most Valuable Sponsorship Deals in Soccer” Forbes May 11 2016 accessed August 8 2018 www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2016/05/11/the-most-valuable-sponsorship-deals-in-soccer/.Exhibit 3: per-season Broadcasting rights for major global football leagues (in US$ Millions)Note: *International rights 2018/2024Source: Created by the case author using data from Mike Ozanian “The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2017” Forbes June 6 2017 accessed August 7 2018 www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2017/06/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2017/#23935ded77ea.Exhibit 4: Top Champions League appearance fees for major global Football clubs 2014–2015 (in € millions)Source: Created by the case author using data from Totalsportek2 “UEFA Champions League Prize Money 2018 (Winners to Earn Upwards of €100 Million)” Total Sportek May 25 2018 accessed August 7 2018 www.totalsportek.com/money/uefa-champions-league-prize-money/.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca.Copyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-09-11The shareholders of Tata Steel Limited (Tata Steel) received a letter from the company dated November 25 2016 informing them of the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to be held on December 21 2016 in Mumbai at which they needed to decide the fate of Cyrus Mistry and Nusli Wadia two company directors. Shareholders of six other Tata Group companies received similar notices of EGMs at which the shareholders would have to decide the fate of these two directors of the boards of their respective companies. Electronic voting options would also be available to Tata Steel shareholders to vote on the resolution between December 18 and December 20 2016. Shareholders of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) had already voted in favour of the resolution; however how the shareholders of Tata Steel would vote was unclear. UNFOLDing of eventsThe employees of the Tata Group India’s largest business group received a letter from Ratan Tata on October 24 2016 stating that the board of Tata Sons Limited (Tata Sons) the holding company of the Tata Group had removed Mistry from his role as company chairman. The board of Tata Sons constituted a new committee to select Tata Sons’ next chairman and appointed Ratan Tata as the interim chairman. This announcement shocked the market as “Tata Group is not known to spring such surprises.” Share prices of major listed Tata Group companies decreased by an average of 2.03 per cent within a day and decreased by nearly a further 5 per cent in the next two days (see Exhibit 1; all case exhibits can be found in the student spreadsheet [Ivey product number 7B19N016] that accompanies this product.).In a letter sent to the board of Tata Sons Mistry questioned the board’s decision. He remarked “To ‘replace’ your Chairman without so much as a word of explanation and without affording him an opportunity of defending himself in a summary manner must be unique in the annals of corporate history.” Mistry went on to state that it was unfair to terminate him on grounds of “non-performance” because during his tenure the market value of the listed group companies had increased by 14.9 per cent and the net worth of Tata Sons had increased by 61.5 per cent whereas the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex a broad-based market index had increased by only 10.4 per cent.J. N. Gupta from Stakeholder Empowerment Services a proxy advisor firm stated that such sudden changes in the board were unheard of in the Tata Group. “The reason for such a move is unknown. And this unknown worries us.” While analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. remained bullish on Tata Steel’s shares analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Elara Capital Plc IIFL (formerly India Infoline Limited) ICICI Direct and Ambit Capital had issued SELL recommendations on Tata Steel. However none of these analysts’ reports had indicated the ongoing power struggle in Tata Steel. By virtue of his position as the managing director of Tata Sons Mistry was also the chairman in most of the Tata Group companies. Even after he had been removed as the chairman of Tata Sons Mistry continued to function as the chairman of the other Tata Group companies. The biggest support for Mistry came from some of the Tata Group’s independent directors such as those from Tata Chemicals and Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) who supported and appreciated Mistry for his leadership. The independent directors of IHCL stated that “it was imperative for the independent directors to state their views to the investors and public at large so that those who trade in securities of the company [could] make an informed decision.”As Mistry did not resign from the boards of the group companies Tata Sons asked the boards to remove Mistry from the post of executive chairman. Using Article 90 of TCS’s Articles of Association Tata Sons replaced Mistry and appointed Ishaat Hussain as the chairman of TCS on November 10 2016. The board of Tata Global Beverages replaced Mistry with Harish Bhatt as its chairman on November 15 2016. In a circular resolution the board of Tata Steel replaced Mistry with O. P. Bhatt as its chairman on November 25 2016. Although Mistry was removed from the post of chairmanship of these companies he continued to operate as a director. As Mistry refused to quit from the listed companies Tata Sons asked the boards of the group companies to convene EGMs and use shareholders’ permission to remove Mistry from the directorship of these companies. The shareholders of TCS voted in favour of the resolution passed by Tata Sons at an EGM held on December 13 2016. Because Tata Sons had only a 29.75 per cent stake in Tata Steel (see Exhibit 2) compared with its 73.33 per cent stake in TCS the possible outcome of Tata Steel’s EGM could not be predicted. Mistry urged the shareholders of Tata Steel to vote against the resolution saying “The Tata Group is no one’s personal fiefdom: it does not belong to any individual. . . . It belongs to all the stakeholders including every one of you. I therefore urge you to have your voice heard loud and clear.” In his letter dated December 7 2016 Ratan Tata wrote to the shareholders “The Board of Tata Sons lost confidence in him [Mistry] and in his ability to lead the Tata Group in the future.” He urged the shareholders to vote in favour of the resolution. The stock price of Tata Steel closed at ₹414.05 per share on December 16 2016 the last trading day before the electronic voting started.The Tata Group Popularly hailed as the “salt-to-software conglomerate” the Tata Group one of the largest business groups in India had a humble beginning in Mumbai as a trading company founded in 1868 by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata. The first big industrial project undertaken by the group was Express Mills a textile venture set up in 1874. The group went on to establish large companies of repute in India including the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai in 1903 Tata Iron and Steel Company (later Tata Steel) in 1907 Tata Chemicals in 1939 Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (later Tata Motors) in 1945 Voltas in 1954 Tata Tea (later Tata Global Beverages) in 1962 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in 1968 and Titan Company in 1984.After the death of Jamsetji Tata in 1904 Sir Dorabji Tata and subsequently Sir Nowroji Saklatwala were in charge of the group. In 1938 J. R. D. Tata took over the chairmanship and led the group until 1991. Most of the group companies were set up during his time. Ratan Tata became the chairman of the group in 1991 around the time when India started the process of economic liberalization and led the group until 2012. The Tata Group made numerous acquisitions during Ratan Tata’s leadership including the notable acquisitions of British company Tetley in 2000 Indian telecom company VSNL in 2002 the heavy vehicles unit of South Korea’s Daewoo Motors in 2004 NatSteel of Singapore in 2005 British steel maker Corus in 2007 and Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008.Mistry became an independent director of Tata Sons in 2006 after his father Pallonji Mistry resigned from the board of Tata Sons. Subsequently Cyrus Mistry became the deputy chairman of Tata Sons in November 2011 and its chairman in 2012 after Ratan Tata’s resignation from the board. Initially Mistry had been reluctant to join Tata Sons because of his engagement with his own family business. He decided to join the board as its chairman only when the selection committee had requested his chairmanship for the second time. Although Ratan Tata had resigned from the board of Tata Sons he continued to guide the Tata Group as chairman emeritus. In Mistry’s capacity as the chairman of Tata Sons he became the chairman of many of the Tata Group companies including some of the well-known companies such as Tata Steel Tata Motors Tata Chemicals TCS Tata Power Tata Global Beverage and Indian Hotels.Members of the Tata family were known for their benevolence and generosity. Many had bequeathed most of their personal assets to the various trusts the family had created. As of 2016 these trusts controlled 66 per cent of the total equity of Tata Sons. Two of the principal trusts created by the Tata family members were the Sir Dorabji Trust and Allied Trusts and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Allied Trusts. These trusts were not family trusts but “public charitable trusts” set up with the sole intention of benefiting the general public and therefore enjoyed many tax exemptions in India. These trusts controlled Tata Sons the holding company of the group which in turn controlled the Tata Group companies in India. Although these trusts controlled approximately 66 per cent of the shares of Tata Sons the single largest shareholder of Tata Sons was Shapoorji Palonji Group a large construction company owned by Mistry’s family.The Articles of Association of Tata Sons empowered the Trusts of the Group to nominate one-third of the directors to the board of Tata Sons. These trustee-nominated directors had the veto power to negate any decision taken by the Tata Sons’ board. After Mistry became the chairman of Tata Sons he made it mandatory for certain decisions pertaining to the group companies to be discussed by the board (even though the nominated directors could veto them). The Tata Group was known for its ethical approach in dealing with business problems. The values and core principles of the Group were documented as the Tata Code of Conduct and practised in all the Tata Group companies. Brand Finance a globally renowned brand consultancy firm valued the Tata brand at US$13688 million in January 2016. The Tata Group companies were required to pay a percentage of their total turnover (or net income) as royalties to the Tata Sons for using the Tata name. In 2015 Mistry reduced the maximum royalty payable by any group company to ₹750 million. Indian business groups controlled their group firms through “interlocking shareholding” and the Tata Group was no exception to that practice. For example at the end of September 2016 while Tata Sons owned 29.75 per cent of the shares in Tata Steel and 26.98 per cent of the shares in Tata Motors Tata Steel owned 2.9 per cent of the shares in Tata Motors and Tata Motors owned 0.46 per cent of the shares in Tata Steel. Both Tata Steel and Tata Motors owned 12375 shares each in Tata Sons. Exhibit 3 shows the promoter’s stake in the various listed Tata Group companies. Business groups in India also used funds owned by the group companies to increase their stake in these companies. Tata Sons for example made a rights issue in September 1995 and issued its shares at ₹100000 per share (with a book value of approximately ₹36000 per share) to the group companies. All the trusts in the group renounced their rights and hence received ₹25000 per share from the rights issue. Using the money collected from the rights issue Tata Sons acquired shares in the group companies. In 1997 the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 which made takeovers easier in India thereby encouraging many promoters of Indian companies to increase their stake in their group companies to pre-empt any hostile takeover. During this time Tata Sons’ stake in Tata Steel increased substantially—from a mere 2 per cent in 1994 to 29.75 per cent in 2016. By 2016 30 of the Tata Group companies were listed on India’s various stock exchanges. By the end of fiscal year 2015–16 total assets of the group companies stood at ₹6956 billion equivalent to approximately 2.12 per cent of India’s total corporate assets. In the fiscal year ending March 2015 the Tata Group firms generated 3.5 per cent of India’s total corporate revenue. Exhibit 4 presents the key financials (aggregate) of the Tata Group’s listed firms. Exhibit 5 presents the key financials of all the listed firms in India. Exhibit 6 shows India’s growth rates in gross domestic product and inflation rates (based on the Consumer Price Index). In emerging economies such as India product markets capital markets and labour markets were not as well developed as in many developed countries. In this scenario business groups played a critical role in filling the void created by the inadequacy of such markets. Business groups such as the Tata Group often played the role of a mediator between the group companies and any other third party. As a letter by Tata Sons to the shareholders of the group companies rightly mentioned “Tata companies do not exist in vacuum but benefit from being part of the Tata Group which is most evident in times of difficulty.” A conflict of interest often emerged between the promoter shareholders and the minority shareholders in India. The SEBI’s listing agreement made it mandatory for listed Indian companies to follow the prescribed governance practices which were in line with some of the best governance practices followed worldwide. The SEBI mandated that if a company had an executive chairman then at least 50 per cent of the board members must be independent directors and an independent director must chair the audit committee. In 2013 the SEBI also made it mandatory for Indian companies to obtain the permission of a majority of the minority shareholders if they decided to pursue any material-related party transaction. According to the Companies Act 2013 an independent director could serve a company for a maximum of 10 years. Tata Steel LimitedTata Iron and Steel Company (renamed Tata Steel in August 2005) was set up in 1907 at Jamshedpur India as Asia’s first integrated steel plant. By March 2016 Tata Steel had become the world’s 11th largest steelmaking company with an annual crude steel capacity of 29.5 million tons. In addition to its iron ore mines Tata Steel had its own captive coal mines which were located near its steel plants in the states of Jharkhand and Odisha giving the company a distinct cost advantage. Through its own divisions subsidiaries and strategic alliances Tata Steel’s product lines included the categories of tubes wires bearings ferro-alloys minerals and related industrial by-products. Being a Tata Group company the company adhered to the Tata Group code of conduct. The company proudly stated its vision statement: “We aspire to be the global steel industry benchmark for value creation and corporate citizenship.” Tata Steel completed the first phase of its second integrated plant in Kalinganagar Odisha in 2015. Although Tata Steel signed the memorandum of understanding with the Odisha government in 2004 the local community initially mounted stiff opposition to the plant which substantially delayed the project thereby increasing the total capital expenditure from the projected ₹150 billion to ₹400 billion by 2015. T. V. Narendran managing director of Tata Steel argued that Tata Steel was also spending money on building local infrastructure and amenities in addition to building the steel plant at Kalinganagar. According to Narendran “Typically it costs about $1 billion dollars (about ₹60 billion) to produce a million tonnes of steel. At Kalinganagar we are spending about ₹40-50 billion extra at the project site to build local infrastructure and amenities.” The completion of the first phase of the Kalinganagar plant increased Tata Steel’s total capacity by 3 million tons per year. Tata Steel expected that by the end of 2025 the Kalinganagar plant would have a final capacity of 16 million tons per year.Tata Steel acquired NatSteel of Singapore in 2005 and Corus in the United Kingdom in 2007. The Corus acquisition enabled Tata Steel to move from its position as the world’s 56th largest steelmaker to the world’s sixth largest steelmaker in 2007. Tata Steel was internationally diversified with production facilities located in India the United Kingdom the Netherlands Thailand Singapore China and Australia. Its plants in India were located in two locations: Jamshedpur which had an annual capacity of 9.7 million tons and Kalinganagar of Odisha which had an annual capacity of 3 million tons. Tata Steel Europe (previously Corus) had an annual capacity of 18 million tons at the end of 2016. Tata Steel acquired Corus on January 30 2007 by agreeing to pay £6.08 per share (approximately a 68 per cent premium over the price of Corus from the time Tata Steel initially showed its interest in buying Corus) in a fiercely competitive takeover after outbidding CSN (Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional) the Brazilian steelmaking company. Ratan Tata then chairman of Tata Steel called it “a moment of great fulfilment for all in India” and noted “This is the first step in showing that Indian industry can step outside its shores into an international market place as a global player.” The market was however surprised by this move by Tata Steel for a number of reasons. First the acquisition happened in 2007 when steel prices were very high which required Tata Steel to pay a huge premium over the (already high) value of Corus. In 2003 Corus’ stock was trading at around £0.10 per share when the company was almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Second Corus was a much larger company compared with Tata Steel and with Tata Steel having no prior experience in managing such large acquisitions many were skeptical about the company’s ability to reap any real benefits from the acquisition. On January 31 2007 a day after the announcement of the acquisition Tata Steel’s stock price in India fell by 10.46 per cent. Ratan Tata however defended the move saying “Quite frankly I do feel [the stock market] is both taking a short-term and harsh view. . . . In future somebody will look back and say we did the right thing.”Tata Steel funded the Corus acquisition using a mix of equity quasi-equity (funded by Tata Steel Asia and Tata Steel Singapore) and debt raised by Tata Steel UK. Including the existing debt of US$846 million the total debt taken by Tata Steel UK increased by US$6989 million. This additional borrowing increased Tata Steel’s debt in its consolidated balance sheet by more than 100 per cent in 2007–2008. Although the debt fell marginally in 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 it increased again in 2012–2013 and stood at ₹838.04 billion on March 31 2016. Exhibit 7 shows the key financials of Tata Steel. Exhibit 8 shows the key financials of JSW Steel a peer company belonging to the O. P. Jindal Group. Although Tata Steel’s Indian operations remained profitable its European operations proved to be unprofitable within two years of Tata Steel’s acquisition of Corus. Except for 2013–2014 when Tata Steel Europe reported a meagre net income of ₹454.2 million Tata Steel reported losses in all other financial years after 2008–2009 forcing Tata Steel to report consolidated net losses in 2009–2010 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 (see Exhibit 9). The losses in the European operations were due to the 2008 global recession and the drop in the growth rate in China that resulted in a decrease of steel prices both of which adversely affected the performance of all steel companies in the world (see Exhibit 10). T. V. Narendran managing director of Tata Steel summarized his frustration saying “If Tata Steel did not have to worry about shareholders and profits we too could have sold steel at any price just to keep our plants running.” In 2009 Tata Steel laid off 2500 workers across the United Kingdom due to the economic downturn. In 2015 Tata Steel announced another 900 job losses because of the restructuring of its European operations. After writing off ₹83.56 billion in 2012–2013 and ₹65.28 billion in 2014–2015 as impairment charges largely related to its European operations Tata Steel finally decided to sell off its European division in March 2016. On the day after this announcement the stock price of Tata Steel increased by approximately 7 per cent.Mistry removed as chairman of Tata SonsOn October 24 2016 all employees of the Tata Group received an email from Ratan Tata stating that the board of Tata Sons had replaced Mistry as chairman. The board had constituted a selection committee to appoint a new chairman and it had appointed Ratan Tata as the interim chairman. In a second letter dated November 1 2016 Ratan Tata justified the move saying “This difficult decision made after careful and thoughtful deliberation is one the board believes was absolutely necessary for the future success of the Tata Group” and noting that the group companies should be leading rather than following. Although no reason was given in the original communication sent from Ratan Tata the Indian media believed that Tata Sons was unhappy with Mistry’s decision to sell unprofitable businesses including Tata Steel Europe and to focus only on cash cows (i.e. those businesses that provided a steady profit).On October 25 2016 Mistry sent a letter to the directors of Tata Sons complaining about the unfairness of the decision. He argued that the total debts of the Tata Group companies were very high because of the foreign acquisition strategy adopted by Ratan Tata. Mistry argued that although he had been an independent director of Tata Sons prior to 2012 he never had a “clear grasp of the gravity” of the problems the group was facing. Secondly Mistry complained that Ratan Tata had often interfered in his functioning despite at the time of his appointment his having been promised to have a free hand. For example Ratan Tata forced Mistry to enter the aviation sector even though Mistry’s first priority was to improve the performance of the existing group companies and help them to come out of the mess some of them were in. Although Mistry was removed from the chairmanship of Tata Sons he continued to function as the chairman of the listed companies of the Tata Group. Mistry in fact chaired a session of Tata Global Beverages on October 26 2016. The biggest support for Mistry came from the independent directors of some of the group companies. Independent directors of Tata Chemicals supported Mistry and praised him for the various decisions made by him in a meeting held on November 4 2016. On the same day the independent directors of IHCL another Tata Group company backed Mistry expressing appreciation for the steps he had taken “in providing strategic direction and leadership.”Mistry removed as Chairman of Group Companies Article 90 of TCS’s Articles of Association extended Tata Sons the right to nominate any person as the chairman of a group company as long as Tata Sons had a stake of at least 26 per cent. Under this article Tata Sons appointed Ishaat Hussain as TCS’s chairman on November 10 2016. The board of Tata Steel similarly appointed O. P. Bhatt as its chairman on November 25 2016. Mistry criticized both these decisions. Although Tata Sons had the right to nominate a chairman a board meeting was necessary. Similarly a circular resolution route had been used to replace Mistry at Tata Steel. But the move to replace Mistry with O. P. Gupta ex-chairman of the State Bank of India was supported by J. N. Gupta of Stakeholder Empowerment Services who said “It is a battle between two individuals and the company should not be made to suffer in this fight. The board has a duty to stakeholders and not to any individual.” Although Mistry was removed as the chairman of these companies he continued to be a director on the boards of these companies.Tata Sons’ Plan to remove Mistry as a Director at TATA Group CompaniesThe independent directors of Tata Chemicals included Nusli Wadia the promoter and chief executive officer of various Wadia Group companies including GoAir Bombay Dyeing and Britannia. Wadia was a long-time friend of Rata Tata and Wadia’s decision to support Mistry did not go well with Ratan Tata. When Mistry showed no sign of resigning from the boards of the various Tata Group companies Tata Sons asked the individual group companies to call EGMs to remove Mistry from the post of the director/chairman. Wadia was an independent director at Tata Steel Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals. Tata Sons also asked these three companies to garner permission from their shareholders to remove Wadia.EGMs for the different group companies were to be held between December 13 2016 and December 26 2016 (see Exhibit 11). Ratan Tata sent a letter dated December 7 2016 to the shareholders of all Tata Group companies urging them to vote in favour of the resolution to remove Mistry as the chairman and director of the respective group companies. Ratan Tata explained that when the board of Tata Sons was unhappy with Mistry’s performance he had been given an opportunity to resign from the board. It was only when Mistry refused to resign that the board had dismissed him. Ratan Tata argued that some of the investments made by the group would take time to be profitable and that the Tata Group had exited from only the unviable businesses. He also argued that the group companies benefited from their association with the group Mistry had a “disruptive influence” on the group companies and the presence of Mistry as the chairman could make the companies “dysfunctional.” Mistry disagreed with most of these points and argued that just five minutes before the board meeting he had been informed that the trustees of Tata Sons were unhappy with him and wanted him to leave “ostensibly because Mr. [Ratan] Tata did not get along with him.”Tata Sons sent a letter to all the shareholders on December 12 2016 explaining some of the reasons for removing Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons: (1) dividends paid by group companies had decreased; (2) Mistry often complained about bad legacy issues even though he had been aware of them; (3) Mistry had misled the selection committee in 2011 with his lofty plans for the group but subsequently failed to lead the group; (4) Mistry did not distance himself from his own family-run business the Shapoorji Pallonji Group; and (5) Mistry had increased his concentration of power and authority after becoming chairman of Tata Sons which was against the interests of the group companies. The letter concluded by stating “Tata Sons is therefore compelled to propose the removal of Mr. Cyrus P. Mistry as the Chairman and Director of all Tata Group Companies by convening Extraordinary General Meetings. . . .”EGM in Tata SteelShareholders of Tata Steel received an email dated November 25 2016 informing them of the EGM to be held on December 21 2016 in Mumbai with the sole agenda of removing both Mistry and Wadia from the company’s board. The EGM was called on the requisition made by Tata Sons which held 29.75 per cent of Tata Steel’s total shares. The shareholders could vote electronically between December 18 and December 20 2016. The EGM notice also contained the letter sent by Tata Sons on November 10 2016 to the board of Tata Steel asking it to convene the EGM. The letter alleged that Mistry’s “unsubstantiated allegations” had caused harm to Tata Steel and its various stakeholders and hence he should leave. The letter also alleged that Wadia had been “acting in concert” with Mistry and that he was behaving as an interested party by gathering support from other independent directors; hence he should also be removed as an independent director. The letter also pointed out the benefits that Tata Steel received by being a part of the Tata Group. In particular Tata Steel could use the Tata brand because of the Tata Brand Equity and Business Promotion Agreement it had signed with Tata Sons. The letter claimed that Tata Steel was receiving “substantial benefits” because of its association with Tata Group. Cyrus Mistry then sent an email dated December 5 2016 to all the shareholders of Tata Steel under Section 169 of the Companies Act 2013. Mistry alleged that he was never given a free hand in running the group companies though he had been assured of such freedom at the time of his appointment. He also claimed that governance failures existed in all the listed Tata Group companies because of frequent intervention from the trustees of the various trusts who owned approximately 66 per cent of the shares in Tata Sons and that poor investments made by Ratan Tata and the subsequent increase in debt had dragged down the performance of the group companies although he had tried his best to manage those companies. Mistry financed the entire capital expenditure of US$25 billion over 2013–2016 through internal accruals. To substantiate his statements Mistry argued that Tata Sons’ Nomination and Remuneration Committee had lauded his performance and had recommended Mistry receive a 6 per cent pay hike on June 28 2016.Mistry was particularly vocal about the need for stronger corporate governance in the Tata Group saying that the group needed more than “just the imagery that the [Tata] name evokes.” He argued that the future of the Tata Group depended on how the Tata Trusts were governed by the trustees. The trustees should not interfere in the functioning of Tata Sons as doing so might affect the preferential tax status of the trusts which were essentially public charitable trusts. Minstry alleged that Both Ratan Tata and N. A. Soonawala trustees of the Tata Trusts had misused the Articles of Association to ask for information on any subject pertaining to a group company even though doing so gave them personal benefits. The trustees forced Tata Sons to enter the civil aviation business by forming a joint venture with Air Asia and starting Vistara Airlines another joint venture with Singapore Airlines. Similarly two months before Mistry was replaced two new directors had joined the board of Tata Sons at the behest of Ratan Tata. These new directors along with the trustee-nominated directors voted for the removal of Mistry at Tata Sons’ board meeting on October 24 2016.In addition Mistry also referred to the fraudulent transactions worth ₹220 million between Tata Sons and Air Asia that had been exposed after forensic investigations. In reply to Ratan Tata’s allegations that Mistry had not distanced himself from his family-owned group Mistry argued that the total value of transactions between the Tata Group and his own family business had decreased from ₹11 billion in 2012 to zero in 2016. Mistry alleged that according to Tata Sons’ Articles of Association to replace and appoint a new executive chairman required the formation of a selection committee. No such selection committee had been formed to appoint his replacement. Tata Group’s retirement policy also did not allow anyone older than 75 years of age to join the board as a director but Ratan Tata aged 79 had become its interim director. Mistry also alluded to the possibility that his decision to sell Tata Steel Europe (which Tata Steel had acquired under the chairmanship of Ratan Tata) was one of the reasons for his removal from the board. To prove his point Mistry noted that on November 25 2016 Joy Bhattacharya who was both a close friend of Ratan Tata and a member of the selection panel that was set up to recruit Mistry’s successor said that Tata Steel would remain committed to Europe for at least another decade. On December 13 2016 Wadia an independent director at Tata Steel sent a letter to all shareholders of Tata Steel stating that he was being removed from Tata Steel because Tata Sons believed that he was acting against the interest of Tata Sons. However as an independent director he should work for the interests of the company and not the promoter shareholder group. He also argued that Tata St",,,,,
el had invested close to ₹140 billion in other Tata Group companies and as Tata Steel had lot of debt it should simply sell those shares and repay an equivalent amount of debt to save on interest expenses. Wadia concluded his letter by stating “It is now in your hands to decide not on my fate as an Independent Director of Tata Steel but on the fate of the very institution of Independent Director requires to be protected.”What Should Tata Steel Shareholders Do?The shareholders of Tata Steel needed to vote on two resolutions for removing Mistry and Wadia from the board. The shareholders could vote for or against both the resolutions. Alternatively they could vote against only one resolution. Although Tata Steel’s board had already removed Mistry as its chairman it had not taken any such action against Wadia. Before TCS’s EGM where proxy advisor firms such as ISS and InGovern advised the shareholders to vote against the resolutions others such as Stakeholders Empowerment Services and Institutional Investor Advisory Services advised the shareholders to vote in favour of the resolution. Shriram Subramanian of InGovern argued that Tata lacked a convincing argument against Mistry and further added that “personal vendetta or enmity cannot be a reason to remove a chairman.” Although Institutional Investor Advisory Services had initially advised shareholders to vote against the proposal to remove Wadia it changed its opinion on December 16 2017 on the grounds of the deteriorating relationship between Wadia and Ratan Tata and argued that Wadia’s presence in Tata Steel’s boardroom “is likely to be a distraction.” At TCS’s EGM held on December 13 2016 78 per cent of the individual investors and 43 per cent of the institutional investors voted in favour of Mistry (i.e. against the resolution of Tata Sons). However as Tata Sons owned 73 per cent of the total shares it managed to pass the resolution that sought Mistry’s removal from the TCS board. Tata Sons controlled only 31 per cent of the total shares in Tata Steel and it was unclear what the outcome of the voting would be. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) controlled more than 13 per cent of Tata Steel’s shares. At TCS’s EGM LIC abstained from voting. Nobody knew how the institutional investors including LIC would vote at Tata Steel’s EGM. On December 16 2016 the last trading day before the electronic voting on these two resolutions started Tata Steel stock closed at ₹414.05 per share.endnotES,0,,,,,

The emails between Cleghorn and Ackman at first blush appeared conciliatory but a careful reading by Cleghorn knew that was far from the truth using the term war was unwarranted and almost insulting. It was February 6 2012 and Cleghorn had just finished reading a report discussing investor confidence levels in CP’s management and the results were not favourable. Tensions between CP and its shareholders had escalated ever since Ackman had threatened to launch a proxy contest five weeks earlier. Cleghorn wanted to ignore the recent confidence poll but wondered if his approach to protecting shareholder interests needed to change given recent events.Cleghorn’s response to “War and peace”After receiving a not-so-subtle threat of a proxy battle from Ackman in an e-mail titled “War and Peace” Cleghorn reached out to shareholders as quickly as possible to address Pershing’s accusations. Given that shareholder activism was a rare occurrence in Canada there were limited precedents for how to respond. In consultation with fellow board members Cleghorn issued a three-page letter to shareholders (see Exhibit 1) on January 9 2012 in support of the company’s strategic plan and existing management team. Specifically he addressed three key points:The company was aggressively executing on its multi-year plan” and expected to achieve an operating ratio in the low 70s in the next three years.Pershing did not have a credible improvement plan and its stated objective of an operating ratio of 65 per cent for CP in 2015 was virtually impossible.The company had carefully considered Pershing’s request to replace current CEO Fred Green with Hunter Harrison the retired CEO of the Canadian National Railway (CN); however the board unanimously agreed that this would jeopardize the successful execution of the multi-year plan” and was not in the best interests of shareholders.In an interview with Bloomberg later that day January 6 2012 Ackman publicly disclosed Pershing’s intent to initiate a proxy contest for CP.PErshing announces new director nominees On January 24 Pershing issued a press release announcing a slate of five directors for election to the board of directors at CP’s annual shareholders’ meeting on May 17 2012. The proposed directors included Ackman and business partner Paul Hilal as well as seasoned business leaders with experience as executives or directors of various Canadian businesses. In addition to announcing the director nominees the press release reiterated Pershing’s intention to install Harrison as CEO. Since early January Harrison had publicly supported Pershing’s agenda stating “I would be proud to help lead CP to victory. Should the board determine that I am the best candidate to lead the company I would be honoured to serve.” This declaration was made despite a lawsuit initiated by CN against Harrison on January 23 which cited breaches of the non-compete provisions in his contract owing to his involvement with Pershing. Following the lawsuit filing CN suspended payment of Harrison’s pension and certain other benefits valued at approximately CA$40 million. Ackman responded by confirming that Pershing would indemnify Harrison against any losses arising from the lawsuit including guaranteeing his pensions and benefit payments. One week later Harrison purchased $5 million worth of CP stock with his personal funds.PERSHING HOLDS INVESTOR TOWN HALLOn January 30 Pershing announced its intention to host a town hall meeting for CP investors and other interested parties. The meeting would include a presentation by Ackman Hilal and Harrison and each of Pershing’s director nominees would be in attendance. Pershing followed through by hosting a “CP Rising” town hall in Toronto on February 6 in front of 350 shareholders analysts and media personnel and an additional 1000 viewers via an online webcast. After a brief introduction by Ackman at Pershing’s town hall meeting Hilal presented a series of slides highlighting CP’s performance over the past six years. Specifically Pershing blamed CP’s poor performance on “substandard service” levels limiting pricing power as well as rising unit costs. Further CP was also accused of overpaying for its 2007 acquisition of the Dakota Minnesota and Eastern Railroad resulting in poor cash flow and productivity. Following the presentation on the perceived failings of CP’s board and management team Ackman “interviewed” Harrison for the role of CEO at CP. During the discussion Harrison was not shy about his accomplishments and commitment to improving CP stating that if he could not deliver results “You can hang me in Times Square and pay me nothing.” His strategy was clear—implement precision railroading in the same manner as he had done at CN to enhance operational efficiency. Precision railroading would require CP to focus on enforcing stringent train schedules thereby reducing idle time and maximizing the utilization of its trains. The downside of this strategy was the potential for trains to depart with or without the required cargo and/or delivering shipments when other parties in the supply chain (e.g. boats) were not prepared to take them. Although CP’s role in the supply chain would be highly precise the potential for subsequent delays and missed cargo could upset customers.After the town hall meeting CP management issued a letter to CP employees updating them on CP’s progress against the multi-year plan and countering statements made by Pershing during the event suggesting that CP management believed that Pershing had presented a series of inaccuracies. No further public statements were made by CP.WANING INVESTOR SUPPORTOn February 16 consulting firm Brendan Wood International (Brendan Wood) released a special report for CP shareholders outlining its findings with respect to investor confidence levels in the firm. Based on Brendan Wood’s study confidence in CP’s senior management ranked in the bottom 5 per cent among the 41 firms in Brendan Wood’s Global Transportation Index. While the poll did not necessarily reflect the views of CP shareholders it provided an indication of the sentiment among equity market participants (see Exhibit 2). Since the beginning of the year Cleghorn had met with various CP shareholders and analysts to discuss the speculation regarding Pershing’s proposal and feedback from shareholders had been discussed at the board level.STAY THE COURSE?Despite the Brendan Wood report Cleghorn’s personal conversations with CP shareholders indicated that confidence in the firm’s strategy and management team remained positive. Indeed a long-time CP customer and shareholder criticized Ackman at his town hall for leading “a terrible forum because it’s been so one-sided.” Notwithstanding Ackman’s behaviour received significant media attention and was an unwelcome distraction to the company at a time when it needed to maintain focus on operations. Cleghorn had a clear choice to continue to defend CP’s existing approach or call a truce with Ackman. If he chose the latter what would the compromise be?EXHIBIT 1: EXCERPTS FROM CP LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS JANUARY 9 2012CP’s multi-year plan has three key elements—driving volume growth expanding network capacity to safely and efficiently support higher volumes and controlling costs. CP’s management team is aggressively executing on the company’s multi-year plan and has the full support of the board of directors. . . .The board is confident in CP’s ability to reach an operating ratio (“OR”) or operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the low 70s in the next three years. We will not stop there—as we achieve our goals we will set new targets. . . .The board takes all suggestions from shareholders seriously and has carefully considered Pershing Square’s demand that CP replace the company’s chief executive officer with Hunter Harrison…. the board came to the unanimous conclusion that replacing the company’s chief executive officer… is not in the best interests of CP or its shareholders. . . .Pershing Square stated that Mr. Harrison would only begin to develop a detailed plan over a number of months. Despite the absence of a credible detailed plan Pershing Square has stated to CP that an improvement in OR from 78 in 2010 to 65 in 2015 is achievable. This pace of improvement from this starting point has never been achieved by any railway management team. . . .As Ed Harris who has served as EVP of Operations for both CP and CN has told the Board “It is a mistake to underestimate the differences between the infrastructure of CP and CN. On the one hand in CN you have a railroad that was built by Canadian taxpayers with twice the proportion of sidings and double track and that therefore benefits from significantly enhanced operating flexibility. On the other hand CP has to contend with greater geographic challenges. I am pleased to see significant improvement in CP’s operating metrics as a result of planned initiatives.”. . .The board’s overriding responsibility is to act in the best interests of the company and we believe that Pershing Square’s repeatedly stated agenda of management change would be detrimental to the company and its shareholders. . . .We reiterate our offer to have Mr. Ackman join our board so that a constructive board-level dialogue based on all the relevant facts and information can commence.Note: CP = Canadian Pacific Railway; Pershing Square = Pershing Square Capital Management; EVP = executive vice-president; CN = Canadian National RailwaySource: “CP Executing on Clear Plan to Achieve Low 70s Operating Ratio as Quickly and Efficiently as Possible” Cision PR Newswire January 9 2012 accessed June 12 2017 www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cp-executing-on-clear-plan-to-achieve-low-70s-operating-ratio-as-quickly-and-efficiently-as-possible-136933158.html?.EXHIBIT 2: BRENDAN WOOD INTERNATIONAL SURVEY RESULTSSource: “Shareholder Confidence Problems Back Ackman’s Challenge of CP Management” TopGun Press February 16 2012 accessed June 13 2017 http://topgunpress.com/shareholder-confidence-issues-back-ackmans-challenge-of-cp-management/.",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,71

It was July 2016—the hottest part of another sweltering Dubai summer—and reminiscing about his journey thus far with BMB he felt both satisfied and proud. In just 10 years BMB had gone from its foundations as a start-up baking goods supplier to being the biggest producer of gourmet chocolates and Middle Eastern confectionery in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Private-label highly customized confectionery made for other brands had proven to be a winning strategy in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that comprise most of the Arabian Peninsula. However Khachab and his cousin—BMB’s founder and chief executive officer Bilal Ballout—felt it was time to transition to a business-to-consumer (B2C) model. Establishing BMB brands was essential to continued growth because the partners felt the private-label space would soon fill up with competitors. Ballout was thinking even bigger; their most recent conversation echoed in Khachab’s mind: “We dream of expanding into new markets. [Our] ‘Mely’s’ brand will make that dream come true.” Now Khachab considered the main question facing the partners: which market should BMB enter? As Khachab saw it there were three options: (1) go where Middle Eastern sweets were already popular but compete with many producers; (2) target Arab expatriate populations that might embrace the products and partner with local distributors; or (3) focus on markets where the population showed a preference for sweets but had relatively limited exposure to or preference for Middle Eastern sweets and use BMB brands to set the standard. “New markets” Khachab repeated to himself. “We have a popular product in the GCC. How will the rest of the world embrace it?”The BMB StoryBMB began in 2006 when Ballout was looking for a professional opportunity after completing his Master of Science in Finance in the United Kingdom. Having given up a position with a global consulting firm he returned to Dubai UAE to work in his family’s small confectionery shop. Focusing on the shop’s supply chain he identified a major business niche going unexploited: providing high-quality ingredients and equipment to chocolatiers and bakers in the UAE. Accordingly at the age of 22 and with his brother’s support Ballout established a baking goods trading company called BMB. This trade business soon became a runaway success and Ballout decided that BMB should also open its own facility to produce private-label chocolates and Middle Eastern sweets including baklava and other traditional snacks like halva nougat and a popular date-filled biscuit called ma’amoul (see Exhibit 1).As BMB grew Middle Eastern sweets were at the forefront of its expansion strategy. BMB supplied these private-label products to hypermarkets duty-free shops and hospitality partners throughout the Emirates. By 2009 Khachab had joined the company. BMB was growing quickly and had even begun exporting products to its GCC neighbors Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (see Exhibit 2).By 2016 BMB was producing roughly 2000 tonnes of chocolates and 2500 tonnes of Middle Eastern sweets per year with annual sales above US$68 million. From its humble beginnings BMB had grown to comprise more than 1000 employees with offices in Dubai Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) and Doha (Qatar). In addition to the chocolate and sweets factory BMB also operated a raw materials factory and a printing and packaging facility. Despite such rapid growth BMB leadership focused on trying to preserve the company’s original culture. Core values such as teamwork innovation development and a passion for quality were at the core of the firm’s day-to-day operations. It was especially imperative for the partners to maintain these values as the organization grew. With the company’s higher-than-average turnover rate instilling these values in all workers was an ongoing challenge. The human resource (HR) team was interested in programs to increase worker retention and management was investing heavily in employee development working with the region’s industry and thought leaders.THE Confectionery Industry in the GCC The confectionery industry had enjoyed years of fast growth in the Middle East (and especially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia) due in part to the exponential growth in incomes of the people living in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In 2014 the overall Middle Eastern and African snacks market was roughly $7 billion and growing at 5 per cent per year; this number included $1 billion in biscuit sales and $2 billion in confectionery sales. The chocolate market in the UAE was expected to grow at about 6.1 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) until 2019 compared to 2.3 per cent globally. The confectionery market in Saudi Arabia—BMB’s biggest sales area—was expected to grow at 12 to 14 per cent CAGR until 2018. Throughout the Middle East the confectionery market was expected to top $3 billion by the end of 2017 and to reach $6 billion in the Middle East and North Africa region.Confectionery sales in the Middle East were dominated by major corporations such as Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) Mars Inc. (Mars) and Mondelēz International. These multinational corporations were attracted to the fast-growing markets of the GCC. Facilities in Dubai could easily serve markets in the Middle East Africa and Europe. Access to fast-growing emerging markets was especially important for mature companies that aimed to maintain growth. In 2015 for example Nestlé saw 1.9 per cent growth in developed markets compared to 7 per cent growth in emerging markets.The regional importance of the Middle East was evident in the large investments it attracted. Snack manufacturers and confectioners were spending hundreds of millions of dollars to access the surrounding markets. In 2010 Mars and Nestlé each opened a factory in Dubai for a combined $176 million worth of investments. Four years later Mars undertook a $60 million investment expansion and built an $80 million factory in Saudi Arabia. Over the same period Nestlé invested $400 million.Mars and Nestlé dominated the market with “countline” snacks (i.e. candy bars and cookies sold to retailers in large boxes and then individually resold to customers). Yet with the overall Middle Eastern snacks market growing by 20 per cent per year there was abundant potential for smaller gourmet manufacturers such as BMB. The gourmet chocolate market was worth almost $300 million in 2016. Gourmet snacks in general were bolstered by a tradition of gifting in the Middle East. Sharing gourmet treats during the Ramadan holiday had become very common; individuals would buy fancy chocolates and Middle Eastern sweets for family and friends as well as to give to charities. There were two other trends that gave BMB a sales advantage. In line with rising affluence in the region young adult customers were increasingly demanding customization and quality as well as healthier and more ethically sourced products. A mass-produced chocolate bar was less likely to appeal to these consumers as much as a treat with a unique package taste or story. Many gourmet producers had taken note of this trend and they began to target the UAE market. Dozens of foreign luxury brands (e.g. Forrey & Galland Godiva and Patchi among many others) were establishing upscale boutiques and the competition was growing.As snacking habits matured in the Middle East so too did consciousness about healthy eating. Because of various social and economic conditions diabetes and obesity had emerged as serious health concerns throughout the region. In response consumers began to demand more sugar-free low-fat and even organic snack options. To respond to this demand BMB developed sugar-free and low-fat treats.BaklavaWith origins in the Ottoman Empire baklava was a popular delicacy made from crispy layers of phyllo pastry with a nut filling baked in clarified butter and soaked in honey (or agave syrup in the case of sugar-free baklava). The final treat came in many forms and sizes but was usually cut or folded into a bite-sized snack. In the Middle East and Turkey it was commonly served to guests especially during cultural and religious celebrations. Baklava’s popularity and many regional variations were captured by a few well-known lines:Ask the Greeks and they will say “The Lebanese stole the recipe.”Ask the Lebanese and they will say “The Greeks stole the recipe.”Ask the Turkish and they will say “Our pashas and viziers owned the recipe.”Ask the Armenians and they will say “We invented and improved the recipe.”Ask any of them and they will say “Our baklava is the best and our pronunciation is the correct pronunciation.”BMB produced many variations of baklava which sold well throughout the GCC. Saudi Arabia was the biggest consumer and the biannual Eid feasts were the busiest periods for sales of baklava. There was also high demand throughout the month of Ramadan when Muslims were encouraged to give to the poor and hungry and to fast daily until sunset when friends and family gathered to break the fast.BMB BrandsBMB had recently developed four brands as part of their exploration of a B2C model: “Asateer” “Al Qamar” “Petit Gourmet” and “Mely’s” (see Exhibit 3). Only baklava and chocolate-covered dates were sold under the Mely’s brand; the other brands sold BMB’s full range of Middle Eastern sweets. Khachab and Ballout hoped that these brands would help them pivot strategically both at home and abroad. The Asateer (meaning “legends”) brand emphasized ethnic Arab culture and tradition. The packaging combined stylized Arabic calligraphy with classical Middle Eastern design elements. The product boxes (up to 1000 grams (g)) were heavy duty and had a luxurious feel that made them ideal for gifting. Asateer’s target market comprised tourists looking for souvenirs and Arab communities seeking a high-end sweets experience. Asateer had a premium price and was primarily sold in duty-free and souvenir shops as well as select grocery stores in the UAE and Qatar.The Al Qamar (meaning “the moon”) brand was also geared toward Arab communities but with emphasis on local sales as a common household good—a pantry dessert staple that the whole family could enjoy rather than an extravagant treat. To appeal to everyday shoppers Al Qamar had a more minimalist design concept: modern but distinctly Middle Eastern it featured simplified Arabic text (akin to a sans serif font in the Roman alphabet) and solid colour schemes. The brand was competitively priced in large boxes (up to 800 g) and found in major grocery stores throughout the UAE. Petit Gourmet (meaning “small gourmet”) appealed to European tastes. The brand’s smaller boxes (mostly 500 g or less) were designed with modern packaging and pen-and-ink script in the style of a signature. The brand dispensed with Middle Eastern motifs to better capture the European bakery tradition. Petit Gourmet products carried a premium price and were found primarily in smaller grocery stores and duty-free shops in the UAE and Qatar.The Mely’s brand focused on single servings of baklava and dates. It was perhaps BMB’s most original concept “the Lindt of Middle Eastern sweets” according to BMB’s chief innovation officer. Mely’s dispensed with the common practice of packing rows of sweets into wide flat boxes. Instead each date or piece of baklava was individually wrapped in plastic pillow packaging and sold in boxes of up to 24 pieces. This was meant to appeal to health-conscious Western consumers as an anytime single-serving snack that could compete with cookies and sweet and salty snacks. Like Petit Gourmet Mely’s used packaging designs that were modern and free of traditional Middle Eastern motifs. Marketing for these products centred around the slogan “Be the joy” and encouraged consumers to share the treat with friends. Inside the box were pouches that could hold three or four pieces at a time to be brought to work or sent to school or given as a small gift. As a brand Mely’s was still in development and Ballout and Khachab were very excited about its potential.Potential New MarketsKhachab kept returning to a fundamental question: Should the company bet on unproven markets with no tradition of baklava (and thus no major competition) or should it target consumers who were known to love baklava (and therefore fight for space in an increasingly competitive environment)? While there was no obvious answer he could nevertheless make an informed decision. Khachab picked up a folder containing market analyses of 12 countries. He had commissioned them from a local start-up consulting firm of recent MBA graduates more to test their competence than anything. Yet now these analyses were proving to be surprisingly useful. At a late-night meeting earlier in the week he and Ballout had pored over the study and narrowed the field to three countries: Turkey the United States and India (see Exhibit 4).Turkey: The Birthplace of BaklavaTurkey was the quintessential example of a saturated market. Anyone who had visited Istanbul was familiar with the common window displays featuring towering stacks of baklava. The country’s $3 billion baklava industry produced nearly 1000 tonnes of the delicacy per day with per capita consumption at roughly 4.4 kilograms (kg) per year. Accordingly Turkish consumers and retailers had hundreds of suppliers to choose from and prices were extremely competitive: $8.42 per kg on average compared to an average of $17.06 per kg in the UAE. Khachab believed that in order for BMB to bring its baklava to Turkey branding would be critical to differentiate its product from the many local sources; perhaps it could be sold as a premium import. Then again it would be difficult to distinguish BMB’s products as premium products in the birthplace of baklava so perhaps a more successful strategy would simply be to supply a high-end local partner.The United States: An Opportunity to “Plant the Flag”The United States had a relatively small population of Middle Eastern expatriates—approximately 1.5 million—with a median household income of around $56000. BMB could play to the nostalgia of this population which was clustered in a handful of population centres including New York City Los Angeles Chicago and Detroit. While commercial and market risk would be low because the population would undoubtedly recognize and appreciate the product and the competition would be less intense than in Turkey Khachab also knew that BMB was not the first to bring baklava to these expatriates. Did that make a differentiator even more important or was the need for branding diminished? Why go to the trouble of establishing a brand and earning loyalty if BMB could work through local players that were already trusted by local consumers? In some ways undertaking this kind of relationship would represent a regression for BMB a step backward to its early business-to-business (B2B) model. Yet while a B2B opportunity appeared unexciting this had been BMB’s core strategy from the beginning and the company was adept at handling such relationships. There was also the appeal of the vast American market but this came with many challenges. The United States did not have a strong tradition of baklava. It was seen as a delicious but uncommon curiosity—something purchased in a Middle Eastern café or store. American consumers were also increasingly health conscious and might not want boxes of honey-soaked treats. Appealing to these consumers would take careful planning and brand image could be critical. India: A Market Extension WagerIndians in the UAE may have developed a taste for baklava but there was little familiarity with the treat in India itself. Still Indians clearly enjoyed sweets. The large expatriate population living and working in Dubai had familiarized Khachab with India’s many sweet and rich desserts; this was promising for the prospects of baklava in India. In India’s large cities it would take only a small percentage of devotees to turn over high sales volumes. If BMB entered aggressively with a well-designed brand it could set the standard for baklava—an upscale imported “special occasion” kind of dessert with a bit of ostentatious flair. Indeed where it was sold in India baklava went for prices close to those in the United States despite Indians’ relatively lower purchasing power. India’s numerous religious and cultural festivals such as Diwali could also drive sales much as Ramadan did in the Middle East. India’s Muslim population totalled roughly 200 million—four times the population of the UAE Saudi Arabia Oman Qatar Bahrain and Kuwait combined. Simply establishing itself could present BMB with a challenge however; the World Bank ranked India 130th out of 190 countries for overall ease of doing business and the country was ranked even lower (172nd) when it came to enforcing contracts.The Global Arab DiasporaMiddle Eastern and North African expatriates were estimated to number approximately 20 million worldwide. England and Wales had an Arab population of around 300000 in 2011. In Canada in the same year roughly 400000 people claimed full or partial Arab heritage; many of these people were clustered in Ontario. The Arab population in Mexico was estimated to be about 1 per cent of the population or roughly 1.3 million people. Meanwhile the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported 7–10 million Brazilians of Lebanese ancestry giving Brazil possibly the largest Arab population outside the Middle East. Where to Globalize?Expansion plans for Turkey the United States or India were all attractive due to various respective factors such as a common language overlapping cultures geographical proximity or market size. Ballout and Khachab had successfully navigated BMB through the dangerous waters of its infancy weathering the 2008 global financial crisis along the way. They were proud of their rapid expansion and regional footprint. As they looked forward to the next decade how could they build on BMB’s early success? Could they push for global growth? If so where and how? The B2B model had been the engine of their success thus far but the prospect of increasing competition in the private-label business had driven them into the B2C model as well.Ballout’s plan for expansion centred on bringing baklava to new markets; this could be done either through the B2B model or with a B2C model using the new brands. Either way expansion would be a major strategic pivot. BMB previously exported only to business partners in nearby countries with similar culinary traditions and tastes. To establish a foothold in new markets would require new thinking and new strategies.Khachab’s job then was to determine how and in which markets BMB’s baklava would thrive. Could BMB outcompete other producers in baklava-loving markets? Or should the company aim for volume in a risky market where baklava was not well known? Maybe BMB could capture the best of both worlds by targeting large expatriate populations around the world. Alternatively perhaps the firm should pursue another strategy altogether. Khachab and Ballout both felt that BMB’s primary tool was branding but it was not clear where or how this tool could or should be used. BMB had earned a regional reputation for quality goods but this could not be relied on in new markets. Would BMB’s brands—especially Mely’s and Petit Gourmet—aid the company’s ambitious plans for expansion? Or was the firm biting off “more than it could chew?”Exhibit 1: BMB’s Middle Eastern sweets (baklava and ma’amoul)Source: Company materials.Exhibit 2: Countries of the GCC (Shaded/in yellow)Source: Company documents.

(Birks) a renowned Canadian luxury retailer and jewellery company with a historical pedigree dating back to the 19th century. Having held positions as the president and CEO of Boucheron International the president and managing director of Richemont & Cartier France and the international executive director of Richemont International Bédos arrived at Birks at a time when the brand’s appeal was waning and its positioning was unclear. The retail industry had undergone a significant decrease in traffic since the 2008 financial crisis and with his strong track record in the luxury industry Bédos knew that Birks had not spent much of the previous decade adapting to the new market realities. “The stores lack modernity [and] attractiveness” he thought. “They don’t stimulate curiosity or appetite from the consumers.” Thus with visionary flair and a firm emphasis on branding Bédos reinvigorated and modernized the business editing its offerings reimagining the store concept and format and launching an in-house Birks jewellery line. Yet with the company revitalized and posting profits since 2016 Bédos faced a new set of challenges. At the beginning of 2017 what were the best ways to grow Birks and optimize resources and effort? Where were the greatest opportunities for value creation? What should Birks focus on in the Canadian market and what shape should its international expansion take? What role would e-commerce play? How far and in what directions should Birks extend its brand?CHANGES IN The Luxury Jewellery SpaceMarket research showed that the fine jewellery industry had recovered from the 2008 crisis and ensuing recession and was building to a robust future. Although the financial crisis hit the fashion apparel industry harder than the jewellery market cultural and economic changes had affected Birks in way that management could no longer ignore. As Bédos recognized millennial consumers differed from the preceding generations of luxury jewellery buyers who had tended to follow a predictable path to purchase. Reports documented different paths for millennials influenced by statistically higher marrying ages increased use of digital technologies online shopping and a cultural thirst for experiences rather than material things. A greater sense of social responsibility and environmental concern also shifted the approaches to consumerism for both millennial customers and the companies catering to them. New demands arose for ethically sourced and sustainable jewellery. For a generation that valued authenticity jewellery became another token of self-expression with self-purchases growing alongside traditional practices of gifting jewellery. E-commerce and digital communications further complicated the consumer landscape for millennials; many were “digital natives” who had grown up with unprecedented access to information. In the newly “wired” world increased global offerings and greater price awareness led to heightened competition and a faster spreading of trends. However there was still resistance to change within the luxury goods industry as many major brands—including most of the high-end Swiss watch brands—refused to sell online. At the same time several media sources and industry reports noted the recent emergence of e-commerce in the fine jewellery business. While consumers frequently used the Internet to research products they did not necessarily buy online which meant that brick-and-mortar stores were highly relevant (see Exhibit 1). Companies like Birks needed to ensure that they were among the first “hits” for potential buyers doing online searches.The rise of global consumerism also sparked new developments as a growing number of elite travellers made luxury purchases to commemorate their trips. The effects of this phenomenon cut both ways for the Canadian jewellery market as luxury purchasers would come to the country for purchases but domestic purchasers would often go abroad for luxury purchases or to invest in experiences rather than buying jewellery. In short Birks’s environment had changed drastically since the company originated over a century ago.Birks: COMPANY History Birks had been ingrained in Canada’s history (and vice versa) since 1879 growing along with the country to become an iconic national brand. It began as the legacy of a prominent Canadian family. In 1879 Canadian businessman Henry Birks established a jewellery store in the financial hub of Montreal. Fourteen years later the firm of Henry Birks and Sons was born when Birks partnered with his three sons.As Montreal’s commercial centre gravitated northward to Saint Catherine Street the Birks store relocated in 1894 to Phillips Square where the company maintained a flagship store and corporate offices. Henry Birks and Sons began to expand nationwide in 1901 opening stores in the largest Canadian cities and sometimes acquiring local jewellers which would then operate under the Birks name. In 1953 Henry Birks and Sons expanded its offering when it purchased Roden Brothers Limited a producer of silver hollowware flatware medals and cut crystal. By the late 1980s Henry Birks and Sons controlled more than 200 retail stores in Canada and the United States.The early 1990s were a rocky period for the company as it struggled with debt and filed for bankruptcy protection following an ill-fated attempt to expand into the low-to-mid-market sector with a broader range of merchandise. The company’s acquisition by the Italian-based Borgosesia Group in 1993 provided the necessary financial resuscitation. In 2002 Henry Birks and Sons invested more than US$15 million to buy a controlling interest of shares (approximately 72 per cent) in the American chain Mayors Jewelers Inc. (Mayors). The company went public in 2004 which paved the way for a 2005 merger that resulted in the newly named Birks Group. Birks also started its own product brand. It had previously sold private label jewellery that was stamped with the Birks name but in 2008 the firm halted the private label to create its own styles and product lines. By making jewellery creation an in-house activity Birks gained full control of the process from production to point of distribution. The new products would better reflect the character of the Birks brand which was revitalized when the company came under new management. The Modern Birks Rehabilitation of a Cultural IconWhen Bédos took over as president and CEO in 2012 he rejuvenated Birks’s operations in Canada. Soon the company was perceived as one of the few luxury brands truly invested in the future. Bédos’s reputation and credentials preceded him. In addition to his work in the luxury industry he also had an impressive academic background that included a master of science in management from the London Business School and a bachelor of laws in international law from Panthéon-Sorbonne University. A forward-thinking intellectual with a studiously informed business philosophy Bédos put the Birks brand front and centre. He wanted Birks to focus on the future but without abandoning its rich history. Eva Hartling chief marketing officer summed up the challenge from the company’s market research: “Birks was known for its iconic blue box of premium-quality expensive treasures. But it became ‘my mother’s brand my grandmother’s brand.’ It has been a tricky balance modernizing the brand while preserving the iconic stature of the brand.”To steer Birks into the modern era Bédos sought to identify and highlight the company’s essence. He and his executive team developed the modern-day Birks’s ethos: “We believe in the promise of a brighter tomorrow.” This conviction was shared by all Birks employees; Bédos described it as “not just a corporate motto” but a truth that gave employees a direction and a sense of optimism. The purpose expressed in this mantra pervaded the culture of the company. According to Hélène Messier chief talent officer Birks’s core values were steeped in Canadian values—friendliness courtesy respect and a love of nature.Strategically Bédos’s two main goals were to repair Birks’s retail business and develop its product brand. He made three key decisions to support his strategy: (1) develop an in-house jewellery brand with its own product lines and categories rather than outsourcing design and production to a white-label manufacturer; (2) clarify the company’s market position editing the brands offered in stores by removing entry-level price point product lines while eliminating the flatware china and giftware categories (these products previously took up a large portion of the stores while generating only 5 per cent revenue); and (3) modernize Birks stores and distribution channels.More revolutionary still was the choice to implement a whole new store concept focused on the customer experience. Influenced by the success of the Apple Store’s open concept the new format of Birks stores abandoned the traditional jewellery counter with its air of old-fashioned elegance and class distinctions. New modern-looking “island” counters changed the layout of the store space and the dynamics of customer relations. Employees would stand next to customers instead of lecturing them authoritatively from behind a counter. The aim as Bédos put it was to “talk with the customer rather than at the customer.” With the belief that “retail is part of sociology” Bédos wanted to tap into the social zeitgeist of millennial culture that challenged the older generation of institutions. These innovations sparked an immediate change in perception from the company’s landlords who wanted more of the modernized stores. Notably Birks was the only major jeweller adapting to the new store model.Keeping an open mind to apply new methods that worked Birks took the time to perfect the store concept while developing its own product lines. The company spent 2013–2014 learning to optimize the cost per square foot. The first two new stores were experimental and Bédos admitted they were too clinical and uninviting. Birks therefore continued to improve the store experience until it achieved the right atmosphere. According to Albert J. Rahm Birks’s executive vice-president of retail store operations the ideal ambiance was one of greater approachability and openness with improved visibility of product items. Birks stores were intended to be inviting and friendly allowing sales professionals and customers to connect comfortably on the same level. This reinvention paid off. In 2016 Birks posted a profit buoyed by strong year-end holiday sales (see Exhibit 2). From November 2016 to January 2017 the company defied a jewellery industry dip and showed an increase in sales of 11 per cent over the previous year with the strongest surge in sales coming from the renovated stores. More impressively same-store sales grew (see Exhibit 3). New concept stores opened in locations like Toronto’s Yorkdale Shopping Centre and unprofitable locations—especially those in smaller markets—closed. Birks intended to refurbish flagship and shopping mall stores as Bédos described: “We believe intuitively that the transformation and renovation of our Canadian flagships . . . will reveal the new Birks value proposition.” Yet even with all this progress Bédos believed that Birks had still not reached its full potential. The Montreal Vancouver and Toronto flagship stores were landmarks on the Canadian retail landscape but he felt that they were just a glimpse of what Birks could be—a powerful global brand.Birks Brand Product LinesBédos believed strongly in branding and viewed the Birks brand product lines as central to the company’s growth strategy. These lines included prestige luxury items as well as more affordable luxury products such as the 18-karat gold collection of pendants earrings and bracelets which retailed between $700 and $7000. Tying in with the brand imagery popular lines were often inspired by and linked to Canada’s natural landscape—for example Birks Muse; Birks Bee Chic; Birks Rock & Pearl which targeted millennial women with a chic edgy style; Birks Snowflake and Birks Shooting Star (see Exhibit 4). Bédos understood the extra challenges of branding jewellery: “Unlike other categories where the brand name may be visible on luxury jewellery the name is not present and the design has to carry the brand. This explains why Birks has developed its signature lines—just like Cartier did with its Trinity rings.”Product lines were designed in Canada by in-house designers and manufactured in Europe. A new line took between three to nine months to go from inception to store shelves. The frequency of new pieces and collections aligned with the fashion seasons and additional pieces were launched in between. The company invested in developing product lines in the large bridal space (for example diamond engagement rings brides’ and grooms’ jewellery gifts and wedding bands). According to Hartling the onslaught of e-commerce competitors like Blue Nile Inc. commoditized diamond engagement rings and lowered margins and some less credible international e-commerce retailers even created confusion over how a “proper” or “real” diamond was defined. To develop its new bridal lines Birks worked exclusively with Canadian diamonds which appealed to consumers who wanted ethically sourced and conflict-free stones; this gave Birks an opportunity to distinguish its lines by marketing them with greater clarity but this was not always an easy task. Hartling expressed a fundamental complexity in marketing Birks’s identity as both a brand and a third-party retail destination. Marketing Birks’s marketing messages synchronized with its Canadian heritage and values in a fresh and upbeat way. In keeping with the nature-inspired themes of the brand communications were attuned to seasonality with peaks over the Christmas holiday period and Valentine’s Day seasons. Hartling described how the company’s messaging reinforced the position of Birks as a fresh and world-class prestige brand (see Exhibit 5). Bédos shed additional light on the significance of prestige as something earned but a source of pride and joy as opposed to the colder class-based connotations of high-end luxury: “If you look at the luxury industry it’s cold. The models do not smile. They look unapproachable and the industry tries to be unattainable exclusive and separating people. That is not Birks. Birks is prestige something attainable something fresh something that comes with a bright smile.”Under Hartling’s watch Birks extended its marketing in various directions encompassing traditional advertising (for example newspapers and magazines) as well as digital and social media (for example Facebook and Instagram). Sponsorship deals included Birks’s role as the main jewellery sponsor of the Toronto International Film Festival which gave the brand a glamorous opportunity to have its products worn by various Canadian and international celebrities. In addition Birks gained exposure at the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards a prestigious annual ceremony hosted by the vice regal representative of the Canadian monarch to honour Canadian contributions to the performing arts. This event allowed Birks to capitalize on its status as a Canadian icon and reach large numbers of Toronto business people. Perhaps most importantly in a major public relations coup Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau the wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wore a $7000 Birks diamond brooch when meeting with Queen Elizabeth II in 2015. “After the story broke the brooch sold out within days” noted Hartling.Birks was also no stranger to publicity from its corporate social responsibility initiatives. When the issue of bee colony collapse was not widely recognized Birks was among the first companies to bring awareness and support to the preservation of honey bees. The company kept beehives on the roof of its Montreal flagship store and did its own beekeeping. The image of the bee (a pun on the first letter of the company name) was another nod to nature and inspired the firm’s bee-themed line of jewellery. “We didn’t do this for sales” said Bédos. “Bees are a critical piece of our ecosystem. A better world needs bees.”RetailInG and Merchandising The Birks Product LineBirks carried out its sales operations under three retail banners: Maison Birks Brinkhaus and Mayors. Maison BirksThe Maison Birks banner was represented by 27 stores across Canada (see Exhibit 6). Maison Birks had three store formats that depended on individual stores’ size location and offerings: flagships multi-brand stores and mono-brand stores. Flagship Stores These were the largest format and located in the most prime real estate locations. Maison Birks’s three Canadian flagships (Montreal Toronto and Vancouver) were located in historic buildings. While maintaining a focus on Birks-branded products in the centre of the stores flagships were destination locations that had exclusive relationships with top-tier brands such as Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier which were offered in shop-in-shops or boutiques accessible from inside the building. Maison Birks stores of all formats underwent extensive renovations but the most impressive renovations were reserved for the main flagship in Montreal. The historic store was scheduled to be relaunched by 2018. Its footprint would be reduced from 15000 square feet to 8000 square feet with significant space dedicated to Birks products. The higher levels of the building (formerly devoted to the head office of Birks which was relocated to a nearby modern office space) would be transformed into a luxury five-star boutique hotel. The back of the old store would become a restaurant while the mezzanine would become the hotel reception area with a bar and lounge. Notably the owners of the high-end hotel chose to retain the Birks name. This decision not only provided another opportunity to heighten Birks’s visibility—it was further proof that the brand was durable enough to extend across product categories.Multi-Brand Stores There were 16 Maison Birks stores of this format located in higher-end suburban malls with high traffic. Each store occupied 2200–4000 square feet. The newly renovated stores (seven in total) had wide entrances and an inviting atmosphere. The periphery of these stores showcased more “mainstream” high-end brands of watches (for example Tag Heuer and Baume & Mercier) and branded jewellery (for example Messika and Roberto Coin). Birks-branded products were merchandised in the centre of the store. Mono-Brand Stores These Maison Birks stores were the smallest format by square footage and carried Birks product lines only. There were eight of them in Canada constituting a third of the store portfolio. BrinkhausTwo stores operated under the Brinkhaus banner—one in Calgary and one in Vancouver. The latter location was particularly popular among international tourists from Asia. Brinkhaus stores focused heavily on elite watch brands such as Patek Philippe and Rolex. MayorsThe Mayors banner was used for 17 stores in Florida and Georgia. These stores were well-known destinations for watch brands like Cartier Rolex and Tag Heuer and they also had a strong selection of designer jewellery including Kwiat Mikimoto Pasquale Bruni and Roberto Coin. Mayors stores carried Birks-branded jewellery on an exclusive basis. The stores were used to test Birks-branded products in American markets. “The Birks name does not have the brand equity [in the United States] that it has in Canada” said Bédos. “But when we tested our jewellery lines in our Mayors stores with some modest marketing support it sold briskly . . . A lot of brand building has come from spillovers from the other brands in the store.”Sales professionals within all banners and store formats had to attend “Birks University” an intensive week-long program where they learned product knowledge and the Birks style of client service and sales skills. Rahm had developed this program to foster a cohesive employee culture which he likened to that of a sports team. He stressed the importance for sales representatives to live the Birks brand and deliver the “wow experience” to retail customers.Domestic CompetitionWhen releasing Birks’s annual report chief financial officer Pat Di Lillo described the North American market and competition in the following way:[T]he North American retail jewelry industry is approximately an $80 billion industry and is highly competitive and fragmented with a few very large national and international competitors and many medium and small regional and local competitors. The market is also fragmented by price and quality. Although our Birks and Mayors retail brands are prestige jewelry brands we compete with companies within and outside of this segment including other luxury categories. Our competitors include national and international jewelry chains independent regional and local jewellery retailers.Tiffany & CompanyTiffany & Company (Tiffany) was Birks’s strongest competitor in terms of its brand power. Tiffany had built a global brand around its luxury goods especially diamond jewellery and had established itself as an arbiter of style. The New York–based company had 313 stores worldwide including 95 stores in the United States and 13 locations in Canada and was active online with an e-commerce offering. In 2016 Tiffany had $4 billion in worldwide sales (46 per cent from the United States) but was suffering from softening sales.Signet JewelersSignet Jewelers Limited was the largest specialty jeweller in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom. It operated 3600 stores under the banners Zales Peoples Jewellers Kay Jewelers and H. Samuel and it had revenues of $6.4 billion. In Canada Peoples Jewellers a less premium brand billed itself as Canada’s number-one diamond store in the entry price point category and offered third-party watches (for example Bulova Seiko and Citizen). Peoples Jewellers stores were typically located in shopping malls and there were close to 150 locations in Canada.Independent JewellersSome of Birks’s strongest competition also came from independent jewellers. Bédos estimated that there were hundreds of independent jewellers operating in Canada and the United States and thousands around the world. These independent jewellers often served the high-end market. For example Château D’Ivoire competed directly with Birks in Montreal selling top brands like Cartier Breitling and Rolex as well as its own jewellery offering. Many of these jewellers were highly profitable family-run businesses located in malls and business districts. If it took the wholesale approach Birks would use these independent jewellers to distribute its product brand. This approach was one of the company’s growth options outside of the domestic market.GROWTH OPPORTUNITItiesWith an increasingly competitive landscape in Canada Birks had four different growth options: (1) continue to penetrate the Canadian market; (2) make a stronger push into the United States the biggest market in the world; (3) scale internationally (see Exhibit 7); or (4) pursue growth in the e-commerce landscape.Wholesale Growth in Canada Birks had launched a wholesale business to expand its lines into highly targeted independent jewellers and smaller stores that could carry its brand. Bédos knew that the brand recognition was high in Canada and strong within the industry so it would be logical to access distribution in smaller markets—perhaps even some where Birks used to have stores. Wholesale growth could allow Birks to re-enter these markets where former stores had closed.Wholesale Growth in the United States Buoyed by profitable test runs of Birks’s product brand in Mayors stores and an optimistic outlook for the industry (see Exhibit 8) Bédos believed his firm had an offering that could succeed in the United States. Birks was already preparing for further U.S. expansion by entering into talks with a chain of 25 stores in the United States but what markets should it target? Who were the ideal partners? What were the best ways to support the offering? How would the company ensure the differentiation of its brand? How might e-commerce factor into these U.S. plans?International MarketsThe rapid growth of the Internet brought international competition to Canadian businesses. Birks’s worldwide presence was relatively small so it would have to consider expanding globally. The four most promising international markets for expansion were China Japan the Middle East and Europe. As Bédos considered which of these was the best choice for the growth of the brand he realized that each had its advantages.China Chinese outbound tourists numbered 120 million in 2015. These tourists spent an estimated $229 billion on overseas purchases the majority of which were luxury fashion apparel items and accessories. Birks was a popular destination for tourists visiting Canada. In researching the Chinese market Hartling commented that heritage and history were particularly important in Asian markets like China which tended to favour brands with a longstanding history. Among many Chinese visitors (especially in western Canada) Birks already had some brand recognition.Japan In 2015 the size of the Japanese luxury jewellery market was $8.1 billion making it the world’s third-largest jewellery market after the United States and China. Bédos predicted that Japanese culture with its poetic aspects would be a good fit for the nature-inspired imagery and themes of the Birks brand. A recent Bain & Company report explained that Japanese shoppers had a reputation for enjoying the full in-store experience conversing with store clerks and making use of the services on offer. These consumer behaviours fit well with the atmosphere that Birks aimed to create with its new concept stores.The Middle East With luxury jewellery sales surpassing $6.74 billion the Middle East was one of the 10 largest luxury goods markets in the world in 2015. The United Arab Emirates alone with a population of under 10 million people was one of the top five markets for gold consumption worldwide and sales of gold jewellery there exceeded $2.5 billion. The country’s largest city Dubai served as a major hub for luxury buyers from around the globe and many Dubai residents travelled to Europe for luxury shopping. EuropeThe European luxury market was expected to have solid growth generated largely by American and Chinese tourist consumers who were drawn by the weak euro. Between 2010 and 2014 European jewellery and watches experienced a 2.3 per cent compound annual growth rate and steady growth was expected to continue with jewellery being the driving force behind the growth. In addition having a strong presence in trend-setting European cities like Milan Paris and London gave credibility to any brand in a high-end space.E-CommerceE-commerce for watches and jewellery was a growing trend and online competition was significant. Blue Nile a U.S.-based online specialty retailer of fine jewellery since 1999 dominated online with $480 million in annual revenues in 2015. Blue Nile was particularly strong in the diamond engagement and bridal space. Spence Diamonds a Canadian-owned retailer that positioned itself as an ethical company specializing in laboratory-created raw diamonds “identical to traditional mined diamonds” in every way except for their origin had an expanding online presence to complement its retail offerings. In 2016 online luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter became Tiffany’s exclusive e-commerce partner increasing Tiffany’s online sales from 13 to 170 countries. The online transactions from the 13 nations constituted 6 per cent of Tiffany’s worldwide net sales in 2014 to 2016. Online giant Amazon had also moved into watch and jewellery sales. New York-based Allurez which had an extensive online offering eyed the future of e-commerce predicting that three-dimensional printing would drive e-commerce sales of fine jewellery. In light of all these entrants was e-commerce a golden opportunity or a threat for Birks?Looking AheadBédos reflected on how far he and his team had brought Birks. With the firm’s retail and product brands energized and profitable how could he keep growing the business? What balance should Birks strike between pushing the brand in Canada in existing markets in the United States in new U.S. markets and internationally? How far and in what directions should the firm extend its product brand? How could e-commerce help the company? Though much was yet to be done the future gleamed bright for Birks.

Ltd. (Greenco) put down the phone and looked at his watch. It was 4:00 p.m. His discussion with the design firm had taken longer than expected. He had barely enough time to reach Gurgaon India by 5:30 p.m. for the meeting with M. Tewari the managing director of Best Foods Ltd. who wanted to source frozen vegetable snacks from Greenco and sell them online under his own brand name. As Mehta walked out of the factory in Delhi and got into his car he got a call from his partner Mayank Aggarwal. “Hey Anuj” said Aggarwal. “How did the discussion with the design firm go?” “It was good overall” replied Mehta. “I shared our comments on the logo and pack designs with them and they are confident of delivering the final designs by next week. I will discuss the details with you later as right now I am rushing for the meeting with Tewari.”Mehta and Aggarwal both of whom had graduated in 2005 from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in Ludhiana had come together in 2016 with a decision to enter the frozen foods market in India. As a retired army major with previous entrepreneurial experience Aggarwal had been involved in setting up an intercity cab service. When he met Mehta he had been looking for a new business opportunity. Mehta had value chain experience in the frozen foods industry from the slaughterhouse to the retail of frozen foods. Seeming a natural fit for a partnership the two entrepreneurs started Greenco with plans to launch branded frozen snacks for the retail consumer by the end of January 2017. By November 2016 their product development was nearly done and they were happy with the differentiated product range they had developed. The plant was ready to start production their investments were made and the core production team had been hired. The pressure to stay on schedule had started. As the launch date approached Mehta and Aggarwal were working hard to implement a detailed market strategy but critical decisions were still pending. Although their initial focus had been to build a differentiated brand for the retail market they were beginning to experience setbacks. Supply chains in the frozen foods industry were not efficient and there were various terms and conditions to consider in regard to organized retail. A key element of pricing still had to be resolved and Mehta was under pressure to finalize the company’s pricing strategy.THE FROZEN FOODS MARKET IN INDIAIn 2016 the value of India’s frozen food ready meals market (including frozen snacks) was estimated at ₹856 million (see Exhibit 1). This category recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 16 per cent in volume and 19 per cent in value for the period 2011–2016. The ready meals packaged foods category in India broadly comprised shelf stable dried and frozen ready meals. Shelf stable ready meals were the largest share of the market at the time but frozen ready meals were the fastest-growing segment of the market (see Exhibit 1). Products like frozen kebabs nuggets French fries fillets and cutlets had become popular because of their convenience for at-home consumption. Large companies such as Al Kabeer Exports Pvt. Ltd. McCain Foods Ltd. and Venky’s India Ltd. had been increasing their presence in the frozen snacks segment over the previous five to six years.Overall the share of frozen foods (ready meals and others) consumed in an Indian household was still quite negligible. The market for frozen foods was projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 15 per cent during the period 2016–2021. The frozen ready meals category in particular was projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3 per cent. Various factors were expected to affect growth including an increase in the number of retail chains and improved refrigeration facilities in small retail shops. Poor infrastructure was a major hurdle in expansion. However the availability of cold supply chains—for refrigerated production storage and distribution—was anticipated to grow at a CAGR of approximately 24 per cent over the next few years which would be a boost to the frozen foods industry.Demand from consumers was mostly governed by macroeconomic factors such as increasing urbanization changes in lifestyle and demographics and an increasing number of nuclear families with working women. The microeconomic factors that impacted demand were taste health concerns price and brand. In a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd. and The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry the most important factors considered by consumers while making purchase decisions regarding processed food products were found to be expiry date health aspects (nutritional composition of the product) and brand. Consumers seemed to have either decreased or maintained the level of their processed food purchases in recent years. Food safety concerns could have been a factor in this especially following the controversy over certain branded packaged ready-to-cook foods. For example Nestlé’s instant Maggi noodles were found to contain certain ingredients beyond the permissible limit. Such incidents caused consumers to make more informed decisions when purchasing processed food items forcing the industry to become more proactive to meet demands from regulators and to follow safety standards. GREENCO PRODUCT RANGEAlthough India’s frozen snacks market had experienced overall growth in recent years this was less evident in the vegetarian category. Vegetarian frozen snacks consisted mainly of potato and soy products that were ready to heat or fry. According to Mehta one reason for the lower growth rate was the prevailing habit of cooking and consuming vegetarian snacks home. Another key reason was that unlike chicken vegetarian products were more likely to spoil with mishandling in the supply chain causing more wastage during production. In addition innovative vegetarian options were more labour intensive but consumers expected these products to be cheaper which made pricing difficult.Greenco’s product development focused on the identified market opportunity of nutritious vegetarian snacks that were not potato-based. However Mehta and Aggarwal also included fast-moving non-vegetarian products such as the popular chicken kebabs momos (dimsums) and nuggets. Chicken kebabs were especially important to the company because of Mehta’s prior experience in this area. With the advanced skills of their production team the two entrepreneurs were confident about competing against established companies. They were hopeful that the high demand and popularity of these items would help Greenco establish market penetration and sustenance in its initial period.The generally untapped vegetarian frozen snack category allowed the company to differentiate its products and add value. Greenco focused on nutrition by using largely natural ingredients and by completely avoiding the use of preservatives. Aggarwal decided that using natural ingredients and no preservatives was an important selling point for current consumers who were increasingly becoming health conscious. Other selling points included taste texture and flavour. Therefore the two entrepreneurs worked to differentiate their products by highlighting the complete absence of preservatives taste enhancers monosodium glutamate and artificial colours and flavours from their products.Although the freezing process itself was a proven method of preservation competing companies added class II preservatives to their products as an extra caution. However Greenco decided against preservatives hoping to fill a need gap for health-conscious consumers who normally avoided packaged foods. Consumer research indicated that more and more consumers routinely checked ingredients and nutritive information on product packaging.Aiming to expand and dominate the vegetarian frozen snack category Greenco decided to create a distinct brand identity for the vegetarian range separate from non-vegetarian options to help strengthen its unique positioning. To do so Greenco chose the brand name Veg-de-Zire for its vegetarian products and the brand name I’m Hungry for non-vegetarian options (see Exhibit 2).Greenco Product developmentGreenco initially targeted the North India market. Therefore taste preferences suitable for this region were considered while developing the products. However the challenge was to develop the perfect recipe for each product’s taste and nutrition and then achieve consistency in flavour texture and colour. This required a great amount of time and effort. Taste nutrition and uniqueness were paramount in product development. If the product failed to meet customer expectations in these areas the company would not likely get a second chance to enter the market. Uniqueness and innovation of new products was a key focus for the vegetarian range. However product development of all other products was essentially focused on existing popular items. Differentiation came largely from quality and taste.In October 2016 Mehta and Aggarwal conducted extensive sampling trials both in-house and with potential consumers. Only products that received high ratings on taste and uniqueness were retained. For the trials the company created six different flavours of chicken kebabs blending international seasonings to create unique flavours for the Indian consumer.During product development the founders also worked on finalizing brand identity logos and package design for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian product ranges. Consistent with their original strategy both brands kept separate and distinct identities (see Exhibit 2).ChallengesProduct AppealMehta and Aggarwal were very clear from the beginning that only the best quality ingredients would be used and they made great efforts to finalize the raw material sources. To ensure high quality ingredients they were willing to pay a premium price.They purchased their machinery and equipment from reputable established vendors in India and abroad and installed traditional industrial deep freezers as originally planned. However after a food technology expert visited their plant and sampled their products they were advised to procure blast freezers that used superior technology for freezing compared to traditional deep freezers. In traditional slow freezing protein walls could become damaged and cause alterations in taste. This problem was avoided by using blast freezers which could freeze 50 kilograms (kg) of food within four hours (from 90 degrees Celsius to –40 degrees Celsius). However there were two major issues with this advice. First blast freezers were expensive at a cost of approximately ₹300000 for each freezer. Second Greenco had already purchased the traditional deep freezers and related equipment and the plant was ready to commence production. The entrepreneurs debated how necessary the additional investment would be at this stage. They agreed that they would not go to market with a product that did not meet customer expectations so they conducted blind taste tests to determine the severity of the issue. They found that customers could not detect any difference in taste between the products that were frozen using the two different freezing technologies. However there was definitely a visual difference. Ice crystals tended to form in the deep frozen products which was not an issue in the blast frozen products. But with no comments from consumers regarding the ice crystals Mehta felt that the additional investment was not necessary. “Yes that’s true” said Aggarwal. “But even though consumers do not seem averse to ice crystals at present if there are competitive products on the shelf with no visible crystals which one would they tend to pick up?” Distribution and Market Coverage Frozen snacks in India were typically sold through organized retail stores. Companies selling frozen snacks were largely focused on serving consumers through modern retail channels such as hypermarkets and supermarkets because of the availability of freezers and ease of promotion through dedicated shelf space. Research indicated that attractive displays of these products in supermarkets and hypermarkets was a key factor in pushing consumer purchases. During 2016 hypermarkets recorded a 31-per-cent share of total value sales. Companies such as Al Kabeer Exports McCain Foods and Venky’s India benefited from deeper retail penetration in the country. The increase in penetration was a result of growth in the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets in the country and an increase in available freezer space in modern retail outlets. However access to modern trade was a big challenge for small players like Greenco according to Mehta:Getting shelf space in modern trade is difficult because they have a very high slotting/listing fee in the range of ₹4000–6000 per outlet per month for a multi-store deal. In [the] case of a national brand of retailer this might go up to ₹300000–400000 per month which at this point of time is unaffordable.Aggarwal added:We are also struggling with distributors. We cannot afford to hire a single salesman and distributors are not pushing our products despite [our] offering 30-per-cent margins [including the retailer margin which was around 22 per cent]. Furthermore the costs to transfer products from plant to cold store is also an expensive affair. Supply chain is a challenge as distributors expect us to not only book orders but [also] deliver stock to their doorstep. They only collect payments and charge us 10 per cent.Initially the two founders planned to launch Greenco products in West and Central Delhi targeting 20–25 modernized grocery and kirana stores (which were stand-alone small self-service stores with modern billing and inventory systems). These stores did not charge any slotting fee and agreed to provide shelf space on a personal visit by the promoter. However they would not provide premium top-of-the-freezer display. But if the Greenco products were placed at the bottom of the freezer the stocked products were of little use because they were not likely to be noticed by the buyer.Greenco did not consider logistics partners because of its small initial volumes. The two founders were instead toying with the idea of transporting their products in thermocol (or polystyrene) boxes packed in dry ice and by hiring delivery boys for transport or undertaking this task themselves.Knowing that it would take time to penetrate the retail market and reach reasonable volumes the two founders were also planning bulk sales to business-to-business (B2B) customers in the hotel restaurant and café segment. They had also recently received a proposal from Tewari who ran an online business for retailing frozen chicken products under his own brand name. Tewari was impressed by the innovative vegetarian product range developed by Greenco and was willing to source his products from the company. The offer of assured volume was tempting but how would this affect Greenco’s own retail plans? PricingWith the approaching launch date the two founders needed to quickly finalize their pricing strategy. Consumer taste tests had assured them that their products were highly differentiated and scored high on taste. However they still had to decide whether to adopt premium pricing—based on high quality—or value pricing keeping prices slightly lower than the competition for fast penetration and market expansion. Consumer research indicated that consumers perceived a price point of around ₹100 for the vegetarian products to be an attractive proposition. But given Greenco’s cost pressures would such a price be suitable?They had already spent some time in the last week of October analyzing possible pricing approaches. Consumer willingness to pay was currently driven by the existing competitors (see Exhibit 4) which ranged from roadside vendors of fresh snacks to branded frozen packaged snacks available in organized retail outlets. To begin the process of determining a pricing strategy they decided to analyze the pricing model of two diverse competitors: roadside vendors and premium brand competitors.The selling price for vegetarian momos by street sellers was around ₹40 for eight pieces. However Greenco’s Veg-de-Zire momos at 25 grams (g) per momo were almost double the size of roadside momos. Therefore a 250-g pack containing eight pieces of Veg-de-Zire momos would be equal to 16 pieces of roadside momos. Few brands sold frozen vegetarian momos and mostly focused on bulk orders such as Yum! Yum! Dimsum (from Unitas Foods Pvt. Ltd.) for example. Fresh chicken kebabs served hot at roadside eateries could be bought for ₹150 for two pieces of 85 g each. Large frozen packs ranged from ₹450 to ₹650 per kg (for approximately 12 pieces). Mehta and Aggarwal felt that the quality and taste of their I’m Hungry Mughlai chicken kebab was superior to that of the average competition. However their expected volumes were around 600 kg per month—in comparison the major competitors sold that amount in one day.The cost of raw materials was approximately ₹115–125 for chicken seekh kebabs and ₹55 per kg for Veg-de-Zire momos. Although the two entrepreneurs had prepared detailed worksheets of their estimated raw material and production costs exact numbers for other cost elements (e.g. margin transport and staff operating expenses) were still unavailable. These expenses would be based on estimated volumes which would again depend on the type of pricing strategy adopted. However they estimated that raw material costs would be approximately one-third of the total cost of the product; operating expenses and production costs would add another one-third; and the remaining cost would cover shipping transportation and contingencies. Distributor and retailer margins would be added to this amount to arrive at a total cost of goods sold.Their analysis revealed that if they went for penetrative pricing they could hope to break even only if they sold 35–50 kg of each product per day. However even with this kind of pricing their demand forecast was only around 15–20 kg per day for the initial period. They also had to decide what kind of price differential could be adopted for the B2B market compared to the (business to consumer) B2C market (see Exhibit 4).FINALIZING THE STRATEGYMehta and Aggarwal set a deadline of December 24 2016 to finalize all remaining key strategic decisions to ensure that they could launch by the end of January 2017. Reflecting back on the product appearance Mehta considered So our decision really hinges upon “How critical are the ice crystals in the consumer experience?” You know Mayank even if we did go for the blast freezer I am not sure we can prevent the ice crystal problem. You are well aware how we have been struggling to get our logistics in place. Because of poor management of the cold supply chain there are often points during transport or storage where the power is disconnected for a brief while often leading to formation of crystals. So even if the product was initially blast frozen the crystal problem would still arise.Aggarwal nodded in agreement saying “You do have a point. Remember when we did our market visits? We found that supply chain abuse was pretty common and difficult to control particularly for small local players like us. Still if we want to grow the category and set new standards should we not go for the best option?”Mehta responded “We need to look for funds as well my friend. We need a minimum production schedule and sales of 35–50 kg per day to break even while so far our initial estimates indicate that we would be able to reach about 15–20 kg per day in the initial period.”Aggarwal added his concerns: “We have already exceeded our original budget for capital equipment. We are still a few months away from launch and need funds to penetrate the market as well. This is not going to be an easy decision. Let’s think about this a bit before [making] the final call.” Should they invest in a blast freezer? What should be their pricing strategy? What should be the structure of their sales and distribution? Should they hire a sales team? Should they agree to consider selling their unique products under a resellers’ brand name? Should they focus on B2C or B2B markets?Exhibit 1: MARKET FOR FROZEN FOODSSales of Ready Meals by Category—Volume 2011–2016 (in Thousand Tonnes)Sales of Ready Meals by Category—Value 2011–2016 (in ₹ Millions)Forecast Sales of Frozen Ready Meals by Category—Value 2017–2021 (in ₹ Millions)Brand Shares of Ready Meals—Value 2016 (%)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹66.68 on November 21 2016; *These brands offered frozen ready meals and snacks.

What you want me to do is to not just be in Canada. You want me to dominate in Germany to be super successful in South America in a place like Brazil to take the Canadian policy and the Canadian products and the Canadian learning—and it’s one of the first times we actually have everything first—and go do the best everywhere. And so if we can be a many-billion-dollar very competent company that’s Canadian-based I think we’ll actually be quite proud of that.Canopy Growth CEO Bruce LintonOn April 13 2017 the Canadian federal government introduced legislation to legalize cannabis for adult use to take effect during the summer of 2018. When passed the legislation would make Canada the first G7 country to legalize recreational cannabis at the federal level. Predictions about the size of the Canadian recreational market (including the ancillary market and tourism revenue) were as high as CA$22.6 billion. Simultaneously the changing cannabis laws in other countries presented new opportunities (see Exhibit 1). The global medical cannabis market was predicted to reach $55.8 billion by 2025. Canopy Growth Corporation (Canopy) based in Smiths Falls Ontario had already been working with firms in Brazil Australia and Germany. According to Canopy’s chief executive officer (CEO) Bruce Linton “The companies that are the best in Canada have the best chance of expanding and of being very capable and successful in each of the other countries.”The plan was for Canopy to be everywhere it was federally legal and where a sustainable business could be created. On August 20 2017 Linton reasoned “the more rules we have and the more rigorously they are applied the better the opportunity I have on a global basis to have fewer competitors which [kind of] leads into I would say the international expansion . . . the public policy in Canada’s driving it.” Would Canopy be able to produce enough cannabis to supply Canadian patients and recreational users and the rest of the world? Already much work needed to be done to prepare for the legalization of recreational cannabis. Was Canopy ready to pursue further international expansion opportunities? If so what factors should Linton consider when deciding whether to expand?THE CANADIAN REGULATED CANNABIS MARKETMedical marijuana was legalized and regulated at the federal level by Health Canada starting in 2001 when the Canadian government enacted the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) thereby allowing patients (or a designated individual) to either grow their own cannabis plants or buy dried cannabis from Health Canada. In April 2014 the Harper government replaced the MMAR with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) which allowed only licensed producers (LPs) to produce distribute and sell medical cannabis to patients. The intent was to create tighter controls on the medical cannabis supply. Patients were no longer permitted to grow their own plants and LPs became the only legal suppliers of medical cannabis. Two years later the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) once again allowed patients to grow their own plants because a Canadian federal court case (Allard v. Canada) concluded that the requirement for individuals to obtain their cannabis only from LPs “violated liberty and security rights protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.” The ACMPR had a possession limit for patients of 150 grams or a 30-day supply (whichever was less) regardless of whether the patient grew or bought it. Anyone growing plants (either for themselves or for someone else) was required to register with Health Canada (see Exhibit 2). Patients who purchased their cannabis from an LP could be registered with only one LP per prescription at a time. The regulations did not permit companies to sell cannabis derivatives such as edibles (i.e. cannabis-infused food products) or cannabis resins. Only fresh or dried cannabis plants and cannabis oils were permitted. The oils could not be sold “in any dosage form other than a capsule or similar dosage form.”The Canadian Legal Medical Marijuana MarketThe amount of legal cannabis (both dried cannabis and cannabis oil) sold by LPs had been growing consistently each quarter. Cannabis oils were first offered in the third quarter of 2015 and quickly became popular (see Exhibit 3). In addition to being one of Canada’s first LPs under the MMPR Canopy Growth was the first company to be awarded a licence to both produce and sell cannabis oils which required specialized machinery to extract the active ingredients (i.e. tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD).Critics raised concerns about preventing children from accessing cannabis and the efficacy of medical cannabis. Nevertheless the total number of clients industry-wide was growing from quarter to quarter. For the quarter ending March 31 2017 167754 clients were registered and the average amount of dried cannabis authorized per client was 2.4 grams per day (see Exhibit 3).Due to the expected demand for recreational cannabis in mid-2018 Health Canada announced on May 26 2017 that it would be improving the process for licensing medical cannabis producers to increase the number of LPs producing cannabis. In the same announcement Health Canada disclosed that the average number of registered clients had been growing by 10 per cent a month sales of dried cannabis had been growing by 6 per cent a month and sales of cannabis oils had been growing by 16 per cent a month. The processing of licence applications would be streamlined by allocating more resources to the intake screening and review stages. In May 2017 187 applications were at the review stage. As of August 21 2017 Canada had 54 authorized LPs seven of which were owned by Canopy (one at Agripharm and two each at Mettrum Bedrocan and Tweed).Linton emphasized that one of the differences between the legal and illegal cannabis markets was that the legal product complied with quality control regulations. At the end of 2016 and during first of half of 2017 media accounts surfaced of unauthorized pesticides being found in cannabis which led to Health Canada instituting mandatory pesticide testing requirements in May 2017. While it was a temporary setback for the companies that sold cannabis the stories highlighted the importance of testing cannabis for impurities especially the medical cannabis intended for patients. Cannabis obtained from the black market was not regulated or monitored in the same way that legal cannabis was. As players in a relatively new industry companies needed to learn how to construct and operate large growing operations while keeping costs down. Some of the larger licensed producers managed to lower their cannabis production costs to less than $2 per gram which they attributed to economies of scale. Canopy’s production costs were $1.28 per gram (preshipping and fulfilment). Because the plants were grown indoors the product achieved higher consistency as a result of the accurate control of lighting soil and other inputs. It also meant that electricity costs could be high depending on the provincially legislated electricity costs where the LP was located. One of the challenges that the industry as a whole faced was a shortage of medical cannabis in Canada. With the legalization of recreational cannabis on the horizon Canada could potentially face a larger shortage of supply if the LPs did not develop and expand their grow spaces quickly enough for the rollout in 2018. Simultaneously some of Canada’s medical cannabis companies including Canopy were looking at opportunities for international expansion. Making the decision to expand internationally created an additional layer of complexity because the cannabis laws of many countries were changing. Was it worth the effort at this point in time to engage in more international expansion activities or was it time to concentrate on Canada’s rollout of recreational cannabis in July 2018?Regulated Home Growing: A Possible Threat?Cannabis was believed to be a “weed” and therefore easy to grow anywhere. The ACMPR allowed patients to grow their own plants or to have a designated person grow the plants. If people could grow their own plants why would they spend so much money to buy cannabis from the LPs? THC Biomed another LP was already selling clones (starter plants) to medical marijuana patients within Canada and had bought Clone Shipper a specially designed container for shipping plants through the mail. Aurora Cannabis Inc. Canna Farms Delta 9 Bio-Tech Maricann Group Inc. Peace Naturals Project WeedMD and Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation also had licences to sell plants. CannTrust and Tweed were also licensed to sell cannabis seeds. Even if patients and future recreational cannabis clients were allowed to grow their own plants doing so would take a lot of effort. People could grow fruits and vegetables or make their own wine at home but most people did not. Companies that could achieve economies of scale could produce cannabis for a lower per unit cost than most home growers mainly due to the electricity costs required for controlling the indoor lighting and temperature conditions. Also growing the plants required space and quality control issues needed to be considered. Pests and mould could lead to a bad crop. Cannabis plants also produced a strong smell which could be a deterrent to growers in densely populated areas. According to Linton: Having a cannabis plant grow is not all that hard. . . . The problem is that it gets stressed by . . . light water heat or mildews on it or moulds. . . . I would suggest that we view people who wish to grow out of their home I would love if they bought the seeds and/or any nutrients or components that we could develop. . . . Because I will give them a coupon for 15 per cent off their purchase of product in the event that when they grow themselves isn’t quite as good as we do and we’d be delighted to help them out. I think probably about 90 per cent of the time they’ll be coming back to us.CANOPY GROWTH CORPORATIONCanopy was a holding company with Tweed Bedrocan Canada and Mettrum being its three main brands. Tweed was Canopy’s lifestyle brand that was described on the company’s website as being “approachable and friendly yet reliable and trusted.” Linton was a co-founder of Tweed Marijuana Inc. and created Canopy with Bedrocan BV a Dutch firm that was purely focused on medical cannabis research and creating standardized strains. Bedrocan Canada had the exclusive licensing rights to supply the Bedcrocan strains to the American continent. Mettrum was acquired by Canopy in early 2017 and had a brand identity focused on natural health and wellness. As Canada’s largest medical marijuana company Canopy had the overall vision according to Linton to “constantly evolve upward in the value chain not to be in agro-business.” Each brand had its own set of licences from Health Canada. Among its main brands (Bedrocan Tweed and Mettrum) Canopy had five facilities with cultivation and sales licences and one Bedrocan facility with a sales licence. Four of those facilities were also licensed for the production and sale of cannabis oil. Additionally Agripharm had licences for the sale and production of both the dried plant and oils. However the brands also shared a few common points. For example all of the brands were sold at Tweed Mainstreet (https://www.tweedmainstreet.com) which was the online shopping portal. Similarly all of the products were shipped from a common platform and used common finance and information technology (IT) systems. Production methods and operating practices could also be shared between the LPs’ growing facilities except for Bedrocan’s which came with a proprietary production methodology that could not be shared with the other LPs.Canopy’s patient base was more than 58000 as of June 27 2017 representing approximately a third of all registered patients at that time. In a BNN interview in the summer of 2017 Linton revealed that Canopy was creating logistics and distribution channels across Canada to prepare for the anticipated recreational market in 2018. In terms of production for the recreational market the plan was to have test stores collect data on consumer preferences and purchases.Canopy’s MilestonesLinton was aware of the public perception of Canopy and the rest of the cannabis industry. For example when Canopy decided to list publicly on the Canadian Venture Exchange (under the ticker symbol CGC) the goal was not merely to attract capital but also to differentiate Canopy from its competitors in the eyes of customers. It was also a way to legitimize its business in the eyes of the public. Acquiring Bedrocan was also meant to send a signal to the public. In this instance the signal was that consolidation was already happening and thus the industry was maturing. Similarly the Mettrum acquisition signalled further consolidation.Challenges and IssuesOne of the main challenges that all medical cannabis companies faced was that physicians were often hesitant to write prescriptions for cannabis because according to Canadian Medical Association representative Dr. Jeff Blackmer there had not been much rigorous scientific medical research on the adverse effects and the efficacy of medical marijuana. Without scientific evidence showing the efficacy of cannabis it was challenging for insurance companies to justify covering medical cannabis prescriptions. Linton explained “There have been no broad studies because there were no [cannabis] companies and in 2014 there were only four countries where you could do this.”Despite the aforementioned challenges the operational challenge was to have enough supply in 2018 for both medical patients and adult recreational customers. To address the possibility of too little supply Canopy Rivers was created to finance and advise smaller grow operations in Canada in return for a percentage of the grower’s output. LPs such as Canada’s Island Garden in Prince Edward Island were part of Canopy’s Craftgrow collection which were the growers financed by Canopy Rivers. With a finite amount of vault space in Canopy’s facilities one solution was to convert dried cannabis to cannabis oils because the latter took only 1/10 of the storage space that the former occupied. From their early experiences building their own growing operations the Canopy team knew that it took time to be efficient due to the trial and error necessary. As Linton said “There is no book that you can read to learn how to build a massive cannabis company.”Furthermore there were financial challenges inherent in running a cannabis business. In the summer of 2017 the fourth quarter results were released showing a greater net loss for 2017 than 2016. The loss was mainly due to “biological asset change” which represented all plants that were in the process of growing (see Exhibit 4). Raising capital was also a concern. According to Linton: Everything gets funded principally by the issuance of equity. We have a 1.3 or 1.4 billion dollar market cap probably 3 to 4 hundred million dollars of what you could say are tangible assets which include the licensed value of the facilities and I have about $13 million in debt. The debt instruments for this sector have been withheld by banks unless it’s Tier 2 banks and if you’re dealing with a Tier 2 or Tier 3 bank their ability to actually organize real debt packages is pretty limited. So most of the things are funded by equity issuances. In addition to the reduced access to debt packages from banks there were limitations on the number of institutional investors that could invest in cannabis companies. Large American investment firms such as Putnam and Fidelity could not invest in Canopy or any other cannabis firms because of the cultural stigma attached to the cannabis industry and the fact that at the federal level cannabis was still illegal in the United States. The lack of institutional investors meant that there were more shares exchanged at the retail level (i.e. between individual investors). Would this lack of institutional investors be a limitation for Canopy’s international expansion possibilities?THE INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS INDUSTRYSeveral countries had already legalized medical or recreational cannabis and more countries were expected to legalize cannabis by the end of 2018. However import and export laws could constrain the flow of cannabis products between countries. Bedrocan Canada was both a part of Canopy and a subsidiary of Bedrocan International a Dutch firm. Joint ventures with local firms were a way to manoeuvre around the import and export laws but they also required more investment and therefore represented greater risk for the company.A Health Canada bulletin posted on August 24 2016 made clear that the Canadian cannabis regulations were “neither intended to make Canada an exporter of cannabis nor to enable importation as an alternative of domestic production.” Furthermore “importation and exportation would be permitted under very limited circumstances such as importing starting materials for a new LP or exporting a unique marijuana strain for scientific investigation in a foreign laboratory.” Canopy had already exported cannabis to Germany and Brazil. When asked about the Health Canada bulletin Linton replied:I think every country in the world will limit or eliminate imports because if you ask the United Nations—for what I suspect will be the rest of our lives—it will be governed as a narcotic and the reason is the United Nations has a lot of members and a lot of those members are in geographies and religions and cultures that are not going to change their view on cannabis not in the next 50 years.Furthermore politicians in target countries would also likely prefer domestic cannabis growing operations because of the tax revenue and job creation opportunities. Linton explained “I’m pretty sure if you’re running for re-election and you close Smiths Falls because you’re importing from Uruguay the people in Uruguay are unlikely [to] vote for you.It seemed that Canada was poised to be a leader in the global cannabis industry because of its history and reputation in the world. According to Linton: Being Canada and considered to be a pretty normal bland governed tax-paying rule-following entity helps because we’ve done it first and we actually have a prime minister now that is of some visibility it seems to be never challenged as weird or stupid . . . the fact that we were the second country in the world to have adult access to legal cannabis for medical purposes. . . . And because that started in 2001 with really bad policy the Health Canada bureaucrats and the physicians had about 12 years of terrible experience to learn what they wanted to do in the next generation of policy. And so that was reflected in the policy released in June of 2013. The reason why other countries are copying that as their baseline is they never had access to legal cannabis because of a court ruling. With more countries legalizing cannabis year after year Linton was looking at many possibilities for international expansion: Two years ago I spent a lot of time hosting delegations from the world over and from transnational regulators to show them how things can be done and what the enactment of the regulations looks like. And then I didn’t see them for a year year and a half. And they all went off and wrote their German version or the Chilean version or the Colombian version or their Danish version or their Australian version and on and on and on of what we’ve got. And so now my problem is that they’re all coming out at the same time and I can’t keep up!International Legal IssuesWhile Canopy and other Canadian cannabis companies had already been exporting cannabis to countries such as Germany and Brazil concerns were raised about whether the legalization of recreational cannabis might violate UN Treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988. The Trudeau government’s response was that with adequate restrictions on the production and sale of cannabis Canada would be staying within the guidelines of the treaties. Article 28 of the 1961 treaty seemed to allow for the cultivation of cannabis as long as it was strictly controlled by the government. Furthermore Uruguay was also a member of both treaties and had already legalized recreational cannabis at the federal level.Cannabis in the United StatesAs Canada’s closest geographic neighbour the United States seemed to be an obvious choice for international expansion. However cannabis was legal in many but not all states. Other Canadian-based companies such as Friday Night Inc. had set up cannabis businesses in states such as Nevada where recreational cannabis was legalized in July 2017.	 The fact that marijuana was still illegal at the federal level in the United States meant that the regulatory environment limited the activities of Canadian-based cannabis companies in the United States. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also made his position clear when he said “Good people don’t smoke marijuana.” American investors were interested in Canadian cannabis stocks because the major American stock exchanges (i.e. the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ) would not accept listings for cannabis companies since they were engaging in a federally illegal business. By not engaging in federally illegal activities Linton was ensuring that Canopy was engaging in only purely legal activities.Cannabis in South AmericaIn 2015 the Supreme Court of Brazil was debating the decriminalization of drug possession (for personal use). In November 2016 Bedrocan Canada exported 10 kilograms of dried cannabis to Brazil for research purposes. Bedrocan Canada and Entourage Phytolab formed a joint venture Bedrocan Brasil in late 2016 to develop an epilepsy and pain management drug to be registered in Brazil for Brazilian patients.Medical marijuana was legalized in Chile in 2015. Canadian LP Tilray had partnered with the Chilean government-licensed firm Alef Biotechnology to supply Chilean patients with cannabis products. Tilray’s products had an average sale price of $310 for a one-month supply. Canopy established the brand Spectrum Chile SpA for entry into the Chilean market.Known as the “Switzerland of South America” Uruguay was the first country in the world to legalize marijuana (both medical and recreational) in 2013. The government set the price at $1.30 per gram (see Exhibit 5 for national retail prices) and only registered users over the age of 18 were allowed to buy up to 40 grams per month at a participating pharmacy. The purpose of the regulated low price was to lure customers away from the black market. The regulations did not allow for the sale of any derivative products. Consumers could obtain cannabis by growing their own or going to a cannabis club where they could buy strains that had higher THC levels than were available in pharmacies.Some South American countries had decriminalized the possession of small amounts of cannabis including Paraguay Peru and Ecuador. However companies could not start selling in those countries because large-scale cultivation in some of those countries was still either illegal or not clearly legal. For example in Peru medical marijuana was not legalized yet.Cannabis in EuropeIn March 2017 Germany legalized medical marijuana and relied on imports because little cannabis was grown in Germany. Canopy announced on July 25 2016 that it was working with MedCann Gmbh Pharma and Nutraceuticals a privately held German firm that imported and manufactured pharmaceuticals to introduce Tweed products to German patients. The plan was to start with two strains and then add more varieties later. In late November 2016 Canopy announced that it would be acquiring MedCann GmbH which was renamed Spektrum Cannabis Germany GmbH in June 2017. As of August 2017 Canopy was in the second stage of a three-stage request for proposal to set up a growing operation in Germany. If Canopy succeeded in making it through phase 2 the last stage would be mainly a negotiation for the price of supply.Other Canadian LPs were also interested in the nascent German market. On October 12 2016 Cronos Group’s subsidiary Peace Naturals Projects Inc. announced that it had made its first export to a German firm Pedanios GmbH a distributor for more than 200 pharmacies. On May 26 2017 Aurora Cannabis Inc. another large Canadian LP acquired Pedanios GmbH. On April 28 2017 Maricann Group Inc. a smaller Canadian LP announced it had established a subsidiary Maricann GmbH in Munich with a five-person advisory board.The early entry into the German market was also intended to be a starting point for entering other European nations that had recently legalized cannabis for either medicinal or recreational use including Denmark Italy Czech Republic Catalonia (Spain) and Switzerland.Cannabis in AustraliaIn September 2015 Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration announced that medical cannabis would become a legally controlled drug starting in November 2016. However how the licensing system would work was not yet clear. Also each state had its own laws. For example any patient (no age limit) in Queensland could be prescribed medical cannabis for cancer epilepsy or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) but only adult patients in New South Wales could be prescribed medical cannabis for end-of-life illnesses.On May 20 2016 Canopy announced that it would be acquiring equity holdings in AusCann in exchange for consultation services in areas “including production quality assurance and operations and strategic advisory services.” This acquisition was the first international partnership between an Australian and a Canadian firm in the cannabis industry. Cannabis in IsraelDr. Raphael Mechoulam was the Israeli scientist who discovered THC the psychoactive component in cannabis. Since his discovery Israel—one of the first countries to legalize medical marijuana and the country with the highest percentage of cannabis users in the world—had become a global leader in marijuana research with the “world’s highest percentage of financial resources devoted to research.” In March 2017 Israel decriminalized the use of recreational cannabis.NEXT STEPSCanopy was already enjoying its status as Canada’s largest cannabis company. There were new markets to explore but at the same time Canada had a shortage of product in the medical cannabis market and recreational cannabis was expected to be legalized in Canada by July 2018. Meanwhile Canopy’s competitors were also engaging in international business. Aurora was already exporting cannabis to Germany and Aphria Medical Cannabis had invested $25 million in a Florida dispensary. Was it too early to explore more international opportunities or should Canopy “strike while the iron was hot” in countries where the cannabis regulations had just been changed? Where in the world should Canopy go from here?Exhibit 1: potential countries for Canopy’s international expansion of its cannabis salesSource: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Active Registrations for Producing Cannabis for Personal Use July 1 2016 to March 31 2017Source: Created by the authors using data from Government of Canada: Drugs and Health Products “Licensed Producers: Market Data” accessed August 20 2017 https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medical-use-marijuana/licensed-producers/market-data.html.Exhibit 3: canada’s licensed producers of cannabis—Quarterly Production and Sales Data October 1 2015 to March 31 2017 Note: kg = kilograms.

On November 9 2017 TikTok’s parent company the Chinese tech company Beijing ByteDance Technology Co. (ByteDance) announced a strategic acquisition of Musical.ly a popular short-video sharing app based in the United States. With more than 100 million users and similar features to TikTok Musical.ly was a powerful competitor for TikTok’s international expansion into the North American markets. For ByteDance and TikTok the closing of the Musical.ly acquisition in August 2018 was not the end goal as it would create another new challenge. Would it be better to keep Musical.ly as a separate platform as Musical.ly had achieved a good reputation and millions of users in the United States? Or should Musical.ly be replaced to create a global app under the TikTok brand which was relatively new to the US market?TIKTOK’S ORIGINSTikTok was the international version of Douyin a short-video sharing app launched in China by ByteDance. The app enabled users to create share and view 15-second videos that could include lip-syncing dancing comedy skits and other physical activities. It had impressive video-editing tools that let users sync their videos to songs chosen from a massive music library and it offered some easy-to-use special effects—such as shaking and shivering with music hair dyeing 3D stickers and props. An example was the stamp filter which allowed users to create raindrops in the video background by holding their hand(s) up to the camera.The CompanyByteDance was a fast-growing Chinese start-up founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming in Beijing. It operated several multimedia platforms powdered by artificial intelligence (AI). With a natural instinct for new technologies and social trends Yiming saw an opportunity to combine the power of AI with the growth of mobile Internet services to revolutionize the way people connected with digital information. ByteDance’s use of AI technologies helped the tech company learn about users’ interests and preferences through their interactions—what users clicked on completed and commented on—and then feed them personalized videos. According to Bloomberg News on October 26 2018 ByteDance was then valued at more than US$75 billion after a new $3 billion round of investment from SoftBank Group Corp. This made ByteDance the world’s most valuable tech start-up.The Short-Video MarketWhen ByteDance launched the Douyin short-video sharing app in China in September 2016 the short-video sharing market was not anything new and was growing. In China Kuaishou led the short-video market by reaching 13.3 per cent penetration in January 2017 followed by Meipai at 3.5 per cent. Kuaishou was particularly popular in Chinese lower-tier cities and was dubbed “the app for small-town Chinese” as over half of its users lived in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. Outside China Musical.ly dominated the developed markets such as North America and Europe but it had yet to expand into China.The high penetration of smart phones—exceeding 80 per cent by November 2016—and the rise of a new generation in China promised to sustain the growing trend of the short-video sharing market. According to an iResearch report China’s short-video market exceeded 153 million users in 2016 and would reach 242 million by 2017 an increase of 58.2 per cent. Douyin’s general manager Wang Xiaowei said in an interviewThe popularity of large-screen smartphones and the acceleration of network infrastructure make people especially the new generation get used to expressing themselves. We believe the short-video market driven by user-generated content has great opportunities among the new generation. The existing short-video apps [in China] are either in favor of tool attributes or less attractive to young people and there should be a music-based short-video community for [the] Chinese new generation.Douyin’s Growth in ChinaDuring the early phases after its launch Douyin frequently updated its versions to improve the product features and usage experience by adding new icons creative special effects filters 3D posters improved video definition and video filming optimization (see Exhibit 1 for detailed updates between version 1.0.0 and version 1.4.0). These refinements helped make Douyin easy to use and offered creative tool kits.Even with improved performance and powerful editing tool kits Douyin still did not receive great attention until Yue Yunpeng (a celebrity in China) forwarded a short video with a Douyin watermark in his Weibo profile on March 12 2017. Yue’s sharing received 83175 likes and more than 5083 forwards. Douyin’s operations team realized the power of celebrities in attracting users and invited a number of Chinese stars who had huge fan bases—such as Yang Mi Lu Han Kris Wu and Angelababy—to join its publicity campaigns.Promotions and Explosive GrowthFrom the second quarter of 2017 Douyin started to grow which could be attributed to its heavy marketing promotions including the attraction of stars and celebrities the sponsorship of TV channels and various trending hashtags. The refinement of its tool kits along with its ability to push “hot” videos to relevant users as powered by its advanced AI techniques enhanced Douyin’s explosive growth.In addition to inviting stars from TV and movie studios and other platforms Douyin invested heavily to promote its own Internet celebrities and its key opinion leaders (KOLs). During a celebration conference in November 2017 ByteDance invested $300 million to help content creators increase followers and generate revenues. Sponsoring Chinese popular variety shows through title sponsorship or product placement deals such as “Hip-Hop in China” “Happy Camp” and “Everyday Upward” also helped Douyin increase its exposure. In order to engage more ordinary users and attract creative content various trending topics or themes in the form of hashtags were regularly promoted on Douyin. Some hashtags were particularly popular spreading virally and attracting thousands of videos and millions of views. By December 2017 Douyin’s daily active users (DAUs) in China had reached 17.4 million.Taking advantage of its fast growth and youth orientation Douyin co-operated with the corporate sector—particularly fashion-based companies—for advertising campaigns. In September 2017 Douyin uploaded its first three advertising campaigns for Airbnb Harbin Beer and Chevrolet and attracted tens of thousands of users. On November 15 2017 Douyin initiated a “City Catwalk” hashtag challenge in partnership with Michael Kors a luxury American brand. Yang Mi and Mark Chao the brand’s Chinese ambassadors and some of Douyin’s “in-house” KOLs joined the campaign and shared videos of people performing catwalks dressed in Michael Kors products. Users were motivated to create their own catwalk videos with Michael Kors products which created 30000 posts and over two billion video streams.By the end of October 2018 Douyin’s number of DAUs exceeded 200 million and monthly active users (MAUs) reached 400 million in China. As Douyin grew into the broader market its videos not only focused on music but covered more general and diverse entertainment such as cooking fashion and travel. On March 19 2018 Zhang Nan the president of Douyin announced its new and more inclusive slogan: “Record the good life.”Strengthening Supervision to Build the CommunityDouyin’s growth and popularity were always accompanied by criticism of its video content as addictive and vulgar which were not unfamiliar claims for social-media apps. As The Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz indicated “Watching too many in a row can feel like you’re about to have a brain freeze. They’re incredibly addictive.” On April 10 2018 the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television demanded that ByteDance’s Toutiao a popular news aggregator permanently shut down the account of Neihan Duanzi due to vulgar content. A large number of Toutiao’s users then quickly swarmed into Douyin with the same profiles and provided similar comments on Douyin’s hot videos. So Douyin temporarily removed its live-stream and comments features that day. Yiming said that he had been bothered by a “guilty conscience” in that “Over the past few years we put more effort and resources toward expanding the business and did not take enough measures to supervise our platform.” He announced that ByteDance would expand its team for monitoring content from 6000 to 10000.On April 10 2018 Douyin also rolled out the “anti-addiction” system—after 90-minutes of continuous usage an alert would pop up to notify users and after daily usage exceeding two hours the app would be automatically locked. However the app could be unlocked again by entering a password. Although it was difficult to control user-generated content Douyin tried to build and maintain a healthy environment for its users especially after gaining millions of users.TIKTOK: DOUYIN’S GLOBALIZATIONOverseas expansion was always on ByteDance’s agenda. As Yiming said “China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don’t expand on a global scale we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So going global is a must.” In an interview with a Tsinghua University professor Yiming revealed that his company’s globalization goal was to have more than half of the company’s users from outside China within the next three years. When Douyin was exploring its growth in China the short-video sharing app competition in both China and global markets was becoming increasingly fierce sharpened by the expansion of existing competitors and the emergence of new entrants. Douyin’s biggest competitor in China Kuaishou (called Kwai overseas) had started its own global expansion. Musical.ly after achieving dominance in the United States and Europe expanded into China to capture that market. In view of competition as well as potential overseas markets Douyin rebranded as TikTok for the international market on August 2017 while remaining Douyin in China.Globalization StrategyIn an interview Yiming explained the company’s globalization strategy as “global products + localized content” and conveyed his belief in ByteDance’s advanced AI techniques. He added that the globalization strategy was consistent with ByteDance’s mission to build global creation and interaction platforms. TikTok therefore kept very similar traits and features to Douyin’s but introduced distinct characteristics for different markets. As a user-generated content app TikTok’s localization strategy was to offer various hashtags around local festivals localize its stickers and effects or filters. “Our localization strategy helps us encourage users to create relevant and local content along with incorporating global trends in the localized flavour” said Raj Mishra the business head of TikTok India. As of 2018 TikTok had more than 500 million MAUs globally in over 150 markets and 75 languages.TikTok in Southeast AsiaThe Market and CompetitorsWith more than 641 million Internet users 51 per cent of whom were MAUs the Internet economy of Southeast Asia—including Indonesia Vietnam Thailand Philippines and Malaysia—reached $50 billion by the end of 2017 exceeding the expectations of Google and Temasek by 35 per cent. People spent a lot of time on social media and were eager to express themselves and share with family and friends. According to an estimation by the United Nations the median age of the population in Southeast Asia was 28.8 years. With a vast number of connected and tech-savvy youth Southeast Asia presented a lucrative market for technology companies. TikTok’s head of marketing Viv Gong said “As Indonesia has the sixth largest population of Internet users in the world we see a huge market opportunity for our app.”Despite attractive market prospects there were no dominant short-video sharing apps in most Southeast Asian countries in 2017. Kwai entered Southeast Asian countries in later 2016 and according to data on Google Play although Kwai was in the top-100 list in Vietnam its ranking was below 400 in other major markets in Southeast Asia.Localizing Campaigns and PromotionsByteDance expanded into Southeast Asian markets by establishing a local office in Indonesia in August 2017. In order to inspire the first generation of creators and celebrate the expansion TikTok held an offline launch party in Jakarta the capital of Indonesia on September 13 2017. Over 100 local stars and Internet celebrities attended the party including Indonesian actress Salshabilla Adriani and Thai actress and singer Suppanad Jittaleela who had more than 1.08 million and 1.29 million followers on Twitter respectively. In Thailand TikTok invited famous young actor and singer Leeratanakajorn Thanapob and rising actress and model Ungsumalynn Sirapatsakmetha to record videos for the promotion.The “Internet celebrity economy” through YouTube and Instagram had been well developed in Southeast Asian countries and some Internet celebrities had accumulated millions of followers. ByteDance’s operations team in Southeast Asia also took advantage of the powerful appeal of local Internet celebrities. “We are looking for and attracting some good content creators from social-media platforms like Instagram” said a manager of TikTok. A number of Internet celebrities created videos and shared them to other social-media platforms like YouTube. In order to bond with content creators TikTok periodically organized offline gatherings. “These gatherings offer a platform for the content creators to share their experiences. More importantly they evoke a sense of belonging and loyalty among content creators” said an influential content creator on TikTok.To cater to local customs the operations team added new stickers and promoted related campaigns based on each specific market. During Thailand’s traditional Water Festival TikTok rolled out three festival-specific stickers to increase its visibility and garnered more than 40000 users in three weeks. During the 2018 ASEAN Football Federation Championship in Vietnam TikTok received more than 120000 videos about the event and attracted 54.8 million views. As most Southeast Asians were fond of and good at dancing and singing TikTok sponsored a variety of hashtags around dancing and singing to encourage user participation. The #tiktokramerame challenge in Indonesia attracted more than 53 million views.According to Google Trend TikTok had achieved a high rank among Southeast Asian countries in 2018 especially in the Video Player category as TikTok was almost the number one app—except in the Philippines where it was number three—in March 2018. In Thailand TikTok garnered over 10 million downloads almost one-sixth of the total population.TikTok in JapanFor a long time the short-video sharing market in Japan was largely carved up by Internet giants such as Facebook Snapchat and YouTube. Expanding to Japan meant TikTok had to compete directly with these giants. On the other hand this represented an opportunity for TikTok as the big companies were not concentrating on the short-video sharing market.As a content-focused product going global was never easy for TikTok especially in the Japanese market which had a distinct culture and an often biased view of Chinese companies. The Japanese market had always been harsh to beginners. As the director of TikTok Japan said “Most of the time they would not give you the opportunity for communication with the excuse of busy schedules or there have been cases where the conversation went well but was ultimately dismissed by top managers.”Breaking the IceIn August 2017 TikTok rented two rooms and set up the founding team in Shibuya a district of Tokyo to start its expansion into Japan. The founding team of TikTok Japan consisted of seven members who were familiar with Japanese culture. The director of this team had fully blended into the Japanese society studying and working in Japan for 17 years. The other team members were either Japanese or people who had studied in Japan.In order to break into the Japanese market TikTok went after the most popular Internet influencers and stars to build up its initial content pool. In the first six months everyone on its operations team was tasked with engaging celebrities. The TikTok Japan team put in great effort and time to collaborate with its first star Kinoshita Yukina who installed TikTok out of her own interest. The operation team grasped this opportunity to break the ice. The director of TikTok Japan said “It took around six or seven rounds of discussions to finally seal the deal. The star studios in Japan are particularly prudent so we needed to talk to them time and again to familiarize them with our product and show our sincerity for cooperation.” After the initial success in signing Kinoshita Yukina the road to convince other star studios in Japan became increasingly less bumpy for TikTok which soon got several popular stars and Internet influencers on board in Japan including Kyary Pamyu E-girls and Fichers. By March 2018 videos with the TikTok watermark started becoming popular on Japan’s social networks.Localizing Campaigns and PromotionsIn addition to attracting local celebrities TikTok customized various features and content in Japan. “Japan has a strong campus culture. Therefore we designed contests that allowed students to participate in groups like cheerleaders” the director said. To cater to Japan’s “respect for similarity” TikTok launched various hashtag campaigns that allowed users to play in groups. On TikTok Japan some dance movements were also simplified to help overcome the shyness of Japanese users. During the period between February 14 and March 9 2018 TikTok promoted the “TikToker Battle” campaign including fashion dance amuse talent and technology hashtags. The most popular videos were shown on four large advertising screens at Shibuya’s busiest intersection. This campaign attracted more than 68000 videos and received 300 million views. In terms of the TV channel promotions and considering the undesirability of product placement in Japan the operations team offered TV producers interesting and report-worthy stories on TikTok that would appeal to Japanese TV producers which helped TikTok co-operate with the TV channels.According to AppBi a leading data analytics consulting agency in China TikTok stood out as number seven in the top-10 list with more than 2.5 million downloads in the first quarter of 2018. The Japanese TV network Nippon TV was also attracted by TikTok’s popularity and taped 15 minutes of street polling to feature TikTok in its morning show “Sukkiri!”TikTok in North America The Competitor: Musical.lyBefore TikTok began its entry into North America Musical.ly had become the most popular short-video sharing app. Early in May 2016 Musicaly.ly ranked number one on Apple’s App Store in 19 different countries amassing 70 million registered users and hitting the mark of 10 million DAUs in the United States.Debuted in April 2014 and officially launched in August 2014 by Chinese entrepreneurs Alex Zhu and Luyu Yang in Shanghai China Musical.ly let its users create 15- to 60-second lip-syncing videos set to various music. At the beginning Musical.ly was launched in both the Chinese and US markets. However compared to the Chinese market’s tepid reaction Musical.ly had been particularly popular in the American teenager market. Due to its small team size Musical.ly decided to concentrate on the US market. In Zhu’s mind Musical.ly was built to be the next social network for sharing videos and was not just a lip-syncing video app. “Today the very proposition of the app is not about creating music videos. It’s not about lip-syncing. It’s about a social network” Zhu said. “It's a community. People want to stay because there are other people.” Musical.ly allowed users to make a duet only when they were BFFs or “Best Fans Forever” rather than simply followers. Since its launch Musical.ly spawned a number of its own digital stars and a passionate creator community of “Musers” (Musical.ly users). Having become a sensation among teenagers in North America and Europe Musical.ly tried to broaden its reach by entering into Asian markets with the name “Muse” on June 6 2017. However Musical.ly did not succeed in the market due to intense competition and its impenetrable product style.The Merger with Musical.lyByteDance acquired Musical.ly as a way to tap into the US market—with Musical.ly already boasting a considerable American audience. Reportedly the acquisition closed in November 2017 at $1 billion. Upon closing the acquisition ByteDance allowed Musical.ly to operate as an independent platform.CHALLENGESLeveraging the strategy of localizing content in each specific market TikTok had globally achieved some exciting numbers in users and rankings. However the local focus also brought a challenge as it was therefore difficult for TikTok to take advantage of its user base for global expansion. In the meantime TikTok had always been surrounded by skeptics and competitors during its expansion. Faced with these challenges could TikTok sustain its position and competitive advantages? How could TikTok make profits after spending a billion dollars in the global markets? The major challenges that TikTok faced in sustaining its position in global markets were as follows.Intense CompetitionThe popularity and success of TikTok had aroused attention and concern from many other tech companies pushing them to release copycats or create similar features targeted at teens. In November 2018 Facebook quietly launched a new short-video sharing app called Lasso that had very similar features to TikTok. According to a report by TechCrunch Snapchat had recently rolled out a new feature called “Lens Challenge” to increase user engagement by letting users post short-form videos themed to a particular song dance event and more.In China TikTok’s main competitor Kuaishou had been boosted by Chinese tech giants Tencent Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu Inc. to join the overseas market particularly in Southeast Asia. Tencent also invested almost $478 million to promote its own short-video sharing app Weishi thereby locking horns with TikTok. Academics Michael Wade and Jialu Shan said in The Conversation that “ByteDance cannot rest on its laurels; however if it wants TikTok to build on its position as the first globally successful ‘made in China’ app TikTok will need to massively expand from its base while staving off attacks from well-funded and ambitious Chinese and global competitors.”Quality and Content of VideosAlthough TikTok racked up millions of users many increasingly complained about the videos as “cringe” and “creepy.” According to The Atlantic “It’s [TikTok’s] so painful and embarrassing that a viewer can’t help but laugh.” One example was a video of a woman standing in front of a bathroom mirror doing thumb movements to a Yo Gotti and Nicki Minaj song and the video pans up to show that she was filming by holding the phone in her mouth.Since the merger with Musical.ly which was mostly popular among youth there was an increasing notion that parents were worried about content on TikTok such as the video that depicted a teen dancing—and then cut to the dead body of the teen’s relative. The perceived addiction also annoyed users—“The only time she [her 10-year-old cousin] interacted with us was when she asked us to be in her TikTok video” Maulydia Yusliwan from Indonesia complained.Government RegulationTikTok had already sparked concern from local governments. On July 3 2018 the Indonesia Communications and Information Ministry temporarily blocked TikTok after learning that it contained “pornography inappropriate content and blasphemy.” This ban was overturned a few days later after TikTok agreed to clear the “negative content” increase security mechanisms and enforce restrictions on users between the ages of 14 and 18. It also agreed to open an office in Indonesia to liaise with the government over content.MonetizationIn China Douyin started exploring opportunities for monetization in early 2017 when it ran three advertising campaigns for Airbnb Harbin Beer and Chevrolet. Those three advertisements proved successful and showed Douyin’s potential for monetization. Taking advantage of hashtags in Douyin brands could post their own hashtag campaigns to create engagement such as Michael Kors’ “City Catwalk” campaign. Douyin also co-operated with Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Tmall TaoBao and JD.com to enable users to sell products in their videos and via links on their profiles.In overseas markets TikTok was still in the “burn money” stage for market growth and penetration and had yet to start generating revenues. As explained by a director of TikTok’s international markets “There have been brands that have approached us regarding advertising but we do not intend to monetize our service at the present time and are waiting for the market to mature.” ByteDance was always generous with spending when it promoted TikTok globally. However despite heavy promotion and a massive user base TikTok only had a 29 per cent engagement rate whereas Facebook’s engagement rate was 96 per cent Instagram’s was 95 per cent Snapchat’s was 95 per cent and YouTube’s was 95 per cent. Facing a low engagement rate and differences across markets TikTok’s monetization in global markets still had a long way to go.THE ROAD AHEADGiven the distinct user bases of TikTok and Musical.ly both in content type and geographic regions maintaining two different platforms to target distinct user groups appeared to be a good idea. However combining both platforms might deteriorate the unique positioning of each platform and also risk a drop in the number of users due to possible annoyance. How much growth could the niche market of Musical.ly offer? If TikTok and Musical.ly did not benefit from each other’s unique networks then quite possibly no synergies would arise from the high-ticket acquisition. Could the combined user bases of Musical.ly and TikTok help the growth of a combined platform via global network effects? Could they also provide stronger defences against more diversified competitors with larger user bases? The acquisition decision would determine the future of ByteDance in the global market.Exhibit 1: Detailed updates for Douyin between version 1.0.0 and version 1.4.0Source: Created by the case authors from “Douyin—What’s New” [in Chinese] AppAnnie (account required) accessed July 4 2019 www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/ame-yin-le-duan-shi-pin-she-qu/details/.ENDNOTES",0,,,,

A worker had had both legs seriously injured while clinker rake loading and he had been rushed to the hospital in critical condition. It was an alarming situation for Patil the chief operating officer at the Rawan Cement Works (Rawan) unit of UltraTech Cement Limited (UltraTech) based in Raipur Chhattisgarh. His firm belief that all occupational injuries could be prevented was shaken. The unit was in the midst of a terrible phase—perhaps its worst ever. The collapse of the clinker silo roof a few months back had been followed by a series of incidents that had attracted negative attention from government officials the media and trade unions. Amid declining productivity and low employee morale this present incident added to Patil’s woes. Despite management’s objective of zero tolerance towards safety violations and the deployment of globally acclaimed safety consultants the situation was suddenly beyond control. As Patil analyzed the situation he felt that there was a significant gap between the best policies formulated at the management level and their implementation at the grassroots level. This gap led to a deviation from the desired result. It was essential to move from a process-centric approach to safety to one that was people-centric. Patil had a few ideas in mind. He needed effective immediate and out-of-the-box solutions to his multi-point objective so he called his core team together for discussion. His priorities were to manage the safety crisis that had engulfed the unit and to restore the faith of people in the organization. He needed methods to implement policies and procedures at the ground level to prevent a relapse. EXECUTIVES INVOLVED Patil had joined the Rawan unit of UltraTech in the financial year (FY) 2013–14 as the chief operating officer and executive president. A graduate in mechanical engineering with a master of business administration degree in finance Patil was a seasoned professional with more than 30 years of experience in various capacities. Popularly known as the “safety person” within the UltraTech families Patil had been instrumental in taking safety from a fashion to a passion within the company. He had actively steered the safety excellence journey at UltraTech through his collaboration with DuPont Sustainable Solutions (DuPont). DuPont was an operations management consulting firm that was globally acclaimed for its best-in-class safety systems and its role in transforming workplaces to become not only safer but also efficient and sustainable. Patil’s vision of making everyone accountable for safety had played a pivotal role in providing overall safety standards.Ravi Kant Dubey had joined UltraTech Cement as a manager in 2008 and was the head of the safety department. He was initially based at the Awarpur Cement Works unit in Chandrapur Maharashtra. He took over as general manager at Rawan in 2015. An engineering graduate who specialized in industrial safety Dubey had 19 years of rich experience in executing and implementing a range of safety practices on various important projects in India and abroad. His well-crafted safety practices had resulted in the completion of critical projects without any lost-time injuries. During his tenure at Awarpur Cement Works he had played a key role in enhancing safety compliance.BACKGROUNDOwing to its hazardous nature the cement industry found ensuring healthy and safe working conditions for employees and contract workers to be one of its biggest challenges (see Exhibit 1). Accidents or lost-time injuries had not only instant effects on the morale of the people but also long-term effects on overall productivity and business sustainability. The cement industry was gradually evolving to develop and implement better systems for occupational health and safety management in order to minimize potential mishaps. The safety practices at UltraTech had a relative edge over those of other global players and the company’s vision was “to be the leader in building solutions by focusing on zero harm to employees environment and our stakeholders.”Safety at UltraTech was strongly system-driven with a hierarchy of control to manage risk. The company had a fully functional and dedicated department of safety (see Exhibit 2) consisting of 16 employees. The department headed by a general manager consisted of a section head four front-line executives and 16 stewards. UltraTech’s safety processes were revamped to focus on the prime goal of achieving zero harm starting in FY2009–10. This was done through a collaboration with DuPont. The initial findings in this project suggested there was a reactive approach towards safety within the company. However within four years there had been significant improvement in a 13-point score that showed a cultural shift towards a proactive approach (see Exhibit 3). Subsequently there was also a significant reduction in the frequency of accidents. The company worked to develop an integrated approach that built safety into the contract management process. It took various measures to enhance the level of safety at the unit—including the elimination of risk factors substitution with safer alternatives the isolation of high-risk zones engineering control administrative measures and mandated use of personal protective equipment. In total 24 safety standards 24 safety procedures and more than 100 guidelines were developed and implemented. Optimally safe working conditions were designed by modifying the facility and infrastructure designing inherently safe systems and improving processes (see Exhibit 4). Some significant initiatives were a full-day safety round (when a person was designated only for monitoring safety at a site for a full day) a morning toolbox talk (a discussion on safety related items while preparing for work in morning) daily job activity planning closed-circuit television monitoring at all critical locations testing for height phobias a one-man one-lock system (a safety practice) stop-work empowerment (where each person in the organization was encouraged to stop work if he or she found that there was a safety risk involved) the development of an online safety quiz and a night vigilance system. Ensuring complete safety was one of the key responsibility areas of the line function. Moreover the importance of being safe at all times and the mandatory use of helmets were emphasized through off-site safety measures. All of these measures contributed to a safe working environment.Despite these measures the plant had witnessed frequent incidents in the recent past. The plant had already been shut down for several weeks due to a cyclone jamming and this had resulted in a significant loss of productivity. There had been back-to-back accidents: a worker suffered a severe facial injury caused by belt-pulling during maintenance and another suffered high-degree burns while cleaning hot bed ash. The situation worsened when one worker suffered a serious abdomen injury and another died as a result of injuries related to the erection of a coal shed. Finally the roof of a clinker silo collapsed. There was massive agitation from the trade unions the issues had flared up in the media and the government had demanded immediate corrective measures. The situation had become completely out of control. Many demanding questions needed attention. It was difficult to understand why or how such incidents had occurred when the organization had implemented best-in-class safety systems in collaboration with DuPont. Though ensuring the complete safety of employees at all times was a non-negotiable aspect of the organization incidents were still being reported at the site. As Patil was recognizing the need to devise measures that would make safety measures people-centric rather than process-centric Dubey joined the Rawan unit as it was passing through its toughest ever phase. After two months at this unit and heading the department of safety Dubey was entrusted with the responsibility of devising an implementation plan for a best-fit approach. He was also given the task of designing internal communications that would restore the faith of employees. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Globally India was the world’s second-largest producer of cement so cement contributed significantly to the country’s overall economy. The country had a total cement manufacturing capacity of about 384 million tonnes as of FY2015–16. Per-capita consumption was estimated to be about 200 kilograms which was low compared with the world average of 500 kilograms. Out of the total consumption in India the housing sector represented about 67 per cent followed by infrastructure (13 per cent) commercial construction (11 per cent) and institutional construction (9 per cent). The cement industry in India was dominated by a few large players: UltraTech Ambuja Cement Ltd. ACC Limited Shree Cement India Cements Limited Ramco Cements Limited and Birla Corporation Limited. There were 210 large cement plants in the country accounting for a cumulative installed capacity of over 350 million tonnes and 350 smaller plants that accounted for the rest. The cement industry employed more than 1 million people either directly or indirectly. Since the industry was deregulated in 1982 it had attracted huge investments from Indian and global investors. COMPANY OVERVIEW: ULTRATECH CEMENTIdentifying itself as “The Engineer’s Choice” UltraTech was one of the leading producers of cement globally and the largest manufacturer of grey cement ready-mix concrete and white cement in India (see Exhibits 5 and 6). Headquartered in Mumbai it operated in India with 18 integrated plants 25 grinding units and seven bulk terminals. Within the three decades since its inception in 1986 it had carved a niche for itself: beginning as a cement manufacturer it was now seen as an end-to-end innovative building solution provider. Keeping pace with the changing tastes and preferences of contemporary consumers it had become a one-stop shop for primary construction needs.UltraTech’s operations spanned India the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. With a dominant presence on the global front UltraTech was also India’s largest exporter of cement to adjoining countries and the Middle East. With the organization’s focus on cutting-edge technology research and technical services UltraTech as a brand embodied the characteristics of strength reliability and innovation. UltraTech’s parent company the Aditya Birla Group was a Fortune 500 company employing a diverse workforce of 120000 employees belonging to 42 different nationalities across 36 countries.TRANSITION TOWARDS BEHAVIOuR-BASED SAFETY: THE DECISIONThough safety was strongly system-driven human intervention had an important role in the process and exposed the system to inadvertent risks of error and overconfidence. While safety compliance was the first consideration of company processes these considerations were not always properly addressed. A closer analysis revealed that almost 50 per cent of the incidents at UltraTech could be attributed to un-safe acts or the risky behaviours of employees. These were carried out mainly to save time or to make things more convenient. Sometimes the cause was a lack of understanding or training or the result of unskilled behaviour or a disagreement about safe practices. Moreover employees generally believed that while they complied with safety procedures it was always others who violated safety practices and put things at risk. The major focus for enhancing safety up to this point had been on maintaining safe work conditions. The related areas of concern had been adequately addressed; however it was now felt that incorporating behavioural modification was the key to controlling containing or mitigating the consequence of any untoward happening. Patil and his core team members arrived at a consensus: engagement of the people was necessary in order to move from being process-centric to being people-centric and to make the safety implementation process effective. Further they would have to devise emotionally intelligent methods to restore the faith of people in the organization. To manage the immediate crisis Patil instructed his core team to float an internal communication to all stakeholders. The communication would be aimed at boosting the morale of employees and assuring them that all possible corrective measures would be taken to ensure their complete safety. The team was also considering people-centric measures to incorporate behavioural modifications; these included mentoring remodelling on-the-job training and other proposed measures. The key decision would require devising the best-fit approach to effectively transition to behaviour-based safety. MentoringPatil strongly believed that “[safety is] for the people safety is of people and safety is by the people.” To address the issue of un-safe acts and risky behaviour that could lead to safety violations it was necessary to drive behavioural modification in people. To shift towards behaviour-based safety Patil and his team felt that the involvement and participation of people was of prime importance. Patil proposed an informal approach of pairing mentors with mentees to address the issue. This was meant to emphasize the need to be safe over the need to ensure compliance with processes. The concept would aim to bring about behavioural modifications in employees by enhancing their overall level of comfort at the workplace. The approach would require line managers to function as mentors for workers who would be the mentees. Each mentor would be allocated about 12–15 mentees from cross-functional domains and would be responsible for emphasizing the importance of safety—not only at the plant but also off-site. The mentors would be entrusted with the task of communicating various safety policies procedures and guidelines to mentees in an informal and engaging manner. Informal communication would be promoted and personal bonding would be the key aspect driving the mentor–mentee relationship. To drive home the concept it was suggested that the mentors should treat the mentees as extended family; they would also be responsible for addressing their professional and personal grievances. Team activities could be designed to improve bonding beyond the hierarchical framework. Enhanced engagement with people and a caring attitude would make the mentees receptive to the mentors. This approach would make it easier to address un-safe acts in a positive manner and to bring about behavioural changes. Key performance indicators would be based on a monthly tally of interactions reports of un-safe acts or near misses stop-work notices and safety kaizen events attended by the mentees. The intention was to enhance workers’ knowledge of safety standards and develop their commitment to achieving the goal of zero accidents.Remodelling On-the-Job TrainingTo address the specific concerns of un-trained or unskilled behaviour the team considered an innovative approach to employee training that would involve characteristics such as a theme of the month a “safety on wheels” concept customization posters and the use of field-based scenarios.Theme of the Month: With a view to building awareness a safety-based theme such as road safety machine guarding environmental conservation or a proactive approach towards safety would be chosen every month. A few activities would be organized around the proposed theme and people displaying exemplary behaviour would be acknowledged at a monthly gathering. At the same time workers would also be apprised of the performance expected from them current gaps and suggested methods for overcoming these.Safety on Wheels: The “safety on wheels” concept was proposed to train ground staff and contract workers during shutdown periods rather than in a formal classroom setting. The concept would make use of animated videos on safety standards. The videos would be made in regional languages to ease workers’ understanding. Customization: This initiative involved performing a thorough training needs assessment to understand specific needs to be addressed. Special safety induction for young or temporary employees was also under consideration. Illustrated Posters: To establish better connections with people posters employing illustrations—as opposed to written hand-outs on the notice boards—would be used to convey learning from incidents. Field-Based Scenarios: To get the maximum leverage out of the training initiatives real field-based scenarios would be incorporated. Participants would role-play real incidents to enhance their overall learning in a way that was easy to understand. Communication would be based on identifying risky behaviours and corrective or preventative actions taken and would emphasize key learning to prevent injuries.Other Proposed MeasuresOther measures were also proposed including incentivizing safe work practices creating an employer of choice index and closely monitoring risky behaviour.To build positive reinforcement incentives would be realigned towards the behavioural excellence of individuals. Employees could be recognized for taking active measures such as reporting near misses moderating hazards or using their stop-work authority to prevent mishaps at the workplace. A campaign called Khatra Dhuno Abhiyan (“Mission: Risk Finding”) would be initiated to involve everyone in the process of identifying and reporting hazards and spot awards would be given to motivate people.The creation of an employer of choice index was also under consideration. This would invite employee feedback about what employees expected from the company in terms of ensuring a safe working culture and what measures they thought should be incorporated to achieve this. Suggestion boxes would be installed at various places to encourage unbiased feedback. The feedback received could be compiled to introduce people-centric measures.Close monitoring of risky behaviour would be done through safety policing and close supervision. While safety policing would punish un-safe acts close supervision would involve assigning a skilled worker to each unskilled worker in order to avoid safety violations. CHALLENGESA few challenges in implementing the above approaches were anticipated. First and foremost were the criteria for choosing the mentors. The next was to motivate mentors to take up additional responsibility and handle cultural differences between mentors and their mentees. On the one hand the core team considered methods to build effective communication develop personal bonds with people and address their personal grievances; on the other hand it was difficult to ensure that workers would not make undue use of these methods to avoid work. Training for high-risk activities and the choice of a trainer were other points under consideration. The team also foresaw challenges in devising criteria for identifying risky behaviour and training for high-risk activities. moving forwardTo improve workplace safety the company would have to look beyond existing organizational protocols and systematic safety compliance. The priority was to address the fundamentally risky behaviour of employees reduce lost-time injuries and make business sustainable in the long term. The key decisions revolved around managing the safety crisis at the unit and devising a plan to prevent the recurrence of recent events.Exhibit 1: Common causes of injuries Source: Company documents.

Saurabh Sinha had witnessed the growth of the company at an average rate of 16 per cent since its inception in 2005 when it started with 200 full-time equivalent (FTE) (reaching 1000 by 2016). This was a fair growth rate for a captive division of a leading U.K.-based bank in India. However as the head of the India division Sinha had to ensure that DXSD remained competitive. Although the company’s growth rate had been consistent DXSD India continued to need growth spurts to remain competitive and sustainable. Augmenting an existing LoB resulted in incremental growth whereas adding a new LoB contributed to growth spurts. The company operated in a competitive global market competing against such countries as the Philippines Romania and Ireland. These locations which were quickly emerging as preferred destinations for offshore outsourcing were competing on the basis of the value proposition and productivity offered. DXSD India’s competitive advantages included cost arbitrage productivity and quality of work delivered. Lately however Sinha worried that these services were not sufficient to continue attracting business. New ideas were needed to ensure growth.The DXSD India leadership team outlined its goal to take on more complex work. New LoBs were identified as potential for new business including moving from reconciliation and retail operations towards risk management asset-liability management and treasury back-office operations. In the sphere of information technology (IT) management wanted to move beyond support and development work into areas such as data mining and analytics. Therefore Sinha had started focusing on accepting work related to the migration of complex processes. After some deliberation Sinha’s team outlined a new process migration methodology. This new methodology was expected to transform the company’s approach to the migration of LoBs. DXSD India received the assignment to migrate a new LoB on January 23 2015. Sinha had just two days to decide whether to follow the new approach or continue with the current way of working.About DXSDDXSD operated through an office in India established in 2005 and another office in Ireland established in 2010. The heads of both offices reported to the company’s headquarters in the United Kingdom. The India office had double the staff of the Ireland office. Each office had an independent finance human resources IT and operations function. The Ireland office specialized in call centre operations for inbound and outbound customer handling. The transition and business excellence functions were common to both offices and reported to the head of DXSD India. The business was prepared to grow in terms of augmentation (enhanced capacity) increased complexity or the addition of new LoBs such as data analytics. However the areas of procurement asset-liability management and treasury back-office operations were yet to be tapped. The DXSD management realized that in order to take the next step they had to strengthen their core competencies; therefore they set up a year-long foundation program. The objective of this program was to improve their structure and rigour across areas such as human resources project management and information security in order to enable the organization to achieve sustainable growth. The DXSD management team realized that movement of work (referred to as “migration”) was crucial and therefore nominated migration as one of the key focus areas of the foundation program.Sinha and his team had been able to migrate processes and applications to DXSD India successfully but there had been challenges. Moving up the value chain led to higher risk exposure. Specifically the quality and accuracy of service delivery were of paramount importance and could not be compromised. The Upcoming MigrationSinha pondered over the new LoB migration assignment he had just received. He recalled the previous year’s attempt to improve the structure by outlining a new migration approach. With that attempt in mind he called Isha Chawla the head of the migration team to discuss how to handle this new opportunity. Sinha explained the new opportunity to Chawla: We have just received an approval for the migration of a new LoB where the focus will be on the IT side.[] I wanted to discuss the approach we should adopt to handle it. Perhaps we need to transform migrations and an incremental change may not suffice. This LoB is complex and has high visibility. Could you work out a proposal to recommend whether we will be able to transform our migrations through our new process migration framework or should we continue with the existing framework for the upcoming migration? I have a meeting planned with the key sponsor after two days and would need your recommendation before that. Chawla responded to Sinha’s request as follows: I understand the importance of this opportunity and the associated sense of urgency. You are aware that migrations have been identified as a key area in the strategic foundation program and my team has been waiting for such an opportunity but moving to this complex LoB with the new approach is not without risk. We have not really tested the new process migration framework. The framework has also not been integrated with the U.K. [project management office] PMO practice.[] Besides this two days is a short time to decide on the way forward but let me get back to you with a proposal after a discussion with the team.Existing Process Migration FrameworkA process migration framework ensured that the structure and rigour of migrating work from onshore to offshore locations met the company’s requirements. Migration of work involved the movement of a process application or service from the U.K. head office to one of the two satellite offices in India or Ireland. Ensuring that the work migrated smoothly involved training sessions and various compliance requirements including privacy impact assessment fraud risk assessment and business continuity planning. Eventually the expected parameters of quality and accuracy were to be met in the shortest possible time.For example after reconciliation process work had been properly migrated to DXSD India the end customer would not detect any difference in terms of service quality or turnaround time. The initial focus was usually on ensuring accuracy. The expectations for the speed of the migration were dealt with during the progression period. Regardless of which location received the work—India or Ireland—the robustness of the framework to ensure successful migrations was the most important factor. DXSD India had developed the framework with this intention in mind. However the U.K. PMO had not been involved during the development of the existing framework.Phases of the Existing Process Migration FrameworkThe existing process migration framework was developed by the India office in collaboration with the operations and IT teams. The framework was developed in four phases (see Exhibit 1) each supported by a well-defined set of templates. The four phases of the process migration framework were due diligence and solution assessment planning execution and closure.Due Diligence and Solution Assessment: This phase involved understanding the scope of the migration and validation from onshore partners to enable planning. This was mostly a discussion with the onshore partners on what was required to be done. It also involved filling a simple template which captured the usual requirements of a migration. The purpose of this template was to ensure that all important details from the perspective of the migration were not missed.Planning: On the basis of the due diligence and solution assessment a detailed plan was prepared. This would include planning for compliance requirements hiring onboarding infrastructure setup knowledge transfer billing and service level agreements.Execution: This phase involved the execution of the activities planned in the previous phase. Travel was sometimes necessary to transfer knowledge from employees in India or Ireland to employees in the United Kingdom or for trainers from the United Kingdom travelling to India or Ireland to share their knowledge. The transfer of knowledge was one of the most important elements. Its proper execution was essential to ensure a successful migration.Closure: Once the execution phase was completed the migration project could be closed. Closure involved logging all lessons learned and releasing migration-specific resources.The framework was a straightforward process that was expected to serve the different expectations of both the IT and operations departments. As a certified Capability Maturity Model Integration service IT was required to comply with the service system transition process area. The operations department’s key focus was to ensure a seamless transition. Although the management team supported the need for rigour floor workers were not looking forward to dealing with yet another set of templates. DXSD had worked hard to instil a constant pursuit of operational excellence while avoiding the addition of elements without value. After all the workers needed to appreciate the value of using the framework.The migration team fully understood that implementing the framework involved far more than simply deploying some templates—it was about transforming the way DXSD viewed the migration of projects. Because DXSD Ireland had not developed a framework of its own the migration team relied completely on the framework developed by DXSD India for reference. However the team was well aware that the new framework had been developed without the involvement of the U.K. PMO.Having the experience of several previous migration projects DXSD India took the lead in this new project. The company was a high-performing division of the conglomerate having fully met the expectations of its onshore partners. The DXSD India management team was also committed which gave the migration team the necessary motivation to deliver its best work.The management team anticipated that the framework would help set correct expectations ensure readiness of infrastructure and hire the required personnel governance communication and project management. Although the existing framework had been comprehensive inertia had prevented its full use. According to some members of the migration team inertia stemmed from the fact that the framework was considered unrealistic despite its tailored guidelines. New Process Migration FrameworkIn the last quarter of 2014 the migration team decided to correct some existing gaps in the process through the new framework (see Exhibit 2). The team wanted the framework to have a clear end-to-end life cycle perspective. Clearly defined “go no-go” moments were implemented using toll gates (or approval points) after each phase. Also because the setting of expectations did not seem optimal a new initiation phase was proposed. The purpose of the initiation phase was to ensure that all the stakeholders including sponsors were aligned with the goals. This phase would provide the opportunity to set clear expectations from everyone in terms of deliverables their availability communication and governance. The purpose of toll gates was to ensure that the migration moved ahead in a systematic manner with milestone-based acceptance at the end of each phase. Toll gates also ensured that no surprises appeared at the end of the migration.The ProposalSinha requested that Chawla submit a proposal on which approach should be followed for the upcoming migration. Along with her team Chawla had to logically justify the chosen approach thinking beyond the upcoming migration. The team was aware that more than just repairing gaps was required despite the fact that the new migration framework had been developed collectively with the IT and operations teams. Chawla was a seasoned professional with a significant amount of experience. She understood that the management team was looking for a transformation of migrations. Rahil Jalan and Binoy Sarkar two key members of Chawla’s team were frantically evaluating the pros and cons of deploying the existing migration framework on the upcoming migration. Jalan expressed some concerns: It is not just the framework that we need to look at; we need to think about how we are going to handle the engagement of onshore and offshore stakeholders. One has to realize that this work would have to be delivered from both locations of DXSD. The knowledge transfer would be complex not because of the underlying technology but because of the fact that the core team in the U.K. is likely to move on to new assignments in a few weeks. This could limit the opportunity for tacit knowledge transfer. Who will handhold the migration from the onshore team in such a situation? To top it all we don’t have the required portal specialists who can handle an immediate handover.Sarkar had another concern: If we deploy the new migration framework would the management stand behind us? We had not involved the onshore partners in the development of the framework so how will we get a buy-in from them? They like to run their projects as per their framework which already involves toll gates. How are we going to ensure that the required governance structure is in place and our management is kept in the loop for guidance and is regularly apprised of the risks and issues? Besides this do we have the funding to take this initiative forward beyond the upcoming migration? We may need more hands on deck if we follow this course or else I know for sure that this initiative will fizzle out.Chawla attempted to allay the concerns of Jalan and Sarkar by sharing her thoughts: I think we do have management commitment. The management is of the view that DXSD will move up the value chain only when we can give our partners the confidence that a migration is going to happen without hiccups and I feel that can happen only if we transform the migrations. Sinha has shared the feedback from the onshore team and our new framework addresses many of these concerns. He has even suggested a transformation framework [see Exhibit 3] that we can utilize.The upcoming opportunity has high visibility and we can’t afford to go wrong. If we continue to use the existing process migration framework we may not be able to turn it around properly. On the other hand if we use the new framework which has not been fully tested it may be counterproductive. Should we run with the existing way of working or choose the new process migration framework? Would fixing the gaps in the framework be enough to transform the migrations? What should be our proposal for the upcoming opportunity?Exhibit 1: Existing Process Migration FrameworkSource: Created by authors based on their understanding of the existing process migration framework.Exhibit 2: New Process Migration FrameworkNote: TG = toll gateSource: Created by authors based on their understanding of the new process migration framework.EXHIBIT 3: PROCESS TANGRAMNote: IT = information technology; MIS = management information systemsSource: Chitra Sharma Business Process Transformation: The Process Tangram Framework (New Delhi: Springer India 2015) 3.",1,BROWN,SOUTHERN ASIA,MAN,

Ltd. (Bauing Group) decided to expand the company internationally the group successfully established subsidiary companies in several Southeast Asian countries. These subsidiary companies grew rapidly and became profitable. Based on this success in Southeast Asia Bauing Group decided in 2016 to expand further by entering the US market. Entering the US market entailed some challenges and difficulties including cultural and regional differences language barriers and the need to become familiar with different construction standards and laws. Bauing Group also needed to address a pressing issue: determining its market entry strategy. Background of Bauing Group Shenzhen Bauing Construction Group Co. Ltd. (Bauing Construction) was founded in April 1994 as a subsidiary of Bauing Group with registered capital of ¥680 million. Bauing Group one of the biggest companies in China’s construction and design industry had comprehensive qualifications. Its services included interior design curtain wall and steel structure engineering integrated artificial-intelligence engineering fire-control building engineering electromechanical installation security solutions metal window and door installation conference centre construction and medical device engineering. The company provided its clients with integrated design construction and installation solutions as well as management services. It was China’s leading integrated design enterprise and it had been nominated for awards as one of China’s 100 top developing enterprises in construction and as one of the top 10 Chinese construction and design firms. Bauing Group had A-level design qualifications related to decorating curtain walls artificial intelligence and fire control as well as first-class construction qualifications in these categories and in electronic-door and electromechanical installation. It was also qualified to supply security solutions medical devices financial security solutions and international contracting. Bauing Group’s business network reached the whole country and all around the world. It was present in all five regions of China excluding Taiwan and it had branches in Beijing Shanghai Wuhan Guangzhou Kunming Chengdu and other major cities. Its focus was public cultural projects; the construction of sports sites luxury hotels and transportation stations; the design and decoration of hospitals; and the decoration of luxury residences. The Construction Industry in ChinaAccording to a MarketLine industry profile the Chinese construction industry had grown significantly in recent years. Its value had increased by 6.1 per cent in 2016 and this increase was expected to continue. The most lucrative segment of the construction industry was residential construction which represented 53.8 per cent of the construction industry’s total value in 2016. Because residential construction projects were smaller and more standardized they were also cost-efficient and did not require significant expertise or financing. Thus this segment involved a relatively large number of smaller companies that competed mainly based on price creating “a nearly perfect competition environment.”Non-residential construction contributed 46.2 per cent of the industry’s total value in 2016. This segment was much more concentrated than residential construction; a small number of large companies here competed via tenders for large commercial and infrastructure projects. In this segment achieving a competitive advantage was highly dependent on economies of scale and specialization.Non-residential construction had grown over the past few years because of large government investments in infrastructure which analysts expected would continue to stimulate additional growth in the near future in turn ameliorating some reductions in demand for housing and non-residential projects. Some of these major infrastructure developments included a bridge between Shenzhen and Zhongshan; a second international airport near Beijing; an expansion to the country’s railway network; and the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative which represented investments of many billions of dollars.Bauing Group Goes GlobalBauing Group had a business presence in more than 20 countries and regions around the world including Europe Southeast Asia Mid-Asia West Africa and Australia.In 2014 Bauing Group’s board chair Gu made the decision to take the company abroad. Many of his speeches spoke of a desire to promote economic and trade co-operation through humanistic exchanges combine the implementation of building projects infrastructure construction electric power engineering [and] Smart City business together with transnational cultural exchanges [and] create an international brand of Chinese private building enterprise with Bauing characteristics.More specifically Bauing Group was motivated to go abroad for two main reasons. First the country’s OBOR initiative provided a great opportunity. This initiative announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 aimed to create a web of railways roads pipelines and energy corridors to connect and integrate the Eurasian continent. It involved a massive expansion of Chinese-led infrastructure construction across Eurasia with the ultimate goal of connecting China to customers in Western Europe. The scope of the initiative was dramatic. It had attracted more than 60 countries. The project had already made real progress with more than 200 enterprises signing contracts for projects along OBOR routes. Many of these were funded by the US$40-billion Silk Road Fund (a Chinese government investment fund meant to increase investment in countries along the OBOR route). Potential opportunities for those involved in the initiative were significant. Countries along the route envisioned widespread economic benefits and the investment came at a welcome time. A report from McKinsey & Co. found a growing gap between the need for infrastructure worldwide and infrastructure spending noting that the world was falling short by 11 per cent or up to $350 billion every year. For the more than 45 countries that had signed on to the initiative Chinese spending could fill much of this projected infrastructure spending gap. Projects associated with the initiative could revitalize stagnant Central Asian countries providing power running water and transportation to landlocked areas. The expansion of construction could also create opportunities for the firms that constructed bridges power plants rail lines and other infrastructure along the OBOR route. Chinese firms were racing for opportunities to submit tenders for projects associated with the initiative. Given Bauing Group’s primary business and strengths the company decided to follow the OBOR initiative to upgrade and transform itself. Second the building industry in China’s domestic market had become more competitive which posed challenges for Bauing Group. In 2016 the overall building and decoration industry in China was improving. During 2016 total revenue in the industry increased and the growth rate changed from negative to positive (see Exhibit 1). However most public companies in this industry in China saw their gross margins decrease for reasons such as increased period costs decreased operational capabilities and poor cash flow.Going global therefore became the inevitable strategy for Bauing Group. In September 2014 the group purchased 51 per cent of the shares of Shenzhen Ninefold Construction Group Co. Ltd. to leverage its overseas resources. In December 2014 it founded PT Bauing Construction Group Indonesia (Bauing Indonesia) to lay the foundation for global-oriented management and international development under the OBOR initiative. In 2015 Bauing Group set up a subsidiary company in Hong Kong. Based on the group’s success in Southeast Asian countries Bauing Group decided to expand its business into other countries in that region and to enter new markets in the United States and Australia. Bauing Group’s Success in Southeast AsiaIn Indonesia where Bauing Group established its first foreign company in 2014 the construction industry had undergone significant recent growth at annual rates slightly below 10 per cent in 2016. The non-residential segment accounted for 90.1 per cent of Indonesia’s total construction value which was partly the result of increased government spending on infrastructure projects and increased demand for commercial and residential construction due to an increasingly urban population and increased incomes. Since 2014 Bauing Indonesia had grown rapidly (see Exhibit 2) and the overall financial performance of Bauing Group from 2013–2016 had also grown steadily (see Exhibit 3). Bauing Group had continually established new companies in other Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam and Myanmar. The company had successfully completed many large-scale projects in these countries including the Indonesian Army eco-house project the Country Garden Forest City sales office KL Port Klang Yima Hotel fitting-out projects in Malaysia and the Crowne Plaza Danang fitting-out project in Vietnam. It had also launched many new projects which were under construction (see Exhibit 4).The success of Bauing Group in Southeast Asia was a result of two factors. First the OBOR initiative and the opportunities it provided: the initiative was expected to bridge the infrastructure gap and thus accelerate economic growth across the Asia-Pacific area and throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The area of the initiative encompassed approximately 60 countries primarily in Asia and Europe and also included Oceania and East Africa. The anticipated cumulative investment over an indefinite time scale was variously estimated at $4 trillion–$8 trillion.Second Bauing Group’s corporate culture emphasized wisdom sharpness and bravery—characteristics of the eagle—which reflected the core values of Bauing Group’s Lingnan cultural heritage. Lingnan culture from Guangdong and the nearby provinces in south-eastern China encouraged people to “always [be] brave to go out to try new things to embrace change to adapt [to a] new environment wisely.” This approach combined values from Cantonese Teochew and Hakka cultures and was typically contrasted with Zhongyuan culture which came from China’s northern plains (Zhongyuan was Mandarin for “central plain”). Throughout history many Lingnan people had immigrated to Southeast Asian countries taking with them the Lingnan culture and lifestyle and maintaining their dialects from one generation to another. They were a special ethnic minority group that played important roles in different walks of life in most Southeast Asian countries. By basing its corporate culture in Lingnan culture Bauing Group was able both to naturally gain some advantages and to overcome cultural conflicts when entering Southeast Asian countries.The US Construction IndustryA MarketLine industry profile indicated that the US construction industry had been experiencing healthy growth. It had increased in value by 6.5 per cent in 2016 and analysts expected this growth to continue at a similar rate between 2016 and 2021.The highest contributor to the US construction industry’s total value was the non-residential segment which contributed $712.5 billion or 60.1 per cent in revenue. Residential construction contributed $473.2 billion or 39.9 per cent of the industry’s total value in 2016. Strong demand for residential properties fuelled by a significant increase in household income and lower mortgage costs had been largely responsible for the strength of the US construction industry in recent years. Non-residential construction in the United States had been slightly unstable but had improved in recent years. Spending on infrastructure however had stalled due to an uncertain political climate. MarketLine expected growth in the US construction industry to continue to slow as private investments slowed. Analysts expected investors to be less confident about this industry and expected banks to tighten qualifications for lending.In this scenario non-residential construction was expected to increase. Analysts projected that the main contributors to the industry would be large-scale projects including The Wharf in Washington DC; the One Vanderbilt building in New York City; and a planned high-speed rail line in California. The US industry was also vulnerable to a labour shortage which might act as a deterrent in the coming years.New entrants in the US construction industry faced capital barriers “related to significant capital outlay and economies of scale” and large established competitors which made the industry relatively difficult for newcomers.Residential construction in contrast was less concentrated and therefore more suitable for smaller companies. Moreover the industry as a whole was influenced by the country’s overall economic climate so it could vary over time just as industries did in other countries.Challenges of Entering the US Market In 2016 Bauing Group decided to further expand its business and to enter the US market. The company’s overall management strategy in the US market was to realize fast high-quality expansion and healthy sustainable growth through constantly improving management and operations and providing comprehensive construction and management services to its clients. Although it had successfully entered Southeast Asian markets Bauing Group faced unprecedented challenges in the United States including cultural conflicts regional differences language barriers and different standards and laws governing construction. More important than meeting these challenges was the need for the company to decide on the most suitable market entry strategy for Bauing Group to enter the US market (see Exhibit 5). Should it enter the market through licensing greenfield projects franchising business alliances exporting turnkey projects joint ventures or acquisitions?Exhibit 1: China’s Building and Decoration Industry—Total Revenue and Growth Rate 2012–2016 Note: ¥ = RMB = Chinese yuan renminbi; ¥1 = US$0.17 on January 31 2016.Source: Adapted by the authors from Baichun Lai “2016 Analysis of China’s Architectural Decoration Industry Listed Companies [in Chinese]” Shenzen Guangtian Science and Technology Development Research Institute June 21 2017 accessed April 15 2018 www.sohu.com/a/150901237_659865.

The first strategy comprises four contractual modes of market entry. The first contractual mode is exporting which refers to business activities where goods and/or services are sold outside the country in which the major value-added activities took place. The second mode is licensing which describes contractual transactions in which the owner of knowledge-based resource assets sells to another organization or individual the right to use these intangible resources for a defined purpose. The third mode is franchising which is a contractual agreement between a franchisor and usually many franchisees that are legally and financially separated. The franchisor sells to the franchisees the right to commercialize goods or services under the franchisor’s established brand name and a proven business concept. The fourth mode is the turnkey project which is defined as a market entry mode where a firm sells complete operations and supply- and distribution-chain services. Market entry through a turnkey project usually includes the start-up of operations and the necessary training qualifications and consulting with local personnel; the firm then turns the key over to the local government in return for an agreed-upon payment-of-use fee.The second foreign market entry strategy comprises two main co-operative modes of market entry. The first mode is the business alliance which refers to agreements between two or more participating organizations that target long-term business objectives. The second mode is the joint venture which refers to a business arrangement in which two or more legally distinct firms decide to own and control a common business.The third foreign market entry strategy comprises mainly two hierarchical modes of market entry. The first mode is acquisition a corporate action in which one company buys most if not all of another firm’s ownership stakes to assume control of the firm. The second mode is a greenfield project which is a type of foreign direct investment whereby a parent company builds an entirely new organization in a foreign country (i.e. a foreign start-up).Source: Mario Glowik Market Entry Strategies: Internationalization Theories Concepts and Cases of Asian High-Technology Firms (Berlin: De Gruyter Oldenbourg 2016) 156 164 166 169 172 193 194.",1,ASIAN,EASTERN ASIA,MAN,0

In 2008 Fastenal pioneered the concept of industrial vending machines which helped its clients reduce their supplies costs by 40 per cent. In 2015 Fastenal was ranked 44th on Forbes’ list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies and in January 2017 it was ranked 10th on Industrial Distribution’s Big 50 List. In Minnesota Fastenal was one of the 20 largest public companies with a total employee strength of 19624 and revenue of US$3.96 billion by the end of 2016 (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Fastenal was also known for providing the best customer service in the industrial supply sector. Fastenal’s employees believed that one of the key drivers of the company’s success was their decentralized and empowering organizational culture in which employees close to customers made decisions. These features helped Fastenal become one of the rare companies to leap from 100th position on Harvard Business Review’s 2014 list of the Best-Performing CEOs in the World to 33rd position on the 2015 list. Although Fastenal enjoyed a high profit margin and different awards its competitive edge was threatened when Amazon Business entered the industrial supply business in 2012. Amazon Business’s impact on Fastenal was visible when within two years of its entry Fastenal’s performance began to decline. The announcement of Amazon Business’s inception itself reduced Fastenal’s share price by 15.76 per cent. Further Fastenal had not reported any significant increase in its gross profit or operating income as a percentage of sales since 2014. Growth in earnings per share was also in decline (see Exhibit 2). Competition became even more challenging when in May 2017 Amazon Business pioneered a supply chain innovation and applied for patents for aerial drones.Did Fastenal have any competitive advantage over Amazon Business or was its survival likely to be threatened by Amazon Business? What strategies should Fastenal take to contend with Amazon Business: should it focus on differentiation to outpace the competitive threat posed by Amazon Business or resort to a price war through a strategy of low costs to save its market? Would Fastenal be able to regain its growth trajectory given the competition from a dominant player like Amazon Business?BackgroundIn 1967 Bob Kierlin along with four of his friends pooled $30000 to open the first Fastenal store located in Winona Minnesota. Initially Fastenal mainly supplied fasteners such as nuts bolts and screws. Their first retail store was 1000 square feet (93 square metres). From Fastenal’s beginning Kierlin advocated the motto of “Growth through Customer Service” which guided employees in working closely with Fastenal’s clients to keep them supplied with what they needed and drive clients’ business improvement. The company’s website proclaimed “We don’t just make a sale—we align with our customers to make them more successful.” Kierlin already had experience working in a hardware store. He had observed that many customers came to Fastenal for simple products like nuts and bolts and in 1967 thought of making these simple products available through vending machines. However Kierlin soon realized that this was an expensive proposition and much ahead of its time.Nevertheless the business gradually flourished. In 1987 the company launched its initial public offering making Fastenal a listed company. In 1994 Fastenal took its first step toward internationalization opening stores in Canada. By 2001 Fastenal had also expanded to Mexico and Singapore. By 2008 with its continuous growth effort Fastenal was incorporated in the S&P 500 Index. By the end of 2016 it had 2503 stores across 21 countries although most of Fastenal’s revenue came from the United States (see Exhibit 3). During this time Fastenal also paid special attention to human capital development and in 1999 launched the Fastenal School of Business for company employees. Product lines and performance driversFastenal’s business had two components: industrial production and maintenance. The industrial production business supplied nuts and bolts screws and studs which were used as components of products manufactured by its industrial clients. Fastenal referred to the industrial production business as original equipment manufacturing (OEM). Fastenal offered a total of 12 product categories under its OEM business (see Exhibit 4). Fastenal’s maintenance business was known as the maintenance repair and operations (MRO) business. It focused on different client service-related needs providing after sales services and solutions ranging from simple tool repairs to complex engineering support. Fastenal attributed its success largely to its wide variety of product lines. The company’s 2016 annual report stated “We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products and services from convenient locations as well as to the high quality of our employees.” In 2016 the MRO business contributed 63 per cent of Fastenal’s total revenues.Fastenal’s manufacturing plants were placed in nine locations including Minnesota California and Indianapolis and fulfilled 70000 orders every year with each job customized for an individual customer. Fastenal had 14 distribution centres 11 of them in the United States serving 2452 stores in North America and an additional 51 stores outside of North America. Fastenal also had more than 6000 fully owned delivery vehicles. Its national call centre took care of all customer queries including hardware and software issues. Each of the Fastenal stores provided customized inventory to its clients and had a high rate of same day service. Fastenal sold to industrial customers through multiple channels including retail stores onsite vending machines and its website Fastenal.com. For certain product lines like metal cutting tools and blades Fastenal was itself dependent on suppliers. However the maximum inventory that Fastenal purchased from a single supplier was no more than 5 per cent.CompetitionFastenal had the highest profit and operating margin among leading competitors in the industry (see Exhibit 5). The company’s major competitors included W. W. Grainger Inc. MSC Industrial Direct Co. and HD Supply Inc. All other companies were fragmented in the industry. Fastenal had four times as many stores as any of its competitors. Fastenal also opened more than 60 new stores every year until the end of 2015 (see Exhibit 4). By the end of 2016 Fastenal had more than 2500 stores globally compared to the 598 stores of W. W. Grainger one of its closest competitors. One of the key reasons for Fastenal’s higher profitability was the location of its stores which were always near the distribution centres. Fastenal’s broad market coverage with more stores than competitors and a completely owned distribution network including trucks and other logistics-related supplies gave Fastenal a competitive advantage. The capital required for such a distribution network deterred other players from competing (see Exhibit 2).FAST—Disruptive innovation In 2008 Fastenal launched its industrial vending system Fastenal Automated Supply Technology (FAST) with huge success. The Fastenal vending system was an Internet-connected appliance integrated with vending technology installed at the client’s end. Fastenal provided two versions of the vending machine: FAST 3000 and FAST 5000. These machines had similar functions but FAST 3000 was physically smaller. The vending machine’s integrated video management display resembled that of any snack vending machine although the machine’s software was more complicated. The cloud-based software recorded every transaction allowing a client’s employees access to materials depending on their roles and needs. Employees needed to swipe their identification card or enter an access code to withdraw an item from the vending machine. The vending machine’s software allowed a manager to track all stock outflows and the employees taking the stock which helped to prevent misuse of supplies. When the vending machine ran low on certain items Fastenal’s local store received an automatic notification so that a Fastenal employee could fill the machine thereby eliminating the cost of stockouts and paper work. Fastenal’s industrial vending service was beneficial for both a client’s employees and the client itself. Employees were able to retrieve products themselves which was especially useful for those working night shift; normally they would have to wait for a supervisor on the next day. As a result employees could ensure timely maintenance work. The client was able to save costs by closely monitoring inventory and having replenishment orders placed automatically. The automated vending machines helped Fastenal clients reduce their supply consumption by 40–50 per cent.The vending machines were not standardized; they were customized for each company usually based on the client’s industry type. Thus a vending machine for a client in the plastic industry was different from a machine for a client in the construction industry. Fastenal searched for industry-specific information to select supply items 50 per cent of which would usually be safety-related such as safety glasses or gloves. The remaining supplies included MRO items such as duct tape batteries or utility blades. For items that were heavy and could not fit in the regular vending machines such as hard hats power tools or aerosol cans Fastenal provided its clients with FAST Auto Lockers which gave controlled access to employees for these heavy items. The entire industrial vending system was supported by a network of employees including a local sales force machine re-stockers and regional sales support which involved fleets of vans to deliver machines and trained FAST specialists to give hands-on demonstrations to Fastenal’s industrial clients. Fastenal also had a national distribution and transportation system. The industrial vending machines reaped positive results for Fastenal. Their revenues grew significantly from $2 billion in 2010 to $3.96 billion in 2016. Acceptance of the technology was initially low; just 7000 customers used the company’s vending machines by 2011. But by 2014 there were more than 46000 clients opting for the industrial vending solutions. Industrial vending then became a core part of Fastenal’s business and one of its major growth drivers. In 2017 Fastenal reported that 62825 vending machines were being used by clients across the United States (see Exhibit 1). By the first quarter of 2017 Fastenal’s growth rate in sales through the vending machines outpaced the company’s total sales growth.Investment in Human capitalFastenal took a bottom-up approach to management. The company believed that employees could make good decisions if they were invested with good training and decision-making skills. Fastenal believed that its success was based on recruiting smart candidates training them well and working on their competencies. This was important according to Fastenal because the employees worked most closely with clients. Will Oberton a previous Fastenal chief executive officer (CEO) explained: “The closer to the customer the decision is made the more successful we will be.” Employees understood not only Fastenal as a brand but also its mission. The company created an environment that encouraged employees to be authentic and reliable.In 2005 Fastenal started a sponsorship program as a step to fill demand for skilled computer numeric controlled (CNC) machinists. According to Daryl Bergen a trainer and recruiter at Fastenal “Fastenal has a huge demand for skilled CNC machinists but there are not enough skilled applicants to fill the gap.” He further emphasized “It’s not something you can walk off the street and [learn].” Fastenal offered sponsorship programs for which it selected 10 candidates each year to attend a full-time program in CNC at Southeast Technical Institute in Sioux Falls South Dakota. If these candidates graduated with a GPA of 3.0 or higher they were offered a full-time job with Fastenal and were further reimbursed 25 per cent of their tuition fees and book costs. Fastenal also launched the Fastenal School of Business focused on imparting industry and company-specific business skills to its employees. Graduates from this school were in demand among the company’s competitors.Trained Fastenal employees were able to map inventory consumption processes at clients’ locations and suggest means to reduce operational costs. Cory Jansen executive vice president of operations at Fastenal commented:Our inventory management specialists will work with [our client’s] personnel to map how product flows through [their] current system and identify areas where operational costs can be reduced or eliminated. We will uncover hidden sources of supply chain waste to provide total cost-savings solutions. Fastenal’s efforts paid off not only with recruitment but also with employee retention. Fastenal provided other incentives as well to its employees. As a part of its internal marketing campaign in 2013 Fastenal held a competition for its employees; the winner received a sponsored trip to the NASCAR Sprint Series Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway as a guest of Roush Racing. More than 50 per cent of Fastenal employees participated in this competition.Most Fastenal employees also felt that one of the critical elements that helped the business grow from a small fastener shop to a dynamic innovative company was the corporate culture which was deeply committed to training employees and empowering them to make decisions. In 2015 alone Fastenal employees completed 478000 hours of training courses both online and instructor-led. Further Fastenal followed a policy of promoting employees from within the company; approximately 95 per cent of Fastenal employees had been promoted from within the company. Most senior level positions were filled with employees who had started their careers at very junior positions with Fastenal.Marketing and Customer SupportCustomers and vendors were equally important to Fastenal and the company made efforts to bring both together at an annual event that was usually hosted at Fastenal’s main distribution centre in Indianapolis Indiana. Customers across the globe were brought in for the event and were also encouraged to participate and educate themselves with relevant ideas to obtain a clearer picture of the services and products that Fastenal could provide. The launch of Fastenal’s vending machines took place at the annual customer expo in 2008. At that time industrial vending was a niche technology because both the machine and the labour costs needed to maintain them were high. However Fastenal was able to provide machines and lockers at a much lower cost as a part of its inventory management solution for its customers. Fastenal’s chief operation officer Lee Hein viewed the concept of an industrial vending machine as the perfect solution for Fastenal customers. He noted:From the beginning we saw vending as an investment in our customers—a way to solidify relationships and earn opportunities by providing tremendous value in terms of time and cost savings. It’s been a perfect fit for our local service model bringing our store teams and products even closer to our customers. Fastenal also advertised on social media and had an in-house design team that worked on signs and displays.Fastenal’s programs and products offered several benefits to its customers. First Fastenal made available a lower cost solution through vendor consolidation and value-added services. Second Fastenal offered customized product stocking. Third and most important its customer management philosophy emphasized a trusted relationship with customers. As one of Fastenal’s clients John Leech from Terex Advance Mixer Inc. declared “We need trusted suppliers like Fastenal.” Fastenal’s inventory management solution offered fast lead times and zero stockouts. The custom manufacturing division of Fastenal ran 24 hours a day 7 days a week to meet customers’ needs at any time. Fastenal also ensured quality with 100 per cent traceability of materials and in-process testing. Fastenal automated as many processes as possible for smooth handling of business documents while also maintaining local personal relationships with customers as required. Fastenal provided industrial customers with a single source for fasteners and related equipment needs such as HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) plumbing lighting and cleaning products. By virtue of its convenient store and industrial vending system Fastenal was able to quickly meet the emergency needs of clients as well as regularly stock inventory through its stocking program. To further smooth the customer experience Fastenal did not rely on a third-party transportation system for distribution as other national industrial suppliers did. This helped Fastenal maintain quick onsite recovery efforts. All of these practices resulted in the growth of a loyal customer base with 63 per cent of Fastenal’s business coming from repeat customers.Challenges and the Road AheadFastenal had a history of exponential growth but that growth was challenged as Fastenal saturated many of its markets. Further competition increased as other well-established players such as The Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Home Improvement began encroaching on Fastenal’s market. Fastenal also needed to worry about the growth in e-commerce sales. The business to business e-commerce trade in the United States was expected to achieve record sales of $1.1 trillion by 2019 accounting for about 12 per cent of total business to business sales which would be twice the business to consumer e-commerce sales of $480 billion. The market research firm Forrester Research Inc. predicted that by the end of 2017 56 per cent of the business to business buyers in the United States would make more than half of their purchases online compared to 30 per cent in 2014.Since 2012 the online space for industrial supply equipment had become more competitive and challenging with the onset of Amazon Business which targeted industrial companies and offered more than 500000 industrial products. At the time of Amazon Business’s launch in 2012 Fastenal’s share prices declined by 15.76 per cent. Other leading players also reported a decline in share prices; for example W. W. Grainger’s shares declined by 11.21 per cent. Although Fastenal was an S&P 500 company there had been a wide gap between its stock market performance and the performance of other S&P 500 companies since 2012. Investors began wondering whether established brick and mortar industrial suppliers like Fastenal were set to lose competition to giant online wholesalers like Amazon Business. By 2014 Amazon Business surpassed W. W. Grainger with sales of 2.2 million products compared to W. W. Grainger’s 1.2 million. By 2016 Amazon Business was servicing more than 400000 U.S. businesses generating sales of $1 billion from April 2015 to April 2016. However traditional industrial suppliers believed that since the industry was fragmented with thousands of small- and medium-sized distributors big wholesalers could co-exist with online wholesaler giants like Amazon Business. As a key player in online commerce Amazon Business’s growth plan was aggressive. It did not want to capture just the U.S. market; it wanted to capture industrial customers globally. By June 2012 it had already started shipping industrial supplies to more than 50 countries. By then Amazon Business was operating in countries like Germany the United Kingdom and India. As well Amazon Business also provided a 365-day return policy free 2-day shipping corporate credit and low prices all of which resulted in superior customer service. Industrial supply clients felt that Amazon Business could be a major threat for traditional industrial suppliers. The purchasing manager of a global plumbing products manufacturer commented:If Amazon promoted their site actively and correctly they could change the industry. I definitely think they are a threat to the traditional online trade sites like Grainger and McMaster. I could definitely see Amazon as a threat to Fastenal especially on the fastener side. Previously experts believed that traditional industrial suppliers could leverage their existing customer relationships greater product expertise and deep understanding of customers to successfully compete with Amazon Business. According to Brian Strojny CEO of Insite Software Amazon Business was struggling in terms of expertise product knowledge and assortment and establishing relationships with clients. He further explained “Leveraging each of these advantages will set the independent wholesaler and distributor head and shoulders above the low prices of [Amazon Business].” However Acquity Group an e-commerce and digital marketing company disagreed. According to a study the company conducted in 2013 industrial customers would opt for the supplier that offered the lowest prices rather than remaining loyal to their old suppliers.In 2014 Amazon Business began investing in aerial drones to make delivery possible within a couple of hours of receiving an order. In May 2017 the company received a patent for its drone delivery system which involved shipping the material with an inbuilt parachute allowing the package to be dropped from an aerial vehicle and land at a destination without any damage. Drones would be equipped with a global positioning system cell phones and cameras with sensors which would help in the monitoring and delivery of packages. With aerial delivery Amazon Business not only challenged traditional retailers with its online purchase model but also challenged their delivery model. This was a threat to Fastenal’s entire logistics set-up because the company fully owned its distribution network and did not rely on a third-party distributor.Fastenal however maintained its focus on industrial vending machines. It believed that the market could sustain approximately 1.7 million industrial vending machines. Despite competition from Amazon Business since 2012 Fastenal reported constant growth in revenues from the industrial vending system. Reflecting its strong reliance on industrial vending machines the CEO wrote in Fastenal’s 2016 annual report: We believe industrial vending is an important chapter in the Fastenal story; we also believe it will continue to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a “first mover” advantage. Given this we have continued investing aggressively to maximize the advantage. However for its industrial vending software and hardware components Fastenal relied on only one vendor which had the capability to supply the same vending machine components to Fastenal’s competitors. It was also uncertain whether Fastenal’s industrial vending machines would be able to compete with Amazon Business’s proposed aerial drone delivery system. Although Fastenal opened 40 new stores globally in 2016 it had also closed 159 stores. In fact from 2014 to 2016 Fastenal closed 142 stores in the United States alone. According to Fastenal’s chief financial officer Holden Lewis:Where it makes sense to open some stores we’ll open and where it makes sense to close we’ll close. . . . In the past we’ve talked about store openings and they’ve historically been a significant growth driver. Now those stores are foundational and our significant growth drivers are Fastenal Onsite and vending. Growth has evolved away from stores to other drivers although Fastenal is still a store-based model.Additionally research by a reputed U.S. marketing research firm Forrester indicated that by the end of 2017 approximately 56 per cent of industrial customers in the United States were likely to make more than 50 per cent of their purchases online. Critics believed that with Forrester’s prediction of growth in online sales for industrial customers and Amazon Business’s power of low costs Amazon Business could change the industry structure of the wholesale industrial supply business just as it had revolutionized the retail market. Could Amazon Business disrupt the industrial supply component sector? Was an industry leader like Fastenal likely to be adversely affected by competition from an online giant like Amazon Business? If so how should Fastenal respond to competition: should it opt for a low price or a differentiation strategy to save its market share?EXHIBIT 1: FASTENAL—NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES STORES AND INDUSTRIAL VENDING MACHINES (INSTALLED) 2011–2016Source: Developed by the authors based on Fastenal Company “Form 10-K for the Period Ending December 31 2013” EDGAR Online February 6 2014 accessed April 14 2017 http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/FAST/4661898678x0xS815556-14-16/815556/filing.pdf; Fastenal Company “Form 10-K for the Period Ending December 31 2016” EDGAR online February 6 2017 accessed April 14 2017 http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/FAST/4661898678x0xS815556-17-9/815556/filing.pdf; Mike Baker “Fastenal’s Struggles Continue Relative to Past Performance” CGS Industry News April 28 2016 accessed May 16 2017 http://newsroom.chainstoreguide.com/2016/04/fastenals-struggles-continue-relative-to-past-performance.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-03Wilson Yuen the chief executive officer of OpenSky.tv (OpenSky) founded the company in 2016. In October 2017 he had to make an important decision. Should he help scale up his company’s business by continuing to offer free services in Hong Kong? How could he achieve his initial objective of creating a business-to-consumer (B2C) recommendation platform?Yuen’s idea had come about two years earlier when he shared his thoughts and plans with a colleague:I discussed with a friend who had recently resigned from his management position at a television broadcasting company. My friend’s expertise was in the television industry while my experience was in developing video-related technologies. So the discussion triggered us to develop a B2C recommendation platform.Yuen summed up what OpenSky was trying to achieve and his vision for the future of the television industry: We wanted to bring people back to consuming video content on television with personalized content in their own channel and OpenSky understood. All they needed was a single on/off button in the device for them to watch videos across various platforms such as TV broadcasters Facebook or YouTube.OpenSky combined AI (artificial intelligence) and user-experience design to offer a recommendation platform for a wide range of quality video content including dining art architecture tourism and culture. The platform analyzed each user’s behaviour and curated a personalized experience for the viewer. OpenSky aimed to drive more television programming consumption and disrupt the industry with machine-learning intelligence and human curation supported by video content creation and amplified by commercialization. By October 2017 OpenSky had more than 3000 hours of video programs from Hong Kong Japan South Korea Taiwan Singapore Malaysia the United Kingdom France Germany Austria Spain Switzerland the Netherlands the United States Canada and Australia. COMPANY BACKGROUNDYuen had taught at various universities in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2013 including the City University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. In 2010 noting the extreme popularity of online video Yuen founded TFI Digital Media Limited (TFI). The “TFI” in the company name referred to its slogan: “Technology. Fun. Innovation.” The company’s mission was to “bring content culture and people together.” TFI leveraged its patented technology for video encoding to offer live streaming and over-the-top technology which allowed businesses to deliver video content across the world. By November 2017 TFI had 30 full-time employees with branch offices in Hong Kong Taiwan China and the United States serving over 4 million devices in 25 countries. After Yuen founded OpenSky in 2016 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of TFI (see Exhibit 1). OPPORTUNITYOnline video consumption became widespread with the increased bandwidth that fourth-generation (4G) technology provided on mobile and Wi-Fi networks. As well cloud infrastructure continued to improve at a rapid pace while content production costs continued to drop. High definition videos could be captured through smartphone cameras. A user could create video content and instantly broadcast the video to a global audience. Video production and sharing proliferated throughout the Internet and continued to grow with experts forecasting that 74 per cent of all Internet traffic in 2017 could be in video format.Online video viewing across the globe was expected to increase by about 20 per cent in 2017 with people spending an average of 47.4 minutes per day viewing online video. Spending on online video was projected to account for 31 per cent of total digital display advertising expenses by 2019. This figure was an increase from 28 per cent in 2017. In Hong Kong spending on online video content was the largest segment at 22.9 per cent with the highest growth being recorded in the period 2016–2021. In comparison spending on online advertising was 10.2 per cent and spending on video games was 6.6 per cent.Yuen summarized his reasons behind choosing to move from a business-to-business (B2B) technology provider to a B2C video content recommendation platform:TV programs were becoming less costly to be replaced by short videos driven by a few factors: (1) technological advancements (2) reduced prices of production equipment and (3) increase in video sharing platforms. We were entering a new era in which quality production could be achieved while immense popularity could be gained through the viral effect of social media. We expected that more and more videos with differentiated contents would be created due to the social atmosphere and thus we aimed to build a recommendation platform. The platform helped audiences navigate through the sea of video content analyzing their interests and choosing and prioritizing the most suitable video content. The platform had to be localized for targeted geographical regions in order to align with local culture.Yuen claimed that the decision to move from a B2B technology provider to a B2C video content recommendation platform would generate various key advantages for his venture: We had technological strength and were experienced in working with content providers on both technical and business workflows in all cases. We understood how to minimize their workload and allowed them to focus on producing quality video content. In such cases they had no need to worry about promotion marketing and other operational mechanics. The foreseeable trend on video sharing in our case derived the B2C business model of OpenSky. The goal of OpenSky was to achieve “automation.” Only three pieces of information were required when uploading videos to OpenSky: (1) authorization of access rights for certain countries (2) age range of target audience and (3) the category. And based on the latest trends and social issues we OpenSky produced recommendations to users in a humanized approach rather than a rigid engine with no comprehension of user desires. YouTube’s recommendation engine could achieve similar outcomes. However premium content providers could gain little merit from this practice having challenges in monetizing and building their own brand case.CONSUMER PAIN POINT AND SOLUTIONTraditional television did not allow audiences to create their own channels or to recommend personalized video content to fellow viewers. Yuen realized that viewers would find it difficult to locate their preferred video content among the millions of options available at any moment under any category so he worked to address this issue:OpenSky aimed to mitigate consumers’ pain point of knowing where to find content and what to watch. We helped viewers find the videos they were looking for and recommended the right video cases to viewers. TFI had the technology and experience in establishing OTT [over-the-top] platforms.Yuen explained how OpenSky would address the viewer’s frustration and make the process more efficient:It [OpenSky] helped users formulate their personal channel by human curation and AI. Users could also watch others’ personalized channels. Ultimately each user had an individual list of video contents compiled by AI combined with recommendations from friends and celebrities they follow.BUSINESS MODEL: CREATION CURATION CONSUMPTION COMMERCIALIZATIONOpenSky functioned as a video viewing guide and used AI and human curation to recommend videos aimed at people aged 25–40. Since its launch in December 2016 OpenSky had registered 43000 video downloads by October 2017. Yuen developed OpenSky’s creation curation consumption and commercialization (4C) model to create and distribute its content to the market.How the 4C Model WorkedCreationOpenSky would license videos from external content providers and individual producers through a revenue sharing model.CurationThe company would then collaborate with television experts from the theatre and music industries to produce curated content. For example popular television personality Stephen Chan theatre star Olivia Yan and music producer Terence Lam were considered as hosts for OpenSky content. Their influences would reach a wide range of target customers across different age ranges from teenagers to mature adults.ConsumptionOpenSky’s viewership would be measured according to the number of content downloads from the platform advertising volume and membership subscriptions among other indicators.CommercializationOpenSky expected to generate revenue from four different sources of income: advertising subscriptions to its video recommendation service subscriptions to its recommended videos (revenue shared with content providers) and the provision of its curation services (see Exhibit 2).OpenSky enriched its video content by curation. The company would regularly create new themes and then actively provide related videos for that theme from three main sources: videos produced in-house videos licensed from content providers and videos created by contracted producers under a specific theme. According to Yuen the various themes were set based on a particular strategy:The frequency of changing the theme would be based on the resources and the latest trends; for instance the theme of Andy Lau’s movie when the Hong Kong Film Awards were approaching or the theme of boxing when Rex Tso won his [boxing match].The 4C Model and Boxing OpenSky live-streamed major events to great success. On October 7 2017 it aired the Clash of Champions 3 boxing event featuring Hong Kong superstar boxer Rex Tso. In the process of airing the Rex Tso boxing match OpenSky followed the 4C model to create and distribute the content to viewers.CreationThe broadcasting service filmed the boxing match and asked several boxing trainers to upload videos featuring boxing training footage.CurationOpenSky hosted interviews with boxing athletes and coaches on the sport of boxing which viewers could access through a search of relevant programs for that theme.ConsumptionViewers downloaded the OpenSky mobile application (app) and were able to watch online live streaming of the boxing match as well as related videos available on the platform.CommercializationAfter watching the boxing match featuring superstar boxer Rex Tso many viewers would have a renewed interest in joining boxing classes or purchasing merchandise from the boxing event to enrich their experience.Yuen hoped to encourage Hong Kong viewers to watch more videos. He wanted to revolutionize the television industry and increase demand for video recommendations which was the main business driver for OpenSky. To boost traffic OpenSky looked for business partners from the traditional television industry. Broadcasters had a wealth of video but they were unsure how to provide the content to an interested audience. OpenSky’s recommendation service was the perfect complement to meet the needs of traditional television broadcasters.Yuen explained how OpenSky was changing the way video was delivered to viewers:[Major] events like the Rex Tso boxing event were only broadcast on television or radio programs in the past. Consumers now had a choice with OpenSky. This was the value we provided to customers: premium public and local. Further we could also introduce them to videos which were behind the scenes other comparable boxing events/facilities/courses—anything that might interest audiences. This gave all around consumption and facilitated participation in boxing-related events and tasks. It perfectly fit into the 4C model of content creation curation consumption and commercialization.In addition to airing major events OpenSky also used media outlets such as Facebook radio programs and newspapers to create awareness for its service which was becoming more and more available to viewers. OpenSky struck a partnership with Samsung’s Smart TV to deliver a seamless experience to Smart TV subscribers. Audiences could bookmark and preview video content on their mobile phones and later enrich their experience at home by using the OpenSky app on their Smart TV. This partnership was intended as a marketing plan to boost the number of OpenSky app downloads (see Exhibit 3). BUSINESS MODEL—REVENUE STREAMSOpenSky adopted various methods to stimulate and generate revenue from different sources including advertising brand and product placement sponsorships subscriptions transactional video on demand and subscription video on demand (SVOD). Each method was intended to reach a different occasion and viewer. To be viable advertising required a large audience in terms of online viewer traffic. Pay-per-view was suited to one-time content such as movies. Subscription models needed content with appeal to a niche segment. To accommodate the various different revenue models and consumer needs OpenSky licensed content created its own content and brought together content from providers with viewers using various profit sharing models. OpenSky helped video content owners distribute and monetize their videos. Content creation was becoming the company’s largest area of expenditure accounting for approximately two-thirds of all aggregated costs. Therefore OpenSky decided to partner with independent content creators to reduce fixed costs. However building awareness about its service and generating demand could become the major source of expenses. For example OpenSky’s expense breakdown for the period between July 1 2017 and October 31 2017 was as follows: platform development 51 per cent; content 30 per cent; marketing 16 per cent; and miscellaneous 3 per cent.Among its revenue streams Yuen saw two major sources of revenue as the key areas for OpenSky: its current business customers and new individual consumers. Yuen had some ideas on how to retain current customers:Present customers of TFI had requested us to help develop over-the-top video platforms. However here came a dilemma: as content providers we were not motivated to commit upfront investments in developing online platform and promotion while technology companies charged for the services. With OpenSky producers could upload their videos for free and monetize the content from viewers through a revenue sharing model.Yuen also had some ideas on the recruitment and retention of new individual consumers:Videos were divided into two categories: free and SVOD. Consumers cared less about the prices. They looked for a service provider who could provide what they wanted as soon as they had a need. OpenSky would not offer all the videos in the world but we acted as the medium between quality video content and the public in order to change Hong Kong people’s viewing habits. For instance nowadays the general public would search various keywords of the contents in Google versus reaching the official website directly. We would like the public to search for videos through OpenSky. We could also help promote events and live stream the events. The important value of OpenSky for customers was to provide the widest range of a variety of videos they were interested in in a timely manner.Yuen also had some ideas on making the subscription model more effective:At first only subscribed and paid users could use our platform. What we wanted to achieve was how to facilitate users to only pay for the services they found worthy. Trailers with hooking punchlines were an option to attract users to pay for the claimed service.I was confident that OpenSky was an innovative business model because I really believed in my gut feeling as I was sensitive to the trends and development potential in the digital world. My colleagues could provide more objective insights with evidence and cases from market research.When asked if he had considered how much consumers would be willing to pay for the service Yuen said “We are still establishing the pricing level the time to start our subscription model and when to increase prices.”As a platform that facilitated video consumption Yuen did not see any direct competitors to OpenSky. In fact he thought there was great potential for collaboration among other types of service and content providers (see Exhibit 4). WHAT SHOULD THE BUSINESS MODEL BE?One full year after OpenSky had been launched Yuen reflected on the platform’s future:We would like to focus on the Cantonese market first and next the Mandarin and English audiences. We got some video content ready for the South East Asia markets and we are actively working with a potential partner in the Guangdong province of China to enable OpenSky to expand its geographical footprint. . . . If we can capture the Cantonese market we can do the same for any other market. I hope our kids will still watch television in 20 years’ time apart from YouTube.In terms of social contribution Yuen planned to give back to the technology industry in Hong Kong hoping to create an open and supportive environment for technology companies in Hong Kong. We would like to build trust among consumers through OpenSky. We could extend live streaming to many other events like Cantonese opera shows for the elderly who are unable to go on site for whatever reasons. We could contribute back to the public via our platform and technology.Yuen had resolved many issues. However how to make his pet project of creating a B2C recommendation platform grow into a major force in the industry was his most pressing concern at the moment.

Over the past five years Diglot Capital Management has given me numerous opportunities to grow and enhance my skills. It is a great company and I truly enjoyed working here. However I am scared to go in to work. I am having problems sleeping and my family is worried about me. I hope you will understand my situation when I say that I was forced to look for other opportunities due to the unexplained sequence of events happening on the company premises over the past few weeks. Thank you.On July 11 2016 Sanjay Shinde a vice-president at Diglot Capital Management (DCM) read the resignation letter with regret. The employee who had resigned was a valued worker. She had a good relationship with her manager and peers. The problem she had alluded to in her resignation letter was her belief that the workplace was haunted. This belief had led to feelings of ill omens and concerns for her safety that eventually culminated in her resignation. Attrition was not the only problem in the DCM office in Bangalore India; Shinde observed that there had been a spike in the number of unscheduled leaves leading to a drop in productivity. Shinde was concerned that at this rate he would continue to lose staff and eventually fail to meet the annual service level agreements with the company’s U.S.-based clients.DIGLOT CAPITAL MANAGEMENTDCM a consumer financial services company was headquartered in New York. DCM was a wholly owned subsidy of Diglot Capital Bank which offered credit services linked to customer accounts (see Exhibit 1). DCM’s clients were e-commerce companies retail outlets grocery stores airlines and other large-scale corporations. DCM had a set of elite clients including several Fortune 500 companies. These client companies provided their customers with store credit cards. The credit cards were linked to the DCM bank and were useful for offering rewards cash back store discounts and other benefits to the consumer. Besides credit DCM offered loyalty programs capital management services and customer service. Customers of DCM’s clients the Fortune 500 companies used the DCM store credit card and contacted DCM customer service for queries regarding sales claims and other membership services. In 2016 about four-fifths of the world’s 500 largest companies already outsourced customer service work to India. This was known as business process outsourcing (BPO). Outsourcing customer service work to Asia’s third-largest economy—India—could typically generate cost savings for a company of between 35 and 50 per cent. A large portion of the population in India and other Asian countries was well versed in English. DCM had set up its offshore customer service centre in Bangalore India where calls were routed from the United States. BPO INDUSTRY IN INDIAWith more than a 50-per-cent share of the total global offshoring industry India had witnessed rapid growth in demand for its BPO services. In 2012 the offshoring industry in India stood at US$23 billion. In 2014 a research firm in Pune India projected the Indian BPO offshoring industry to become a US$40-billion industry by 2017. Seventy per cent of the revenue of India’s BPO industry was from call centres 20 per cent from data entry work and the remaining 10 per cent from information technology-related work. The voice-based processes or call centres offered real-time resolutions. Proficiency in English was the only hard skill required for most voice-based customer service positions as an advanced degree was not required. Since the BPO industry was growing there was a boom in the BPO job market for young adults both men and women (aged 18–30 years) who could speak English. The BPO customer service representative position was a lucrative option for many people who were in need of immediate financial support.In 2009 about 3.5 million people in India graduated with an undergraduate degree. The BPO sector employed about 700000 people in 2008; according to a study conducted by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) by 2012 that number had increased to 2 million. Cosmopolitan cities in India such as Delhi Mumbai Hyderabad Bangalore and Pune were famous for their educational institutes that produced many English-speaking graduates. Further these cities also had good infrastructure and a business-friendly atmosphere making them a popular destination for BPO activities and call centres.The growth of BPOs was not without its downside. In 2015 two professors in India published a study on the attrition of employees in Indian BPOs. As per the findings of the study the major reasons influencing employees to quit were low career prospects better remuneration at other firms stressful lifestyles and unsatisfying interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Additionally to adjust to the time zone differences between the United States and Asia most of the working hours were from the evening through to the early morning. Sedentary lifestyles and sleep disruptions coupled with work pressure greatly increased the stress levels of employees. This took a toll on their health in the long run and was a major reason for the high attrition rate in the BPO industry despite the income and freedom offered by positions in the industry. In 2014 the average rate of attrition in the BPO sector in India was 28 per cent. Due to the high turnover there was a skill gap that increased the need for training in the sector. High investment in training together with the high attrition rate posed a challenge for the BPO industry. The average attrition rate reported by DCM in India for 2015 was about 40 per cent. Like its competitors DCM was always on the lookout for good talent while constantly seeking ways to improve its management practices and engage people thereby reducing attrition. DCM IN INDIADCM had 1700 employees in Bangalore. The major operating processes in the company were sales capital collections risk management and the claims resolution process besides support functions such as human resources finance and workforce management (see Exhibit 2). Shinde was vice-president operations of the sales capital process whose major functions included telemarketing cross-selling managing customer accounts and other forms of telephone customer services (see Exhibit 3). Like other call centres in India that were aligned with U.S. operations employees at DCM India were required to work at night. Sales capital had 300 customer services representatives that worked in multiple shifts to provide appropriate coverage.Since the parent company of operations was in the United States many human resource policies at DCM India were adopted from the policies and practices of DCM in the United States. For instance DCM India followed the principle of fair employment practices that was tied to the Equal Employment Opportunity principle of Title VII of the American Civil Rights Act. As per fair employment practices all employees of DCM India had to be treated fairly and were not to be discriminated against on the basis of race skin colour religion sex or national origin. However to attain cultural alignment with Indian operations policies such as the dress code policy employee benefits vacation and paid leave among others often differed from the parent company in the United States. India was the birthplace of Hinduism Buddhism Jainism and Sikhism; besides these religions people in India practiced Christianity and Islam. This cultural diversity was also evident at DCM where common Hindu rituals such as lighting a diya and wearing a tikka and Christian traditions such as singing Christmas carols were observed and work schedules were adjusted during Ramadan and other events. SHINDE’S LEADERSHIPShinde had worked with DCM since 1999. He had joined as an operations manager and became vice-president of Operations in 2006. Shinde believed in an open-door managerial approach and regularly conducted meetings with the customer service representatives. He knew that like any other BPO in India attrition had been a constant challenge for DCM. Shinde used different sources to effectively detect issues that might affect productivity. The higher pay along with better management employee engagement practices and benefits offered by other companies were among the reasons cited by employees when they quit DCM. One employee even stated in his exit interview that he was leaving because the other company had a better cafeteria. But over the past 16 years Shinde had never encountered a situation quite like this one: employees were leaving because of the presence of ghosts in the company. HOW IT ALL BEGANShinde reflected back on the time he met the new-hire training group in early April 2016. He faintly remembered meeting Julie Rani as she had been wearing a large necklace that said “Jesus Loves All.” As the training progressed the trainer Madhu Das complained that Rani was inattentive—she would look scared or suddenly start crying. Das had asked her “What is the matter Julie? Is everything alright?”Rani had replied “I see a demon there. He wants me to get up and stand near the wall.” Rani pointed to a corner of the training room. Das saw nobody standing in the corner and told Rani to calm down.The frequency of such incidents increased over time. Rani’s behaviour was not only disturbing the training but also creating fear in other employees. By mid-May Punit Gupta an employee relations specialist recommended Rani for the Employee Assistance Program; Rani had a medical condition that caused hallucinations. By the end of June Rani was terminated from DCM on medical grounds. However Shinde soon realized that the employees’ fear of supernatural forces lingered even after Rani had left the company.SUPERSTITION AND THE INDIAN WORKPLACEAfter Rani left the company other employees remained fearful of coming to work. Many employees still believed that an evil spirit was residing in the building. Shinde saw an increase in the appearance of artefacts and spiritual symbols among employees of all sects and religious groups within the company.Shinde was disturbed by the increasing visual display of totems. He recalled reading an article. Team Lease a staffing company in India had surveyed 800 companies in eight metropolitan cities (New Delhi Mumbai Chennai Kolkata Bangalore Hyderabad Pune and Ahmedabad) to determine the prevalence of superstition in the Indian workplace. The results of the “Superstitions at Work” survey showed that about 62 per cent of survey participants followed personal beliefs and about 51 per cent of these participants carried these beliefs or superstitions to the workplace. Furthermore about 48 per cent of respondents felt that practicing superstitious behaviour at the workplace had a positive effect because it boosted their confidence and improved their work performance. The management of the companies surveyed did not lend explicit support to employees who practiced superstitions nor did the management interfere when an employee was seen to be following some superstitious belief. Most employees at DCM were full-time whereby they worked daily eight-hour shifts five days a week. Shinde felt that the results of the Team Lease survey could help explain the behaviour of his employees. The employees held certain values according to which they observed certain practices. Since employees spent a considerable amount of time in the workplace naturally the rituals they observed at home were also carried to work. Over many years Shinde had frequently seen employees keep lucky charms like a laughing Buddha or pictures and statues of deities at their desks. Since these artefacts did not seem to impact work productivity in the beginning Shinde did not mind. He believed that by accommodating employees’ religious beliefs a harmonious and inclusive workplace would evolve. During the month of Ramadan DCM management would consider requests for leave or changes to the work shift so that employees could pray. The company accommodated employees’ religious and personal preferences and tried to make modifications where possible. But the nature of these requests was seasonal or only applicable to a few employee groups. Exceptions were considered on a case-by-case basis and generally made possible by deploying a different group of people so productivity was not affected. Shinde was concerned that ever since the incident with Rani employees were afraid to work at night and business continuity would eventually be affected. After each call customers had the option of rating the quality of service. DCM’s goal was to get a customer satisfaction score of 100 per cent. The average satisfaction score in the months of January to April was 95–98 per cent. However the survey scores dropped to 92 per cent in June 2016.GROWING CONCERNSFear of the evil spirit becoming active in the dark-to-dawn shift led to further unrest in the company. On July 11 2016 Roopa Tyagi a valued female employee decided to resign. Tyagi explained during her exit interview that she believed it was due to the presence of the demonic entity that her family had started experiencing health and financial problems. She was scared that the evil spirit was proving to be a bad omen for her family. To avoid complications Tyagi had started looking for other opportunities and found a role with one of DCM’s competitors.After Tyagi left Shinde was concerned about losing more people. He observed that a few employees were even scared to use the chair that Rani had used or the computer she had accessed for fear of being possessed by the ghost. Shinde further noticed that the number of absences during the graveyard shift had starkly increased. As the call volume was low during these shifts there were fewer employees—about 30 people—scheduled to work at that time in a facility with a capacity of 350 people which made the working atmosphere seem one of isolation. Shinde noticed that besides an increase in the number of unscheduled absences there was a drop in customer satisfaction scores and an overall drop in productivity. He decided to meet with the customer service representatives to address the issues before they snowballed into a larger problem. During the team meeting Shinde reasoned We are here to ease your fears. I want us to be practical and factual so that we can build a high-performing team. This building was constructed 30 years ago. DCM has been operating here for the past 12 years. Never have employees even vaguely complained of such occurrences. DCM strives to maintain a safe environment. The company premises are well protected by guards and other security personnel. We even have cameras and other technological safeguards in place. “How will the security guard help when the employees are scared of the unknown?” Shalini Mahajan a customer service representative replied. “I know that science and technology do not offer enough evidence. It is a matter of belief; people who believe in ghosts and spirits just cannot control their fear.” “I understand your concerns” Shinde said. “We want to make sure you are comfortable coming in to work. What can we do to help you?”“I think we should reach out to the local church. The holy priest has been summoned before to perform exorcisms. He is well versed with situations like these” suggested Winston Roy. “Or we could call a pandit [Hindu priest] and ask him to perform the shantikaran puja. This would cleanse the work premises” suggested Mahajan. Religions in India were divided into different castes and sub-castes and followers developed certain beliefs based on these castes and on other factors. For instance there were 330 million gods in Hinduism alone; this was a reflection of the different ideologies held by Hindus. The number of different philosophies people in the country held was great when other religions such as Christianity and Jainism were considered. Shinde knew that his employees held a number of different beliefs and that each person would have an opinion aligned with these. He did not want to favour a specific cultural group as it would lead to other problems. Shinde responded I understand and value your suggestions. But DCM is a company based on modern values and scientific principles. We must not encourage non-scientific practices. Also as per the policies and fair employment practices of the company we should not encourage practices that [would] show we are biased towards any specific religious group. “I read about a scientist couple who reside in Bangalore. They explore haunted places and suggest alternatives based on research. This approach would be the best as it would be evidenced by science and not biased towards any ethnic group” suggested another employee. Shinde felt that the discussions were leading nowhere. He realized that most of his employees were superstitious but at the same time he did not blame them. Shinde remembered reading an article about Mukesh Ambani the 9th-richest man in the world. Ambani who lived in Mumbai owned the world’s most expensive home. The house which had cost US$1 billion to build was reportedly empty—the owner believed it would bring bad luck to move in because it did not line up correctly with the principles of Vastu Shastra. Superstitions could affect real estate prices and Shinde was afraid the company and the reputation of the office premises could be at risk. Shinde knew he had to be careful in dealing with a sensitive issue such as this. He therefore prepared for his upcoming monthly meeting with Elizabeth Gregory in New York. Gregory was DCM’s head of Operations for Asia. Besides DCM India Gregory had stakeholders in the Philippines Mauritius and Malaysia. CULTURAL CLASHES: THE UNITED STATES AND INDIAShinde dialled into the conference line for his meeting with Gregory who had already dialled in and was waiting for Shinde to join. “Liz here” she said. “How are things going Sanjay?”“Well not quite so well” Shinde replied honestly. “You must have observed that there is a drop in productivity compared to last month.”“Yes. I am surprised to see that. What is the reason for the dip?” inquired Gregory.“We have an issue here that some employees feel the work premises are haunted. Due to this employees are scared to come to work and in general the morale is low” Shinde replied. He explained Rani’s case the sequence of events and how the rumours began. “This is not good. Do you know why people are behaving like this?” asked Gregory. Shinde explained India is a country deeply seeped in faiths and beliefs. Most individuals have been brought up in a socio-cultural environment where following superstitions is an accepted norm. The competitive environment seems to foster superstitious routines. Eventually these superstitions become a source of mental and emotional reassurance. “This is quite alarming!” Gregory exclaimed. “I am surprised to see well educated people believe in such practices.”Shine repliedIn 2007 a survey was conducted by the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture within Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut. The purpose of this study was to determine [the] worldviews and opinions of scientists in India. Over 1000 scientists were surveyed from 130 Indian institutes of which 24 per cent admitted to believing that holy men could perform miracles 38 per cent believed that God could perform miracles and 49 per cent believed in the effectiveness of prayers. Most Indians do not feel there is [a] dichotomy between science and spirituality.Shinde further explained “It is a matter of faith. These rituals and practices are ingrained in the culture. Both educated and uneducated people go to men of God temples and other holy places to seek resolution to their problems.” Shinde told Gregory about the meeting with his team and one employee’s recommendation to perform an exorcism.“The United States is a democracy as well. We have people from many more nationalities and religions. I haven’t really seen any problems like this here” Gregory reasoned.Shinde explainedIndia is a collectivist society. There is a high preference for belonging to a larger social framework. In such situations the actions of the individual are influenced by various concepts such as the opinions of one’s family extended family neighbours work group and other such wider social networks that one has some affiliation toward. Hence the tradition of the joint family system and arranged marriage is seen in India even today. Due to this the urge to abide by the norms of the society is very high and the impact of rituals and superstitions is very strong in India. Americans in general are often categorized as much more independent pragmatic and individualistic. Because a country’s collectivist or individualist culture often frames work practices the concept of work and ethics is different in India and the United States.Gregory inquired “Have you discussed the situation with the legal and compliance department? Do they have any recommendations?” Shinde repliedThere is an act in India that is basically a law against superstitious practices in India. After the bill was drafted in 2003 it was severely criticized for being racist or anti-Hindu. Even though the bill addressed only fraudulent practices the law drew such a thin line between faith and blind faith that the backlash to it was severe. In short it is legal to perform a miracle but it would be illegal to claim to perform a miracle to cheat someone. Right now the law is only passed in the state of Maharashtra and not applicable to companies in Bangalore which operate in the state of Karnataka. Hence the rest of India remains without comparable protection from fraudulent healers or superstitious practices.“I agree that this is a very sensitive situation. But this behaviour is just not acceptable. Should we do something to discourage this behaviour?” asked Gregory. Shinde replied I personally think that the employees cannot control their behaviour. The only way I can think of right now is to diffuse the grapevine. Hence I was thinking of meeting [with] all the employees in small groups to address the situation. I would be focusing on facts to ease their fear. I was also thinking of offering additional incentives to work the graveyard shift. Due to lean staffing [during that shift] we could offer more security coverage to make sure they do not feel alone and vulnerable. I also recommend working with a few rationalist groups to eradicate such superstitions. Gregory argued But did you not say it is a matter of faith and belief? People in general should be motivated to work. Based on what you said I am not sure that their belief would change by offering more incentives. I am not sure if that would work. We need to focus on our metrics. Have you considered disciplining the employees? “The religious backlash could be a very severe issue and could even lead to riots and other disruptions. People are already stressed. If we impose further restrictions on them they will quit” Shinde reasoned. “If we do not discipline them then they will not improve. Employees may eventually start taking advantage of the situation. The sales and profits were not good in spite of the 4th of July promotion sales and discounts. I do not want my customers in the United States to feel dejected due to this issue” Gregory asserted. CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVESShinde finished all of his meetings at 4 a.m. He looked back at all that had happened that day. Gregory had made a valid point about the need to fix the problem quickly. She was his client and it was important that she was happy. He realized that Gregory was accountable for her goals too. However Shinde respected the beliefs of the employees and understood their fears in working through the night knowing they believed in superstitions. Shinde wanted both Gregory and his employees to be happy. He knew that he could not compromise the desires of one for those of the other. What was the best way to achieve a balance? Shinde did not sleep that night as he considered various solutions and the implications of these. Before making a decision Shinde needed to consider the pros and cons of each alternative to finally develop a plan to achieve the business goals while respecting the concerns of all the people he worked with.EXHIBIT 1: Diglot capital management business modelNote: DCM = Diglot Capital Management.Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 2: organizational STRUCTURE OF Diglot Capital Management IndiaNote: HR = human resources; IT = information technologySource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: Management STRUCTURE OF sales capital at diglot capital managementNote: HR = human resources; WFM = workforce managementSource: Company documents.ENDNOTES",1,BROWN,SOUTHERN ASIA,MAN,

At their hotel they observed other guests engaged in an excited discussion in front of the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet allowed hotel guests to add several ingredients to their breakfast cereals such as raisins special seeds and chocolate chips. Curious about what the guests were discussing the young entrepreneurs decided to talk to them and discovered that the guests were from different European countries. The guests told them that they enjoyed having such a great variety of breakfast items. They especially appreciated having the option to choose the ingredients for their breakfast cereals. When Hubertus Bessau the chief marketing officer of mymuesli explained that their company focused on customization the guests were excited and wanted to know where they could buy products from mymuesli. On their trip back to Germany Bessau convinced his co-founders Max Wittrock and Philipp Kraiss that entering new markets would be a great opportunity for mymuesli to grow although it might be a challenging step for the young company. Bessau suggested working on an internationalization strategy over the next few years. Having confidence in Bessau’s expertise and feeling validated by the hotel guests’ excitement about mymuesli Kraiss and Wittrock asked him to prepare for the next board meeting a plan of where to go next with the company. COMPANY BACKGROUNDIn 2005 three German students Wittrock Bessau and Kraiss had the idea of starting their own breakfast cereal company. They were on their way to a lake to go swimming and heard a radio advertisement for a well-known German breakfast cereal manufacturer. The students wanted to seize the opportunity to be pioneers in online mass customization for breakfast cereals which they believed should also be organic and sugar-free. In 2007 mymuesli went online for the first time and the business started by distributing breakfast cereals in Germany (see Exhibit 1). The popularity of this concept and of their products allowed the founders to grow their business quickly. At the outset they mixed the customized breakfast cereals that were ordered online in their small kitchen in Passau. After two weeks they were already sold out. Therefore at the end of 2007 they moved to a new production site in Passau. In its second year of operation mymuesli began to expand to nearby countries such as Austria and Switzerland as well as to the United Kingdom. In Switzerland the founders built a second office and production site in order to increase production capacity. In 2009 they entered the Dutch market with mymuesli and in early 2017 they opened a store in Sweden. A milestone was met in 2010 when mymuesli’s unique mixing machine began to be used allowing for the preparation of over 566 quadrillion different breakfast cereal varieties. Mymuesli offered more than 88 versions of pre-mixed breakfast cereal. These versions were chosen according to the most popular customer choices from the mass customization concept and were sold in mymuesli’s own stores in multiple cities. In 2009 mymuesli tested the store concept in Passau by selling its products in physical stores in the city (see Exhibit 2). The popularity of this store encouraged the founders to open more stores across Germany. In the following years mymuesli proceeded with its international expansion by opening stores in Austria Switzerland the Netherlands and Sweden. As of summer 2017 mymuesli owned 58 stores across Germany Switzerland and Austria; two in Sweden; and one in the Netherlands (see Exhibit 3).The company continuously grew emerging from a three-man start-up and expanding to a company with more than 800 employees by 2017. Mymuesli won several start-up awards including the German Founders’ Award granted by Germany’s Financial Times and in 2016 the German Marketing Award.MASS CUSTOMIZATIONMost of the time consumers of breakfast cereals found an ingredient in their cereal bowl that they did not like or missed an ingredient that they liked. The three mymuesli founders wanted to tackle this issue by implementing the concept of mass customization which would allow customers to mix their own individual breakfast cereals out of more than 80 ingredients on mymuesli’s website. In total over 566 quadrillion mixtures were possible ensuring that every customer received his or her preferred product by adding individually chosen ingredients. In five easy steps the virtual mixer allowed customers to choose their preferred ingredients all of which were organic and—if possible—locally sourced (see Exhibit 4). Besides mixing individual breakfast cereals the customer could also create customized labels. To fulfill customer wishes as much as possible and to attract new customers mymuesli continued adding new ingredients to its list of choices and adapted its offerings to new trends in health and lifestyle. For instance it created a special “Yoga-Muesli” in reaction to the popularity of yoga and added chia seeds to the ingredient list because of the increasing demand for the healthy seeds. ONLINE AND OFFLINE DISTRIBUTIONIn Germany and abroad mymuesli distributed its products through three channels: its website (online) and its own stores and selected supermarkets (offline). In the online store customers could mix their own breakfast cereal. Besides this customers could place orders 24 hours a day seven days a week avoiding bottlenecks such as queues and unavailable staff. The products were then shipped to customers’ homes. However customers had to pay shipping costs of €3.90 if the order amount was less than €40 and had to wait two to three days for their products owing to delivery time. If they wanted to avoid these additional costs customers could pick up their products at hotspots. While such hotspots were located primarily in mymuesli stores there were a few external hotspots in major cities. For mymuesli online direct sales were a quick and inexpensive method to connect with customers and to sell its products. The website could be adapted to suit newly entered markets. Moreover its online stores allowed the company to collect data that was used to analyze customer behaviour and that optimized sales. However online sales limited customer interactions and required a great deal of overhead such as updating product descriptions adding pictures and for packaging and delivering the products. In mymuesli’s own stores customers could buy pre-mixed versions of cereal. These stores allowed customers to get a “muesli experience” by tasting different products. They could also buy a bowl of freshly prepared breakfast cereal and take it to go. The stores were located primarily in city centres in high-density foot traffic areas which gave them further exposure to non-customers and offered the possibility of benefitting from people’s impulse buying habits. New customers who often visited an online store only if they were specifically looking for something were attracted to mymuesli’s stores. However for mymuesli opening its own stores required huge capital investment and involved greater risks. GLOBAL BREAKFAST CEREAL INDUSTRYSupply and DemandAccording to forecasts the global breakfast cereal industry was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 4 per cent between 2013 and 2019. The industry’s value totalled €29 billion in 2012 and it was expected to reach €38.6 billion by the end of 2019. Key growth drivers in the industry were the rising demand for natural and organic food the increasing number of health-conscious consumers and consumers’ increased disposable income. In 2014 North America accounted for the largest market share of about 34 per cent followed by Europe. However while the demand for breakfast cereals in North America and Europe was anticipated to be stagnant or even decline Asia Pacific was expected to emerge as the fastest growing breakfast cereals market with a forecasted global market share of 13 per cent by the end of 2019.Companies operating in the industry made use of innovative marketing and promotion strategies to attract more customers. Moreover they adapted the promotion of their products according to region-specific breakfast habits and introduced innovative flavours in breakfast cereals to appeal to customers with different taste preferences.The breakfast cereal industry could be split into several segments (see Exhibit 5). Taking figures from the United States’ breakfast cereal market the largest market in the world the segmentation looked as follows in 2016: with about 93 per cent of total sales ready-to-eat breakfast cereals that could be consumed without further preparation had the largest portion of the market. However as growth in demand was anticipated for the Asia Pacific where a majority of consumers preferred hot cereals the hot cereal segment was expected to increase its share to about 18 per cent of the global industry market share by 2019 and thus to drive overall market growth. In 2016 ready-to-eat corn breakfast foods (e.g. corn flakes) made up the largest segment in the United States with 27.9 per cent of total industry revenue. The increasing number of consumers choosing gluten-free products as well as relatively low production costs led to an increase in revenue for this segment. The revenue of the second-largest segment ready-to-eat wheat breakfast foods (e.g. wheat flakes) decreased to 16.8 per cent because of shifts in dietary preferences. The segment of other ready-to-eat grain breakfast foods (e.g. granola or oats) grew to 48.2 per cent of total revenue in the United States in 2016 thanks to consumers’ increasing preference for healthy cereal foods and gluten-free grains. Last with 7.1 per cent of the United States’ industry revenue hot cereals (e.g. oatmeal) accounted for the smallest percentage in 2016. Their consumption was seasonal and revenue share had declined over recent years due to consumers’ increasing shift to convenience food.The demand for breakfast cereals was influenced by multiple factors including household disposable income changing consumer lifestyles product pricing and the presence of substitutes. The demand in developed countries had declined due to changing consumer trends and economic recovery. While the rise in income per capita allowed customers to buy more expensive or branded products it also enabled them to buy costly alternative breakfast products such as yogourt sandwiches snack bars and fruits. However most of these substitutes did not provide the same nutritional benefits as some breakfast cereals which were nutrient-dense thanks to the many vitamins minerals and fibre they contained. Additionally consumers were tending to dine out at cafés and coffee shops more frequently and busy consumers increasingly preferred fast and portable foods. Moreover the trend toward healthy diets such as low-carb diets limited the demand for breakfast cereals. The demand from supermarkets and convenience stores for breakfast cereals was a key external driver of industry performance. Looking at the U.S. industry as a proxy this segment accounted for 53.8 per cent of total industry revenue in 2016. It was followed by grocery wholesalers with 33.4 per cent. Mass merchandisers were able to sell products at a lower price because of their purchasing power. Moreover they had a huge choice of different brands to select from and sold their own private label products. The private label products were also adapted to consumer needs and were sold for a lower price (around 35 per cent lower). Supermarkets mostly sold the brands that enjoyed the highest brand loyalty as end costumers tended to buy brands they knew from their childhood. Although distribution through food service providers contributed the smallest revenue share in the United States in 2016 (6.5 per cent) food service providers that catered to hotels and schools for instance were crucial because their segment reported a growing revenue share thanks to the increasing trend of having breakfast outside of home. Additionally 6.3 per cent of industry revenue in the United States in 2016 was generated through exports. Industry Costs and PricingCost structures in the breakfast cereal industry varied depending on various factors such as the size and scale of production marketing expenses and supply chain relationships. The cost structure in the U.S. breakfast cereal industry serves as an example. While profit was estimated at 5.4 per cent of revenue the remaining 94.6 per cent was costs broken down as follows: 53.2 per cent was purchasing costs 7.6 per cent was the cost of wages marketing made up 5.6 per cent of costs 1.6 per cent was depreciation and the costs for rent and utilities totalled 1.5 per cent. The remaining 25.1 per cent included various other costs such as; overhead expenses logistics and distribution and research and development. Profit in the industry had been volatile over the past few years because of fluctuations in commodity prices of corn wheat and grains. The prices of corn and wheat which were both important inputs for breakfast cereals significantly influenced profitability. When these prices rose industry profitability decreased. Moreover the changing availability of grains resulted in volatile prices. Suppliers who were mostly independent were carefully chosen to control costs and supply volatility of these raw materials. Mymuesli mainly purchased its supplies from local farmers and grain traders. An increase in the number of organic farmers in recent years had led to a decrease in prices for organic supplies. Companies offering supplies for packaging were numerous and they set relatively stable prices.The price sensitivity of customers varied among product segments. Customers’ willingness to pay a higher price depended on the perceived quality of the products. Strong brands were able to command a premium price thanks to their good reputation and brand-loyal customer base. Producers of healthy products perceived as high quality were able to charge higher prices. However during the past five years the growing segment of low-priced private-label brands led to an increase in price-based competition.Mymuesli positioned its products as organic premium products for which its customers were willing to pay a higher price. The large pre-mixed cans (400 500 or 575 grams) could be purchased at prices from €3.90 to €14.39 while the “2go” cups (40 or 85 grams) cost approximately €1.90. If customers chose to mix their own breakfast cereals €3.90–€4.90 was charged for the base and €0.20–€1.25 was added for each additional ingredient. Global CompetitionThe global breakfast cereal industry was mature and somewhat concentrated. Major players with well-established brands benefited from their customers’ brand loyalty and accounted for the large majority of industry revenue. The biggest global players fiercely competing for market share were Kellogg Company PepsiCo Inc. Nestlé S.A. General Mills Inc. and Weetabix Ltd. In the United States General Mills Inc. had a market share of 23.8 per cent followed by Kellogg Company with 23.3 per cent Post Holdings with 11.9 per cent and PepsiCo Inc. with 6.3 per cent. Yet there were also country-specific industry players such as Dr. Oetker Ltd. in Germany and Valsoia SpA in Italy. The industry was expected in the near future to become even more concentrated. Since breakfast cereals were facing increased competition from substitutes major players were likely to acquire niche companies in order to increase their product offerings market share and market power. The ability of new players to enter and compete in the industry was limited by some barriers to entry such as the high capital intensity heavy industry regulations and policies and strong positioning of existing players who enjoyed favourable contracts with media outlets and positive supply chain relationships. Economies of scale and scope were favourable in the industry. However companies that specialized in niche products could become new players in the industry. In mymuesli’s home market of Germany start-ups such as Muesli Muehle and Cereal Club which emulated mymuesli’s organic and customized breakfast cereal concept entered the market. Players in the breakfast cereal industry mainly competed on quality relationships with buyers price product innovation and differentiation. The ability to adapt to shifts in consumer preferences and to differentiate from other players was a key success factor for companies whose growth was limited. In response to the consumer trend toward healthier diets and to an increase in disposable income companies adapted their product lines to spur demand by introducing healthy premium products. WHERE TO GO NEXTAlthough their company had grown significantly in terms of number of employees from a start-up to a medium-sized company the three founders were eager to determine into which market to introduce mymuesli. Bessau met with his marketing team to discuss how to proceed with the internationalization plan. He specifically wanted his team to conduct an analysis to identify the top three most attractive markets in Europe based on data he had gathered (see Exhibit 6).EXHIBIT 1: COMPANY LOGO Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: mymuesli STORES AND PRODUCTSSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: MYMUESLI INTERNATIONALIZATIONLocation of mymuesli Stores in German-speaking Countries*Note: * In addition mymuesli owned two stores in Sweden and one store in the Netherlands.Source: Created by the authors based on company documents.EXHIBIT 4: mymuesli’s CUSTOMIZATION PROCESSNote: choco = chocolate; chocs = chocolatesSource: Company documents; “Mixer” mymuesli accessed March 15 2017 https://uk.mymuesli.com/mixer/.EXHIBIT 5: GLOBAL MARKET SEGEMENT DESCRIPTIONSource: Created by the authors based on “IBISWorld Industry Report 31123 Cereal Production in the US” IBISWorld Rory Masterson July 2016 accessed March 2 2017.EXHIBIT 6: MARKET DATA TABLENote: *Estimated; countries ordered alphabetically; GDP = gross domestic productSource: “Consumer Expenditure on Cereals” Euromonitor International from National Statistics/Eurostat/United Nations (UN)/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); “Disposable Income” Euromonitor International from National Statistics; “Ease of Doing Business Ranking” Euromonitor International from World Bank; “GDP: Euromonitor International from National Statistics/Eurostat/OECD/UN/International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics; “Total Population/Urban Population” Euromonitor International from National Statistics/UN; “Urban Population” Euromonitor International from National Statistics/UN Euromonitor International accessed April 3 2017.

Kinsip had a varied product mix that included light and dark spirits a broad variety of bitters and cask-aged maple syrup. However for the previous few weeks the distillery had been working hard on a completely different product.In March 2020 the business had retooled to produce hand sanitizer in response to the shortages resulting from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Motivated by a desire to help the community Kinsip had initially provided its first batches of hand sanitizer for free to help protect front-line workers in the area. Producing hand sanitizer had required a considerable amount of effort and production adjustment but Kinsip had risen to the challenge. As a distillery it already produced ethanol something that was also a key ingredient in the composition of hand sanitizer for its regular products. In addition Kinsip’s production and bottling expertise enabled it to meet the needs of the community quickly and effectively. Before long Kinsip had added hand sanitizer to its list of products for sale to the public.The three Kinsip cofounders were already pleased with the quality of their consumable products and the experience the distillery provided to consumers both at the farm and through wider distribution. With the development of an excellent hand sanitizer they wondered about next steps. Should they make hand sanitizer a regular Kinsip product offering?HISTORY OF KINSIP HOUSE OF FINE SPIRITSBackground and Product MixSarah Waterston along with her brother Michael Waterston and his spouse Maria Hristova had always loved visiting Prince Edward County (PEC) a southern Ontario locality known for its many farms and wineries. During their visits to the area they appreciated and enjoyed the quality of PEC’s fine local products. Among the family members Hristova was a third-generation distiller with a lifetime of expertise in the development of fine spirits. Having developed a discerning palate while growing up in a family-owned European distillery she could appreciate the unique quality that local ingredients brought to flavour profiles. Hristova and her family members soon recognized that particular quality in PEC’s 66 Gilead Distillery. Set on a beautiful farm in the town of Bloomfield near the popular Sandbanks Provincial Park and named for its address 66 Gilead Distillery was the only producer of fine spirits in the area.When 66 Gilead Distillery was put up for sale in 2016 the three family members seized the opportunity to become business owners. After acquiring the business the next step was to give the distillery a fresh new name. Initially the three owners considered the name “Kindred” for their venture to reflect their family connections. Eventually however the business’s name evolved to “Kinsip House of Fine Spirits” to emphasize the fine nature of its products. The distillery promoted values of family community and fine craftsmanship through a statement on its website: “Kinsip is rooted in an appreciation of family and the fulfillment found in building community. We craft products together that reflect and accentuate the quality of the moment. Life is worthy of celebrating the small moments as well as the grand.”Kinsip defined itself as a craft “grain-to-glass” distillery borrowing from “farm-to-table” the popular phrase for locally sourced food ventures. Wheat grain rye and barley used in production were cultivated on the farm’s 80-hectare fields which created a business distinction that very few distilleries in Ontario could claim. Kinsip was also one of very few cooperages operating in Canada.Kinsip had purposefully aimed to create distinctive spirits with unique flavours in its distilling which took place on the premises. The cofounders had established community relations and procured various elements for their spirits—including juniper black currants lavender and maple syrup—from local producers. Kinsip had further distinguished itself by becoming a “verified artisan distiller.” Artisan Distillers Canada (ADC) verified a business as an artisan distillery if it was independently owned produced a limited volume (less than 100000 litres) of ethyl alcohol and used its own techniques to ferment blend infuse or age its own brands of spirits and bitters.Of the 178 craft distilleries listed on the ADC website 81 were verified artisan distillers. Among the 28 Ontario distilleries listed on the ADC website Kinsip was one of nine verified artisan distilleries and the only one located in PEC. The next verified artisan distillery was located 192 kilometres away in Johnstown Ontario. The closest non-verified artisan distillery was 124 kilometres away in Peterborough Ontario.Eventually Kinsip’s product line evolved to include 11 different spirits such as rum whisky gin brandy and vodka (see Exhibit 1). Kinsip also offered a selection of non-alcoholic products such as bitters and maple syrup aged in whisky barrels. During the tourist season of May to October Kinsip welcomed visitors for tastings and tours of the facility.Kinsip sold its spirits directly to consumers both from its premises at the farm and through online shopping. Its products were also available across Ontario through the government-owned liquor and wine retailer Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). As well Kinsip sold its bitters and maple syrup through 30 boutique outlets most of which were located across Ontario and through several locations in Quebec and Alberta (see Exhibit 2). For sales promotion Kinsip packaged some of its product into attractive and convenient gift sets. As well the distillery offered loyal customers club membership status which provided certain priority privileges (see Exhibit 3). For customers who preferred shopping online Kinsip offered free shipping on each online order over CA$50. HAND SANITIZERInitially Kinsip had produced hand sanitizer to supply local hospitals with a product for use on hands and on surfaces within health care facilities. Therefore Kinsip formulated its sanitizer in a more convenient liquid spraying format rather than a gel. Health care workers were provided small bottles of the hand sanitizer free of charge from several of Kinsip’s initial batches. The distillery then expanded its distribution of this essential product during the COVID-19 pandemic across the community making it widely available for sale to the public (see Exhibit 1). Kinsip added the phrase “For Difficult Times” on the hand sanitizer’s label to remind users that the product was part of a community effort to keep everyone safe (see Exhibit 4). Early purchasers of the Kinsip product consisted mainly of essential workers who frequently interacted with people and could not conduct their work from home such as delivery people truckers and others.By mid-March 2020 over 100 Canadian artisan distilleries had accepted the challenge of producing hand sanitizer. Kinsip was one of 20 such distilleries located in Ontario (see Exhibit 5). As a sales promotion Kinsip offered 120 millilitre (ml) bottles of hand sanitizer free of charge with all online orders of spirits and maple syrup (see Exhibit 6). Safety and RecallsLike many other producers of hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic Kinsip consulted the World Health Organization for direction on the product’s formulation which included glycerol hydrogen peroxide and ethanol. In April 2020 due to a supply shortfall in hand sanitizer Health Canada permitted producers to use technical-grade ethanol in the composition of the product. However technical-grade ethanol could pose a health risk because of its impurities. By comparison food-grade (or pharmaceutical-grade) ethanol was much purer and safer for sanitation involving skin contact. Therefore in June 2020 Health Canada issued a product recall for all non-compliant hand sanitizers that included technical-grade and industrial-grade ethanol. Kinsip and other artisan distilleries as producers of consumables had used only food-grade ethanol in their product so they were not subject to the Health Canada recall.PricingMost artisan distillers who produced hand sanitizer priced their products competitively (see Exhibit 7). Kinsip priced its smallest container at $0.09 per ml which was considerably higher than the average price of $0.04 per ml. However Kinsip’s larger containers were more competitively priced. Its one-litre bottle was priced at $0.023 per ml which was lower than the average price of $0.029 per ml. Kinsip’s four-litre jug was priced at $0.014 per ml which was also lower than the average price of $0.016 per ml. In addition Kinsip offered free shipping anywhere in Canada on all online orders over $50; some other artisan distilleries also provided free shipping locally. However most companies applied standard shipping fees to all of their orders which meant that a customer order of $100 from the nearby city of Kingston Ontario could cost an additional $30–$40 in standard shipping.Projected DemandPrior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 the global hand sanitizer market was projected to grow from US$1.2 billion in 2019 to US$2.14 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2 per cent during the forecast period of 2019 to 2027. However after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic analysts revised the expected annual growth rate of the hand sanitizer market up to 45.7 per cent for 2020. Hand sanitizer had grown to become an estimated US$200 million industry. Public awareness about increased hygiene standards for preventing viral outbreaks led market analysts to project continually increasing demand. With the potential for COVID-19 safety practices to extend over longer periods the use of hand sanitizer was expected to become a standard practice in the future for all public spaces. KINSIP CUSTOMERSMost Kinsip customers became acquainted with the distillery’s products during tasting tours which operated between May and October. Therefore the success of the tourism season in the PEC region had a direct effect on Kinsip’s potential online sales which resulted from tourist visits and tasting tours.As the only distillery within the PEC region Kinsip welcomed a wide range of visitors including motorcycle groups vacationing families and young retirees on weekend excursions. Most visitors came from three major urban centres—Montreal Toronto and Ottawa—which were located within a two- or three-hour drive from PEC. Kinsip attracted various customer segments but according to its own research two main demographic groups tended to dominate during the summer months and in the early fall season. During the summer months when children were out of school the Kinsip site was popular with young parents—especially women aged 25 to 45—who visited PEC for week-long holidays with their young children. Kinsip estimated that this segment comprised 40–60 per cent of visitors to the farm. The parents and children enjoyed touring the facilities and sights which included numerous chickens running freely in the farm’s open yard. These visitors tended to prefer clear spirits and purchased products to consume during their summer vacations and back at home after the holidays.During the early fall months of September and October frequent visitors to the Kinsip site were mostly weekend tourists who wanted to stock up on products for winter including early Christmas gifts. Kinsip estimated that 30–40 per cent of these customers comprised dual-income couples aged 50–65. These consumers tended to be knowledgeable about spirits enjoyed entertaining at home purchased a wide range of products and would buy cases of spirits in single purchases rather than single bottles. While exploring the PEC region customers would visit the Kinsip distillery to relax in the picturesque farm setting and appreciate Kinsip’s urban-styled tasting bar. In stark contrast to the farm setting the tasting bar featured a contemporary white design with copper accents. The three Kinsip cofounders intentionally chose a design that projected clean slick urban features to counter the farm’s rural country setting. Many customers used the term “farm glam” to describe the unique design that the three Kinsip cofounders intended to portray. The term “farm glam” seemed to portray a stylish design within a picturesque country setting that customers could indulge in and treat themselves. Many Kinsip customers saw their visits as pleasurable high quality experiences that featured unique local products. Online sales were mainly derived from these personal experiences. Online customers tended to be people who had already enjoyed Kinsip products during tasting tours onsite. Other online shoppers had been referred to the Kinsip products by loyal clients.PRODUCT MIXKinsip invited its customers to practice restraint and to savour its products to appreciate the complexity and uniqueness of each one. The business produced 11 different spirits including rum rye whisky gin brandy and vodka. Each product was combined with unique flavours derived from locally sourced ingredients such as lavender juniper berries black currants pine needles and maple syrup. The connection of the spirits to the local sources was reflected in the names of many products such as Maple Whisky and Woodland’s Whisper Pine Vodka (see Exhibit 1). Kinsip’s non-alcoholic products also emphasized unique sensory experiences. For example Kinsip’s maple syrup was aged in whisky barrels to elevate a common Canadian product to a more sophisticated level. Kinsip’s bitters not only featured locally sourced jalapenos lavender and maple syrup but also incorporated coffee and chocolate from craft businesses located in Toronto.By contrast Kinsip’s hand sanitizer was marketed as a purely utilitarian product with a minimalist descriptive label (see Exhibit 1). The phrase “For Difficult Times” was added to the product’s description to suggest Kinsip’s role in protecting the community during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Exhibit 4). However as the pandemic wore on over time it was less clear whether the phrase continued to resonate with customers. The format of Kinsip’s hand sanitizer used in hospitals allowed it to be sprayed on surfaces which provided an advantage over gel formats. However some customers who expected hand sanitizer to be in a gel format were confused by the spray version. Nevertheless feedback from customers indicated that they appreciated the product’s quick drying quality which meant it did not leave a sticky residue. Some early users even reported that the product smelled like gin which they considered a positive attribute. The three Kinsip cofounders were proud of the quality and purity of their hand sanitizer. They also hoped that it served as a reminder of the firm’s commitment to the community. However it was clear that the sanitizer provided a sharp contrast to other items in Kinsip’s list of products. It was the one product that did not seem to fit with the otherwise fine quality consumable spirits.The three owners wondered how to market this one special product to enhance its fit within the distillery’s product mix. Did the hand sanitizer constitute an opportunity to reach a broader consumer base?EXHIBIT 1: KINSIP HOUSE OF FINE SPIRITS—PRODUCT LIST (in CA$)Alcoholic ProductsEXHIBIT 1 (CONTINUED)Non-alcoholic ProductsNote: Availability of products could change over time; information in this exhibit reflects products featured on the Kinsip House of Fine Spirits website at the time of writing; ml = millilitre.Source: Created by the authors with information from “Home” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca.EXHIBIT 2: BITTERS and MAPLE SYRUP STOCKISTSSource: Created by the authors with information from “Home” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca.EXHIBIT 3: KINSIP HOUSE OF FINE SPIRITS—CLUB MEMBERSHIPSource: Created by the authors with information from “Home” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca.EXHIBIT 4: KINSIP HOUSE OF FINE SPIRITS—HAND SANITIZERSource: Created by the authors with information from “Hand Sanitizer” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca/hand-sanitizer.EXHIBIT 5: CANADIAN ARTISAN DISTILLERieS PRODUCING HAND SANITIZER Source: Created by authors with information from “Artisan Distillers Producing Disinfectant & Hand Sanitizer” Artisan Distillers Canada March 19 2020 accessed August 18 2020 https://artisandistillers.ca/news/artisan-distillers-disinfectant.EXHIBIT 6: KINSIP HOUSE OF FINE SPIRITS—COVID-19 Shipping InformationNote: ml = millilitre.Source: Created by the authors with information from “Home” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca.EXHIBIT 7: HAND SANITIZER PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND PRICES FROM ONTARIO ARTISAN DISTILLERIES (in CA$)EXHIBIT 7 (Continued)Note: *Minimum allowable concentration for hand sanitizer was 60%; distilleries listed in Exhibit 5 that did not offer sanitizer for sale on their websites were omitted from this list; all listed producers manufactured hand sanitizer using food-grade ethanol; ml = millilitre; L = litre.Source: “Products” Dairy Distillery accessed May 7 2020 www.dairydistillery.com/collections/products; “What We Make” Dillon’s Small Batch Distilleries accessed May 7 2020 https://dillons.ca/what-we-make; “Shop” Dixon’s Distilled Spirits accessed May 7 2020 https://dixonsdistilledspirits.com/shop; “Shop” Junction 56 Distillery accessed May 7 2020 www.junction56.ca/shop; “Home” Kinsip House of Fine Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.kinsip.ca; “Shop” Last Straw Distillery accessed May 7 2020 www.madebyhand.laststrawdistillery.com/shop; “Shop” Limited Distilling accessed April 18 2021 https://limiteddistillery.com/pages/shop; “Products” Murphy’s Law Moonshine Distillery accessed May 7 2020 https://murphyslawmoonshine.com/collections/all; “Shop” O’Kenny’s Craft Spirits accessed May 7 2020 www.okenny.ca/shop; “Silver Fox Distillery” Facebook accessed May 7 2020 www.facebook.com/silverfoxdistillery; “Products” Top Shelf Distillers accessed May 7 2020 https://topshelfdistillers.com/collections/all; “Shop” Willibald Farm Distillery accessed May 7 2020 https://drinkwillibald.com/collections; “Shop” Wolfhead Distillery accessed May 7 2020 https://drinkwolfhead.com/shop.",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,WOMAN,

The company not only reported a ₹79.7 million loss but its standalone net profit for fiscal year (FY) 2015–16 was also down 35.73 per cent to ₹499.8 million. What was alarming was that the net profit for the previous fiscal year (2014–15) was ₹777.6 million (see Exhibit 1). Despite the dip Franz Cerwinka JCI-Hitachi’s director and chairman was upbeat about the company’s future in India. He expected India to be among the leading markets for JCI-Hitachi by 2020. At the end of 2016 India accounted for nearly 10 per cent of the company’s revenue and was among its top 10 markets. In 2015 with an eye on a promising future based on expected growth over the next five years JCI-Hitachi launched a new range of imported air purifiers. The intent was to expand the business into different segments such as air and water coolers and water purifiers in the face of established competition from market leaders such as Voltas Limited (Voltas) Blue Star Limited (Blue Star) LG Electronics India Private Limited (LG) Samsung India Electronics Limited (Samsung) and Whirlpool India (Whirlpool). Given the dip in earnings and competition was the launch of new products a good idea? If JCI-Hitachi were to go ahead and enter these new segments what strategic capabilities could it leverage? What were the possible obstacles to success in the new segments?company backgroundHitachi LimitedHitachi Limited (Hitachi) headquartered in Tokyo was a highly diversified Japanese manufacturing corporation comprising more than 900 subsidiaries. Hitachi’s journey began in 1910 when its founder Odaira Namihei while still an employee in the electric shop of a Kuhara mining company began experimenting with his own designs and made the first domestically produced five horsepower electric motor. This electric motor became Namihei’s company’s first product and he made two Japanese characters—hi (meaning “sun”) and tachi (meaning “rise”)—enclosed in a circle as the Hitachi logo. In its initial years Hitachi manufactured heavy electrical equipment and industry machinery. However by 2016 it was a global conglomerate in a wide range of sectors: information technology automotive electronic railway urban and power systems digital media consumer goods financial services construction machinery and equipment high-functional materials and components social infrastructure and other systems. Launch of JCI-Hitachi Hitachi entered the Indian market in 1998 as Amtrex-Hitachi Appliances Limited in a strategic alliance with Amtrex Appliances Limited. By 2003 Hitachi had acquired the entire stake from Amtrex Appliances Limited and the company was renamed Hitachi Home and Life Solutions Limited. In 2016 it had a production plant with a capacity of 430000 room air conditioners (RAC) per year five regional offices 20 branch offices 203 exclusive sales and service dealers over 4000 dealer points 33 exclusive showrooms and a wide-ranging product portfolio. The company was a major player in both commercial and household air conditioning (AC) segments. It depended on energy-efficient eco-friendly AC solutions for its future growth strategy and brand identity. It won many awards between 2013 and 2016 such as the Frost & Sullivan award for product leadership in 2013 and the best manufacturer brand of BEE star labelled appliances in the AC category in 2014. In October 2015 Hitachi Appliances Inc. and Johnson Controls Inc. entered into a joint venture and Hitachi Home and Life Solutions Limited became Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Limited. This partnership aimed to capitalize on the strengths and distribution networks of both companies by combining their diverse product portfolios and marketing channels. The combined company focus was to provide better more energy-efficient and eco-friendly cooling solutions to the Indian customer. To improve the business of its commercial AC segment JCI-Hitachi identified the need to invest in channels marketing promotion and product development. It also aimed to improve its after-sales service by introducing various new modes of complaint registration such as the Hitachi Care mobile app live chat lines and the Hitachi 24x7 customer care service number. PRODUCT PORTFOLIOJCI-Hitachi’s wide product portfolio included window split cassette and duct ACs; tropical inverter product lines; variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems; as well as chillers refrigerators air purifiers and washing machines (see Exhibit 2).Room AC SegmentIn 2016 the window AC share was 14 per cent of the RAC market and contributed 22 per cent of JCI-Hitachi’s overall RAC sales. The company was not promoting the window AC aggressively and promotions were confined to print advertisements. Split ACs had 76 per cent share in the RAC market; JCI-Hitachi’s market share in this fragmented segment was 10 per cent. The inverter AC market which formed 10 per cent of the RAC market contributed to 40 per cent of JCI-Hitachi’s overall sales. The company expected to add another 10 per cent to overall sales by 2020. JCI-Hitachi promoted inverter ACs extensively in outdoor promotions press advertisements television (TV) commercials and online campaigns focusing on energy saving consistency and uninterrupted cooling in Indian weather conditions. Commercial AC SegmentThe commercial AC segment consisted of business-to-business splits cassette ACs ductable ACs VRF systems and chillers. Used in commercial institutional and industrial buildings this segment contributed to approximately 37 per cent of the ₹59 billion market. JCI-Hitachi’s most promising segment VRF continued to show robust growth because of its widespread use in the hospitality entertainment banking education residential and industrial sectors. The company’s ductable range had four different models designed with built-in features unique to each model and was used in small corporate offices banquet halls small hospitals and so on. Chillers were used for wider application areas and had larger cooling capacity. Application-Based AC SegmentApplication-based ACs reflected rapid growth as a result of considerable progress in the parent industries of telecommunications (telecom) and banking. In 2016 demand from the telecom industry substantially decreased because of the increasing debts of telecom players. JCI-Hitachi’s Spacemaker AC however had a near monopoly in this segment and was expected to continue serving its existing base. The company was continuously developing new products and technologies to meet the evolving requirements of the industry.Home Appliance SegmentJCI-Hitachi marked its entry into the home appliance segment in 2005 with refrigerators and washing machines. Despite a limited range it was a niche player in that market. In 2016 the company’s refrigerator and washing machine segments had 43 and 4 stock-keeping units respectively. The home appliance segment contributed to 9 per cent of the total business share. In 2015 the Indian refrigerator market was worth US$1.45 billion and was expected to grow by 10 per cent by 2020. In the same year JCI-Hitachi’s refrigerator segment had a market share of 0.6 per cent and the company was looking to expand it to cater to a larger market. Because of low demand for its self-cleaning washing machines JCI-Hitachi was struggling in this segment. The air purifier market size of ₹7.5 billion was expected to grow threefold because of concerns over deteriorating air quality; JCI-Hitachi entered this market with a range of air purifiers to capitalize on the situation. With a market share of 23.6 per cent Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd. led this segment. Usha International Ltd. followed with 15.7 per cent. Other brands were Bajaj Electricals Ltd. (9.2 per cent) Orient Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning Service (9.0 per cent) and Havells India Ltd. (7.2 per cent). For JCI-Hitachi this product category showed a positive response and looked promising for future growth.MAJOR COMPETITORSVoltas With multiple products an ever increasing distribution footprint and high dealer margins Voltas was the market leader in the AC segment. The company reported revenue of ₹58.32 billion in FY 2015–16 a growth of 13 per cent over the previous year. It also led the RAC segment with a market share of 21 per cent. It had products such as water coolers and water dispensers in addition to ACs and commercial refrigeration products.LGLG was a major player in the domestic electric appliances segment with a wide and innovative collection of refrigerators ovens cooktops microwaves dishwashers washers dryers window ACs water purifiers vacuum cleaners TVs mobiles music systems and computer products. LG’s aim for a growth of 30 per cent in 2016 with a focus on new categories like water and air purifiers paid off. Its gross revenue reached ₹144.98 billion in 2015–16 compared to 139.37 billion in 2014–15.Blue StarBlue Star had a wide portfolio of products such as commercial refrigeration ACs water purifiers water coolers and air purifiers. The company reported revenue of ₹35.47 billion in FY 2015–16 a growth of 15 per cent over the previous year.SamsungSamsung provided solutions in the consumer electronics information technology and telecom sectors. Its product range included colour TVs mobile phones home appliances and different types of ACs. The company’s revenue crossed the US$7 billion mark in 2015–16 a rise of 19 per cent over the previous year.WhirlpoolWhirlpool was another major player. The company’s product range included home appliances ACs water purifiers air purifiers and built-in appliances. Its revenue reached the ₹38.55 billion mark in 2015–16 a 7.8 per cent growth over the previous year.FUTURE POSSIBILITIESBecause the AC business was highly dependent on seasons in India JCI-Hitachi could like most of its competitors consider expanding its product range in the following markets.Air Coolers The air cooler market sold 7 million units worth ₹30 billion in 2015 but only 20 per cent of this volume came from the organized sector. Sales were likely to grow to 10 million units by 2020 as high and rising temperature levels were expected to create greater demand for cooling solutions. In 2015 Voltas launched its range of Fresh-Air Coolers to be a leading air cooler brand within the next three years and bridge the wide gap between fans and ACs. Blue Star followed Voltas into this segment in 2016 with the intent of achieving at least ₹1.5 billion in business from the segment in the next three years. Air coolers with less ownership and running costs than AC had become the mass market option for Indian consumers. With a 50–55 per cent market share in the organized sector Symphony Limited was the market leader. It was followed by Kenstar India at 35 per cent and Bajaj Electricals Ltd. at 15 per cent.Because of rising income and aspiration levels greater brand awareness and a possible reduction in taxation after implementing a proposed goods and service tax air coolers had become a lucrative market for organized players. In 2016 the market penetration was only about 8 per cent whereas more than half of the country’s households were in hot and dry climatic areas which was a big growth opportunity.Water PurifiersIncreasing water pollution and depleting water tables had damaged the quality of drinking water in India. Because water-borne diseases accounted for 77 per cent of all diseases in the country the water purifier market had immense growth potential. In 2015 this ₹42 billion market was considered niche but growth by at least 23 per cent was predicted over the 2014–19 period reaching US$4.1 billion by the end of 2024. The water purifier market in India was highly price sensitive. Intense competition among leading players centred on quality durability price after-sales services and product innovation through technology. The top five players included Eureka Forbes Limited Kent RO Systems Limited Hindustan Unilever Limited Ion Exchange and Tata Chemicals Limited. Eureka Forbes and Kent RO had a combined market share of 65 per cent. Other prominent players included Kelvinator LG Panasonic and Whirlpool.The availability of low-priced purifiers and vendors’ improved distribution networks led to penetration in lower income and rural households. In 2016 Blue Star entered the residential water purifier segment hoping to capture a 15 per cent market share within three years. According to Blue Star joint managing director B. Thiagarajan the decision to enter the segment was to leverage the Blue Star brand and get more mileage from its installation and after-sales service businesses. Water DispensersRising disposable incomes surging demand across industries growing contamination and water resource concerns rapid population growth urbanization industrialization and better health awareness all propelled the demand for water dispensers in India. The promising growth projections of the water dispenser market made it very attractive. The market was expected to grow annually at more than 13 per cent between 2016 and 2021 to a total value of ₹3 billion by 2018 for an estimated 30000 units. Besides market leader Blue Star with a 35 per cent share and major players like Voltas Atlantis and Carrier Midea India Private Limited Chinese products made water dispensers a competitive market.THE WAY AHEADBesides the AC air cooler and air purifier markets competition was rife in newer segments like water dispensers water purifiers and water coolers. Although JCI-Hitachi was an established player in the AC market its decision to enter newer markets was fraught with challenges. The company backed its intention to achieve sustainable profitable growth by investing in new technologies and eco-friendly cost-efficient solutions. It also introduced air purifiers in 2015. Yet with competitors such as Voltas Blue Star LG Samsung and Whirlpool already present in the various air and water solutions segments JCI-Hitachi had to carefully consider its decision to enter newer segments and assess whether the entry would be timely. If the timing indeed was good what strategic capabilities could it leverage? What were the possible obstacles to its success in the new segments?EXHIBIT 1: SELECTED FINANCIALS FOR JCI-HITACHI (IN ₹ MILLIONS)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹67.9047 on December 31 2016.Source: Created by the authors based on Hitachi Home & Life Solutions (India) Limited Annual Reports 2011–2016 accessed December 22 2016 www.jci-hitachi.in/content/investors.EXHIBIT 2: JCI-HITACHI PRODUCT PORTFOLIONotes: AC = air conditioner; VRF = variable refrigerant flow; TM = Twin Motor; QA = Quadricool.Source: Created by the authors based on “Products” Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning accessed December 14 2016 www.jci-hitachi.in/product.endnotes",0,,,,

We must rethink what we do not only transforming our art but also transforming the experience we offer our patrons and how we interact with the rest of the world.”Stratford Festival Campaign Preliminary PlanBeing the executive director of Canada’s Stratford Festival (the festival) was not just a job to Anita Gaffney. As she looked out her office window in January 2016 appreciating the fresh blanket of snow falling outside she contemplated her deep ties to the organization. Three years ago she had been appointed to the festival’s top administrative position and became responsible for the business side of the organization setting up the strategic plan selling tickets fundraising establishing and maintaining relationships with external stakeholders and overseeing student education outreach. More than half a century ago a construction company owned by Gaffney’s father had helped build the festival’s first theatre in Stratford Ontario. The picturesque city featured a collection of stately tree-lined streets and had a population of 30000. It was situated on the Avon River about a two-hour drive from both Toronto and the Canada–U.S. border. Years later in the late 1980s while serving as chair of the festival’s board of governors Gaffney’s father had been instrumental in helping the organization stabilize during turbulent times. Maintaining the festival’s foundation while ensuring its future was now Gaffney’s responsibility. She was determined to do her family history proud and there was much at stake. It was not just about the festival; it was also about the role the organization played in the community and the driver it represented for the city of Stratford.The short-term picture did not worry Gaffney. The 2015 season featuring Hamlet King Lear and The Sound of Music had just ended with some success which was why Gaffney confidently anticipated being able to report a small surplus to her board at the upcoming annual general meeting in March. With a mix of Shakespearean drama including Macbeth and As You Like It musicals including A Chorus Line and A Little Night Music and the expected blockbuster attraction The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe the upcoming season looked equally strong. Meanwhile a low Canadian dollar currently trading below US$0.70 looked likely to drive an increase in U.S. patrons. Simply put the Stratford Festival was sitting on a much stronger financial footing than it had been when Gaffney took over operations in 2012 and faced a CA$3.4 million deficit. In 2013 a long-term reinvention plan had immediately reduced expenses by $3.1 million via layoffs wage freezes and a reduced performance schedule which saw performances cut by one week in both April and October. However the festival had avoided cancelling plays and closing theatres—both considered to be signs of a sure “kiss of death” in the theatre business. On the revenue side marketing and advancement efforts had helped produce operating surpluses of $1.7 million and $795000 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Artistic Director Antoni Cimolino had contributed to the recovery by returning the festival to its roots in 2013 following a move by his predecessor Des McAnuff to feature less Shakespeare more musicals and a higher proportion of new work. In 2013 and 2014 attendance rebounded to 474000 and 467000 respectively up from 432000 in 2012. Ticket revenues reached $29.7 million and $28.3 million as the festival’s average ticket price was reduced in an effort to bring established patrons back and to attract a new audience.As far as the media was concerned the Stratford Festival was back. “After spending a scary 2012 season sinking deeper and deeper into red ink . . . Canada’s biggest theatre festival is enjoying a fiscal comeback that deserves a standing ovation” the Toronto Star noted in 2013. As The Globe and Mail put itStratford is beginning in some ways to look a lot more like it did in the boom years. The Festival Theatre’s thrust stage is being restored to its original configuration. Canadian-written plays are (alas) back on the margins and Canadian stars from the pre-McAnuff era are getting back into the spotlight. Even the coming [2013] season’s playbill rings a bell: Among the offerings are Fiddler on the Roof and The Three Musketeers both programmed on the 1826-seat Festival Theatre in 2000 one of the years when attendance topped 600000. But as Gaffney admired the scenic view outside her office she knew the long-term outlook was not necessarily as pretty as the festival’s hometown. Annual attendance was still below previous levels of more than 500000 which was where the numbers needed to be to ensure long-term operational sustainability. In other words the festival’s belt-tightening and its return to creative roots at a time when the Canadian dollar was in decline were not enough to ensure that the organization would survive its next economic tempest. The festival still needed a long-term and innovative strategy that could generate sustainable growth and make the organization strong enough to weather future economic downturns and exchange rate fluctuations. A new filming initiative to extend the festival’s visibility and market reach internationally showed promise. Over the next decade if all went well this initiative would entail filming all of Shakespeare’s 36 plays for distribution in theatres on DVD and via digital media. However the initiative had just been set back by the loss of one U.S. distribution partner who was pulling out due to low interest from American audiences. A $100 million capital campaign the first major fundraising effort in more than 10 years was also in the works pending final board approval in 2017. It was hoped that this campaign would allow the organization to rebuild the festival’s aging Tom Patterson Theatre and bolster its endowment fund. This campaign represented a tremendous opportunity for the festival to generate new momentum improve its financial stability and offer more innovative programming.Still Gaffney wondered whether these activities would be enough. She also wondered whether she was taking on too much at once. She knew for certain that strong leadership would be required to steer the pending capital campaign and film initiative while pushing for innovation and still keeping daily operations on track. After all managing a creative culture that believed in “excellence at any cost” demanded constant vigilance as resources were limited. But she was up for the challenge. Gaffney had been hired 25 years earlier as an assistant publicist and had worked her way up the ranks to the position of director of marketing before landing her current position and she had never avoided challenges in the past. “When there was something ugly difficult impossible either I volunteered to do it or it happened on my desk. I took on jobs that no one else wanted to do . . . the impossible things.” THE STRATFORD MISSIONWith a reputation for high-quality productions featuring notable stage and movie actors—such as Colm Feore Eric McCormack Jessica Tandy Maggie Smith William Shatner Christopher Plummer and William Hutt—the Stratford Festival was the largest classical repertory company in North America. Its purpose statement read “We will inspire and delight our audiences and serve to transform their perception of the world by creating an unparalleled theatrical experience centred around some of the world’s best plays with a special emphasis on the work of William Shakespeare.”This ambitious mission along with the festival’s multiple commitments—to developing emerging actors through the Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre creating and staging new plays creating educational opportunities for schools and producing related films and documentaries—significantly influenced other theatres across Canada and around the world. As Cimolino said “If we were a hospital we’d be a teaching hospital.” The festival also attracted a veritable village of artistic talent to Stratford not only to the stage but also to the backstage creating and maintaining the festival’s proprietary collection of costumes props and sets.BIRTH OF A FESTIVALOriginally devoted solely to Shakespeare’s works the Stratford Festival was conceived by local journalist Tom Patterson who incorporated the Stratford Shakespearean Festival of Canada as a not-for-profit legal entity on October 31 1952. Patterson knew almost nothing about live theatre. He simply felt a theatre devoted to Shakespeare’s plays would be a natural fit for the Ontario railway town named after the Bard’s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon.Productions were initially presented in a giant canvas tent fronting Stratford’s Avon River. The main Festival Theatre was constructed in 1957. With seating for 1824 the festival’s first permanent home was famous for its unique thrust stage that extended into the audience. Amphitheatre seating and Roman-style stage entrances from under the audience provided an intimate and engaging experience that became the festival’s trademark. Over the years the festival’s footprint grew with the acquisition or lease of three other buildings in the city’s downtown core (see Exhibit 1). Built in 1901 as a vaudeville house the festival’s second-largest venue the Avon Theatre with capacity for 1093 patrons was initially rented in the 1950s then purchased and renovated. The 260-capacity Studio Theatre was added to the Avon Theatre complex in 2002 in a space that formerly housed a scenery shop. The barn-like Tom Patterson Theatre which seated 487 patrons was leased from the City of Stratford. Additional venues dramatically increased the festival’s theatrical operations while allowing the festival to offer an increased number of classes workshops and forums with actors and directors. Several plays were eventually presented at the same time throughout the April–October performance season. While many actors appeared together in several different productions no two productions shared an identical cast. As a result up to four different plays could rotate on each stage which resulted in complicated rehearsal and performance schedules.Venue expansion eventually turned the Stratford Festival into Ontario’s third-largest tourist attraction following Niagara Falls and the City of Toronto. It also greatly increased its local economic impact and staffing requirements. According to the Conference Board of Canada the repertory theatre system Gaffney managed with an annual operating budget of approximately $60 million indirectly generated 3000 local jobs $140 million in annual regional economic activity and $55.8 million in taxes. By 2016 more than 200 actors directors and designers were typically employed by the festival throughout its eight-month schedule. Over the course of the full year 1000 other direct jobs were created and approximately 250 of these were full-time. Many festival employees had more than 20 years of service. Approximately two-thirds belonged to three different unions that negotiated seasonal contracts pay structure benefits and working conditions. In 2016 the major industries in Stratford were agriculture automotive manufacturing and tourism. The biggest employers in town were the festival and the hospital.TICKET SALESAlthough attendance fluctuated throughout its 60-year history the Stratford Festival—like other live theatre operations around the world—experienced a significant decline in attendance during the first decade of the 21st century as a result of turbulent economic conditions and increased competition. Patrons and potential patrons were concerned about a host of financial issues from job security and investment returns to the overall price of a trip to Stratford. U.S. patrons in nearby Michigan Illinois Ohio and New York who at that time represented 25 per cent of the festival’s ticket sales were also concerned about travel issues related to the thickening Canada–U.S. border as a result of global security concerns.Stratford was a destination—that is people needed to make a conscious decision to visit the Stratford Festival. The area had few other tourist attractions so the experience needed to be worth a two- six- or eight-hour drive. For example the Stratford Festival differed from the Shaw Festival: when tourists travelled to the Niagara area they had access to the Shaw Festival plus other tourist attractions—Niagara Falls wineries the casino and so forth. The festival surveyed its customers and more than 90 per cent indicated they were travelling to Stratford primarily for the festival. In addition when people visited Stratford they immersed themselves in the theatre experience. They could choose from multiple productions on any given day. They might run into the actors in the coffee shops. They could attend forum events—talks debates discussions and showcases throughout the season. People felt a real sense of engagement and closeness to the festival. Said Gaffney “We work to give people an experience that is going to make them think that is going to change their perspective of the world. The plays and events connect with that.”Following the festival’s 2013 turnaround efforts ticket sales started to improve (see Exhibit 2). But 2015 sales of 472000 were still well off the 600000 record achieved during the festival’s 50th anniversary in 2002.The festival received approximately 70 per cent of its revenue through the box office. Another 20 per cent of the revenues came through private fundraising. Most of the donors gave to the festival and the leadership because they trusted the vision. A small portion of the revenues came from government sources (for example from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Ontario Arts Council).According to the festival’s 2013 forecast model every sales decline of 10000 tickets represented a $700000 loss in revenue (see Exhibit 3). As a result there was little room for mistakes when selecting the plays for a season’s program. Said Gaffney: When you do the analysis of the shows and the people who come here if you take away one of those segments of shows you take away that segment of customer. So if you don’t have a 20th-century play like a Eugene O’Neill or a Tennessee Williams . . . there were some segments in certain years that were missing as a result. What was happening was we’d have one blockbuster that would carry the day and in 2012 we didn’t have that show and so it revealed we were relying on one show to make it all work. As things stood in 2016 the festival had become heavily dependent on its two musicals which represented 50 per cent of all tickets sold while the other half of total sales was split thinly among approximately 10 plays. Gaffney commented: This is a mad profession to be in. The success of a show is not always predictable. We’ve done titles that you’d think [had] the right actors in [them] [had] broad appeal lots of flash on the stage and yet did not connect with the audience for some reason. We can think a show is fabulous and we’re excited about it. It opens and the critics and audience may hate it.AUDIENCEThree significant age groups made up about 80 per cent of the Stratford Festival’s audience. Students accounted for 10 per cent; baby boomers aged 65–74 made up 22 per cent and adults aged 45–64 accounted for 48 per cent. Tracked by country approximately 75 per cent of ticket sales came from Canada and most of the remaining 25 per cent came from the United States. Less than 1 per cent of ticket revenues came from 74 countries outside North America the most prominent being the United Kingdom and Japan. About 35 per cent of the audience came from Toronto.Ticket revenues were also divided according to six different patron categories: established new lapsed groups schools and other. Audience demographics were then even more finely sifted to examine categories from gender and age to occupation household income education vacation habits leisure activities and books read.A big concern remained how to bring a new and more diverse audience to the festival. Gaffney explained that the festival needed to be very careful to really understand who was attending the different plays and to ensure that it had something to offer those individuals. She said “So for instance with our school audience we have to be very careful that we’ve got a blockbuster Shakespeare they can come to. This year we’re also doing The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe—a C.S. Lewis novel—and it’s great for elementary [school] students.”The settings of the Shakespearean plays were occasionally changed to make them a bit less traditional. Gaffney explained: This year we’re doing a production of As You Like It which is set in 1980s Newfoundland. A couple of years ago we did a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It started with a same-sex marriage at the beginning of the play. Every production is very carefully set in a certain time period. Our current artistic director doesn’t ascribe to doing things just to be quirky.MARKETINGUnlike nearby theatre companies such as Toronto’s Mirvish Productions or Niagara-on-the-Lake’s Shaw Festival the Stratford Festival had very little help from complementary municipal tourism advertising or marketing. In fact the City of Stratford relied heavily on the festival to draw visitors to its restaurants shops and accommodations. More than 90 per cent of local tourists came specifically to see plays. Some investment in the community of Stratford was happening but there were not a lot of other tourist attractions in the area.In each of the past two years the Stratford Festival spent approximately $8 million (15 per cent of its budget) on marketing and sales efforts down approximately $1.1 million from 2011 when marketing costs reached 16 per cent of expenses. By comparison the City of Stratford had a tourism office that spent between $300000 and $400000 annually. Sales and marketing represented the festival’s second-highest single expense. Production spending topped the financial statement at $30 million. In the past four years the organization’s marketing spend was a combination of mass-market (print and outdoor) campaigns and more pinpointed digital interest-based advertising aimed at 45–74 year olds. Demographic research on the festival’s audience showed the top two activities festival patrons enjoyed were gardening (62 per cent) and spending time at the cottage with family (40 per cent). Hiking and cycling were a close tie at 29 and 28 per cent respectively. To attract new patrons the festival planned to increase digital advertising which currently represented 31 per cent of the overall marketing spend. It also intended to continue to connect with existing patrons through call centre operations direct mail and email channels while also reaching out to this group by targeting professional and alumni associations social clubs and service clubs.The Stratford Festival spent between $800000 and $1 million annually on the education market (teachers and students) which amounted to $15–$17 per student visitor in recent years. The investment was viewed as a good way to cultivate future regular customers. In past years as many as 53000 students attended the festival’s Shakespearean and family-focused plays every year. A good proportion participated in some form of enrichment program with the festival’s education department which offered pre-show chats in-class visits with artists and post-show Q&As. However despite these efforts the school segment was in decline dropping to 47000 in 2014. Shakespeare was no longer required reading in local school curriculums; it was now merely an option in the school system. As a result many new teachers had little exposure to Shakespeare’s collected works. Even with the festival’s education program outreach efforts—to help teachers feel more comfortable teaching Shakespeare to have students experience Shakespeare’s plays and to get students on their feet thinking about how music movement and dance could all be part of a scene—getting into the schools to get teachers’ attention was becoming more difficult. Ontario teachers had become increasingly busy with government-mandated extracurricular activities which reduced the time available and the interest in class field trips. Gaffney observed “When we survey patrons later in life they will always cite that their first experience was on a school bus when they came as a kid. And actually maybe not even here. But they went to a theatre some place as a student and so they have some acquaintance with the art form that hopefully grows over time.” She continued: “Transforming education is something that’s on my mind a lot. There’s an imminent pressure to do so because if we rebuild the Tom Patterson Theatre then education is going to be a big part of it. How would we bring in more people? What’s the case for having an education space in this theatre?”Adults aged 45–64 did not just represent the largest portion of the festival’s audience (48 per cent). People in this demographic also accounted for a slightly higher percentage of the festival’s overall performance revenue because they weren’t eligible for the discounts offered to seniors and the under-30 crowd. A very small but extremely valuable piece of this audience segment vacationed in Stratford taking in multiple plays while staying in local lodgings and eating in local high-end restaurants. Adults aged 45–64 also tended to be significant donors. But while this group was definitely the most significant part of the festival’s “established patrons” group it also represented a large portion of its “lapsed patrons.” As a result while the middle-aged group was still being cultivated the festival was focusing on attracting new younger customers. The “under-45” category now made up the largest portion of its “new patron” group.CURRENT DIFFERENTIATION EFFORTSThe festival’s proposed reinvention plan included an ambition “to shift the festival from being viewed as a high-quality organization to one that is both high quality and highly innovative delivering experiences that connect meaningfully with our patrons and that stimulate discourse that emanates beyond our borders.” The goal was to differentiate the festival from Toronto’s Mirvish Theatre the National Ballet and the Shaw Theatre in Niagara-on-the-Lake while positioning it in the same category as London’s National Theatre and New York’s Metropolitan Opera (see Exhibit 4). Innovation or differentiation could take many forms: new production techniques and staging new scripts restaging Shakespeare in a more modern time adaptations gender- and race-blind plays as well as film and digitizing the library.During visits to New York’s Metropolitan Opera and London’s National Theatre Gaffney had noted initiatives that aimed to extend those brands’ experiences through filming and distributing select plays to movie theatres. Although not directly competitive with the Stratford Festival the National Theatre did present a threat in this area since it had been the first out of the gate. Gaffney feared another Shakespeare festival in North America such as the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre or the Oregon Shakespeare Festival might also move ahead with film initiatives before the Stratford Festival did so making it more difficult for the festival to carve out a competitive niche. In 2013 she presented the festival’s board of directors with the Stratford@Play business plan a proposal to heighten awareness for the festival’s brand internationally by sharing the festival experience with audiences in Canadian and U.S. movie theatres. The plan called for the filming of all 36 of Shakespeare’s plays over the next 10 years at a rate of about three each year. This initiative fit the festival’s ambition to be more innovative and to take bolder actions in an effort to attract more people. Before doing a full rollout of Stratford@Play Gaffney tested the marketplace by filming several plays—Caesar and Cleopatra Twelfth Night and The Tempest—selling 10000–15000 tickets per play through Cineplex. Gaffney felt that number could eventually grow to 20000 with an international reach. The National Theatre sold 50000 tickets for the majority of its screenings and 150000–200000 for more popular titles such as Frankenstein and The Audience.Unlike the National Theatre Stratford had the support of its unions to record its selected Shakespearean plays and distribute them in movie theatres and online through DVDs iTunes and Amazon. The festival hoped to take its digital product into schools to entice teachers and students back to Stratford. It received a government grant for the first three years of filming.But executing the film project was not a simple matter. Producing the films involved bringing a Toronto film production crew into the main festival theatre to capture a matinee performance of each of the selected productions then following up with close-up filming later the same day and several weeks of post-production work. Distribution agreements with cinemas such as Cineplex in Canada and Fathom in the United States were required which meant that multiple contracts needed to be signed. The cost for producing and distributing the first three films in 2014 was estimated at $2.1 million with anticipated revenue from tax credits cinemas downloads and fundraising of $720000 per film.Two years into the initiative with six filmed plays now completed Gaffney was able to break even on the films and saw just $100000–$200000 in incremental earned revenues annually. In Canada Cineplex remained supportive as a distribution partner. However although the festival’s plays were being shown on 300 screens in the United States Fathom was pulling out due to low attendance and disappointing financial performance. Meanwhile the film business—which was not the festival’s core product—was now occupying a disproportionate amount of Gaffney’s time and energy. While the project was innovative and progressive eight years remained to film Shakespeare’s entire 36-play canon and it remained uncertain how this project would fit into much larger plans. Gaffney knew Stratford@Play could pull her down if it were not properly staffed and managed. She was determined to continue with the initiative for a few years to see whether it would pick up momentum and commercial appeal.FUNDRAISING EFFORTSAlthough the Stratford Festival contributed significantly to regional economic activity it received relatively little in government support. In 2014 the festival received just $3.8 million or 6 per cent of its total revenues from provincial and federal government grants yet it contributed close to $60 million in taxes. By comparison private fundraising normally contributed approximately $12 million annually while contributions from the festival’s $72 million endowment fund averaged between $1 million and $2 million per year.Gaffney wondered whether the time was right to launch a new fundraising initiative. It had been 10 years since the festival had wrapped up its most recent endowment campaign. Entitled “For All Time” this campaign had raised $50 million. The “Act III” capital campaign conducted 20 years ago had generated $15.2 million from private and government donors. If approved the proposed new $100 million capital and endowment campaign (intended to raise $60 million in capital and $40 million for an endowment) named “Vision 20/20” would be the most ambitious fundraising effort in the festival’s history. The funds would help finance educational outreach and innovative new programming but the major goal was to raise money to replace the Tom Patterson Theatre with a new multi-purpose facility.The Tom Patterson Theatre typically hosted 40000–60000 patrons for three or four core festival productions roughly 180 performances each season. But the brand experience offered by this venue was not ideal. The temporary nature of the 470-seat auditorium meant it was cramped; its seats had limited legroom making it almost impossible to exit in the midst of a performance; and it lacked key amenities enjoyed by customers at other festival theatres such as lounges bars and a posh lobby. A rebuilt Tom Patterson Theatre would feature an education facility; a digital media studio; rehearsal space; a parking structure; and expanded capacity for festival courses forum events and workshops. However while the experience would be enhanced the seating would increase only modestly to 600 still roughly just one-third the size of the festival’s 1800-seat main theatre. The logic for the limited increase in seating was based on maintaining the theatre’s reputation as an intimate venue for enjoying Shakespeare. A rebuilt Tom Patterson Theatre was an exciting tangible project that held the promise to lure patrons back to Stratford. A less glamorous but still viable alternative would be to renovate rather than rebuild the venue. That option would allow the capital campaign to focus on bolstering the festival’s endowment funds to support programming improvements at current venues. While the Tom Patterson Theatre would remain rustic and functional it would not be the potential future festival showpiece envisioned by management. In other words a renovation was seen as a “Band-Aid” solution that would not fully exploit the venue’s scenic location or provide an inspiring new creative environment for the future.Before moving forward with a rebuild however the festival needed to hire new staff and fundraising consultants—not to mention a lobbyist and an architect—just to determine whether the plan was feasible. Meanwhile Gaffney’s fundraising department needed an architect’s model to “sell the vision” before an architect was even hired. The board had put the ball squarely in Gaffney’s court with a recent $500000 commitment to study project feasibility. However directors were growing nervous thanks to the Ontario government’s recent wave of austerity. With provincial and municipal elections coming in 2018 the organization needed to quickly secure funding commitments before there were any changes in leadership. That of course was easier said than done. Stratford’s mayor who accompanied Gaffney to government meetings in Ottawa and Toronto had already indicated the city’s willingness to support the project. But the festival was looking to both the provincial and federal governments for $20 million each in support; the remaining $20 million was expected to come from private donors. Thus collaboration with all levels of government was required and each level of government’s support was contingent on that of the others. At the federal and provincial levels officials wanted tangible proof that the project would garner private support. Meanwhile potential private donors wanted assurances the politicians were onside.NEXT STEPS?The festival’s most recent five-year strategic plan developed following the $3.4 million deficit in 2012 was coming to an end and a new vision for future prosperity was now required to reassure the board that the organization was on the right path. Whether that meant adopting new theatrical approaches or introducing new programming change was obviously needed. “Y",,,,,
u don’t get the same traction or attention when you’re in a holding pattern” Gaffney explained. “We need to be introducing new things all the time. It’s critically important; otherwise people will think you’ve gone to sleep and then [they’ll think] it doesn’t matter if they don’t get to Stratford this year—there’s always next year.”As the Stratford Festival Campaign Preliminary Plan noted “To really make our mark internationally we need many more projects in the pipeline and we need a far greater appetite for risk. Risk is the inevitable —and necessary—handmaid of invention.” But while introducing a new capital campaign would generate excitement it could also backfire if any of the internal or external stakeholders lost interest or if management was distracted by the film initiative. With or without funding for a new Tom Patterson Theatre attendance still needed to be managed for the next four years. As Gaffney watched snow fall outside her office she knew in her heart that the festival currently lacked the budget and the will to sustain risk. That made her wonder whether the festival should lower its expectations and budgets at least temporarily and perhaps scale back its productions. Was it time to think big and strengthen the festival’s resources for greater resiliency through more innovation? Growing revenues outside of attendance would not be easy but with the festival’s current challenges and susceptibility to economic swings she knew that new and innovative approaches would be required to place the festival on a stable footing for the long term. Gaffney also knew there was much more at stake than just the health of the festival. Like her father she felt a personal responsibility toward the City of Stratford itself. And knowing her father had kept going when things were tough because it was the right thing to do for the festival and its hometown community gave her strength. She remembered him saying “I can’t let it be somebody from Stratford that lets this thing down.” Gaffney felt the same way.Exhibit 1: Stratford Theatre MapSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: the Stratford festival’s Ticket sales 2011–2014Source: Company files.Exhibit 3: THE Stratford festival’s surplus/shortfall scenarios at various sales thresholdsSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: THE stratfoRd Festival’s Ambition MatrixSource: Company files.,1,WHITE,WESTERN EUROPE,WOMAN,,

The beautiful Saturday morning was ruined when a 22-year-old shooter arrived on the scene and shot Giffords in the head. In the spree the shooter killed six people that day and wounded at least 10 others. The target of the shooting Giffords was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.Mary Reed had been waiting in line with her daughter to take a picture with Representative Giffords the day of the shooting. When the shooter arrived he began shooting down the line. Reed pushed her daughter against a wall and protected her with her own body. Reed’s husband and son were off to the side and escaped behind the corner of a building. Reed was shot in the arm and in the back an injury that left her with chronic back pain since. Having survived the shooting Reed joined a protest held on October 29 2014 organized by the advocacy groups Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (Moms Demand Action) and Everytown for Gun Safety (Everytown). The protest took place at the annual general meeting of The Kroger Co. (Kroger) and Reed wanted to tell the investors her story. Kroger a large U.S. food retailer allowed customers to carry weapons in stores where state laws permitted it. The protest group wanted Kroger to change its policy and ban the presence of guns from all of its stores including those in states where it was legal to conceal and carry a weapon. Although the 2011 shooting in Tucson had not taken place inside or outside a Kroger store gun control advocates were demanding action from Kroger and other similar stores. Reed expressed her concern for customer safety at stores such as Kroger. She explained that her shooter had stood inside the Safeway supermarket in Tucson for 15 minutes with his gun in the back of his pants. No one had expected him to start shooting people. Because Arizona allowed weapons to be concealed and carried it was not out of the ordinary for people to carry guns into stores in Tucson. Reed articulated her concerns about customer safety: Now I think do I go up to someone with a gun and see if they’re behaving oddly? Are they there looking for somebody? I’d prefer when I’m shopping at Kroger to be focused on the produce and not have to calculate the risk management of being around people who feel the need to shop with loaded guns around children.Reed was a gun owner herself but after experiencing this tragic shooting outside the Safeway store she questioned the necessity of carrying firearms into public stores. “I was saved by an unarmed 60-year-old woman and two unarmed 70-year-old men” she said recalling how civilians had wrestled the shooter to the ground as he tried to reload his weapon. Reed added “There was an off-duty sheriff who was a few feet away. But this all happened in 22 seconds. It wasn’t in slow motion like in the movies.”Reed claimed that Kroger had a duty to create a safe environment for its shoppers by banning guns from all of its stores. She believed that allowing all citizens to carry guns did not necessarily make stores safer and that it should not be her duty to “calculate the risk management” as she shopped for groceries. After all her attacker had been disarmed and detained by unarmed citizens. Could a tragic event like the one that happened outside the Safeway store happen at a Kroger store if Kroger did not take the extra precaution of banning firearms from its stores? After the protest on October 29 2014 Kroger elected to maintain its status quo: customers could carry weapons in the store if the state law permitted it. However incidents of gun violence increased over the following years and gun control advocates were exerting more pressure. Given increasing public concern about shootings in public places should Kroger reconsider its original statement and ask its customers to abstain from their right to carry a gun while shopping to ensure that customers perceived the stores as safe and family friendly?company profile and historyKroger was founded in 1883 when founder Barney Kroger used his life savings to open a grocery store at 66 Pearl Street in Cincinnati Ohio. Mr. Kroger ran his store based on the simple motto “Be particular. Never sell anything you would not want yourself.” In 1901 Kroger became the first grocery store in the United States to establish its own bakery. The store was also the first to sell meat and groceries in the same building. Then Mr. Kroger began manufacturing his own products in his Cincinnati store. As the company grew so did the variety of food products it manufactured. By 2017 40 per cent of Kroger’s private-label products were made at one of its own manufacturing plants. Kroger had a total of 38 manufacturing plants with the products produced by the plants making up 26 per cent of Kroger’s total dollar sales. This created an impressive sales advantage because one could not find Kroger products sold elsewhere.Kroger’s stores were the first to formalize consumer research in the 1970s. The stores interviewed 4000 people at that time. In 2014 the number of people the stores had interviewed had grown to 9.6 million. In 1972 in a continuing series of firsts Kroger became the first grocery store to use electronic scanners. By 2017 Kroger was still incorporating new technology into its stores.Kroger offered a variety of combination stores in 2017. These stores served a wide range of consumers and included multi-department stores supermarkets price impact warehouse stores and convenience stores. Gun laws and RetailersThe Second Amendment of the United States Constitution granted “the right of the people to keep and bear arms.” The language of the complete amendment was not clear leaving room for debate about what was intended with the right but it was generally accepted that the amendment granted each and every individual citizen—military and civilian—the right to bear arms. There was no federal law that governed whether and how permits to carry guns would be issued; therefore each state was left to establish its own laws.All American states to some degree allowed firearms to be concealed and carried. The rules governing concealing and carrying and to whom permits could be issued varied greatly from state to state. Out of the 50 U.S. states 38 required a state-issued permit to carry a concealed weapon in public; 12 states allowed concealed weapons without a permit. The state-issued permit was known as a “CCW” (carrying concealed weapon). Nearly all states had restrictions on where weapons could be carried; restricted locations included bars schools hospitals and public sporting events. To “conceal and carry” a gun meant to carry a gun that was not visible in plain sight. There were three types of conceal-and-carry laws known colloquially as “unrestricted” “shall issue” and “may issue.” States with unrestricted laws did not require citizens to obtain permits or licences to own a gun although some of these states did restrict in which public places guns could be carried. States that followed “shall issue” rules granted a permit to anyone who met the minimum qualifications set by the state. “May issue” states required a permit to conceal and carry but whether the permit would be granted depended on varying factors. Each state set its own rules concerning who could be issued permits; some states were stricter than others. For example to carry a gun in the state of New Jersey a person who was not a law enforcement officer had to demonstrate “justifiable need” meaning that the person needed the gun for self-protection and that there was no other way to reasonably achieve that protection. Almost all states allowed what was known as “open carry” meaning that citizens who were granted a permit for a gun could carry one in public in plain sight. Only three states and Washington D.C. prohibited open carry of any firearm. Another three states prohibited only open carry of handguns. However there were certain situations when even these states allowed a person to openly carry a firearm. For example in Illinois a gun owner was allowed to open carry a gun for hunting. U.S. midterm elections were held in 2014 and gun laws were a major topic of debate. The campaign was used as a platform for advocates on both sides of the issue. By then Moms Demand Action had already used their protests and campaigns to bring various companies across the United States including Kroger Target Corporation (Target) Panera Bread (Panera) and Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks) into the debate. Many of the establishments that requested that customers refrain from bringing guns into their stores stated that this request was not a political stance but rather a way of creating a store atmosphere that promoted family values.Panera and Starbucks complied with the requests of gun control advocates. Panera wanted to avoid making a political statement while still expressing what its stores stood for and who it wanted in its stores. Panera issued a statement insisting that allowing or not allowing firearms into its stores affected the store’s community atmosphere: “The request is simply [that] we recognize everyone’s rights. But we also recognize that we are building communities in our cafes and [we] are where people come to catch a breath.”Starbucks also wanted to avoid making a political statement. It did not appreciate being dragged into the political debate about gun control but to avoid damaging the relationships it had with its consumers and to promote a certain atmosphere within Starbucks stores the company opted to request that consumers not bring guns to their stores. Starbucks’ chief executive officer (CEO) Howard Schultz addressed the political undertone in an interview with CNBC television: “Starbucks is not a policy maker and we are not pro- or anti-gun. However over the last few months or so we have seen ourselves thrust into this debate in a way that is not consistent with the values and guiding principles of our company. … [B]ut guns should not be part of the Starbucks experience.”Advocacy groups also successfully involved large retailers in the gun policy issue. Kroger like many other retailers and even its competitors had to decide whether it should comply with the requests of gun control advocates and how new gun control policies if implemented would impact the company’s public relations and ultimately its sales and profits. gun safety Advocacy GroupsThe advocacy group Reed joined Moms Demand Action was started in 2012 one day after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut. Founded by stay-at-home mom Shannon Watts the organization started as a Facebook group; within a year the group had grown to over 130000 members with chapters in all 50 U.S. states. Moms Demand Action was a grassroots organization that largely worked at the community level raising awareness about gun safety issues and encouraging U.S. citizens to lobby their senators to vote for laws that promoted gun safety. Moms Demand Action was not attempting to change the Second Amendment; however to prevent gun violence the group wanted stronger laws governing how citizens bore arms.A second advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns (MAIG) was formed earlier in 2006 by Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City and Thomas Menino former mayor of Boston. MAIG worked at the policy level lobbying lawmakers to promote and advocate laws that decreased gun violence. In 2017 the organization consisted of more than 1000 current and former mayors.In 2014 the two advocacy groups came together under one new umbrella Everytown for Gun Safety the largest gun violence prevention program in the United States. The new organization was backed by Bloomberg who planned to spend as much as US$50 million advocating for gun control in the 2014 U.S. midterm elections. The groups organized protests to urge large corporations to promote gun control and to urge retailers to create safer store policies on guns. With the strength of the new umbrella organization Moms Demand Action petitioned retailers such as Target and Starbucks to change store policies so that guns would not be allowed in the stores. The organization targeted companies that were family-oriented believing that families should not be made vulnerable to gun violence in the stores that marketed to them. Gun Safety Advocacy Groups and KrogerMoms Demand Action successfully petitioned Target to ban customers from bringing guns into its stores. After the gun control advocacy group collected almost 400000 signatures on a petition Target complied and requested that consumers not bring guns into its stores. Everytown and Moms Demand Action then turned their attention to Kroger together soliciting over 300000 signatures on a petition: Numerous shootings and gun rallies have taken place at Kroger brand stores in recent years. The company policies that have enabled this to happen are not in line with its core values which include creating a “safe and secure workplace and shopping environment.” Most states have weak gun laws that let people openly carry guns even if they haven’t had a background check or training. Private businesses like Kroger have the responsibility to protect their customers when the law won’t. Moms Demand Action made 12000 calls to Kroger’s corporate offices. They also spent thousands of dollars on a controversial advertising blitz that generated significant media attention. In media interviews Shannon Watts founder of Moms Demand Action asked “Why is Kroger asking customers—the vast majority of whom are women and moms—to handle their risk management for them? . . . How are we to determine the difference between an armed robber and a person carrying a gun to make a political statement?” According to Moms Demand Action 83 per cent of Kroger’s customers agreed that the retailer was not putting safety first. U.S. Senators Chris Murphy Richard Blumenthal and Dianne Feinstein supported gun control advocates and together they also petitioned Kroger writing Kroger’s CEO Rodney McMullen:We write today to urge you to adopt a policy that would prohibit the open carry of firearms in your stores. In doing so Kroger would be sending an important message about your commitment to the safety of your employees and customers. Gun Rights AdvocatesAdvocacy for gun control was not without its opposition. In 2013 U.S. Representative Michael Speciale contributed to a debate over passing gun legislation amendments arguing in favour of sustaining conceal and carry laws: “It’s silly these laws that tell you that you can’t carry here you can’t carry there. The only ones who pay attention to the law are the law-abiding citizens. A lot of the laws just lack common sense.” Speciale’s statement reflected the beliefs of many gun rights advocates about the regulation of firearms: The only people affected by the regulation of firearms were the citizens who would abide by the regulations; those seeking to do harm would not comply with laws or regulations in any event. Another concern for gun rights advocates surfaced during the gun control debate of 2013. These advocates became concerned that the additional gun regulations would eventually lead to the banning of all guns. Gun rights advocates argued that owners of concealed handguns were able to protect themselves and others if they needed to and taking away the right to carry their guns would only embolden attackers because the attackers would know that their victims would be weaponless. Gun rights advocates were backed by Suzanna Hupp a former member of the Texas House of Representatives. In 1991 23 people were killed in a restaurant that had banned guns. Hupp was dining in the restaurant with her parents on that day. She had a concealed handgun permit but had left her gun in her car in compliance with the state law at the time. The shooter killed both of Hupp’s parents. Hupp believed that if she had had her gun with her in the restaurant that day she would have been able to protect her parents from the attacker.kroger’s options in 2014 Gun control advocates had petitioned multiple companies to ban guns from their stores; some companies like Starbucks and Target complied but others refused. Those that refused indicated that they wanted to or felt obliged to uphold citizens’ right to conceal and carry a gun. Option 1: Comply with the Requests of Gun Control Advocates If Kroger was not putting its customers’ safety first those customers would question whether Kroger was worth their support. Ignoring political pressure from U.S. senators could also suggest that the company did not care about its customers’ and employees’ safety. If the public adopted this view Kroger’s business would suffer—it would lose valuable employees who did not feel safe and customers who felt that Kroger was not prioritizing their safety could stop shopping at Kroger and convince others to do the same. This would eventually hurt Kroger’s sales and profits. If Kroger did comply with the requests of gun control advocates the retailer could benefit from good publicity and an increase in sales. Customers and employees might view Kroger as a safer place to shop and work. Option 2: Do Not Comply with the Requests of Gun Control AdvocatesAlthough all 50 states allowed some level of conceal and carry the demographics and cultural views on gun laws differed state to state. The state laws could be seen as a reflection of American cultural values suggesting that not all of Kroger’s customers would feel the need to ban guns from Kroger stores. If Kroger chose to support the gun control advocates’ petition and implement a nationwide policy on banning guns the retailer risked offending customers who enjoyed the right to conceal and carry in their state and who might feel unsafe if they could not carry a gun.Kroger had to be careful with any statement it made or position it took because any action could be taken by customers as a political message that involved more than customer safety. If Kroger continued to allow guns in its stores it could be indicating it favoured gun rights advocates and customers complying with their requests.If Kroger did side with gun rights advocates those customers would potentially feel safer and more secure in Kroger stores and thus convince others that Kroger was a safer place to shop. This could potentially lead to an increase in sales. Obviously this decision would offend customers who were gun control advocates.Option 3: Make a CompromiseKroger could attempt to please both those customers who advocated for gun safety and those who advocated for gun rights. Each store could evaluate its demographics and local custom then decide whether it would allow guns into its store. Each store would be better fit to serve its customers’ needs. This might better serve consumers on both sides of the gun policy issue.In 2013 office supplies retailer Staples Inc. (Staples) allowed individual stores to determine their own gun policy. An individual store could prohibit guns but there was no explicit corporate policy regarding the banning of firearms. This meant that unless an individual store stated otherwise a person could carry a firearm into a Staples store within the limits of the state laws. Although local decision-making allowed the company to better serve its consumers based on geography the policy did not please Moms Demand Action. After calling on Starbucks to ban guns from its stores Moms Demand Action called on Staples to do the same—across the whole corporation. Staples made no comment in reply to the call but it was evident that its customers were sensitive to the gun issue. In June 2013 Staples was criticized by Second Amendment advocates for rejecting an effort a small gun store made to enter a contest run by Staples for small businesses. The criticism was enough for Staples to apologize and to promise to change its store rules for future competitions.In 2013 and 2014 Staples fell short of its target goals for sales growth. In 2015 its sales growth was 3.42 per cent short of its goal. These were the years following Moms Demand Action’s lobbying Staples to ban guns from its stores and Staples’ refusal to allow the gun store in the small business competition. Kroger’s ResponseIn 2014 Kroger issued a statement similar to those issued by other retailers who had decided not to comply with gun control groups:The safety of our customers and associates is one of our most important company values. Millions of customers are present in our busy grocery stores every day and we don’t want to put our associates in a position of having to confront a customer who is legally carrying a gun. That is why our long-standing policy on this issue is to follow state and local laws and to ask customers to be respectful of others while shopping. We know that our customers are passionate on both sides of this issue and we trust them to be responsible in our stores.In August 2014 a spokesperson on the behalf of Kroger told Forbes:Kroger’s position on customers lawfully carrying firearms is in practice identical to many other U.S. retailers which is to abide by state and local laws. We know that our customers are passionate on both sides of this issue and we trust them to be responsible and respectful of others while shopping in our stores.Early in 2015 Kroger reinforced its position again when its chief financial officer was interviewed for CNBC:If the local gun laws are to allow open carry we’ll certainly allow customers to do that based on what the local laws are. We don’t believe it’s up to us to legislate what the local gun control laws should be. It’s up to the local legislators to decide to do that. So we follow local laws we ask our customers to be respectful to the other people they are shopping with. And we really haven’t had any issues inside of our stores as a result of that.Although gun safety advocate groups were not satisfied with Kroger’s response the retailer’s position did not appear to have damaged Kroger’s net earnings. In 2013 Kroger’s net earnings totalled $1519 million for a 53-week period. Net earnings for 2014 were $1728 million. In 2015 the first full year after Kroger’s statement net earnings were $2039; in 2016 $1975 million and in 2017 $1907 million.Kroger’s Options in 2017In 2014 Kroger had elected not to interfere with citizens’ rights. However gun violence was only increasing.In 2016 a shooter injured 68 people and killed 49 at Pulse a nightclub in Orlando Florida. The shooter had three weapons one of which was an assault rifle. In 2017 527 people were injured and 58 killed in a shooting in Las Vegas Nevada. The shooter had 23 guns. Mass shootings in the United States increased from 269 in 2014 when Moms Demand Action began petitioning Kroger to 346 in 2017. And the pressure from the advocacy groups also increased. Debates and commentary in the news and on social media about gun violence in the United States were plentiful. Gun control was also growing in significance as an issue in political debates. In light of the events since 2014 should Kroger revisit its original decision? If it chose to comply with gun control advocates it could lose the business of gun rights advocates. However if it chose to ignore the protests of gun control advocates the retailer risked bad public relations with and loss of business from its target consumers. Kroger had to decide whether it would change positions and if so how.ENDNOTES",0,,,,

Companies had been exploring for oil in the country for some time but because it was not easy to extract and export the oil production began only in 2003. However once production began investor interest grew. Griffiths Energy International Inc. (GEI) a Canadian company based in Calgary Alberta wanted to join those companies drilling for oil and in 2008 began meeting with officials in Chad in an effort to secure production-sharing contracts. At last in 2011 with land leases in place a team ready to work in Chad and significant private investor backing secured GEI was ready for an initial public offering (IPO) that would be the largest the Canadian market had seen for some time. Investment bankers and lawyers began drafting the prospectus with plans to go public by the end of the year and the company set about recruiting its board of directors. Robert Hodgins an experienced director in the resources sector was one of those invited to join the board. Hodgins accepted the appointment only to be confronted within weeks with one of the most difficult decisions he had needed to make as a business leader: when GEI’s lawyers were conducting the due diligence for the IPO they uncovered contracts that suggested bribery had been involved in securing the land leases. At that time bribing officials was not uncommon in Chad or in many other parts of the world especially where economies were less developed. However it was an offence in Canada for Canadians and Canadian-based businesses to engage in bribery or corruption of foreign public officials. With GEI poised to go public the original private investors anxious to realize their investment through the IPO and the company ready to begin production Hodgins and his board colleagues needed to decide what to do about the lawyers’ discovery.Black Gold in ChadGEI was founded in 2009 by investment banker Brad Griffiths and two partners. Griffiths did not have experience in the oil and gas business but he was a brilliant investment banker successful and well known. He was also notable for his role in changing how investments were financed in Canada by developing what became known as “bought deals.” Most importantly Griffiths had a reputation for identifying good investments.In the late 1990s Chad began to surface as a good investment country for oil. A consortium led by ExxonMobil Corporation (Exxon) began explorations in 1996; in 2003 it was finally successful getting oil from the drilling fields in the Doba basin in Chad to the seaport in Cameroon using a 1070-kilometre pipeline. Although the consortium was successful it had relinquished other exploration rights. Production lands were up for bid the price of oil was increasing and Griffiths saw the opportunities. Griffiths engaged numerous people to help him secure the opportunities in Chad. In 2008 he and his advisors spent six months investigating the oil and gas opportunities in Chad and establishing contacts both with Chad’s president and his associates in the oil ministry and with Chad’s ambassador to Canada and the United States who was based in Washington D.C. By 2011 after years of negotiation Griffiths had successfully secured his production-sharing contracts and the needed leases. Changing Leadership at GEISuccess in obtaining the contracts came with a commitment to commence operations in Chad within a certain period of time; the company had also provided the Government of Chad with a work commitment worth US$115 million. So Griffiths was prompt in hiring the needed consultants and management team. To prepare GEI for its switch from prospecting to production Griffiths hired a new chief executive officer Gary Guidry effective July 1 2011. And to prepare the company to go public Griffiths and Guidry began seeking directors for the board. Hodgins was known in the resource sector. He was a chartered accountant investor and director with 30 years of experience in oil and gas. While Griffiths and Hodgins were not acquainted Guidry had worked with Hodgins before and recommended him for the board. Guidry extended the invitation to Hodgins himself and arranged for Hodgins to meet with the management team on Monday July 18 2011—a fateful day as it happened. Hodgins recalled:I was sitting in my car waiting in the parking lot before going in to meet the team. I pulled out my phone—at that time a BlackBerry—and the headline read “Prominent investment banker missing.” When I looked I realized it was Brad Griffiths.Griffiths had last been seen midday near his boat in the middle of Lake Joseph north of Toronto. His death was confirmed at the end of the week when diving teams recovered his body from the lake. With the company’s founder gone Guidry was temporarily appointed chairman and the management team finished populating the board. Hodgins confirmed his commitment as a company director and another director was chosen to act as the new permanent chairman. Employees were hired to get the operations up and running in Chad and investment bankers and lawyers were retained to take GEI public. The company had raised CA$165 million with private investors who were expecting a return on their investment when the company went public and the company was slated to begin drilling early in 2012.Plans were made to go public by the end of 2011. Earlier that fall lawyers for the company began preparing the prospectus. Then while conducting the due diligence just weeks before the IPO which had been scheduled for December the lawyers located certain contracts that raised concerns. Seemingly straightforward contracts for consulting services appeared on closer examination to be a conduit to pay money to the wife of Chad’s ambassador to Canada and the United States. The contracts may have directly or indirectly benefited the ambassador himself in exchange for his help to secure the land leases in Chad.Bribing government officials in exchange for influence or assistance to obtain favourable contracts had previously been a routine if distasteful business for decades and in Chad the practice had been widespread. But the world specifically those countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) was thinking differently about bribes for business advantages and Canada had enacted legislation making it a criminal offence.Corruption in ChadThe government of the Republic of Chad had been relatively stable since the 1990s when President Idriss Déby Itno took control of the government. However political unrest in neighbouring regions flowed over into Chad rebellions became common in the border regions and refugees attempted to avoid conflict by moving back and forth between countries. Déby added internal political unrest when he changed the country’s constitution to allow him to run for president for another term. Although Chad was the fifth-largest country in Africa the country was poor. It was landlocked and much of the northern portion of the country lay in the Sahara Desert. Most of the sparse population (8 persons per square kilometre) lived by agriculture—cotton in the south and cattle in the middle regions where the tsetse fly did not decimate the herds. Foreign assistance accounted for one-quarter of the country’s gross national product. Life expectancy was only 51.5 years for women and 49 years for men and almost half of the population was under the age of 15.Exxon’s success in producing oil in 2003 had raised hopes that oil revenues could improve Chad’s economy. The government was abiding by an oil revenue management law that controlled the investment and allocation of the royalties and in 2000 the government had enacted a law that provided penalties for corrupt practices. The government had even established the Ministry of Good Governance dedicated to combating corruption. But civil servants judicial employees and law enforcement officials were underpaid (and sometimes not paid for stretches of time) increasing the allure of profits from bribery and weakening the state system for enforcement of anti-corruption efforts. This rent-seeking culture was business as usual in Chad. In terms of the ease of doing business the World Bank ranked Chad near the bottom of the list (180 out of 190). Transparency International ranked Chad as among the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. Nonetheless the promise of oil and significant returns on investment attracted companies such as GEI that were willing to accept the risks of doing business in the country in exchange for what Hodgins described as “the big prize.” Global Anti-Corruption EffortsThe OECD estimated that the cost of corruption globally was more than 5 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP)—valued at US$2.6 trillion with US$1 trillion paid in bribes each year. The World Economic Forum estimated that corruption increased the cost of doing business by an average of 10 per cent. In 1997 in an effort to combat corruption and contain its harms the OECD passed the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (the Anti-Bribery Convention). Canada was a signatory to the convention so in 1998 to meet its commitments under the convention Canada enacted the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA) establishing bribing a foreign public official as a criminal offence. The offence applied to bribes paid to an official of any foreign country if carried out by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident or by a corporation or organization formed under the laws of Canada. The legislation initially provided exemptions for facilitation payments or “grease payments”—money paid to foreign government officials to speed up or facilitate routine transactions. The United States had similar legislation—the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)—but its exemption for facilitation payments was narrower than Canada’s legislation and its reach was broader. The U.S. legislation applied not only to American citizens residents and organizations but also to anyone pursuing bribery within the jurisdiction of the United States and to anyone using U.S. interstate commerce such as wire transfers to further an act of bribery. Thus a Canadian citizen who engaged in bribery in the United States could be found guilty under both Canadian and American law.Canadian and American legislation also differed in how they were enforced. Acts subject to the CFPOA were investigated by Canada’s national police service the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and were prosecuted only under criminal law. In contrast the American legislation imposed both criminal and civil penalties and both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were responsible for enforcing the FCPA. The SEC was responsible for civil enforcement of the Act over companies the SEC regulated and the Department of Justice was responsible for all other enforcement. The United Nations also made efforts to curb international bribery and corruption adopting the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2003. When introducing the convention to the General Assembly of the United Nations Kofi Annan then secretary-general described corruption as:An insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and the rule of law leads to violations of human rights distorts markets erodes the quality of life and allows organized crime terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish. Canada was a signatory to the OECD and United Nations conventions and it had federal legislation dealing with bribery of foreign officials. Still Transparency International had assessed Canada as being far behind other developed countries in dealing with transnational bribery and the OECD harshly criticized Canada in 2011 for its weaker legislation an insufficient number of investigations and weak penalties for conviction. By 2011 the RCMP had managed to advance only two investigations in a decade one resulting in a guilty plea and a negotiated fine of CA$9.5 million and the other just then heading to trial. At that time while financial penalties levied against companies could be unlimited in size individuals convicted of foreign bribery could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison and no individual had ever been convicted. In comparison the U.S. legislation imposed a complex range of criminal and civil penalties that could amount to millions of dollars a maximum of five years in prison or both although in most cases actions had been taken against companies rather than individuals. the Board’s DilemmaGEI had new management and a new board that had been in place just a few months and Brad Griffiths was dead. The company had raised tens of millions of dollars privately and the early stage investors wanted their exit through an IPO scheduled to take place in a month. And then the lawyers uncovered the contracts. According to Hodgins:The contracts were questionable. We didn’t know what we were dealing with. You had to wonder if you were going to engage in bribery why would you have a contract? The first contract was with the wife of the ambassador to Chad. You can’t have a contract with the ambassador because he’ll try to influence the outcome and that’s offside under the legislation.Now we see that there’s a big chasm between us and going public. Now we have to decide what do we do?Hodgins’s gut instinct was to “come clean” and contact the RCMP to report the facts. While some of his colleagues felt the same the risks were high and not all immediately agreed on this course of action. Given the circumstances some felt that the likelihood of the contracts coming to light was “slim to nil.” If the matter did surface at some point later the issues could be dealt with then once the company was stable and producing oil. The business of conducting oil and gas operations in Chad involved a high degree of risk which was well known to investors so uncovering bribery at some future point would not be surprising. But if revealed later how long would it take to bring the matter to trial and could the company survive in the meantime? Immediate public disclosure of these events could slow or even cancel the IPO: Could it survive a foreign corruption investigation and possible prosecution? Canada had no history of self-disclosure for bribery offences so if the contracts were revealed to the authorities right away the process and penalties were unknown. Employees could be out of work investors would have put their money down for nothing and the company could go bankrupt. To compound the problem even further it appeared the bribery could be linked to Chad’s ambassador to Canada and the United States who was located in Washington. Voluntary disclosure would thus involve Canadian and American enforcement agencies; if they were going to report the problem to whom should they report it? The board was small—just six directors—and all were experienced professionals with public business profiles. Some were concerned about their reputations which could be tainted by the company’s actions even though the contracts had been negotiated under the previous management. All had exercised their options to purchase company shares collectively worth $1.65 million.The newly appointed chair of the board resigned and Hodgins was appointed to take over. He described his role as “creating an environment that was positive for everyone to contribute. I needed to herd these cats use the strengths of the individuals and have a logical discussion so we could reach the best decision collectively.” In hindsight Hodgins thought the whole experience was “something like the valley of death” addingNot many things wake me up at night and have me staying awake but I was wondering “Should I quit this board or should I continue to try to lead them to do the right thing and have confidence that collectively we will do the right thing? What was the right thing?”Endnotes",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,

Ltd. (NORPL) was restlessly studying the company’s annual process loss reports. The significant process losses in the form of oil giveaway were a cause of worry and had cost him his sleep. The fluctuating cost of pure coconut oil compounded with the process losses had significantly weakened the company’s bottom line. Kumar had therefore been assigned to devise an appropriate strategy to address the oil giveaway problem. Kumar had just held a meeting with his subordinates to come up with a solution but was not satisfied with the outcome of the discussion. He was scheduled to present his strategy to the board the next morning at 10 a.m. and had less than 16 hours to come up with a suitable plan.NAMRATHA OIL REFINERIES PVT. LTD. (NORPL): COMPANY HISTORYNORPL was one of the leading firms in the Indian state of Karnataka involved in the manufacture and packaging of pure coconut oil products. The company was founded in 1995 in Tiptur India by three brothers—B. S. Arun Kumar B. S. Shiva Prasad and B. S. Ravindra—who foresaw a market for pure packaged coconut oil in the state and decided to tap into it. Over the years the company achieved significant growth due to the uncompromised quality and the purity and freshness of their products. NORPL sourced the best quality copra from local farmers at a competitive price. The company followed a typical family-run business structure resembling a flat structure (see Exhibit 1).Customer satisfaction one of NORPL’s core values had held the company in good stead in the long run. All products manufactured by the company were organic in nature without any preservatives or chemicals and were known for their unique aroma colour and taste. The company achieved quality standards and shelf life by ensuring that its manufacturing processes met all the mandatory quality parameters. The products were available in three types of stock keeping units (SKUs): pouches wide-mouth jars and narrow-mouth bottles in various volume specifications.NORPL had only one plant in Tiptur Karnataka which had the capacity to manufacture and package 250 tonnes of coconut oil. The manufacturing operations required a high level of skills and knowledge to precisely maintain the product quality. The packaging operations did not require as much expertise as manufacturing and accordingly the company employed skilled employees in the manufacturing division and semi-skilled and unskilled employees in the packaging division. NORPL had been very successful in its operations witnessing a steady rise in revenue over the past 22 years (see Exhibit 2 3A and 3B). It also had received several awards from various government bodies and non-governmental organizations for its unrelenting delivery of quality products.the coconut oil MANUFACTURING PROCESSCopra the raw material used for manufacturing coconut oil consisted of 70 per cent coconut oil and 30 per cent copra cake by weight. Copras were dried coconut kernels made by plucking and de-husking mature coconuts and drying the nuts using sunlight or other heating methods. The copra cups were then tested for quality compliance after which they were unloaded in batches into silos. The oil extraction process involved four operations: cutting cooking expelling and filtration (see Exhibit 4). The copra cups were cut into small pieces in a hammer milling machine and then transferred to a cooker and heated to a temperature of about 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit). The cooking operation increased the yield by breaking down the protein fibres in the copra and reducing the moisture content.The cooked copra pieces were then passed through expellers for oil extraction. The expelling operation involved two stages. In the first stage almost 58 per cent of coconut oil in the copra was extracted and the first-stage copra cake was produced. This cake which had approximately 50 per cent coconut oil by weight was then passed through a second-stage expeller which further extracted 45 per cent of the remaining coconut oil thereby leaving nine per cent of coconut oil by weight in the final cake. The final cake was generally used for manufacturing cattle feed biscuits and other products. The last step of the oil production process was filtration in which the oil underwent a double-stage filtration process. The primary filtration used a Vibro sieve that filtered the coconut oil by removing small copra particles. The secondary filtration occurred in a filter press that filtered fine copra particles from the coconut oil and rendered it to the required quality. The manufacturing division operated for 24 hours a day for 25 days a month.The coconut oil was then stored in farm tanks having a capacity varying from 40–300 tonnes. After a set of rigorous quality checks the coconut oil was dispatched to the filling units for filling and packaging.PRODUCT FILLING AND PACKAGING The filling unit consisted of three lines that filled the oil in pouches wide-mouth jars and narrow-mouth bottles (see Exhibit 5). The coconut oil stored in farm tanks was transferred to four 15-tonne capacity day-tanks using centrifugal pumps. The oil in the four day-tanks was transferred to the filling machines of individual lines through dedicated oil lines. An intermediate oil storage tank also known as the buffer tank acted as a regulator between the day-tanks and the filling machine so that level differences in the day-tanks did not affect the functioning of the filling machines. The filling operations in the filling machines were based on the principle of volumetric filling a process by which the quantity of product (usually liquids and semi-solids) was measured and filled using a predetermined volume of reciprocating pistons and cylinders.The pouch line consisted of a single nozzle pouch machine. The laminate which formed the primary package of pouches was loaded in the pouch machine. The vertical and horizontal sealers sealed the laminate and the filling machine filled the oil in the pouches from a nozzle. The filling nozzle was connected to a filling cylinder and the filling operation took place according to the movement of the piston inside the filling machine. After this operation the pouches were packed into cartons and stored in the finished goods storage area. The wide-mouth line consisted of an eight-headed linear filling machine. The empty wide-mouth jars were fed into the filling machine for filling. The jars were filled then sealed and capped using a sealing machine and a capping machine and then packed into cartons and stored in the finished goods storage area.The packaging operations of narrow-mouth bottles were similar to the packaging for wide-mouth jars except that the narrow-mouth bottles were capped after the filling operation and no sealing process was involved.The packaging division operated for 16 hours a day for 25 days a month. The average monthly demand for SKUs included 340000 pouches 120000 wide-mouth jars and 280000 narrow-mouth bottles. The finished goods in the finished goods storage were checked for quality compliance and then dispatched to depots based on the plan generated by the advanced planner and optimizer software.THE OIL GIVEAWAY ISSUEOperators were assigned to the three filling lines based on the line speed. The pouch line was the slowest with a speed of 21 pouches per minute followed by the wide-mouth line with a speed of 35 jars per minute and the narrow-mouth line with a speed of 40 bottles per minute. Three operators were assigned to the pouch line and five operators each to the wide-mouth line and the narrow-mouth line. The various tasks associated with the lines are shown in Exhibit 6. The quantity of oil filled in each line was expressed in kilolitres (KL) and it varied each month for each line based on the filling plan shared by the marketing and sales team. The filling plan of each line for the past year is shown in Exhibit 7. The issue of an oil giveaway was observed in the filling operation. Oil giveaway referred to the metric used to measure the process loss in oil-filling operations and was defined as the percentage of oil filled that was greater than the quantity mentioned in the product label.Oil giveaway % =  %For example in a 500-millilitre (ml) wide-mouth jar the standard quantity of coconut oil to be filled was 500 ml. However due to the capability constraints of the filling machines the actual quantity of oil would be 503 ml. In such cases the additional 3 ml corresponded to the oil giveaway loss and was expressed as a percentage of standard quantity [i.e. (503 − 500) ÷ 500 = 0.6% which was the percentage of oil giveaway].The variation of oil giveaway for the most recent financial year is shown in Exhibit 8. NORPL’s commercial reconciliation sheet for February 2017 (see Exhibit 9) shows the comparison of the actual quantity of oil filled against the specified quantity of oil to be filled.THE SHOP FLOOR MEETINGA shop floor meeting was called on March 15 2017. The attendees of the meeting included the following:Madhav Kumar: The director of the plant (operations) the first line of command for all production- and maintenance-related activities that formed part of the manufacturing and packaging division. At the age of 52 he had extensive experience in the fast-moving consumer goods and beverages industries. Besides working on process design and improvements enterprise value creation and supply chain management Kumar had also been a key player in establishing strategic alliances with upstream and downstream stakeholders in the value chain thereby contributing significantly to both the top and bottom lines of the company.Vinod Sharma: The production executive of the packaging division who had rich experiences in oil and foods manufacturing and packaging industries. With 12 years of experience Sharma was a certified six sigma green belt holder. He had headed cross-functional projects on lean management in departments such as raw material handling and finished goods dispatch departments. While he had a penchant for analyzing data and driving insights he had poor interpersonal skills and exhibited undiplomatic behaviour which made him unpopular with the other executives.Aditya Jaiswal: The maintenance executive of the manufacturing and packaging division. An energetic mechanical engineer by education he had six years’ experience in the maintenance divisions of food and beverages industries. His proactive nature and effervescent attitude helped him build good rapport with the shop floor operators and the top management alike. He liked to challenge the status quo and innovate. Jaiswal had initiated and successfully implemented a filtering technique in the manufacturing division which had significantly increased the product quality. His proactive nature helped him cultivate a good relationship with Kumar.TRANSCRIPT OF THE MEETINGAt the shop floor meeting the following discussions took place:Kumar: You all are well aware that the company is facing an oil giveaway issue. The figures for last month are alarmingly high and the data show an increasing trend. And even though we have discussed this issue several times before we have not been able to tackle it. Management has given us clear-cut instructions that we must resolve it in this quarter. What do you have to say about this Sharma?Sharma: Sir I am aware of the gravity of the situation and my team is already working on specific projects to improve efficiency and reduce these kinds of losses. However due to poor spares supply and vendor issues we have not been able fully to implement these improvements. Kumar: I have been hearing these excuses for a long time now. Show me some signs of progress that you have made in these projects. What data do you have to support your arguments?Sharma: We have been collating supporting information for some time now. However the data are still in the initial phase. And as we are also missing some data points in the daily production report (DPR) we are unable to analyze correctly. We are still working on the data.Kumar (looking at the DPR): I can also see some entries missing in the DPR especially in the “Actual filled quantity” column which I believe refers to some critical parameters of the process. Why is this data missing?Sharma (answering with a straight face): Yes I understand that these are some of the critical parameters of the process. The operators of the filling machine are supposed to make these entries but sometimes miss recording these readings. I have tried talking to them but to no avail. Most of them feel that they are experienced enough and can manage even by bypassing some of the basic procedures in the packaging process. Kumar: Seriously? Is this your analysis of the oil giveaway? I really don’t think I can communicate these excuses to the board. Sharma it is high time you improve your work.Sharma: Yes sir I will. However I do want to make one crucial point. I have collected data on some maintenance activities as well. In the case of the pouch line I found that the machine broke down twice a week last month. Also I didn’t find the maintenance activities to the mark. As the number of breakdowns increase the time window available to us to make minute adjustments on the machines to control the oil giveaway reduces. And because of this constraint many times we have to run these lines without performing the fine-tuned adjustments and this shoots up the oil loss. I have been talking about this for some months but no action had been taken. Jaiswal who was listening patiently till now sprang into action.Jaiswal: I do not agree with Sharma. The machine may have broken down a few times but you can’t attribute this to poor maintenance alone. These machines are run by semi-skilled and unskilled operators who sometimes may operate them without following the standard operating procedures. So don’t blame the entire maintenance team for all the breakdowns in the packaging division. Kumar: As far as I know the maintenance activities in the packaging division are carried out by semi-skilled operators of the maintenance team right? Why are we giving critical maintenance activities to these semi-skilled operators? Can’t we bring in some skilled operators for these essential works? Remember “a rolling stone gathers no moss.”Jaiswal: Sir most of the time the skilled operators are busy with the maintenance activities in the manufacturing division. In fact I have tried to take preventive measures and use skilled labour for maintenance activities when they are free. However the production executives do not allow us to stop the machines for maintenance saying that it would affect their production planning.Kumar: So Sharma as I understand it you are not fine with preventive maintenance activities but okay when the machine stops functioning because of a breakdown? Sharma: Sir as far as I know this is the only option available to us in the existing system. We cannot stop our lines as per the convenience of other people. We are always on our toes and our schedule is very tight so it is very difficult for us to stop work and give up the machines to the maintenance people. Moreover these people don’t bother about our service levels and delivery. We are the ones who must ensure that the goods are finished on time even amidst this confusion. Kumar: Can I see the history card for the pouch line?Jaiswal handed it over to Kumar (see Exhibit 10).Sharma: I am also doubtful about the quality of the spares we are purchasing. I have seen that many times the material of construction (MOC) of shafts keys and other spares do not adhere to the quality specifications and this leads to quicker wear and tear. I have highlighted this to the maintenance team several times but the issue had not been addressed so far. So now we are left to shoulder the blame for all the breakdowns. Kumar: What do you have to say Jaiswal?Jaiswal: Yes sir unexpected breakdowns happened several times. First most of our machines are not upgraded. Also our monthly production plans are very tight and so we are forced to procure spares from local vendors rather than original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). However most of the times we do prefer to purchase from OEMs.Kumar: Why are we not maintaining a minimum inventory level for these spares? How about the adage “dig your well before you are thirsty”?Jaiswal: Sorry sir. As of now we are not doing this because of the numerous constraints we face. For one the finance department had limited the maximum inventory value of spares that we can maintain in our factory.Kumar (agitated): You know what guys there is a limit to everything. I have less than 24 hours before my meeting with the board and listening to you I know that we are in a great deal of trouble. Now listen to me very carefully. I want both of you to sit together and make a report on all the critical issues you are facing and then design an action plan to resolve the oil giveaway issue. Primarily I want you Sharma to do a reconciliation and calculate the actual oil giveaway figures of this month to date. I want both reports on my desk before 6 p.m. today. All of you please note that the state government has recommended that it would provide coconut oil as an edible oil under the Public Distribution System (PDS) in the state. As suppliers of this oil this would mean a great opportunity for us and I want us to be ready to encash it. Kumar returned to his office and once again considered that if the issue of the exponential oil giveaway losses was not resolved immediately it would severely weaken the company’s bottom line. And even with his meeting with the board the next day he still had not come up with a solution which made him nervous. His thoughts were broken by Sharma’s sudden entry into his office. He was carrying the reconciliation sheet in his hand and looked very tense. Kumar glanced through the report and his eyes froze on the oil giveaway statistics for March 2017. As he stared at the figures a shiver ran down his spine. The oil giveaway as per the calculation was 1.2 per cent. He took a deep breath and said aloud the quote that came to his mind—“It seems that the cure is worse than the disease.”EXHIBIT 1: namratha oil refineries PVt. Ltd.

Funded primarily by the Toronto Enterprise Fund (TEF) Free Geek Toronto focused on its dual goal of running a business and working with individuals who faced employment barriers. Fukunaga explained:Free Geek Toronto is a non-profit social enterprise that helps bridge the digital divide. We accept donations of electronic waste that we then refurbish and re-sell at an accessible price to help every Torontonian get connected. We also train and employ individuals who have struggled with employment to work in the day to day operations of the organization.Fukunaga had taken over the leadership of Free Geek Toronto in mid-November 2016. He was an instructor and educator with more than a decade of experience teaching in a variety of fields (e.g. adult literacy technology employment skills wilderness/outdoor skills and computer repair) and he had worked in the non-profit sector for the past five years. Fukunaga talked about his goals at Free Geek Toronto:I’ve been working for social enterprises in the last two years and have been able to be part of great working teams. I was given a mission to stabilize Free Geek Toronto’s operations. We’ve always wanted to expand but we need to be able to achieve consistency on our processes before that can happen. These include for example our ability to forecast sales develop plans that can be carried out and achieve efficiencies in our operations. First we steady the ship then we sail it forward.All profits generated from the sales of refurbished electronic goods were reinvested into Free Geek. It was late November 2016 and Fukunaga was thinking about the challenge of bringing in volunteers to fill key roles in the organization:We’re trying to run a viable enterprise and devote enough time to hire train and manage a unique workforce many of whom have employment barriers. If we bring in volunteers we will alter the work culture of the organization. Some say it might demotivate our current workforce to have these volunteers work alongside them. I need to analyze the situation and figure out what we should do about a potential volunteer recruitment strategy. Is it a good idea or not?Social EnterpriseSPrivate enterprises focused on profit generation and not-for-profit entities aimed to achieve social goals. Social enterprises had dual missions: to sell goods or services or both in the marketplace to generate income; and to achieve social impact goals. Examples of social enterprises were thrift stores that sold recycled and donated goods and apparel companies such as tentree which planted 10 trees for every garment sold. Fukunaga addedNot-for-profits and charities can have social enterprise components to them. The YMCAs and YWCAs for example often offer low-cost recreation and hostel services and will waive fees for those in need. Yet they have a mandate to be self-sustainable. There are other examples of social enterprises that we’ve looked at for inspiration. There was for example a food services training centre that helped provide training and experience for those looking to get a job in the food industry. There was a business aspect where the trainees were generating revenues for the training centre with the proceeds helping to make the centre self-sustaining. Graduating employees were better off because they were able to find a job more easily. In 2016 approximately 25000 social enterprises were operating in Canada. Awareness of social enterprises was increasing with about CA$2.2 billion in funds available in Canada for impact investing. The TEF was one of the sources of funds for social enterprises. The TEF was founded in 2000 as a partnership among four organizations: United Way Toronto and York Region; the City of Toronto; the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services; and the Homelessness Partnering Strategy a federal government program administered by the City of Toronto. The goal of the TEF was to support the development of social enterprises that focused on providing “transitional or permanent employment or training leading to employment for people who are marginalized.” Free Geek Toronto was a recipient of one of the TEF’s annual operating grants. Free Geek Founded in Portland Oregon in 2000 the first Free Geek enterprise was started with the goal of recycling and giving away computers to community members in need. Oso Martin the founder of Free Geek recalled the early days of the organization: “Some people have too many computers; others don’t have enough; and there is a glut of computers going to landfills. Mash them together and the solution is Free Geek.” Martin had been helping to organize an Earth Day event in Portland Oregon when he commented that a collection of “junky old computers” that had been donated should be refurbished. The next day a director of a not-for-profit handed Martin a cheque for US$250 to create a social enterprise and file for 501(c)(3) status and offered a further donation of 50 computers. Another supporter invested US$35000 allowing Martin to start his social enterprise. Free Geek had three key goals: Reuse computers and technology by giving them away for community service.Recycle in an environmentally responsible way those computers that were not reused. Provide education and training in the use of computers and technology.By 2010 Free Geek in Portland Oregon had generated the majority of its revenues from the sales and recycling of computers and from disposal fees with just 25 per cent coming from donations and fundraising efforts. In an effort to expand the concept Free Geek made its business model supported by documentation and plans available online to anyone. By 2014 there were perhaps a dozen Free Geek organizations throughout the United States and Canada. In Portland the original Free Geek continued to have an impact on its community. In 2013 a manager shared some facts:Active volunteer count first broke 100 in 2001 200 in 2004 300 in 2005 400 in 2008 500 in 2009 600 in 2010 . . . pretty steady. For the last two years we have been receiving about 6000 computers per quarter. We broke 1000 in 2003 2000 in 2004 3000 in 2005 4000 in 2007 and 5000 in 2008. The 6000 number has been pretty steady since 2010. Sales in dollars per quarter is around [US]$175000 for the last full quarter. This is down from our high in 2010 ([US]$202000). We started at [US]$1000 a quarter in 2001 and worked up to [US]$100000 a quarter by 2008.Free Geek TorontoFree Geek Toronto was founded in 2009 and moved its offices to Queen Street West in 2014 (see Exhibit 1). Free Geek Toronto had two full-time staff (an executive director and an operations manager) and approximately five part-time staff who had employment barriers. In addition Free Geek Toronto was able to work with 13 work placement participants in 2016. Fukunaga explained:We work closely with other charities and work placement centres. On occasion we are asked to provide temporary work placements—three to six months in length—for individuals being assisted by these other charities. We provide these individuals their first step in their employment journey. For example we have individuals from hospitals and mental health centres who we welcome in. They come in to work and or to learn skills in a safe environment with low expectations. They may not have worked for months or years. They want to eventually work full-time but they need us as a bridge to get there. Their limited time at Free Geek Toronto is a chance for them to get into a routine to take on responsibility to prepare themselves for full-time work.There is a “social return on investment” for what we do for people and we would like to quantify this at some point. By providing individuals with work opportunities we help them move away from a reliance on social assistance we shorten the time to full-time employment and we hope that they find more suitable perhaps even higher-paying jobs. One of the training programs I was involved with before Free Geek Toronto showed that for every dollar invested in that training program there was a social return on investment of nine dollars. Free Geek Toronto had several programs that supported its key goals:Electronic waste recycling: A wide variety of electronic waste—amplifiers to MP3 players tablets computers smartphones and video projects to name a few—could be dropped off at its office in downtown Toronto. It also offered a service whereby an employee would pick up electronic waste from a client’s location (at a nominal cost of $40–$100).Training: Employees and community members were trained on how to refurbish electronic equipment. Many trainees came from low-income families or had low digital knowledge or both.Refurbishment: Equipment deemed salvageable would be refurbished on-site by Free Geek Toronto’s employees.Sales: Once refurbished equipment was sold at a low mark-up to walk-in clients (see Exhibit 2).Free Geek Toronto’s Human Resources Goals“We’re hiring people who have been unemployed. And we don’t only look at what they can do for us when they’re working for us. While we do not have a social worker internally we do our best to help our employees tap into support services that are available in the city” said the operations manager. “Whether they need wellness programs shelter support or a food bank we direct them to the right places.” He continued: One of the challenges we face is trying to support employees who are on disability [benefits]. This does not necessarily mean that they cannot work with us. They can’t have full-time paid work meaning that we can only have them working for us up until a limit. When they surpass that limit there is a clawback and the employee has to give a portion of it back to the government. Consider that disability [benefits] could pay $1100 a month. If they’re only allowed to earn $200 before the clawback starts then an employee earning $1100 would have 50 per cent of the extra amount above $200 clawed back or $450. There is some consideration for any child care or disability-related work costs that are eligible but many of our employees do not have child care expenses or disability-related work costs to claim.Another former operations manager commented: We’re also quite flexible with the way we manage our employees. You can come in to participate on one single day with us to help us with recycling. You can come in and speak with us and we’ll accommodate you. If you’d like some privacy to sit in a corner away from the noise and work away at a project that’s fine with us as well. What we’ve done successfully is that we don’t have a prescribed idea of what it means to be successful at a job. Fukunaga explained how Free Geek Toronto approached the issue of performance management:Honestly we manage by starting from a point of caring and respect. We have a small staff and I can individualize how we treat people. We set expectations for job roles and we have learning updates—we do not call them reviews—every six months. This allows us to have conversations with our staff about progress. If an issue comes up then we hope that it will not be a surprise. We have to be careful here—the traditional “carrot and stick” approach to incentives and discipline does not work because our employees can still be in a sensitive position in their time with us. For example in a traditional environment punctuality is important. If you’re working in retail or in a warehouse and are late three times it is likely you will be reprimanded and let go. With us we notice you’ve been late and we will sit down with you to find out if anything is going on. We are willing to support you and tweak our schedule so that it works for you. If it continues to be a problem we just continue to talk about it. It’s more akin to a coaching relationship the way we manage our people.Managing Operations: Creating More Flexible RolesFree Geek Toronto’s operations manager oversaw the programs that generated funds for the enterprise—sorting refurbishing training and sales. He needed to strike a balance between offering training sessions and carrying out refurbishing tasks. A former manager noted “Every additional hour we devote to working with participants takes an hour away from refurbishing computers for sale. One is not more important than the other: we just have to find the balance between our activities.”Over the years Free Geek Toronto had modified its skill requirements to be able to accept a broader range of employees. In the past it had tried to hire individuals who could refurbish a computer from start to finish. Free Geek Toronto would invest in training those individuals and then put them on a phased-in program with the end goal of graduating a technically skilled employee. Starting in 2012 Free Geek Toronto began dividing the work processes into more manageable segments so that employees could choose to specialize on any one task. They recognized that much was expected of an individual to be able to sort through e-waste identify valuable pieces for refurbishing carry out the refurbishing and prepare the item for sale. Another plan—not yet implemented—was for Free Geek Toronto to document on paper all the processes related to each job. For example training on customer service and sales in the retail storefront was typically provided verbally. Fukunaga was thinking about documenting each step creating “work manuals” for each position. Taken one step further Fukunaga wanted to also have pictorial diagrams and “how-to” videos.Free Geek Toronto’s Next StepsFukunaga had recently taken over as executive director and he had a few issues to consider. Free Geek Toronto generated approximately $120000 in revenues from grants recycling materials and selling refurbished computers and equipment. The total cost of running Free Geek Toronto was approximately $130000 annually. He addedI’m the third executive director in the past 18 months. We’re working full-time but we don’t seem to be able to get all of the strategic and operational pieces in place. For example we still do not have a reliable way to forecast what our sales will be in the next year. Our operations are labour-intensive. Training a new sales associate to manage the retail side of the shop takes two to three months: a manager provides one-on-one training with that associate walking him or her through each operation several times. Providing training to employees refurbishing computers and other electronic equipment still takes two to three months. A lot of the training is hands-on meaning that the trainer demonstrates to employees how to take apart diagnose and refurbish equipment. We need to augment our resources if we want to do more.The Possibility of Using VolunteersFukunaga wondered whether he could develop a volunteer program at Free Geek Toronto just as the Portland office had done. A few committed supporters had reached out to Fukunaga to consider a comprehensive volunteer program that would include college or university placements and a volunteer director (unpaid to start with) who could marshal a team of volunteers to support profit-generating programs at Free Geek Toronto. A set of volunteers could also add capacity for Free Geek Toronto to offer a broader set of training programs. On the other hand Fukunaga realized that recruiting volunteers could affect the culture at Free Geek Toronto: Remember that we are helping to train individuals with work-related barriers. These individuals know that they do not yet function at the same productivity as does an average volunteer. An average volunteer could be university-educated and . . . passionate about helping out. They’re enthusiastic and usually very productive. I’m sensitive that placing a highly skilled volunteer alongside our employees could be demotivating for the latter group. Yet I need more assistance in all aspects of the business from strategy project planning marketing operations and human resources.Many Free Geek Toronto employees had barriers such as autism or health concerns such as anxiety or stress that had prevented them from finding full-time employment. Their employment at Free Geek Toronto was a way to regain their self-confidence in a safe environment with people similar to themselves. A task that could take a volunteer 10 minutes to complete—such as adding a few refurbished computers to inventory—might take a Free Geek Toronto employee an hour or two to grasp. In addition many employees were in fragile emotional states when at work and Free Geek Toronto’s management team tended to take extra care to ensure that they were given as much support and accommodation as possible. Previous executive directors had thought that introducing volunteers to work alongside Free Geek Toronto employees would change the work culture. A former operations manager recalledVolunteers can be trained and this sensitivity training might take weeks. Remember that volunteers can elect to leave us a few weeks after joining us and in that case we would have invested that training for very little return. There is also the challenge of volunteers overstaying their welcome if they are unsuitable. Then we would have to find a way to ease them out of our company. In the past the thought of adding a volunteer program was believed to be too much to manage. It would have taken away resources from helping our employees.Other ChallengesAnother related issue was that Free Geek Toronto had a bulging warehouse of product waiting to be refurbished for sale. “The issue is resources. We have valuable computer equipment but we do not have enough employees to help us” Fukunaga said. “I would like to consider ramping up our current employment program to double the number of participants to 26. What will that do to my budget? Where can I find the shortfall? Can I spare the managerial resources to train and manage a larger group?”Fukunaga was focused on ensuring operations ran smoothly. He heard a story from a former manager that Free Geek Toronto had been on one occasion late issuing cheques to its part-time employees. “I can’t eat until I get that cheque” one employee had lamented. “I can’t go to McDonald’s tonight if I don’t have any money.” The employee had no savings no place to live and counted on Free Geek Toronto’s payments to survive. The former manager added “We had to get our board members to rush from their downtown Toronto jobs—these are senior executives—to sign the cheques so that we could hand them out before the end of the day. That’s when it became real to me.” Fukunaga took a look at the issues Free Geek Toronto faced and wondered what a viable strategy for the next two years would look like. He concludedUltimately I think Free Geek Toronto can do more but our limitation is resources. Even on the product side we’ve got people calling all the time and asking for free computers. Now if we gave out free computers it would definitely add to our social impact. But if we gave away our computers we won’t be able to recoup the time and resources we spent refurbishing them. Without money we cannot continue to operate.Exhibit 1: Free Geek Toronto’s webpageSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: Free Geek Toronto—examples of Refurbished Products For SaleSource: Company files.

P. Mohapatra—was reviewing the company’s year-to-date performance report with Prasad Kumar the health and hygiene program manager. They were looking specifically at the performance of the company’s sanitation project which had two components: (1) bringing about attitudinal and behavioural changes among schoolchildren toward sanitary practices and (2) constructing toilets for girls in schools. The pilot project covering 317 schools had received a positive response from the community and witnessed marked changes both in behaviour and attitude among schoolchildren. Teachers and students were happy with the program. TKM was planning to expand the program to cover 1378 schools by 2020–2021. The expanded program entailed the maintenance of sanitation and hygiene in the pilot project schools as well as initiating the program in the expanded set of schools. In expanding the project there were two main concerns before the project’s team: whether the target number of schools was achievable and the challenges that both Toyota and its implementing partner were likely to face.THE COMPANYEstablished in 1997 TKM had been a joint venture between Toyota and the Kirloskar Group. By 2017 Toyota held an 89 per cent stake in the joint venture and the Kirloskar Group owned the remaining 11 per cent. Operating out of the company’s plants in Bidadi in Bengaluru which occupied almost 1.7 square miles (about 4.4 square kilometres [km]) of land the company had an installed capacity of 310000 units of vehicles. It was one of the leading automobile manufacturers in the country serving the markets of India South Africa Mauritius Bhutan Nepal and Brunei.The company’s flagship model Innova had been the fastest-selling model in the multi-purpose vehicle segment for the past 12 years and the Fortuner model had been the best-selling model in the sport utility vehicle segment since 2009. The Etios model introduced in 2010 had also gained popularity. TKM also imported and sold other models throughout India such as Land Cruiser Prius and Lexus.CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AT TKMSince 2001 TKM had been working for communities around its Bidadi plant through multiple interventions. Initially these interventions were based on the needs of the local people in its area of operation. Toyota had global programs pertaining to road safety the environment and education and these had been adopted by TKM. It also operated in the areas of skill development and health and hygiene. In all five areas in which it operated TKM had achieved substantial success with clear focus on the outcome and impact of the five programs (see Exhibit 1).The company’s vision for its CSR activities was to “be a socially committed corporate through building vibrant communities in harmony with nature aiming to become the most admired company in India and meet customer expectation and be rewarded with a smile.”The company’s CSR activities contributed to social responsibility through the following four pillars.Social: Contributing to the development of the society by imparting technical education raising road safety awareness promoting art and culture and developing local communities through sustainable activitiesEconomic: Developing a harmonious relationship with the society by enhancing community development activities and contributing to the progress of the regionEnvironment: Undertaking measures to protect and safeguard the environment through effective eco initiativesBusiness: Complying with the externally imposed social and environmental standards and conducting their business operations with honesty and integrityFollowing the parent company’s best practices TKM adopted a four-step approach to problem-solving:Plan: Analyzing needs and a feasibility studyDo: Implementating needs-based prioritization of activities (a) in consensus with the local community and (b) involving stakeholders; sustaining the activityCheck: Monitoring evaluation of the program using effective implementation toolsAct: Improvising upon the existing plan; planning for new activitiesTo meet the requirements of the society TKM always looked for projects that were scalable sustainable and that made an impact.According to Akito Tachibana the managing director at TKM These activities are close to my heart and I take a keen interest in promoting them. We have our priority areas—education sanitation water environment and road safety. We focus on a few areas and try to ensure that we do the things right. We also aim to perfect our activities on a small scale and when we are confident we try to scale them up.One of the key programs under TKM’s CSR activities was health and hygiene and the company had pioneered the program through its unique ABCD—A Behavioural Change through Demonstration—model in this case through behavioural change communication (BCC) about sanitation. As outlined below sanitation was a major issue in India including in the area surrounding the TKM plant at Bidadi and Toyota had attempted to address the issue by testing the ABCD model on a small scale to be upscaled later.SANITATION ISSUESIn 2014 2.5 billion people worldwide did not have access to basic sanitation facilities. One billion people defecated in the open and 2200 children under the age of five died every year as a result of diarrhea and other gastric diseases. In India the situation was no better: 564 million people had no access to sanitation facilities. These people had to relieve themselves in open spaces such as at roadsides; behind trees; and on playgrounds railway tracks and river banks. The practice of relieving oneself in the open was called open defecation. According to World Bank estimates one in 10 deaths in India occurred due to poor sanitation. Exposure to contaminated water led children to pick up chronic infections that impaired their bodies’ ability to absorb nutrients. The World Bank observed that nearly 44 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and over 300000 people died from diarrheal diseases every year.For women and girls open defecation could lead to serious problems. Typically women would relieve themselves when it was dark (early morning late evening nighttime) to preserve their dignity. However these were also the times when they were most vulnerable—they could be attacked or raped under the cover of darkness. Due to holding back urine for too long they often developed urinary tract infections. Also the use of old cloth pieces to prevent leakages during menstruation caused infections and made it difficult for them to move around freely. Girls often missed school for a few days every month due to poor access to sanitation facilities.Every day 1.75 million tonnes of fecal waste were generated in India. The lack of a mechanism for safe disposal of this waste was a cause for concern. Significant portions of fecal waste went into drains lakes and rivers contaminating groundwater and agricultural produce and giving rise to waterborne diseases. SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAN (CLEAN INDIA MISSION)Started in October 2014 Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Clean India Mission aimed to promote a culture of cleanliness among the residents of India. It proposed to clean up the roads and other places used for open defecation in Indian cities towns and villages. The mission’s objectives included eliminating open defection through the construction of both household-owned and community-owned toilets. Creating a mechanism to monitor toilet usage was another component of the mission. The government of India launched a program to create an open-defecation-free India by October 2019. The program mandated the construction of 90 million toilets in rural India at an estimated cost of US$30 billion.SANITATION STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT AT TKMTKM began building household toilets in 2011 but it soon realized that building toilets alone was not sufficient. Without a means to manage and operate the toilets they soon became dysfunctional. People started using them for storing grains and other items. In 2014 when the Clean India Mission was started it became apparent that people’s habits and practices also needed to be changed. The company thus embarked on its strategy (see Exhibit 2). The building of infrastructure was to be supported by behavioural change through demonstration and schools were deemed the right place to start this. All schools had a common toilet for boys and girls so to maintain the privacy and dignity of girls TKM decided that toilets for girls would be constructed. With each toilet or set of toilets an incinerator was also provided for the safe disposal of sanitary napkins (see Exhibit 3). A BCC program was also designed to ensure that students adopted correct behaviours such as washing their hands carefully and leaving the toilets in exactly the same condition they had found them. The children then spread the message of sanitation among their parents and the community (see Exhibits 4 and 5). Unlike the strategies the company adopted in the past the new strategy paid rich dividends (see Exhibit 6).A BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE DEMONSTRATION (ABCD) PROGRAMIn a study conducted in 2014–2015 TKM found that the community strongly felt the need for sanitation. People in rural India practised open defecation and this led to not only diarrhea and intestinal worm infections but also typhoid cholera hepatitis polio trachoma and other diseases. The ABCD program was started with the objective of promoting sanitation to improve health promote privacy and dignity among women and children and instil sanitation habits among the younger generation. TKM sought to achieve this through (1) constructing toilets in schools to support schoolchildren (2) creating a behaviour change program to enable children to maintain the toilets (3) employing children as change agents to motivate their parents to build household toilets and (4) sensitizing children to correct sanitation habits (handwashing keeping toilets clean etc.). Thus the program consisted of two components—infrastructure creation (school and household toilets) and BCC.There were four key stakeholders in the ABCD program—the implementing partners and trainers from the Support for Network and Extension Help Agency (SNEHA) schoolchildren parents and the community.Implementing partners and trainers from the (SNEHA): Spread awareness through demonstrations and videos. The trainers also worked with the School Development and Management Committee teachers and school headmasters to teach them sanitation techniques and toilet maintenance.Schoolchildren: Learned handwashing techniques toilet maintenance and other sanitation practices.Parents: Gained awareness through their children and through training.Community: Learned through sanitation drives with video showings and organized activities. Trainers also explained how the government schemes worked.According to one female seventh grade student “Whatever we are taught in school by the ABCD trainers we go home and spread the word. The idea is that when we go to the washroom it should be just as clean after we use it.”TKM took up the infrastructure creation and once the toilets were built they were cleaned and managed by the students. TKM planned to support each school for three years. In the first year of the intervention the company provided training demonstrations and consumables. The trainers made daily visits to the schools. In the second year the schools managed most things themselves though the trainers visited weekly. In the third year the schools continued under self-management with bi-monthly trainer visits. The schools’ performance was evaluated by measuring the performance of the facilitator the school and the children and the toilets (always clean sometimes clean or never clean). At the end of the period if the schools performed well and received a three-star rating (see Exhibit 7) they no longer required Toyota’s support; Toyota continued to support one- and two-star-rated schools until they met the required standards.As for the issue of waste and water management the sludge created by the toilets was managed by a microbial solution and hence did not impact the environment. Water availability at schools was inconsistent and insufficient. This was because the schools received water only once every two or three days. This required schools to store an adequate amount of water to meet the requirements for the days when water was not supplied.For girls’ toilets incinerators were provided for the disposal of sanitary pads and were largely funded by the government. The sanitary pads were also provided by the government. The maintenance of the toilets cost ₹5–7 per child for consumables. The money for this came from government grants contributions in kind from local shops and cash contributions. After TKM withdrew from a school the program was largely self-funded by the school along with government grants. A critical problem here was the mismatch between spending and the receipt of funds. Government grants reached the schools at odd intervals causing a cash crunch for the schools. Sometimes the schoolteachers would collect funds to try to meet the shortfall. In order for the school to become self-sufficient students often carried out a jata (procession) whereby they marched to the market and requested every shop on the way to contribute consumable items (e.g. soap cleaning liquid etc.) for the school. The shopkeepers being part of the community were ready to help by donating soap or cleaning materials. This also increased the visibility of the program by bringing awareness of the sanitation issues to other shoppers and encouraging them to help.The BCC was led by a team from the implementing partner SNEHA whose trainers educated the students in sanitation habits. They also conducted programs in the community to bring about awareness of sanitary practices. The role of the village head (sarpanch) was crucial. Since almost half of the village heads were women the program considered them agents of change. The implementing partner employed facilitators who went to each school and taught the students about the benefits of sanitation and hygiene. They also taught them how to maintain the toilets’ cleanliness. Frequent quizzes were conducted to test the children’s understanding of the concepts they had learned on sanitation and hygiene. After-school hours were devoted to community outreach and evenings were spent visiting villagers and organizing videos to promote sanitation. The implementation partner had originally planned to deploy 55 facilitators for the program covering 110 schools; however to fully meet capacity requirements it had to employ 85 facilitators.The role of the school cabinet was to create a sense of responsibility and leadership among the students. The school cabinet played a vital role in involving the students in day-to-day school activities. It raised issues related to education sanitation and other topics for discussion by the students.SETTING UP THE ABCD PROJECTBetween 2015 and 2017 TKM spent ₹23 million on the ABCD program. A chance meeting between Toyota representatives and government officials just prior to the announcement of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan led the company to think in terms of behavioural changes. Its earlier efforts at building toilets were going to waste as people were using the toilets as storehouses.The pilot project was started in the Ramanagara district of Karnataka approximately 50 km southwest of Bengaluru and famous for its huge rocky outcroppings. The Ramanagara district had four taluks 18 hoblis and 823 villages covering an area of 3559.12 square km.TKM adopted the Toyota business practices methodology to manage the project (see Exhibit 8). When the project was initiated the aim was to provide 100 per cent sanitation in each village and make all children aware of sanitation. At the time of initiating the program there was only 78 per cent sanitation coverage among government schoolchildren and the awareness level was less than 45 per cent. TKM had to break down the problem at the district and school levels (see Exhibit 9). It identified the problem’s points of occurrence and found that poor usage of toilets was the main problem. A root cause analysis indicated that the problem was twofold: there was a hardware issue (no toilets at school or home) and a software issue (changing attitudes and behaviours). After identifying the problem TKM set a target of covering 317 schools with more than 3000 students by March 2018. This would entail building a program to solve the problem further breaking it down into activities to be taken up at regular intervals. Outcomes were measured periodically and the objective of 100 per cent sanitation in target villages was expected to be achieved by March 2018.LOOKING AT THE FUTUREThe plan for the future was called Plan 2020. It entailed increasing the coverage from 317 schools to 1378 schools by 2020–2021. Its objectives were to (1) create a self-sustenance model for school sanitation; (2) ensure 100 per cent use of school sanitation facilities by schoolchildren; (3) promote a child-to-parent approach to achieve 100 per cent household toilets in 110 villages; and (4) promote 100 per cent functional toilets. These objectives were similar to those set out at the early stage of the project but included a commitment to cover 100 per cent of the schools. The project entailed the following challenges:Infrastructure Cost: It cost ₹144000 to build a single-unit toilet ₹293000 to build a two-unit toilet and ₹300000 to build a multi-unit toilet. For every 40 girls a single-unit toilet would be required. This financial outlay needed to be spread over the project period. There was also a concern that the cost would rise in the future. In December 2017 the retail inflation rate in India stood at 5.21 per cent. Consumables—₹9 per child per month—were another cost. Household toilets however were sponsored by the government.Availability of Trainers: Given the relatively high unemployment in the country (estimated at about 3.6 per cent)  it seemed workforce availability would not be an issue but in reality a trained workforce was difficult to find. Also the implementing agency realized it often needed more people than it had initially projected. Did the implementing agency have the wherewithal to scale up? Would the implementing agency be as efficient as it had been in the pilot project? The members of the CSR team looked at each other as they wondered whether the future project was achievable.EXHIBIT 1: Toyota Kirloskar Motor CSR ACHIEVEMENTSNote: CSR = corporate social responsibility.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: SANITATION STRATEGY DEVELOPMENTNote: BCC = behavioural change communication.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 3: AN INCINERATOR IN A SCHOOL TOILETSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: THE ABCD MODELNote: ABCD = A Behavioural Change through Demonstration; BCC = behavioural change communication; IHH = individual household.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: DEEKSHITHA AND HER FIGHT AGAINST OPEN DEFECATION“I won’t eat anything unless we have a toilet at home! Please please build it for the family.”That is what a 10-year-old Indian girl Deekshitha told her mother when she started her protest with a hunger strike. There is no toilet in her home so Deekshitha goes with her younger sister early every morning to defecate in an open field just a few minutes’ walk from her home.Her life changed when she moved from her grandmother’s house to join her parents three years ago and discovered there was no toilet at home. She found this out from her mother who asked Deekshitha “Can you go out in the morning and do it in the open?” It was a sad surprise for her since her grandmother had a toilet.In the south Indian village of Nagavara where Deekshitha lives many homes have no toilet because most farmers earn just enough to live on without much luxury and cannot afford to construct a household toilet. There are snakes in the field near Deekshitha’s house. People walk on the narrow path very near to the place where she has to defecate. She tries hard to never let others see her and her younger sister. They keep extremely quiet and take turns to watch for any danger. There is also a problem with the lavatories at school; students must wait in long lines because there are not enough facilities.Deekshitha says that when she cannot have privacy in a clean toilet or relieve herself comfortably “My stomach begins to ache and I suffer from diarrhea. When it’s bad I don’t even want to read.” She likes studying but on a few occasions when she has felt at her worst she was late for school or did not go at all.“I can’t bear it. I really want a toilet at home!” Deekshitha pleaded desperately to her mother. Her mother replied “You know how things are . . . it’s not that simple.” Deekshitha was disappointed but she also noticed that her mother looked very sad when she had to refuse her request. She knew her mother feared the dangers of open defecation and wanted a toilet just as much as she did.Deekshitha did not give up. She remembered that her grandmother sometimes did not eat anything for a whole day when she took the cows to the fields. Deekshitha imagined that the hunger must have been terrible and she devised the idea of protesting to her parents with a hunger strike. But the hunger strike turned out to be painful. She imagined a bowl of rice inviting her to eat it but she refused to do so because she thought it would break her resolution.Her mother was shocked to see Deekshitha lying in bed starving and felt so sad that she cried with her. According to the school principal the cost of building a toilet was expected to be about ₹15000. But recent droughts had reduced the farmers’ incomes and some families had to live on about ₹20000 a year. Like people from other villages Deekshitha’s parents had no spare money to build a toilet; there were other more urgent things to be done first.Due to several reasons including the lack of funds toilet construction did not happen immediately. Yet with the help of government funds and support from TKM Deekshitha could realize the dream of having a toilet in her house.Source: “Small Hands Shaping the Future: Village Kids Spark a Sanitation Revolution” Smiles: Toyota Sustainability Journal 2 (March 2018): 3–10; “sMiLES｜Vol.2 Toyota ABCD Program (India)” YouTube video 5:00 posted by “Toyota Global” July 1 2018 accessed November 30 2018 www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN-wMEdVO2s.EXHIBIT 6: Toyota Kirloskar Motor’s ABCD PROGRAM timelineNote: ABCD = A Behavioural Change through Demonstration.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 7: STAR RATING SYSTEM FOR ABCD SCHOOLSNote: ABCD = A Behavioural Change through Demonstration Program; WASH = water sanitation and hygiene.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 8: TOYOTA motor corporation—APPROACH TO SOLVING BUSINESS PROBLEMSStep 1: Clarify the problem which includes alignment with the ultimate goal or purpose and identify the ideal situation the current situation and the gap.Step 2: Break down the problem which requires breaking it into manageable pieces using the 4 Ws (what where when and why) and finding the prioritized problem process and point of cause (through genchi genbutsu—literally “go and see”—a key principle of the Toyota Production System).Step 3: Set a target—make a commitment; set a target for addressing a point of cause and determine “how much” and “by when.”Step 4: Analyze the root cause—brainstorm multiple potential causes by asking why and determine the root cause by going to see the process.Step 5: Develop as many countermeasures as possible; select the highest value-added countermeasures; build consensus with other stakeholders; create a clear and concrete action plan.

Acting in that role you are tasked with resolving the issues or problems that the profiled organization is facing at a particular moment in time. Alternatively you are asked to evaluate and choose among opportunities that exist for the organization at a specific point in time. Those issues and opportunities may be confined to a specific discipline in business such as accounting marketing human resources or strategic management. However the challenges often involve several disciplines reflecting the multi-faceted nature of business in practice.The case method involves learning by doing. It provides you with an opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to real-life and realistic situations. Listening to class lectures reading about various business subjects and performing quantitative and qualitative analyses to solve well-defined problems are all valuable learning tools; however management skills and knowledge cannot be developed by these methods alone. Management requires more than applying a storehouse of prepackaged solutions or standard answers. Each situation faced by management has its own variables unique to the situation. Using the case method provides you with valuable opportunities to develop and practise skills you will need in those situations.Introduction to Preparing to Discuss A Case in ClassThe method for a basic case analysis presented in Note 2 of the Case Guide Series—“Performing a Case Analysis” No. 9B18M054—can be used for various purposes: discussing the case in class writing a report making a presentation or writing a case exam. This note helps you to adequately prepare to discuss a case in class and to provide meaningful input to the class discussion. The guidelines in this note are for general use. You should always defer to your instructor’s requirements which may differ or be more specific. Prepare before ClassTo benefit from many of the opportunities of the case method you need to do your own analysis before class and make your own decisions based on that analysis. Read the case once for familiarity and a second time to gain a full command of the facts so you have good insight into the issues. As you read the case the second time highlight the key points and make notes based on your assigned tasks. If questions about the case are provided in the course syllabus they are intended to be used only as guidelines to identify the issues and some of the analysis to be done. You are still required to come to your own conclusions regarding the issues and relevant analysis. In most instances you are expected to do a full analysis of each case: identify the key issues problems or opportunities (collectively referred to hereafter as “issues”); analyze the issues using case facts and relevant business tools concepts and models; develop and evaluate some alternative solutions (again drawing on case facts and appropriate tools concepts and models); and recommend a course of action. Prepare two or three pages of notes to take to class. These notes will give you talking points for the class discussion. Use your notes in class to keep track of the points your colleagues raise and to quickly identify opportunities to add to the discussion. As you track the discussion you can formulate arguments to challenge your colleagues’ analysis of the case or to revise your own thoughts about the case. Due to time or space constraints your instructor might require only a partial case analysis. For example you could be asked to focus only on identifying and analyzing the issues. Alternatively the case might clearly define the issues and you could be asked to only identify and evaluate possible solutions. Another form of partial case analysis is a “directed case” in which you are directed to answer a specific set of questions about the case. In such cases your preparation for class should focus on the partial analysis you have been directed to perform.Contribute to In-Class DiscussionYour willingness to participate in the discussion of a case will enable you to consider a variety of viewpoints and insights and thereby gain the full benefits of the class’s collective knowledge and experience.In class the instructor’s role is to facilitate discussion often by asking questions. Students should do most of the talking and you should be prepared to provide supporting reasons for your views. You are expected to show respect for others’ opinions but you are also encouraged to challenge each other. Similarly you are expected to be willing to submit your analysis and conclusions to scrutiny by others without becoming defensive. Several good plans of action are usually possible so do not refrain from taking and maintaining a minority position provided you can defend your position using sound analysis. On the other hand feel free to change your position and recommendations as others’ views emerge and a more complete range of information is assembled. Due to time constraints it is impossible to discuss every aspect of a case in class. Therefore your instructor might steer the discussion in a particular direction or the discussion might centre on only one or two steps of the case analysis; for example identification and analysis of issues might be the focus of one case while on another occasion the issues might be clearly defined and your task could be to focus on developing possible solutions. Nevertheless you are welcome to introduce additional ideas other issues or a new alternative for instance. Doing so will help to avoid feeling frustrated because some of your best ideas are not discussed. While your instructor might not be able to discuss your ideas to your complete satisfaction you can enrich the discussion by noting additional aspects of the case that are worthy of more consideration.Generally the class as a whole will perform a more thorough and creative analysis than would be possible by any one person working alone or by any given small team of students. Therefore do not be discouraged because you did not consider a particular solution. As new ideas are raised be prepared to supplement or adjust your prepared analysis and recommendations. Listen to others in ClassListening to others in class is hard work. Use active listening techniques apply listening etiquette and refrain from activities that will prevent you or others from hearing what the speaker is saying.Use Active Listening TechniquesListen for the ideas the speaker is presenting not just the words being spoken. Link what one speaker is saying to what others have already said. By doing so you can build on their arguments or dispute their conclusions by making direct reference to their statements.Listen critically for the main argument the speaker is presenting so you can understand how the speaker’s argument differs from yours and how the speaker uses case facts concepts and models in analysis. Recognizing the logic of the speaker’s argument aids you in structuring your own argument in response.Active listening helps you build on analyses and arguments presented by previous speakers. Ask questions that clarify a speaker’s use of case facts concepts and models and that clarify the conclusions drawn by the speaker. Briefly summarizing a previous speaker’s comments in your notes ensures that you have understood what a colleague has said. This summary can also help you to establish and refine agreement among class members at various stages of the case discussion process.Avoid making judgments about a speaker’s ideas; quick judgments limit your willingness to hear what the speaker is saying which can lead you to discount the value of your colleague’s contribution to the case discussion. Having preconceived ideas about what a speaker might say can cause you to tune out of the conversation; and when you tune back in you could have missed a critical component of the speaker’s argument.Finally approach a discussion with an open mind: you might discover during the class discussion that you misinterpreted a fact or misapplied a concept or model and that the analysis alternatives and recommendation provided by others is more appropriate than yours.Use Listening EtiquetteListening etiquette begins with focused attention on the speaker. Allowing colleagues to share what they have diligently prepared shows respect for the time they have spent preparing and recognizes the value of their thoughts and contributions. Give feedback to the speaker through your body language: maintain eye contact with the speaker nod and smile when appropriate and physically lean into the conversation. Show respect by allowing the speaker to completely finish speaking. A pause could simply be the speaker taking an opportunity to gather thoughts not an indication that the speaker has finished talking. Appropriate listening etiquette requires that you do not carry on side conversations while a speaker has the floor. Side conversations distract not only the speaker but also those around you and could prevent a speaker’s ideas from being understood by the entire group. Appropriate listening etiquette also requires that you not be distracted by electronic devices. Ensure that your laptop is open to your notes and the case. Turn off your cellphone and put it out of sight. When your attention is distracted by electronic devices you also distract those around you and interfere with the collective understanding of the case.Good listening etiquette helps you to develop essential management competencies skills and abilities. Your technical analytical problem-solving and creative skills will be sharpened as you evaluate your own analysis against that of your colleagues.Enhance the Quality of Your Class ParticipationThere is no one single way to earn high marks for preparation and participation. However the following guidelines can enhance the quality of your class participation:Identify the most important issues including those that might have been overlooked by those closest to the situation.Provide supporting arguments for any statements you make or conclusions you draw but be clear and to the point.Share appropriate analyses; for example bring your proposed organizational chart or your financial analysis on a flash drive or at least be prepared to share a few key specifics of your analysis. This is a clear way to demonstrate your preparation.Come to a decision and be prepared to give your recommendations. Any analysis you have completed is of minimal value if it does not culminate in a decision. Participate in all phases of the discussion—identification and analysis of the issues development and evaluation of alternatives and development of an action plan.Interact with other students. Ask them to provide support for their arguments. State why you disagree with their opinion. Build on their analysis but avoid merely repeating what they have said.case analysis and academic integrityBecause case analysis is complex it may often seem helpful to discuss the case informally or formally with other students before participating in a class discussion writing a report or making a presentation. Managers and consultants often discuss problems with other people within the constraints allowed by confidentiality. Therefore your instructor may allow encourage or even require such discussion. However to ensure academic integrity and to avoid plagiarism unless your instructor has specifically indicated that some degree of discussion is permissible you should consult with your instructor before engaging in any collaboration. This restriction on outside discussion is especially necessary when preparing reports and presentations.It may also seem helpful to search the Internet for teaching notes for cases or for case reports or slide presentations prepared by other students. Academic integrity requires that you refrain from using such resources in full or in part. Any attempt to use the work of others and to pass it off as your own is plagiarism. If the instructor is suspicious that plagiarism might be involved you may be asked to upload a copy of your case report through Turnitin.com.While using the work of others may appear to provide a shortcut to a good grade the quality of online sources and the work of other students is often suspect at best. Most importantly you deprive yourself of the learning opportunities the case method offers.",0,,,,

Sasol an international energy company with annual turnover of US$21 billion in 2018 had entered the fuel retail market in 2004 and was planning to open 12 new franchise sites by the end of 2018. Sasol had a total of 399 franchise sites which it referred to as Sasol Convenience Centres (SCCs). SCCs usually consisted of an open area with the pumps (called the forecourt) where petrol diesel and engine oils were sold and a 24-hour convenience store. At the Stormvoël retail site in addition to the convenience store there was a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and an automatic teller machine (ATM). As Botha glanced through the window of her office she saw a queue of about five people in front of the ATM and others walking towards the KFC. She was pleased to notice that all of the parking bays in front of the petrol pumps were occupied. A couple of other customers walked between their cars and the convenience store. Observing the movements of these many customers Botha realized that to increase revenue she would need to scale Sasol retail service offerings at the site to include different products to cater to the different customers that walked in and out of the premises daily. To make an informed decision Botha would have to gather information on her customers’ needs such as what they were looking for why and at what times of day. However she was unsure about how to gather this information. Botha wondered about the demographics of her regular customers. What was the gender age parental status and general interests of these customers? The various brands in the service station industry had all been experiencing a decrease in customer visits at an average of 10 per cent over the last year (see Exhibit 1). According to research company Lightstone petrol brands BP Sasol and Total had experienced a large drop in visits while Engen had been impacted the least. In this competitive environment it was important for Botha’s service station to increase its efforts in building loyalty among its customers. career backgroundVicki Botha was born in 1957 in Johannesburg South Africa. Botha’s father a Greek immigrant had wished for her to adhere to the traditional Greek culture. She therefore attended a Greek boarding school and immediately upon finishing school she married a Portuguese man who lived in South Africa and they had a child. Her husband was a non-commissioned officer in the South African Defence Force and was regularly away at army camps. He adhered to traditional patriarchal Portuguese values regarding the role of a woman; for example he would not allow Botha to work in corporate organizations. Since she had no work experience and no tertiary qualifications she felt financially at risk since her husband was exposed to dangerous situations. After five years of being a housewife Botha eventually convinced her husband to allow her to work outside of their home and landed her first job as a travel agent. However 10 months into the job she was asked to travel to Israel but her husband did not allow her to travel and this led to her leaving the job. Botha’s husband saw banking as a suitable type of industry for his wife and advised her to look in that area for another job. In 1981 Botha started working at Standard Bank in Rustenburg in the North West Province as a junior clerk. She felt that she had to prove herself and so worked her way up the corporate ladder. In 1989 Botha was promoted in the Rustenburg branch and became the first woman appointed to a managerial position in a rural area. At the time there were only two other female managers at Standard Bank at its head office on Simmonds Street in Johannesburg’s city centre. Botha worked at the bank for eighteen and a half years. During that time she moved to Pretoria and became the commercial manager of the Pretoria branch which had been the second largest branch in South Africa. Botha completed several management development programs in banking while working at that branch.In 1992 Botha made the difficult decision to divorce her husband who had been both physically and emotionally abusive to her. She now had to provide for her three childrenaged six five and one at the time of the divorceon her own. Botha understood that it was her responsibility to make a better life for herself and her children. This gave her the determination to work even harder.resistance to women leadershipDuring her tenure as a bank manager in Rustenburg Botha experienced clients insisting on seeing a male manager and not wanting to talk to a female about their businesses. Rustenburg had a big farming community and the farmers would question Botha’s knowledge on farming. To be accepted in a man’s world she felt she had to change her persona at work-she was feminine neatly dressed and did not swear-especially because her role entailed ascertaining whether businesses could be granted an increase in their credit amounts. Botha also experienced heightened resistance from male clients in the construction industry who doubted her business acumen as a female. She had to adapt and believed that as a female manager she had to work a hundred times harder than a male in the same position to be accepted in that field. But faced with that disheartening prospect when the bank went through a restructuring and offered retrenchment packages Botha accepted a package and began looking for other opportunities. She had a client who wanted to sell a filling station and she grabbed the opportunity with her boyfriend at the time as a business partner.In her career as a manager in ascertaining credit risk Botha had seen that you could have all of the knowledge in the world an available business and customers but if there was a lack of financial management skills the business would fail. She assessed the filling station business in Pretoria and realized that aside from the purchase only a small capital investment was required; no major equipment needed replacing. It was primarily a cash business where they had no debtors’ book as they did not offer accounts.property acquisitionBotha married her business partner. When the couple made offers on the property they were told by Total South Africa the franchisor that if they sold fuel in litres they would probably be able to grow their business but would never grow the convenience store (called C-store at the time) to over R100000 turnover per month because the station was situated in a low-to-middle income area. Regardless the couple went ahead with the purchase of the property where Botha was responsible for the marketing stock control and costing and selling. Her husband was responsible for the assets maintenance and pumps. Despite the initial caution from Total within six months they had taken the C-store from R80000 to R430000 per month. With increasing the C-store’s turnover and changing the offering the fuel litres increased at the same time.From the time of the sale in 1999 Botha and her husband’s Total site became a key Total South Africa network site one of the company’s top pumping sites in the country winning awards every year. Botha and her husband even won a trip to Egypt in 2002 when they were awarded Regional Retailer of the Year. The couple’s convenience store offered a variety of goods and food offerings such as pies and sandwiches. In time they expanded the site by diversifying their offerings to include a car washone of the best in Pretoriaas well as a Steers fast-food outlet. Botha and her husband also bought the fuelling station site across the road and eventually opened an Exel filling station in 2002. Exel Petroleum (Pty) Limited and Sasol’s Sasol Oil (Pty) Limited merged and in 2004 the site became a Sasol branded site. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIPUnfortunately Botha and her husband divorced in 2009 and the process to separate the businesses became difficult. Everything went onto the market and they made counter-offers in a personal capacity. They settled on splitting the businesses in a way that gave each partner a filling stationso that they were across the road from each other. Botha retained the Sasol site while her former husband retained the Total site. It was a difficult time for Botha and she brought in her daughter to assist with the management of the site. Her daughter had been working for a large business group at the time as a financial manager. With her daughter’s support Botha endured and was able to keep the business on track.Botha’s daughter became a director in the franchised business and set boundaries for expenditure. Her daughter’s husband was an auditor working for the auditor-general and he supported his wife in her financial management duties. The business was a (Pty) Limited and for transparency it had to be audited regularly. Botha’s daughter was very thorough with financial control systems and was involved in every aspect of the business. Botha found it difficult to work in the male-dominated fuel industry as she observed that women were often not heard and perceived as not having the ability to understand the industry. However Botha was hands-on and she made sure to be involved in the business. Botha was passionate about the fuel industry because it had allowed her to grow (see Exhibit 5). As a single mother she had had to leave her young son in the care of her two elder daughters. The resulting experiences during their childhood had had an impact on her daughters and they realized that getting an education was important. Botha had earned enough income through her business to send her children to university and she took great pride in their achievementsthey were awarded distinctions during their studies. Both daughters gained financial degrees and became mature independent women who were realistic about how difficult life could be. Botha’s experience in the banking sector had assisted her in gaining financial skills management skills and time and relationship management skills. Botha’s entrepreneurship gave her the means to provide for and even spoil her children and later on grandchildren. Her entrepreneurial focus also gave her the autonomy she desired. Botha was inspired to prove that in spite of not having a degree she could be successful and enhance her lifestyle. She was not motivated by material things or by owning more than what she needed; rather providing for her children was what drove her in her life.Contextual LEADERSHIP practicesBotha was fair as well as firm. She tended to be aggressive with others in her business dealings when her principles were violated due to her passion for what she believed in. She believed that there was not one style of leadership and so used different styles or a combination of leadership styles depending on what was required in any given situation. She could be unwavering in her stance while still being empathetic with others. Although she had attended many training courses on leadership when working at the bank she realized that the training had been theory-focused and lacked practical application. Botha had to learn through experience to deal with difficult situations that arose in establishing controls in the business. She had always been curious and while working at the bank she had often gone into work early to investigate how the different administrative processes worked. When she joined the fuel industry she again wanted to learn every operational activity. She had initially retained one female employee from the previous owner; however later on as Botha became closely involved in the operations she realized that this employee had stolen R80000 worth of stock. Botha had to terminate the employee’s contract. From that day on Botha ensured that she checked each and every detail of her operations.Botha learned how the customers would enter the store and where they would focus their attention and she improved the store layout accordingly in order to grow the business. Botha gained knowledge of what aspect of consumer behavior to focus on. While she understood the balance sheets she relied on others to handle the accounting side of the business by making all entries and creating the financial statements. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND FUEL FRANCHISING BUSINESS MODELIn 2017 there were approximately 4600 service stations in South Africa in total pumping on average 300000 litres of fuel per month. The retail fuel sector was perceived as one of the best franchising opportunities in South Africa. It contributed in excess of 6 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product and supported the employment of over 100000 people directly or indirectly. While fuel sales remained 80 per cent of an operation’s turnover retail fuel operators were generally maximizing revenues by adding alternate profit centres to their fuel sales for example quick-service restaurants convenience stores and car washes. There were three ownership structures: investing in the physical building land and associated assets called a prop-co; purchasing the business operation only (op-co); or purchasing both (prop-co and op-co). As part of a franchise the franchisees adopted the parent company’s brand reputation as well as its tried-and-tested concepts. The franchisor also offered marketing and buying support as well as a degree of business guidance and mentorship. In contrast independent fuelling station owners were afforded the freedom and flexibility to run their operations in an autonomous mannerfrom the services they offered to their stations’ hours of operation. In addition independents could sell their business to anyone without oversight from the parent company. In the case of Botha she owned the business operations as a franchising business. The 2017 Sasol Franchise Prospectus indicated that a Sasol franchisee was required to demonstrate ethical behavior be a compliant entrepreneur be a passionate Sasol ambassador have sales and marketing skills have knowledge in customer service orientation have a financial and business acumen and finally demonstrate leadership skills. Franchisees were supposed to have at least 2060 per cent unencumbered cash of the total capital required for investment.The Sasol fuel franchise business model involved the property that was rented by Sasol on contract; if anything was added to the site it was for Sasol’s benefit not the benefit of the franchisee. The KFC on Botha’s site had been made too largeit had a sit-down area for 50 people when there were regularly around only four people at a time visiting it. The KFC and its drive-through caused blockages at the C-store’s entrance and exit and blocked traffic trying to pull up to the C-store in this way restricting the amount of available parking bays. Nonetheless the KFC brought Sasol increased revenue.Botha reflected on the increased complexity of the business due to a recent change in how the retail margin was calculated. For instance there was a retail margin a wholesale margin and the cost of fuel. The new arrangement was called RAS or Regulatory Accounting System.With the new RAS whoever invested in the assets would get a return. The dealer-owned (also called retailer-owned) sites had a supply agreement deal with the oil company and they earned a much better return on their whole investment. With company-owned retail (CORO) sites the oil company either owned the land or contracted a long-term lease for the land to host its filling station. A retailer entrepreneur operated the business side. With the company-owned deal the land was leased to Sasol or to another oil company. Under the new system Botha’s business thus reverted to being a CORO because Sasol owned that property. The problem with the system was that the retailer was not being rewarded because a retailer might grow or have already grown the site from say 200000 to 600000 litres. The retailer was not being rewarded for this growth. Therefore there was a line item added under the capital investment (capex) balance sheet called Entrepreneurial Compensation. The RAS caused major issues for CORO sites because when the system was changed there was about a six-month lag in bringing the retailers’ costs up to date. There were disagreements between oil companies and retailers and even between oil companies and the government. The oil companies said that the government could not regulate this contract since it was a commercial contract between oil companies and retailers. Court cases arose. In 2018 the Technical Committee was supposed to revise a retail margin. The public’s perception was that every time the price of petrol rose the retailers were earning more which was not the case. In fact the retail margin was increased only twice a year and since it was a regulated market the wage increase was attached to the increase in the retail margin. In December 2017 there was supposed to be a revision in the operational expenses and a margin increase awarded based on it. However the operational expenses were not a true reflection of actual cost. For instance credit cards costs increased. The bank charged the retailer in relation to the value of the rand not in relation to litres so retailers were remunerated by the retail margin per litre but not by the rand cost. The litre amount had more or less stayed the same while the rand cost of bank charges was a percentage per rand value. Several retailers in the industry were experiencing serious financial strain. Some used the expression “sitting on a landmine” to describe people who had opened a petrol station where that business was becoming more and more difficult. Fuel prices had also increased over the last decade (see Exhibit 2). Journalists were therefore calling South Africa one of the most expensive places in the world to keep petrol tanks full. Sasol fortunately was a well-known brand in South Africa and the company was loyal to the countryeven its vision emphasized its roots in South African heritage (see Sasol’s vision and purpose statement in Exhibit 3). The Sasol Franchise Prospectus highlighted that the Sasol brand had a loyal following (see Exhibit 4 for the benefits of a Sasol franchise). However Botha realized that it was not adequate to rely solely on the Sasol brand to create loyal customers. Botha was passionate about the fuel industry and had experienced various achievements including being a member of bargaining councils and organizations that represented the fuel retail franchise industry (see Exhibit 5 for a summary of these positions).customer informationThe controls in the retail business had to be precise and tight because retailers could not change their petrol price and so then had to be able to offer added services. This is why the C-stores-and later bakeries-were introduced. The car wash was also an added service. Retailers offered ATMs to enable customers to do many things in one place since convenience was currently a major driver for consumers. Over the last couple of years the market changed whereby all fuel retailers sold petrol as well as the same brands of chocolate the same line of the Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) products and the same newspaper among other items. In 2018 Botha observed a decrease in customer visits to service stations and because of that decrease in visits it was necessary to increase the additional offerings. Customers were no longer prepared to buy pies and sandwiches at a high cost. Ten years earlier 80 per cent of sales had been from cigarettes Coca-Cola products airtime newspapers milk and bread. Botha observed that previously the typical customer was male who bought a pie on his way to a meeting. She noted that by 2018 customers wanted to be able to stop at the fuel station and buy a healthy food offering that they could take home to their families.The convenience value was important to consumers as well as the time saving of not needing to prepare a meal at home since most families had two working parents. What the customer needed from a convenience store had changed dramatically. The key focus in all stores had been the location of the Coca-Cola fridges with everything else placed around them. The Coca-Cola fridges were in the furthest corner so that impulse buying for items such as chocolate bars could happen while customers were on their way to the cashier. If customers wanted to buy groceries they would walk around the store to find a specific item. The rest of their shopping was impulse buying so the retailer needed customers to go through the aisles and select impulse goods while on their way to the Coca-Cola fridge. However over the last couple of years Botha observed that the sales of carbonated drinks and cigarettes were dropping as well as sales of pies and unhealthy food. (The growth area was in freshly prepared healthy food where the price represented good value to the customer.) While waiting for the car wash customers wanted to have free Wi-Fi access. Some of the oil companies had added a dry cleaner depot to their petrol stations. Security at the filling station was also important so the area had to be well lit at night. Good customer service was all about knowing your area knowing the customers you were serving and knowing what they wanted.Previously retailers had known who their regular customer was but they did not know what was actually bringing the customer to the filling station nor did the retailer have contact details for the customer. Botha realized that she and her staff had to build up a database of their customers to ensure the sustainability of the business. She had learned that retail chain Woolworths where she had been a regular customer gave relevant vouchers because it was aware of what the customers had been buying. She noticed how Woolworths had directed its marketing towards each specific customer by taking her gender age and preferences into account. Botha having experienced the difficulties of being a woman in a masculine business environment wondered about her own efforts going forward in expanding the business and how being a woman might enable or restrict her in her business dealings.Botha wanted to know more about the profile of her typical customer. She already knew that customers wanted to be rewarded and that they liked to receive a message on their birthday. So a couple years earlier in an effort to reward customers Botha had a loyalty card made and every now and again they released the loyalty program again. Botha and her staff needed to complete the customer information so they designed a card that asked whether the customer was happy with the service and what the store could add to its bakery. Unfortunately customers’ names were sometimes scribbled and unreadable. The attendants supervisors and Botha’s forecourt manager would administer the card but they were not concerned about the quality of the replies as long as the boxes were ticked. So when customers scribbled or left out their cell phone numbers and email addresses it did not really matter to the staffyet currently that information was key. Botha had to encourage her employees to manage the gathering of information better. When they were offering a discount they could actually text message or email customers. However that was just a fraction of where they needed to get to. They needed to build that database to personalize their messages to customers so that they could give the customer the feeling that the store really knew them and that they meant something. Botha wanted to customize her marketing efforts to the specific demographical profile of the customer and their preferences. The way forwardGoing forward Botha and her staff would have to take the customers’ changing needs into account. The question remained how could they gather adequate customer information to increase revenue for the business?EXHIBIT 1: drop in SOUTH AFRICAN CONSUMERS’ VISITS TO SERVICE STATIONS Source: Table created by the authors with content adapted from Lightstone Explore and Tracker Fuel Increases and Consumer Behavior: Lightstone Investigates the Impact on Distances Driven and Consumer Trends 5 2018 accessed December 22 2020 www.lightstoneexplore.co.za/news/Fuel_inceases_and_consumer_behaviour.pdf.Exhibit 2: Fuel price fluctuations in monthly Per-litre price of inland 95-octane petrol (20082018)Source: Graph created by the authors using information from South African Market Insights South Africa’s fuel price history since January 2008 date May 3 2018 Category: Fuel prices and inflation accessed May 11 2021 at https://www.southafricanmi.com/blog-3may2018.html.EXHIBIT 3: SASOL VISION AND PURPOSEOur vision is “To be a leading integrated global chemical and energy company proudly rooted in our South African heritage delivering superior value to our stakeholders”.

Hanna had attended the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition in 2014 and received a diploma in holistic nutrition as well as a certified holistic nutritionist designation. She was also a Reiki master continuing her journey the following summer to Mysore India where she received her Registered Yoga Teacher certification (RYT 200). For the past year she had offered her services to health-conscious consumers who were open to pursuing a natural and holistic lifestyle. Now she recognized a gap in the Calgary market which represented a new business opportunity. She wanted to open a new brick-and-mortar enterprise within one year. Could Hanna determine a viable marketing strategy for opening a physical location and create a viable business plan to make this happen in such a short period? POSANA INTEGRATIVE WELLNESS: the beginningCalgary was the largest city in Alberta owing its rapid growth to its status as the centre of Canada’s oil and gas industry. According to the 2016 census the city’s total population stood at 1392609 million. Calgary was also a dynamic and vibrant city offering everything that citizens as well as leisure and business travellers could desire. The health and wellness industry had been growing at a steady pace for more than a decade in Calgary and inspired Hanna to become involved in the fastest growing health and wellness movement in North America. Personally Hanna found herself frequently ill and lacking energy throughout her day. Like most individuals she visited many doctors who tried to merely write her a prescription. She knew that the solution involved more than just taking some pills. As her true passion had always centred on nutrition health and yoga she began looking for alternative remedies which finally led her to a holistic medicine practitioner. Hanna’s research into holistic products and other resources led to a life-changing moment. After starting her own integrative wellness journey she had more energy than ever. Her sickness migraines and digestive issues dissipated. Hanna realized that people ran such busy lives and were so focused on working earning money and obtaining career success that they often forgot to concentrate on daily health and nutrition as well as living a more organic and holistic life. Hanna started Posana as a way to help individuals reach their personal goals and lead healthier happier lives in the most natural way.TARGET MARKETFrom the 1980s forward lifestyle trends began to focus on living a natural and balanced life incorporating more holistic practices. Hanna’s primary target market was women aged 35–65 with a medium to high income although her services could appeal to men as well. Calgary’s corporate environment could also benefit from her services. The women Hanna was targeting tended to have disposable income to spend on the services she offered. Through her experience providing services to these women she had learned that they felt excluded from the majority of today’s health and wellness services in Calgary. They were anxious to improve their own health and wellness as they entered the next stages of life. Hanna was mainly focused on the business-to-consumer (B2C) market but she also wanted to develop the business-to-business (B2B) market—in particular corporate clients. Employers were searching for ways to improve the productivity of their businesses and they were concerned about the health of their business as it related to the health of their people. More and more organizations were turning to corporate wellness programs to support and raise awareness about their employees’ health needs as a way to improve their health. Many organizations made physical exercise facilities available for their employees implemented fitness programs and promoted healthy eating habits by providing workplace health programs workshops and training in nutrition.HEALTH AND WELLNESS INDUSTRYIn 2016 an international market research report confirmed that wellness was one of the world’s fastest growing and most resilient markets. From 2013–2015 the global wellness sector registered double-digit growth while the global economy/gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 3.6 per cent—a “growth gap” of nearly 15 per cent. Moreover the global wellness economy reached US$3.72 trillion and growth was expected to continue. The wellness industry represented 5.1 per cent of global economic output in 2015 (see Exhibit 1). Furthermore in 2017 an international market research organization published a study on health and wellness that provided an outlook for the Canadian economy. The study suggested that growth for the next few years would remain modest and challenging in accordance with the latest macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth the unemployment rate and growth in disposable income. For a new entrepreneur such as Hanna the most interesting part of this report was where the researchers mentioned that the health and wellness trend would be supported by demographic changes consumer demand for premium and quality foods and beverages as well as rising health consciousness. Greater investment from industry participants—such as ingredient suppliers product manufacturers brands and retailers—would lead to greater awareness and the enhanced availability of health and wellness offerings among Canadian consumers keeping them interested and excited. The report predicted that the health-conscious culture would continue to evolve in Canada as manifested in a wide range of areas (food and beverages nutritional value and more). It would be further reinforced by the growth of the elderly population and rising purchasing power among the younger generations.In 2017 another report by a women’s marketing and media agency mentioned that there would be a tremendous opportunity for marketers to meet the needs of health-focused consumers. The report identified strategic areas of growth ranging from beauty-enhancing supplements to eco-tourism as wellness was the new luxury. It specified that health and wellness had become more than a lifestyle and was now a status symbol. Women aspired to own expensive leggings eat the most nutritious foods and work out at boutique fitness facilities and were embracing a more holistic and natural approach toward their personal and professional lives. The report also mentioned that women with a wellness mindset tended to be more focused on transformational experiences. These women were still acquisition-minded but only if products and services authentically aligned with their values while enhancing their status.ALBERTA ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT In 2015 a recession hit Alberta’s economy affecting workers and businesses. It was one of the most severe recessions the province had ever endured. In 2015 the Alberta economy contracted by –4.0 per cent due in large part to the negative impact of the recent 40-per-cent oil price decline to US$70 a barrel. Despite this recent contraction Alberta had led all Canadian provinces in economic growth over the previous 20 years with an average annual GDP growth of 3.2 per cent per year. The province was still poised to have much higher GDP per capita than any other province. Alberta’s average unemployment rate in 2015 was the third lowest in Canada at 6.0 per cent. The province had capitalized on its strengths in agriculture energy forestry and industrial products to develop a dynamic and diverse economy. In 2015 out of the total GDP of CA$333.1 billion the health-care industry represented 5.8 per cent retail and wholesale represented 9.6 per cent and business and commerce services represented 11.6 per cent. Even in recession after so many years of country-leading growth figures the strength of Alberta’s economic recovery would hinge on how well it would tackle the challenges of budget deficits inadequate pipeline capacity and addressing climate change among other issues. The province continued to have a competitive tax regime and a young highly educated workforce. FundingThere were various sources of funding available to Hanna to finance her new brick-and-mortar business. Aside from her personal investment a classic chartered bank loan and potential investors she could apply for special lending programs such as the Alberta Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) lending program the Startup Canada Women Entrepreneurship Fund the Futurpreneur Canada Start-Up Program and a Business Development Bank of Canada loan. MARKETING RESEARCHHanna knew that properly planned and executed marketing research would save her money and keep her from ineffectively targeting the wrong market segments and offering the wrong services at the wrong prices. By conducting proper marketing research in Calgary she determined which target markets would be most interested in the types of services she had to offer. The population of interest from this research focused on women aged 35–65 but she was also interested in attracting males in the same age range. Most of her target population worked full-time but it also included retired people students and stay-at-home moms. Hanna used a sample of 50 potential clients selected randomly from four different quadrants in Calgary (northwest northeast southwest and southeast). She wanted to focus her research on interviewing new potential clients and thus did not survey her current clients. The research design Hanna used was in the form of an exploratory survey. She felt it was appropriate to use this type of design to gain more background information on potential customers’ needs and preferences. The exploratory research was not intended to provide conclusive evidence. However it would help Hanna better understand the current market and allow her to change directions as a result of revelations from new data findings and insights about her customers. The Posana survey contained 11 questions. It covered areas such as the importance of various features of a wellness centre the prices clients would be willing to pay and client interest in private holistic wellness services. The research findings from her May 2016 marketing research conducted in Calgary helped her make the decision to open her first brick-and-mortar store. She developed a marketing strategy based on these results (see Exhibit 2). ProductSince launching Posana in October 2015 Hanna had been busy offering clients a wide range of holistic nutritional consultations yoga sessions reiki outdoor hikes and much more (see Exhibit 3). She wanted to offer more services to her clients in the near future. Having started with only a few clients she began conducting business throughout Calgary and the surrounding areas. She also began working with the Calgary Board of Education and hospitals hosting nutrition seminars with parents as she believed that healthy lifestyles began at home. Her typical clients (women aged 35–65) were looking to achieve better overall health and were open to new approaches and alternatives. She provided workshops and regular yoga classes out of Ascension Fitness in Calgary. She also traveled to clients’ homes and studios. Hanna was open to offering customized lifestyle packages. Catered dinner parties enhanced the value factor for her higher income clients as she could customize menus and themes to appeal to each client. To be able to perform her nutrition workshops she needed to have the proper food certification to prepare and serve food to her clients. In Alberta food facilities where food was prepared for and/or served to the public were required to employ staff holding a food safety certificate recognized by Alberta’s Minister of Health and Wellness. Although these services already existed in Calgary not many competitors were offering the range of integrated services that Posana did. At that time the B2C clients had the option of purchasing individual services but Hanna also wanted to offer pre-bundled packages for both the B2C and B2B markets. She felt that if Calgary’s economy recovered quickly from the oil price crash of 2015 her current target market strategy could be continued. Other options included allowing clients to build their own package by purchasing her services individually or choosing from one of several pre-bundled packages. If a client chose the individual option a discount could be offered for every three services bundled. With this option discounts would be worked into the prices of the pre-bundled packages.PriceHanna knew that getting pricing correct was tricky as pricing had to reflect supply and demand. Pricing a product too high or too low could mean the loss of sales for the business. She wanted to use a combination of follow-the-leader and variable pricing strategies to penetrate the market and build her reputation and brand. Follow-the-leader entailed basing prices on existing competitor prices. Variable pricing gave the flexibility to offer different prices to different customers depending on their specific needs and circumstances. Hanna was currently offering her services at 25 per cent less than her competitors in order to be more competitive. However she did not have to pay for employees and the operational expenses linked to a brick-and-mortar location such as employees commercial lease advertising and so on (see Exhibit 4). Distribution The distribution strategy outlined how and where consumers bought a company’s product or service. Hanna sold her services directly to her clients. This strategy gave her the advantage of controlling her entire supply chain and enabled her to better satisfy her customers’ needs. Product knowledge training was not applicable at this time as she did not have any other employees. However training would be taken into consideration once the wellness centre opened. Posana’s main distribution channel was the B2C-oriented market. However Hanna hoped to explore the B2B market as well. Becoming involved with corporate Calgary would allow potential businesses to fold her services into their employees’ flexible benefits. Her company was also becoming involved with Calgary schools by educating students and their parents on the benefits of healthy eating and living. She wanted to create strategic alliances with local businesses and was wondering where to focus and how to create a win–win situation for both parties. Currently her direct distribution channel allowed her to control her entire supply chain in the B2C market; however she was looking at expanding to include B2B services to increase her brand recognition and market share. Hanna also wanted to find a central location that was convenient accessible and comfortable for clients. She wanted to personalize packages to best fit the lifestyles of her individual clients. She was dedicated to treating each individual as a unique project.Promotion Hanna’s goal was to empower her clients to become the most authentic and healthy versions of themselves. The industry was in the growth stage of its life cycle but Posana was still in the introductory stage. By offering customizable lifestyle packages to suit consumer needs she would position her company as a premier teacher and partner in her clients’ holistic journeys. She invested in building an informational website that emphasized her different services in order to highlight them for potential clients. She needed to make her website more efficient and user friendly and to increase her social media presence. Although social media had assisted in promoting her business word of mouth was her greatest marketing tool. In order to strengthen awareness in her B2C markets she wanted to find new ways to communicate and create a buzz with potential clients. She was active on Facebook Inc. Instagram Inc. Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corporation websites about upcoming promotions and events she was hosting or attending. She knew that she would need to attend trade shows and other local events to gain more exposure as well as increase her public relations activities before her grand opening in September 2017. For her B2B markets her plan was not as defined. She had collaborated with the Calgary Board of Education and select hospitals. She talked to parents and patients about how important a healthy lifestyle could be describing the positive effects it could have on the mind body and soul. She knew she needed access to company decision makers who would allow her to demonstrate how her wellness services could benefit their professional employees. She needed to integrate both B2C and B2B markets into her marketing strategy. She planned for a total annual marketing cost for the first year of $11000 and a 5-per-cent increase for the following year.COMPETITIONWhile performing her market research Hanna found several competitors that offered some but not all of the same services she did. There were similar businesses that offered a wide variety of alternative health services in Calgary. However she found there was a gap in the market as no other businesses offered the same integrated combination of services as Posana. Some businesses offered key aspects of holistic wellness and yoga but not all in one location. Main CompetitorsHanna’s business had three main competitors. Prema Health offered yoga reiki and other holistic services. Awaken Holistic Health & Wellness Inc. offered yoga reiki nutrition counselling meditation chiropractic care physiotherapy and alternative therapies. Samadhi Yoga (Samadhi) focused more on yoga. Other Samadhi services included a raw food and juice bar reiki holistic nutrition and reflexology workshops and various wellness treatments. Samadhi had introduced corporate wellness into its studio offering studio and in-house classes. Samadhi represented the closest local competition for Hanna’s new business. Most yoga classes and nutrition consultations from these three competitors were more expensive. Their services were priced 25 per cent higher than Posana’s services ranging from $70–$120 for the same amount of time. While her competitors did offer some of the same services they generally did not offer them on a one-on-one basis. Hanna created a competition map to help her position Posana’s performance level with her three main competitors. The map concentrated on the rankings in four criteria that she had identified as key success factors for her start-up: price location accessibility and availability of services compared to her competitors. The ranking was done on a scale from one to four with four being the highest performance level for each criteria (see Exhibit 5).For price Hanna positioned Posana at the highest value because her yoga classes and nutrition consultations were 25 per cent less expensive than her three competitors for the same amount of time and the same services. For location Hanna positioned Posana at the highest value as she had tested the time to travel to some of her clients’ homes by taking some addresses from the far southwest and the far northeast quadrants of Calgary and averaged the time needed to travel to each competitor’s location. For accessibility Hanna positioned Posana at the highest level as her current clients did not need to worry about parking availability and parking costs. Awaken Holistic received a score of zero only because it had not yet opened; Hanna therefore had no information on its location and accessibility. Samadhi and Prema Health were located downtown and in the beltline of Calgary—high car traffic locations with no reserved parking spaces which represented a challenge for customers to find parking at a reasonable price.For availability of services Hanna positioned Posana with the highest value for offering all of her services on a one-on-one basis with no group classes. While Posana’s three competitors did offer some of the same services as she did they generally did not offer them on a one-on-one basis. Competitive AdvantageThe general factors that contributed to a company’s competitive advantage were price and value unique service features notable product attributes customer service and accessibility. The biggest factor contributing to Posana’s competitive advantage was the broad range of holistic and wellness services it offered. Posana’s competitive advantage was a focused differentiation strategy. In order for a differentiation strategy to be effective the target market had to be convinced of the uniqueness and desirability of the services. In Posana’s case the particular market segment being targeted was women aged 35–65 with disposable income. A focused differentiation strategy enabled Hanna to attract an exclusive market of individuals mainly women nearing retirement age who felt left out of the health and wellness industry. By being a first mover in targeting this group Hanna felt she had successfully created a strong foothold in this market and could sustain her competitive advantage against any rivals hoping to enter.moving forward: MARKETING STRATEGYHanna had many important decisions to make. She was unsure how to approach the Calgary market or where to find the right information to grow her business. She did not want to base her decision to enter into a full-time venture on intuition alone. Hanna also had to define her marketing strategy. She wanted to use the 4Ps (product price place and promotion) of the marketing mix to build a marketing plan for her brick-and-mortar expansion in Calgary for September 2017.EXHIBIT 1: Excerpts from global wellness institute ARTICLE “WELLNESS NOW A $3.72 TRILLION GLOBAL INDUSTRY—WITH 10.6% GROWTH FROM 2013–2015”Kitzbühel Austria—October 17 2016—The global wellness industry grew 10.6% in the last two years from a $3.36-trillion market in 2013 to $3.72 trillion in 2015 according to research released today by the Global Wellness Institute (GWI). This new data on the 10 markets that comprise the global wellness “cluster” provides fresh evidence that wellness is one of the world’s largest fastest growing and most resilient markets. 
Economic context: From 2013–2015 the global wellness sector registered double-digit growth while the global economy/GDP [gross domestic product] shrank by –3.6%—a “growth gap” of nearly 15%. The wellness industry now represents 5.1% of global economic output. Wellness expenditures are now nearly half as large as total global health expenditures ($7.6 trillion).Among the 10 wellness markets analyzed the fastest growing from 2013–2015 were: 1) Preventative/Personalized Medicine & Public Health (+23.5%); 2) Fitness & Mind-Body (+21.4%); 3) Wellness Lifestyle Real Estate (+18.6%); 4) Wellness Tourism (+14%); and 5) Healthy Eating Nutrition & Weight Loss (+12.8%). 
These topline numbers were released today at the 10th annual Global Wellness Summit being held in Kitzbühel Austria which has attracted 500 industry leaders from 45 nations. The in-depth report the 2016 Global Wellness Economy Monitor with detailed data on regional and national wellness markets will be released in early 2017.
“Recent years have been marked by global economic contraction and disruptive geopolitical events but a ‘wellness economy’ just keeps rising with an upward trajectory that seems unstoppable” said Ophelia Yeung Senior Research Fellow GWI. “And we predict that consumers governments and employers will continue to spend big on wellness because of these megatrends: an emerging global middle class a rapidly aging world population a chronic disease and stress epidemic the failure of the ‘sick-care’ medical model (resulting in uncontrollable health care costs) and a growing subset of (more affluent educated) consumers seeking experiences rooted in meaning purpose authenticity and nature.” 
Global Wellness Markets—2013–2015 Note: Growth percentages are conservative as revenues are reported in U.S. dollars 
which appreciated significantly from 2013–2015 against the currencies of major wellness markets including the Euro Russian Ruble Canadian Dollar Japanese Yen Indian Rupee and Brazilian Real.2013 revenues—2015 revenues Beauty and Anti-Aging: $1.02 trillion—$999 billion Healthy Eating Nutrition & Weight Loss: $574.2 billion—$647.8 billion Wellness Tourism: $494.1 billion—$563.2 billion Fitness & Mind-Body: $446.4 billion—$542 billion Preventative & Personalized Medicine & Public Health: $432.7 billion—$534.3 billion Complementary & Alternative Medicine: $186.7 billion—$199 billionWellness Lifestyle Real Estate: $100 billion—$118.6 billionSpa Industry: $94 billion—$98.6 billion Thermal/Mineral Springs Facilities: $50 billion—$51 billionWorkplace Wellness: $40.7 billion—$43.3 billionEXHIBIT 1: ContinuedSpotlight on 5 Markets (Original GWI Data): 
Wellness Tourism: From 2013–2015 wellness tourism revenues grew 14% more than twice as fast as overall tourism expenditures (6.9%). World travellers made 691 million wellness trips in 2015 104.4 million more than in 2013. Wellness tourism now accounts for 15.6% of total tourism revenues—nearing 1 in 6 of total “tourist dollars” spent. That is in part because wellness travelers spend much more per trip: international wellness tourists spend 61% more (US$1613/trip) than the average international tourist and the premium for domestic wellness travellers is even higher: $654 per trip 164% higher than the typical domestic tourist. Wellness tourism is responsible for 17.9 million jobs worldwide.

Spa Industry: The spa economy including spa facility revenues ($77.6 billion) as well as education consulting associations media and event sectors that enable spa businesses ($21 billion) grew to a $98.6-billion market in 2015. Spa locations jumped from 105591 in 2013 to 121595 in 2015. Since 2013 the industry has added 16000 spas more than 230000 workers (to reach 2.1 million) and $3.5 billion in revenue. The modest 2.3% annual revenue growth rate (2013–2015) is largely due to the U.S. dollar currency conversion from large spa markets across Europe and Asia. If global spa facility revenues are converted to the Euro the market actually grew a robust 25%: from €56 billion to €70.1 billion. Thermal & Mineral Springs: The number of revenue-earning thermal/mineral springs properties grew from 26847 in 2013 to 27507 in 2015—a gain of 660 facilities across 109 countries. These businesses earned $51 billion in 2015 up 2% from 2013. While this gain looks modest GWI research finds rapidly rising consumer interest in springs-based activities—and 2015 revenues are heavily impacted by the depreciation of European currencies against the dollar as Europe represents 39% of industry revenues. 

Workplace Wellness: As the cost of unwell workers skyrockets (reaching 10–15% of global economic output) employers are spending more on employee wellness each year. The global industry grew 6.4% from 2013–2015 to $43.3 billion. But two-thirds of that spend is concentrated in North America ($16.2 billion) and Europe ($16.1 billion). And the GWI estimates that with only 9.5% of today’s workforce covered by a workplace wellness program this remains a wellness market with some of the largest growth opportunity. 

Wellness Lifestyle Real Estate: The market for residential hospitality and mixed-used real estate that incorporates wellness elements (i.e. human social and environmental health) into its design construction amenities and services was one of the fastest-growing wellness sectors from 2013–2015: growing 19% to $118.6 billion. “A profound shift in the way people consume wellness is underway: once a luxury or ‘add-on’ it’s now being infused into every aspect of daily life—from how people work to how they travel” noted Katherine Johnston Senior Research Fellow GWI. “And the spending on proactive healthy choices—on wellness—will continue to comprise a greater percentage of massive multi-trillion industries whether real estate food and beverage or travel.” Source: With permission “Wellness Now a $3.72 Trillon Global Industry—with 10.6% Growth from 2013–2015” Global Wellness Institute October 17 2016 accessed December 18 2017 https://www.globalwellnessinstitute.org/wellness-now-a-372-trillion-global-industry.EXHIBIT 2: POSANA’S MARKETING QUESTIONNAIRE AND RESEARCH RESULTSQuestion 1: What is your gender?

Norman Wiechert owner of NewStar Marine & Scooter Inc. (NMS) sat at his kitchen table reviewing the end-of-year financial statements for 2016. He and his wife Dalyce Mallion were aging entrepreneurs who operated a unique family business in Eastern Passage Nova Scotia. As a retail shop NMS offered a diverse range of products including a line of inflatable boats aluminum boats outboard motors and trailers as well as a line of electric bikes scooters and mobility scooters. In its three years of business sales had tripled from CA$198000 in 2014 to $600000 in 2016. Although the direction for the company had always been positive near the end of 2016 Wiechert started to struggle with added responsibilities unhappy employees a lack of facility space and poor-quality products. For NMS to continue its remarkable growth Wiechert needed to rethink his operational and marketing strategies. Wiechert was considering several ideas but nothing was concrete. He first considered moving the entire business closer to the city (downtown Halifax was a 30-minute drive away) and transforming a large warehouse into a stunning showroom. He could then split the stock and move the scooter business into a smaller shop downtown. If Wiechert did not move he could make better use of the current land by redesigning a completely new building or at least an add-on structure that provided more indoor space. Mallion liked this idea because a newer building could reduce future maintenance costs. On the other hand Wiechert worried about the loss of revenue and customer loyalty while his location was under construction. As Wiechert contemplated a new direction for the business he began to consider selling the business and harvesting the investment. He and Mallion were nearing retirement and this could be an opportunity to sell while the business was still growing. Wiechert left his home office to open the showroom for 10:00 a.m. That day a married couple stopped in and complimented Wiechert’s great customer service and beautiful seaside location. This comment had him thinking—maybe he didn’t need to make any major changes after all. He was torn. NMS had no well-defined growth plan which made the implementation of any plan a much more difficult task. COMPANY BACKGROUNDWiechert aged 53 never attended university to study business. He was a tool and die journeyman who had always had an interest in boating as a hobby (see Exhibit 1). His entrepreneurial spirit first led him to real estate as the founder of NewStar Properties. Mallion now operated this 15-year-old property development business which consisted of three apartment buildings and generated just over $400000 in annual gross revenue. When Wiechert had completed all major renovations for his property business he began actively looking for another opportunity to generate additional income. In 2011 he started a small proprietorship buying and selling a no-frills brand of small outboard motors (i.e. APS outboard motors) out of a rented storage unit. He soon expanded his product line to include an affordable brand of inflatable boats and eventually added a line of scooters. NewStar Marine & Scooter Inc. was officially started in September 2013 with the purchase of an acre (0.4 hectares) of property in Eastern Passage Nova Scotia. The property a beautiful marine setting facing the protected Halifax harbour close to a heritage fishing village and boat launch was ideal for development. It was zoned commercially and had two residential income properties on the premises to offset the initial start-up costs. These homes were renovated and rented at once to produce an annual gross income of $22000. The main level of one of the homes was separated from the rest of the house and was transformed into a 1000-square-foot (93-square-metre) showroom for NMS while the two-door adjacent garage was insulated to become a workshop and storage facility. After investing $290000 to purchase the land and another $70000 to complete the renovations landscaping a parking lot and signage the retail shop opened for business on January 1 2014.A DIVERSE PRODUCT LINEWiechert believed he would attract more profitable consumers by offering more unique products. Each year he set one primary goal: to sell products no other competitors were offering locally. This goal guided him toward products such as the Toss N’ Save and the Wavewalk—respectively a foldable rigid inflatable boat and a foldable yacht cycle. Most of these products piqued consumer interest but were largely unsuccessful as they were too new to the market. Over the years NMS became a dealer for several successful brands including Daymak Suzuki and Tohatsu which increased the variety and credibility of well-known products. Aside from offering small miscellaneous products NMS had four major retail categories: boats motors scooters and trailers (see Exhibit 2). Boats consistently attracted the largest sales while 2016 sales of motors had made a huge leap from 2015 (see Exhibit 3). Each category included multiple sizes styles and brands which contributed to the varying margins (see Exhibit 4).Boats NMS offered six brands of boats that incorporated both quality- and price-conscious options. Initially Wiechert focused on selling inflatable boats which suited consumers who were searching for either a small dinghy for their much larger vessel or an inexpensive family boat to use on nearby lakes. The sizes offered were between 9 and 12 feet (2.7 and 3.7 metres). The most common size sold was a 9-foot (2.7-metre) tender. An inflatable boat was known for its stability and portability which were huge selling features for the recreational fishing market where consumers tended to use only aluminum boats. Typically boats were purchased during the spring or winter in preparation for the summer. After multiple requests NMS began offering aluminum boats and rigid-bottom inflatable boats. These additions offered consumers more durable and higher-end options. These boats were larger and considered more popular in the fishing industry. The aluminum boats typically ranged from 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 metres) and the rigid-bottom inflatable boats ranged from 10 to 14 feet (3 to 4.3 metres). As the business began to grow Wiechert found there was a demand for designer boats that included a steering console or motor package deal. Although these items had better margins the company was known for only its small marine products. Recently Wiechert had partnered with MirroCraft and Grand/Gala to offer these bigger options. These brands were advertised in leading magazines which drove consumer demand. Wiechert also considered selling 14-foot (4.3-metre) pontoon boats in 2017; he would be the only dealer to carry such boats in Atlantic Canada. Motors From the beginning Wiechert had wanted to sell a reliable no-frills motor for cottage boating. Over time he had discovered the difficult supplier-to-dealer communication with these unknown brands. Fishers and yacht owners desired smaller motors between 2.6 and 10 horsepower (HP; 1912 and 7355 watts) whereas more upscale families tended to be interested in the larger boat packages. The larger the products the better the margins. Even though Wiechert had the lowest prices consumers wanted the security and reliability of well-known brands. In 2015 and 2016 NMS partnered with Tohatsu and Suzuki which boosted the credibility of Wiechert’s business. NMS was almost rid of the leftover APS no-frills motors and sales trends showed that branded motors were driving significant growth. The small motors however did not have healthy margins. NMS mainly focused on motors ranging from 2.6 to 20 HP (1912 to 14710 watts) which weighed approximately 30 to 100 pounds (13.6 to 45.4 kilograms). With the increased interest in designer boat packages Wiechert hoped to start selling 60- to 140-HP  (44130- to 103000-watt) motors. These motors took more space in storage and the showroom and could weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). This market had less competition but the demand was unknown. Also NMS was not recognized as representing large and expensive products. Scooters NMS was the exclusive Daymak and Emmo dealer in Atlantic Canada for light electric vehicles. These quiet vehicles required no gas licence or registration and were legal on bike paths. The speed of the vehicles was regulated to a maximum of 32 kilometres per hour. Depending on hills and weight one $0.25 charge could last nearly 40 kilometres. The scooter market also offered more-attractive margins. Unfortunately the manufacturers offered little or no marketing support to drive consumer demand and significant sales growth. In Nova Scotia the electric scooter market was underdeveloped. There was no branding no branded advertising no quality control and the products were inconsistent. Anyone could purchase a trailer load of scooters put a brand name on the side of the scooters and sell them. Such a strategy tended to be followed by Costco Walmart and Canadian Tire.Customers typically bought scooters in the summer. This product category included electric bikes scooters and mobility scooters. Electric bikes were luxury bicycles that were outfitted with power-assisted lithium batteries. These light vehicles fit the lifestyles of aging active consumers and urban commuters as the power-assist option helped on longer distances and steep hills. Scooters on the other hand were substantially heavier and were not made to pedal. Many models were originally designed as gas scooters but were stripped of their gas-powered system and installed with electric components. These quiet two-wheel scooters were perfect for mature customers looking for an inexpensive way to travel short distances. Interestingly Wiechert had discovered a large demand from people who had lost their licence to driving-under-the-influence charges. Mobility scooters were primarily targeted at elderly consumers. After facing many difficulties with the quality of Daymak mobility scooters Wiechert partnered with other brands to become more competitive in that market. With an aging population and many retirement homes close by mobility scooters could be a profitable market. In 2016 Wiechert sold 68 scooters at an average price of $2332 per unit. An Emmo dealership in Toronto Ontario (15 times the market size of Halifax Nova Scotia) sold between 600 and 700 scooters per year while a Daymak dealership in Hamilton Ontario (similar market size to Halifax) sold an average of 200 scooters each year.Trailers Galvanized trailers were typically sold with the larger boat packages. Fortunately this type of product could be stored outside which usually took up roughly 16 feet (4.9 metres). One of Wiechert’s most popular trailers was the Salter trailer kit. It came in three boxes and was sold unassembled. The versatility of this type of trailer was a huge selling feature. It could be used for construction equipment outdoor sports equipment quads (i.e. four-wheeler all-terrain vehicles) boats or motorbikes and could be stored in an upright position. The trailer was also affordable. Unfortunately there was a limitation due to Nova Scotia laws. Only fully assembled trailers could be registered upon purchase which made it a hassle for consumers to get the product onto the street legally. However this was not the situation if the dealer sold outside of the province where the product could be registered when sold.COMPETITION Wiechert was consistently one of the first small-dealers in Halifax/Atlantic Canada to represent each product category. Years ago Zodiac was the only well-known inflatable boat in Nova Scotia. Now the market had over 50 different brands sold by both national chains such as Costco and Walmart and other smaller dealers such as Freedom SeaBright Marine and Highfield. With little marketing effort a rural location and no skilled staff NMS had still tripled in size. In 2016 a Bass Pro megastore outlet opened in Moncton New Brunswick which was roughly 2.5 hours from NMS. This opening greatly affected boat and motor sales in the Maritime provinces. Furthermore Cabela’s a fishing and hunting outlet store planned to open nearby (in Dartmouth Nova Scotia) in 2018. In general the Halifax area had few marine or scooter stores; the main list included White Water Marine Ltd. Seamasters Services Limited New Wave Power Products C Robertson Business Equipment Halifax and PMV Mobility House. Wiechert believed these shops were relatively small operations and offered poor customer service.As it was with inflatables NMS was first into the electric scooter market. Although it was still an underdeveloped market Wiechert competed with various bike stores such as Canadian Tire Costco Walmart and Lawtons Drugs. Many Halifax stores started to offer electric bikes because NMS did not appear in online searches for “e-bike Halifax.” Wiechert was sure that his poor online presence was having a negative impact on scooter sales growth. Wiechert’s aluminum boats competed with brands that delivered quality or affordable prices which was also the situation for boat motors. NMS was up against large chain stores and online prices with Canadian Tire and Costco selling such quality brands as Mercury Yamaha Honda Evinrude and Shakespeare. Wiechert was a Halifax/Atlantic Canada dealer for all of his branded products except for Highfield Daymak and mobility scooters; thus NMS had a competitive advantage over big-box stores because it offered higher-end brands. A dealer of a specific brand was typically given exclusivity to a specific territory but Wiechert continued to compete with other smaller dealerships or manufacturers in every brand category. All brands that offered NMS a dealership had the ability to open more dealerships in the area which resulted in less exclusivity for Wiechert. Trailers offered by Wiechert had no exclusivity except for the trailer kits in Atlantic Canada.The busiest months for NMS were in the summer; however Wiechert found business remained relativity slow on Thursday afternoons. About 5 per cent of sales were from repeat customers who appreciated the passionate customer service at NMS. Many consumers had trouble learning how to use certain marine and scooter products for the first time. Customers buying online or through the shopping network faced the challenge of “unboxing” their products; this challenge made NMS more consumer-oriented since Wiechert was always on-site to provide expert advice and hands-on product tutorials. Pricing was always a concern for Wiechert. European trade tariffs were said to be decreasing later in 2017 but the U.S. dollar continued to increase which decreased margins on many NMS products. Newstar marine & Scooter IN 2016StaffingWiechert and Mallion needed to make many intuitive decisions regarding the operations at NMS because they had no training in retail store management or human resources. NMS was open Monday to Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and anytime by appointment. Wiechert had no full-time staff members and two part-time staff members. As the owner Wiechert was responsible for everything: sales quotes and invoices phone calls graphic design reorders inventory counts and servicing. He extended himself greatly working most days until 7:00 p.m. Wiechert hired two part-time staff members near the end of 2016—one to assist with phone calls and the other to help with servicing. These staff members had limited skills lacked experience and did not have well-defined jobs. Wiechert also found his staff members were unpredictable in terms of their absences. Wiechert relied on Mallion heavily for organizing paperwork and counting cash every few days when she visited the shop. Usually Wiechert would rely on family members for help in the boat show. Hiring staff was a difficult task for him. With little margin on products NMS could not offer high wages and benefits. Thus Wiechert was paying staff a rate just above minimum wage. FacilitiesEastern Passage Nova Scotia was approximately a 30-minute commute to downtown Halifax. The NMS property included one acre (0.4 hectares) of land two residential units and a commercial store. It had a beautiful view of the harbour and a popular boardwalk. Since the store was in a residential/tourist area there was a pleasant atmosphere for window-shopping (see Exhibit 5). However Wiechert struggled to use the space effectively. The 1000 square feet (93 square metres) of display space was inadequate for displaying different styles of boats to attract buyers. The 720 square feet (67 square metres) of storage space in a 24-by-30-foot (7.3-by-9.1-metre) tent was not ideal dry storage since condensation leaked down and could damage cardboard boxes. The 500 square feet (46.5 square metres) of garage space split into storage and service had no room to efficiently service both scooters and motors; nor was it large enough to inspect trailers. The 160 square feet (14.9 square metres) of container space for motors was a good dry storage but was not easy to access with a forklift. The one-half acre (0.2 hectares) of outside storage space was excellent but not fenced in for security. Limited showroom space had created a challenge for selling a variety of products. Customers could not touch and feel products and thus had to make purchase decisions based on pictures. A forklift was recently leased at the end of 2016 to assist in storing larger products but it did not solve the space issue. Marketing Industry standards recommended that small businesses with sales revenue of less than $5 million allocate 7 to 8 per cent of sales for a marketing budget. In 2016 NMS contributed only 2.1 per cent to marketing. Wiechert promoted his products through Kijiji annual appearances at trade shows and a few small advertisements on a local radio station. Products were mainly advertised by their features. During his free time Wiechert had managed to create a functional website but it was not professionally maintained and needed to be upgraded. It also did not offer the ability to purchase products online. Furthermore Wiechert had created all the brand media; although they were functional they lacked a professional and consistent theme. In 2015 and 2016 one of Wiechert’s former staff members operated a Facebook company page but it was not being consistently updated. NMS had a YouTube channel which presented a collection of national advertisements for some products and some clips of Wiechert using the products. NMS had below-average scooter sales which suggested that the brand association with “marine” might be ineffective. However companies that historically focused only on scooters went bankrupt such as Super Scooter in Quebec. Other successful businesses such as Gary Chartrand Inc. had diversified into fireplaces and heat pumps in addition to scooters. Earlier in 2016 NMS increased its participation and booth size at local boat shows and began selling larger aluminum boats on consignment. Later that year Wiechert decided not to participate in the last two shows (see Exhibit 6). In 2017 Wiechert debated whether to continue such a large investment in boat shows because he could not identify the immediate return. Mallion gathered a list of quotes for other potential marketing investments (see Exhibit 7).Finances With a poor point-of-sale (POS) system and inconsistent bookkeeping procedures it was difficult to accurately depict NMS’s current financial situation. The business had been growing very well but it was still small. NMS was currently evaluated at only $240000 excluding assets. The low business value of the company had Wiechert worried about his future retirement. Being an entrepreneur most of his life Wiechert did not have a pension. He and his wife estimated they would need to sell the business for at least $1000000. Would this selling price ever be possible? The family had borrowed $155000 from a personal line of credit and had an additional $160000 loan from NewStar Properties accruing interest rates of 4.2 per cent and 0 per cent respectively. Mallion estimated that if necessary they could take out an additional $105000 from their line of credit and a $400000 loan from NewStar Properties with the same interest rates.Wiechert tried to keep roughly $50000 in the business bank account partly due to the high monthly operation costs and inventory purchases (see Exhibit 3). Wiechert had a flooring plan with GE Capital which financed product with no interest for six months and 7 per cent thereafter. GE Capital provided NMS with a $170000 line of credit which gave Wiechert more confidence that the business could remain operational during an expansion.GROWTH OPTIONS In 2017 as NMS’s sales continued to grow sharply Wiechert believed it was time to start thinking about opportunities for growth. The family agreed that there was no clear option. They could move build sell or make small adjustments and there was much to consider. Wiechert believed a location closer to the city would increase foot traffic. It would make it easier for customers to reach the shop either by bus or car. He estimated that his retail business would need at least 4000 square feet (372 square metres) of indoor showroom space with high ceilings. A property fitting his requirements was being offered for $705000. This warehouse would need a lot of work before becoming showroom-ready but it had potential. Realistically Wiechert could acquire the property for $650000 and then make renovations over the next few years for an additional $200000. He estimated that his business would be operational at the new location within one to two months. In addition moving into this large commercial building would allow NMS to become a Honda dealership.An opportunity with Daymak also required extra space. Just recently Wiechert had been approached by Daymak one of NMS’s scooter suppliers who was interested in expanding dealerships across Canada with the name “E-Bike Universe.” The Nova Scotia region was offered to NMS as an official dealership but it would require at least 1500 square feet (139 square metres) of display space and 400 square feet (37 square metres) of service space in a strong retail location for developing business. Daymak offered stronger margins and marketing benefits for a committed exclusive dealership for Nova Scotia. Daymak believed this national expansion would help generate awareness for its products and branded stores.Wiechert negotiated the terms so that he could offer other brands of scooters but this opportunity did raise an interesting point: Should he separate the marine and scooter businesses? Wiechert could rent a smaller location in Halifax for scooters and keep the marine business in Eastern Passage. A leasing location in downtown Halifax was offering 975 square feet (91 square metres) for $32000 per year (see Exhibit 8). Wiechert would need to commit to a five-year lease but there was an exit clause if the business did not reach its expected sales. Wiechert estimated he would need an additional $40000 per year to cover other fixed costs.Another possibility was expanding the current location but “closed for construction” was not what Wiechert visualized for the future. The idea of building a new shop may have been his dream but it was a rocky path to get there. Wiechert was quoted $100 per square foot (0.9 square metres) for a metal shell with 20-foot (6-metre) ceilings. He would need to invest a net amount of $50000 which included the cost and earnings from moving the bungalows off the property. This process would take up to six months—much of which would be during the winter. Wiechert would need to find a storage unit to keep operating throughout the construction. A 24-by-30-foot (7.3-by-9.1-metre) tent cost $6000 and a 20-by-8-foot (6-by-2.4-metre) container cost $4000. The family agreed that building new was in many ways riskier than the Dartmouth expansion. It simply could not guarantee that Wiechert would keep his customers and reputation as his competition continued to grow. NMS owned much land but it was limited due to the rental properties. Wiechert also considered selling the business and harvesting the investment. Neither he nor his wife was particularly keen to sell the business right away but they also didn’t want to be naive. The primary goal of building the business was to provide for their retirement. As the two of them moved into their sixties their energy would naturally decrease. Could a stressful expansion be healthy? What else could Wiechert do? He was not ready to retire. The land itself would be worth at least $400000 but there was no interest in the business at this time.These options were drastic but smaller adjustments could also have a large effect. Capacity had been an issue but Wiechert had been successful with the business thus far. THE DECISIONBoth Wiechert and Mallion understood the risks which made the decision even harder. Each consideration had advantages and disadvantages. Did the family have enough money to invest? Was Wiechert’s brand distinct enough to compete on a larger scale? This was the family’s last push at a healthy retirement. Could NMS achieve this push? Wiechert knew he would have to revisit his overall company strategy before he could implement any plan. What should he sell? Who were his customers? How could he reach them? And finally would NMS’s facility allow him to satisfy his customers’ demands?

Should registration fees for the annual SHAD program be raised in 2017? The SHAD program was a month-long summer program for high school students offered annually during the month of July. This program took place in-residence at universities across Canada and its content focused on STEAM (science technology engineering arts and math) innovation and entrepreneurship. Hamoodi was worried about SHAD’s cash flow for the upcoming year and raising fees would alleviate some of the program’s financial strain. She thought preparing a set of cash budgets for the 2017 fiscal year would help with her decision. Hamoodi would have to present her decision to SHAD’s board of directors and this decision would have to be in line with SHAD’s values and goals. HISTORY GOALS AND MISSIONSHAD a registered charitable organization was founded in 1980. The first SHAD program was held at St. Andrew’s College in Aurora Ontario and from there it expanded across Canada with the mission “to empower exceptional youth to make the world a better place.” In 2016 SHAD’s head office was located in Waterloo Ontario and the SHAD program was held at 12 university host campuses (see Exhibit 1). Since its inception 14800 students in Grades 10 11 and 12 had participated in the SHAD program. SHAD’s fiscal year started on November 1 each year.Students who participated in the SHAD program at one of the host universities were called SHADs. Participants were defined as exceptional youth who excelled academically had demonstrated strong leadership skills and were involved in various extra-curricular activities in their communities. SHAD’s goal was to empower these youth “to recognize their own capabilities and envision their extraordinary potential as tomorrow’s leaders and change makers.” Many SHADs had gone on to become Rhodes and Loran Scholars to be named as Top 20 Under 20 to be accepted into programs such as the Next 36 to work with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and similar companies and to start companies of their own.SHAD prided itself on the strong peer network the program it had created; however despite having a strong brand SHAD was not yet widely recognized. Recently steps had been taken to promote SHAD and to make it a more recognized name.Each year approximately 700 students from across Canada and internationally were accepted into the program. The cost per student was roughly $8000 in 2016 for the one-month program but participants were charged fees of only $4500. Despite pricing the program below cost the price point was still too expensive for many parents; however Hamoodi believed that a student who had been accepted into the program should never be turned away for financial reasons. As a result students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended the program. Many students were provided with partial scholarships and bursaries from SHAD to cover their participant fees. SHAD offered an average of $50000 annually in partial scholarships and bursaries per host campus. These funds came from donations received by SHAD (discussed later in the case).THE programRecruitmentPreparation for the next year’s SHAD program started months in advance—soon after the previous year’s program ended. Timed with the new school year in September marketing efforts for the next year’s program began in August and continued through most of the first semester (September to January) of the school year.If students were interested in SHAD they applied to the program between September and the first week of December. These applications were screened by the program directors of the SHAD programs at the various campuses. Simultaneously SHAD contacted all parents to submit any requests for financial support. SHADs were notified if they were accepted into the program by March each year at which point a $500 deposit was required. In April another $2000 was paid and the remaining amount was paid by June 1.Program CostsEquipment and SuppliesEquipment and supply costs averaged $7000 for one program. Approximately 75 per cent of these expenses were paid in June and the balance was purchased and paid for in July.Recreation FeesMost of the program time spent during the month was on the university campus but SHADs often camped and participated in trips into the cities of the host universities and were also involved in activities that took place at the various sports stadiums on the university campus. These costs averaged $3500 and were paid in July.TransportationBuses were rented to take SHADs on various trips and cargo vans were rented to transport equipment at monthly charges of $2400 and $2000 per van respectively. Fuel costs fluctuated substantially across Canada and although fuel prices had been lower in 2016 Hamoodi thought it best to use 2015 fuel prices to be more conservative in her projections (see Exhibit 2). She decided to use the highest fuel costs when determining transportation costs for a single SHAD program but an average fuel cost when calculating transportation costs for the organization. A cargo van averaged eight kilometres for every litre of fuel and each van was expected to be driven 3000 kilometres during the month of July. Other miscellaneous transportation charges were projected to total $1000 for one program.All rental and fuel charges were paid in July except for the cargo vans’ rental fee. The cargo vans were used during the entire month and were returned and paid for after the staff team moved out of the campus residences in the first week of August.Accommodations and MealsRoom and board were provided for all staff members and SHADs during the program. These costs varied across campuses with the highest cost of $168000 for a single SHAD program. When projecting the costs of a SHAD program Hamoodi wanted to be conservative but when projecting the organization’s cash budget she thought the historical average of $140000 would be more suitable. Half of these costs were paid on July 1 and the other half was paid when the staff team moved out in August.OtherOther costs associated with the SHAD program including wages amounted to roughly $1200 per participant. Payment for these costs was split equally between July and August.SHAD FinancialsDonationsSHAD had received donations from various sources since its inception. The use of these funds was internally restricted and they were typically used to pay for bursaries and scholarships to SHADs. Many of the funds were donated by individuals with either a previous or current association with the program. These funds amounted to $3.4 million in 2016 and were held in secure investments such as guaranteed investment certificates and earned an annual return of 2 per cent.Administration CostsSHAD incurred expenses for its alumni outreach and communications the program’s development and evaluation administration expenses and bank and investment fees. These costs were paid as they were incurred.Alumni outreach and communication expenses varied throughout the year. They were projected to be $20000 a month in the first three months of the fiscal year (starting November 1) and $40000 for the next three months. From May to July alumni outreach activities would decline while the preparation and delivery of the SHAD program intensified; therefore these expenses would average $3000 a month during these months. In August alumni outreach would again return to February-through-April levels for the remainder of the fiscal year.Program development and evaluation were viewed as key to the success of the SHAD program. From November to April this work was usually minimal because the next program was still in the planning process. Program development and evaluation expenses were typically $1700 a month per campus during these months. For the final six months of the fiscal year these costs increased to $5000 a month for each campus.Administrative expenses were expected to total $216000 for fiscal year 2017 and would be spread evenly over the fiscal year. Bank and investment fees were $625 a month in fiscal year 2016 and were withdrawn automatically from SHAD’s bank account. These fees were expected to remain the same in fiscal year 2017.FEE INCREASE OPTION in 2017Most of the projected expenses for fiscal year 2017 were higher than those in previous years and Hamoodi was curious to see how this situation would affect SHAD’s cash flow. SHAD had never been able to break even using only participant fees since these fees were always significantly lower than the program cost per student. Although this shortfall created a challenge because deficits were usually significant SHAD had secured additional revenue in the past through donations from alumni and sponsorships from major corporations. Recently SHAD had also secured funding through grants from the Government of Ontario and was currently receiving financial support from the Governments of Manitoba New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. No provincial financial support was provided by British Columbia Alberta Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and no federal government funding had ever been secured (see Exhibit 3).Hamoodi wondered whether participant fees should be raised to $5500 for the SHAD program. SHAD had raised fees in the past and never had a problem filling the 700 participant slots each year (see Exhibit 4). In fact students were often waitlisted for the SHAD program. However Hamoodi was worried that raising fees further could be a deterrent to some students and could decrease the quality of the applicant pool. It could also make it harder for teachers to promote this program in their high schools due to the higher price point.Hamoodi planned to prepare projected cash budgets for fiscal 2017 for a single SHAD program and for the entire SHAD organization (all 12 programs and the organization’s revenues and expenses). For the single SHAD program she wanted to prepare one cash budget with no increase in registration fees and a second cash budget with fees of $5500 per participant. For the entire SHAD organization she would prepare two cash budgets one with fees at $4500 per participant and one with fees at $5500 per participant. These budgets would start fiscal 2017 with the organization’s cash balance of $600000.ConclusionHamoodi strongly believed in SHAD’s goal and mission and she knew that these targets would need to be considered when presenting her decision to SHAD’s other directors and the president. If she chose not to raise registration fees Hamoodi would need a plan to cover any projected cash shortfalls.Exhibit 1: Host Campuses in CanadaCarleton UniversityDalhousie UniversityLakehead UniversityMcMaster UniversityMemorial University of NewfoundlandQueen’s UniversityUniversity of Western OntarioUniversity of British ColumbiaUniversity of CalgaryUniversity of New BrunswickUniversity of SaskatchewanUniversity of WaterlooSource: “Host Campuses” SHAD accessed January 12 2017 http://shad.ca/campuses.htm.Exhibit 2: Fuel Costs across CanadaSource: “Gasoline and Fuel Oil Average Retail Prices by Urban Centre (Regular Unleaded Gasoline at Self Service Filling Stations)” Canada: Statistics Canada last modified January 20 2017 accessed January 12 2017 www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/econ154a-eng.htm.Exhibit 3: SHAD SupportersSource: “Supporter” SHAD accessed January 12 2017 http://shad.ca/Supporters-list.htm.Exhibit 4: Application and Registration Fee HistorySource: Company files.",1,WHITE,,WOMAN,

Ltd. (Farm Harvest) was far from sunny as he entered his office that day. Rajesh needed to hold an emergency meeting with his core team concerning distribution problems within Farm Harvest which produced and marketed fresh corn and ready-to-eat (RTE) corn products. Sathish Kalaimani head of sales for the company was the first person to walk into the boardroom. “Good morning chief” he said to Rajesh. “What happened? I thought we were meeting at 12:00 p.m.”“I wanted to meet the core team right now. Let’s wait for others to join us and then I will explain” Rajesh said. It was then that the other two members of the core team—Selva Kumar the marketing manager and Raghavendra Rao the finance manager—walked into the board room. “Gentlemen I wanted to meet all of you right now to discuss an urgent matter” Rajesh said. He went on:Yesterday I went with my family to a mall to watch a movie. During the intermission we went to the refreshment stall to get sweet corn and realized that Farm Harvest RTE packs were not available whereas the RTE packs of other competing brands were prominently displayed. The stall owner complained that there was no stock of Farm Harvest products and that the distributor had not contacted them for two weeks. On further enquiry I learned that this stock-out situation happens on a regular basis at least three to four times a month. I then checked up on the kiosk and it was the same story all over again. What is happening?Rajesh passed folders around the table to all three team members. “Look at our sales figures. I compiled the sales category-wise for the last six years.” He pointed out the three tables in the report marked Fresh Corn Sales Ready-to-Eat Sales and Kiosk Sales (see Exhibit 1-3). “The tables tell us in black and white the truth—that our sales are falling.” Rajesh continued “Going by my experience yesterday a large part of our sales dip seems to be coming from non-availability of our product in the market. I want to get to the bottom of this” he said. “I want you all to find out where the gap is in our distribution model and what the alternatives available to us are. Let’s meet again in the evening.”SWEET CORN PRODUCTION IN INDIASweet corn a variation of the maize crop was a specialty crop in which the sweetness of the corn was enhanced due to a particular gene. Maize was an important cereal of India and was grown on over 4 per cent of the country’s total cultivable area. The country produced 1.7 million tons in 1950–51 rising to 19.6 million tons in 2014–15. There had been large variations in the production of maize in India since the country’s independence in 1947. Over the last 10 years sweet corn had been the fastest-growing maize crop in India showing an output growth of 56 per cent in that period. BEGINNING OF FARM HARVESTRajesh had recognized the potential in cultivating and marketing fresh corn in India while talking to the farmers in his town. Those conversations had prompted Rajesh to consider getting into the corn business. He was from a strong farming background had earned a degree in management and had big entrepreneurial dreams.Rajesh decided to find the best places in the world for growing sweet corn. He focused on Iowa in the United States because it had been designated as the king of corn for the last two decades. In an average year the state of Iowa produced more corn than most countries did. Rajesh set out for Iowa to find the best sweet corn farmers in the world and learn their trade. As soon as he returned from Iowa he bought five acres of land and embarked on his new venture setting up a sweet corn cultivation and distribution business.Farm Harvest was established in 2010. It started producing and processing top-quality sweet corn through a close-knit community of farmers. The company tapped the existing distribution network for fast moving consumer goods and in a phased manner launched the product in 10 cities in South India over a period of five years.Over the years the company had been selling fresh sweet corn to consumers across the southern part of India. By 2016 the company was cultivating sweet corn on over 120 acres through co-operative farming. It had also forayed into export markets after 2014.The company’s cutting-edge manufacturing facility ensured fresh produce was processed in a clean and hygienic environment. By using the latest Japanese retort technology with temperature control the packaged sweet corn stayed fresh for a period of six months without any added preservatives.FARM HARVEST DISTRIBUTION STRATEGYRight from the beginning Rajesh had realized that in order to be successful Farm Harvest had to cater to various kinds of customers. There were customers who liked to purchase from a retail outlet and would take the sweet corn home for further processing. Some customers liked to eat at the place of purchase. Apart from these many small retailers from neighbouring areas liked to buy multiple packs and resell the packs in their local neighbourhood. Farm Harvest classified this line of business as RTE sales. The other line of business was supplying sweet corn at shopping malls and movie halls through staffed kiosks. Farm Harvest had a clearly defined table that showed the breakdown of the price and commission at various points in the distribution channel (see Exhibit 4).The biggest challenge faced by the company in its initial years was establishing a distribution network for its products. The company categorized trade sales under three different heads: fresh corn sales RTE packaged products and vending kiosk supplies. It grouped the distribution of bulk sales to small vendors RTE packaged stock keeping units and vending kiosks requirements into trade and appointed distributors who would cater to these.The company operated with two to three distributors in each of the cities where it had a presence. The distributors were responsible for supplying the requirements of the small vendors (fresh corn) to the neighbouring traders and the network of retailers in the city of operation. The dilemmaLater the same day at 4:00 p.m. Rajesh and his core team assembled again in the boardroom. Rajesh started the meeting:Gentlemen I hope you all have come up with some answers. Total sales have dipped again this year. This is on top of a drop of 12 per cent from the previous year. We seem to have dropped across all the categories in all cities for the second year in a row. So last year was not an aberration as some of you have mentioned. There seems to be a problem here.“We had stressed the importance of RTE products with the distributors which is why that segment has a drop of just 4 per cent compared to 13 per cent the previous period” Selva responded.“But consider the drop of 9 per cent in the fresh corn category and the whopping 13 per cent drop in the vending kiosk category” retorted Rajesh.“I think the distributor is trading off the effort on one category against the other. If we stress one category the distributor focuses on that since there are incentives and ignores the others” Raghavendra remarked.“Have you looked into the retail distribution figures for 2016?” Rajesh asked the sales manager Sathish. “There seems to be a huge skew toward the large retailers and that could be a cause for concern. We did realize in the beginning that RTE sales had to follow extensive distribution while vending machines would be selective in nature. However looking at the sales in various outlet types this is not borne out!”“The distributors are not keen on visiting smaller outlets because the returns from RTE sales do not work out for them in terms of costs. They are very reluctant to deploy additional personnel. Consequently several outlets face a stock-out situation at times” replied Sathish [see Exhibits 5-8].“In fact” Sathish added “most distributors say that the markup of 9 per cent is inadequate to cover the costs of the distribution of RTE products. Instead they are quite happy with the bulk sales of the fresh corn even though the margins are at 5 per cent. The customers in the fresh corn category actually come to the distributors’ premises to pick up stock and thus the distributor incurs no costs whatsoever.”“Looking back the primary reason we gave RTE and kiosk business [see Exhibit 9] to the fresh corn wholesalers was because of the low expected sales in RTE and kiosks. This was mainly to give us a foothold in the retail market” Rajesh pointed out.“Agreed” chorused Selva and Raghavendra.“Some of the distributors have reduced the number of sales representatives for our products in order to cut costs and that has led to a drop in our kiosk sales which now don’t get replenished on time—this despite the fact that kiosk sales give a markup of almost 35 per cent on the distributor landed price” said Selva. To emphasize his point he distributed to everyone copies of monthly outstanding monthly stock and monthly credit reports (see Exhibits 10 11 and 12).“Have you considered other alternatives for distribution?” asked Rajesh.Raghavendra replied “We did work on several combinations and there seems to be another alternative. One such alternative is to consider separating the RTE and vending business from the distributors and leaving the distributors to only focus on the fresh corn business.”“Are you saying that we should appoint a new set of distributors for the RTE and vending business? Is that viable?” enquired Rajesh.“Actually we were looking at whether we should manage this new channel directly at least in some of the key towns” said Selva.“What do you think will be the reaction of the current set of distributors if we do that?” asked Rajesh.“I have a feeling that they will not have a major problem—not in the major cities. They have been complaining about low margins on the RTE line for quite some time now. After all they were originally wholesalers of commodities and we were the ones who asked them to take up the distribution of the RTE line of products” replied Sathish.Rajesh asked “Have you looked at all the logistics issues?” Raghavendra replied “Yes we have prepared a list of the costs that we will incur once we make this change for the three major cities—Chennai Coimbatore and Salem. After all in the other cities we haven’t established ourselves.”Sathish interjected:Today we offer a credit period of 15 days to the distributors and insist that they carry a month’s stock at all times. We also expect them to extend a 30-day credit period to the retailers. The distributors claim that they are using their overdraft option with the bank which then charges them an interest of 12 per cent per year. If we were to manage the channel ourselves we save on the distributor-related costs which would offset some of the additional costs. Also we should expect an increase in sales by at least 35 per cent in each of these cities with proper coverage and no stock-outs.Raghavendra added: We will have to employ our own sales representatives in these cities. Today we are subsidizing 50 per cent of two sales representatives’ salaries. This would mean additional expenses at each of the cities. The salary would be roughly ₹14000 per person per month including local travel. The fuel costs incurred would be ₹9000 per month the rent around ₹3000 per month and miscellaneous expenses would be ₹2000 per month. Apart from all these there will be the kiosk costs. I have taken these cost estimates from the average costs incurred by our distributors.“This sounds like a good plan. For now let us go ahead with this line of thinking. Instead of renting warehouse space in the city we will continue with carrying and forwarding agents and have a contract with a transporter for delivery” posed Rajesh. He continued “Gentlemen I want you all to look at the feasibility of this alternative. Let us meet at the end of the week to discuss the viability of this option.”Exhibit 1: farm harvest Annual Sales Fresh corn (in ₹ Thousands)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 2: farm harvest Annual Sales Ready-To-Eat (in ₹ Thousands)Source: Company documentsExhibit 3: farm harvest Annual Sales KioskS (in ₹ Thousands)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 4: farm harvest Stock keeping units and Price List						Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Single Cob				RTE Sweet Corn Kernel 125 g			RTE Sweet Corn Kernel 325 g				RTE Bulk-Pack Cobs (5 per pack)					RTE Bulk-Pack Kernels (3 per pack)EXHIBIT 4 (CONTINUED)				Kiosk Pack							Fresh CornNote: g = grams; CFA = carrying and forwarding agent.Source: Company documents.Exhibit 5: farm harvest Distributors (number)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 6: Throughput per DIstributor (in ₹ Thousands per month)Source: Company documents.Exhibit 7: Coverage of outlets in 2016 (Number)Note: Retail outlets defined by the company as Super A (chain department stores that have centralized purchases) A (large department stores with individual purchases) B (grocery outlets with a sales turnover between ₹150000 and ₹300000) and C (small grocery outlets with a sales turnover less than ₹150000).Source: Company documents.

Of the 1000 new hires each year APL had reported 545 resignations in fiscal year (FY) 2019 as compared with 455 in FY 2018. Chaubey explained to Kaushik that hiring suitable candidates and acquainting them with the organization required enormous effort and capital especially in the regulated power sector. Both senior officials at APL realized that it was high time they prevented these rising first-year attrition levels.Chaubey believed that candidates hired for a particular function were expected to stay in that role for a minimum of two to three years. He was of the view that students from elite engineering and management institutions often had unrealistic expectations since most of them had no prior work experience. Chaubey had been with APL for nearly 21 years and had witnessed the shifting demands of new recruits who appeared to increasingly prioritize work–life balance and reduced monotony over earning a stable income which contrasted with the priorities of employees from the earlier generation. However Chaubey had never before observed such high rates of attrition among new hires at APL.Chaubey recalled what an employee in the Production Department had said about his decision to resign: “Sir I really liked what was offered to me but I wanted to define my career my way. I had my own ideas but I have been put under burdensome targets here. I can’t just do the mundane work of managing labour and operating machines.” However the employee’s ambivalent statement did not reflect his performance at APL over the last 12 months. His direct manager had rated him as an extraordinary performer who connected well with technicians and labourers handled shifts independently and achieved all production targets. Chaubey contemplated whether the employee’s statement was an anomalous opinion or whether it was representative of the developing expectations of new employees.Did this employee’s statement indicate a potential problem in the human resources (HR) practices that APL maintained? Chaubey wanted to identify reliable indicators so that he could tackle the situation and prescribe an appropriate action plan to reduce new-hire turnover and thereby strengthen APL’s human capital. He wanted to justify his experience and presence at APL by delivering a suitable HR strategy. At this moment Chaubey recollected his rendezvous with Rishabh Sharma a recent master of business administration graduate who had been with the plant for about a year. Since Sharma brought a fresh perspective and related well with his contemporary new employees. Chaubey invited him to analyse reliable indicators so that he could tackle the situation and prescribe an appropriate action plan to reduce new-hire turnover and thereby strengthen APL’s human capital.   Company Description: APLAPL was the power distribution business subsidiary of the Indian conglomerate Apturja Group. It operated under a unified board and management with its head office in New Delhi. With an aggregate capacity of 8880 megawatts (MW) the company had a turnover of US$2.27 billion in FY 2019 (see Exhibit 2).As of 2020 APL had five functional power plants. Although these were distributed across the country they followed standard operating procedures. The company operated six 250 MW supercritical boilers and five 330 MW subcritical boilers at Korba Chhattisgarh; six 330 MW units at Mundra Gujarat; six 250 MW units at Raigarh Chhattisgarh; five 250 MW units at Singrauli Madhya Pradesh; and five 200 MW units at Kawai Rajasthan (see Exhibit 2).India’s electricity sector was highly regulated; it was monitored by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to ensure that no profiteering occurred. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) made up the majority of electricity sales in the market. India had a single national grid by which power could be transferred from one region to another according to demand and generation. APL had long-term PPAs with the state governments of Gujarat Chhattisgarh Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Odisha covering about 8500 MW.Generation tariffs played a pivotal role in scouting for potential buyers to sign PPAs. The various costs to be recovered through tariffs included capacity costs (and related capital costs); interest on equity debt and working capital; depreciation; operational and maintenance expenses; and energy charges consisting of fuel charges. Return on equity was fixed at 15.5 per cent by CERC regulations creating competition among generators to cut their respective generation costs and hence reduce their tariffs.Organizational ValuesAPL’s corporate goal was to create lasting value for its stakeholders—including its power consumers employees and shareholders through processes that focused on consistent generation and delivery of regular power to national customers including power distribution companies and open access consumers. APL’s strength rested in its unwavering focus on optimal production its seamless training resources and the continuous support that employees received from senior management. APL had maintained an integrated approach since its inception. The organization focused on optimizing operations with reliable power generation at the core of APL’s performance. Its Production Department attracted the maximum number of bonuses and recognition across all the departments further incentivizing employees to achieve production targets.The organization had evolved rapidly since its inception in 1968. As per CERC regulations power dispatch in the transmission grid was scheduled according to the energy charges quoted by the generator creating cost competitiveness among the power producers. APL developed an agile culture to address this competitiveness in the power sector. In order for APL to compete management strove to keep the organization increasingly cost-effective agile and efficient. With rising agility APL provided a competitive milieu for professionals to hone their skills in power engineering operations and project management. This setting was particularly suited to professionals who found this target-driven culture competitiveness and team performance encouraging.HR StrategyStaffingEvery year APL hired new graduates through several channels. Over the past few years 1000 new employees had been recruited annually which aligned with the company’s strategic aim of expanding operations and capacity. The recruits were distributed equally across APL’s five units. The HR head believed that although campus recruitments yielded high-quality hires four additional specialized hiring methods were also required: (1) remote recruitment from campuses that APL did not visit; (2) recruitment from employee and union wards; (3) internal promotions from non-executive grades; and (4) recruitment through LinkedIn. As such APL had five channels for recruitment with each channel accounting for 20 per cent of employee recruitments.APL defined a list of strategically important campuses around the nation. These campuses were identified on the basis of reputation and level of engagement with the organization. Campuses maintained engagement by framing research on practical problems in APL’s power plants sending students for technical excursions and inviting APL’s presence in their conferences and guest lectures. On average APL recruited at 18 campuses each year with each campus visit costing the company approximately $1000.After filling 20 per cent of available posts through campus recruitment the next 20 per cent of vacancies were filled using online job portals. In particular graduates from campuses that APL did not visit were targeted. This mode of recruitment was cheaper for APL costing roughly $100 for each recruitment year and $20 per candidate in administrative costs.The next 20 per cent of posts were filled by candidates who had been referred by existing employees based on some proof of merit or blood relation. This mode known as the APL Ward Program which was offered to employees who had completed at least 10 years of employment with APL cost APL $20 per hire.Agency hiring took care of candidates with referrals from labour unions. APL had committed to recruit 20 per cent of postings from labour wards to non-executive roles. This mode cost APL less than $150 per year.The remaining 20 per cent of candidates were hired through LinkedIn based on their profiles and their interest in the organization. These were highly selective roles mapping key skills to relevant positions. This mode carried scouting costs of about $200 over each recruitment cycle as well as $20 per candidate in administrative costs.CompensationAPL maintained a rate of compensation significantly higher than that of its major competitors in the power sector. As such it was one of the most sought-after employers on the campuses from which it recruited. Compensation rates were predefined according to the positions offered. For example assistant managers at the lowest executive level (a role offered to engineering graduates) were offered an annual package of $10500.Such compensation attracted the best talent to compete for jobs at APL. In turn APL enjoyed huge brand value among young people competing for employment across the full range of its hiring channels.TrainingFrom the moment new employees began the onboarding process APL heavily invested in raising the potential of the organization’s workforce. APL organized a unique orientation program that provided the new employee with a signing bonus accommodation for a week at a five-star hotel personalized onboarding travel reimbursement custom trips to nearby tourist destinations and engagement sessions with key personnel. APL spent about $1400 in associated costs on each new employee. The company provided each new employee with training relevant to the department that the employee had joined and to the employee’s responsibility and performance.Apart from an initial six months of training which involved acquainting the employee with the power production systems and orienting them to best practices followed at APL the company also offered selective role-specific training on a variety of topics which included but were not limited to management information systems modules Six Sigma quality improvement customer relationship management and lean production. Training efficiency was closely monitored based on evaluation of the employee following each training session.Work OrganizationAPL divided its workforce into 14 departments (see Exhibit 3). Each department had defined strategies and goals for each quarter. Although each department functioned independently all work functions were closely related deriving value for the organization in a coherent way.Power production lay at the heart of operations at APL. The company focused on optimizing production through cost-cutting initiatives and the adoption of lean technologies. All other departments sought to maximize their contribution toward achieving this long-term goal.APL continued to monitor staff performance throughout the duration of staff employment. Most managers found employees’ performance to be satisfactory; however in some cases managers struggled to ensure employees were sufficiently productive. To promote optimal growth among its employees APL proposed a promotion or a raise in salary or both for every individual based on the individual’s contribution to the department dedication and performance in the fiscal year under consideration.APL assigned notice periods to employees according to the role that the employee was hired for. APL highlighted its zero-day notice period for trainee management and middle management roles to emphasize its commitment to keeping employees and to ensure that those who wished to pursue other opportunities could do so at will. APL was known as an employer that valued ambitious staff who had the urge to give their best; in return APL expected the best treatment. However APL required a longer notice period for certain roles and positions including personnel in essential services such as core power generation and key positions in top management where it remained very important to maintain staffing numbers. To strengthen its human capital APL had maintained an average of 200 new hires each fiscal year across each plant location for the past few years.The organization had developed a township in the vicinity of each power plant and therein offered a broad range of amenities such as residential quarters supermarkets and recreation centres which in turn employed and were inhabited by the local community. APL was accustomed to organizing engaging extramural activities among its employees labour unions skilled technicians and township dwellers. These activities included occasional cricket matches safety drills departmental trips the celebration of all national festivals and the organization of skits and role-plays throughout the year.The ProblemChaubey had no clue as to what was going wrong with the new hires. There had been no significant change to hiring practices over the past decades especially with regard to recent graduates. In the past five years Chaubey had checked with staff multiple times about their accommodations and food provisions and these were reported as being optimal. Chaubey was also driven to ascertain the effectiveness of his recruitment activity. Rather than rely on his own instincts Chaubey decided to take a data-driven approach to address the challenge of high levels of turnover within the first year of employment. He wanted to identify indicators that would aid in forming a strategy that could address the current crisis.Chaubey invited Sharma to identify indicators based on data (see Student Spreadsheet product no. 7B21C001) and additional information provided (see Exhibit 4) in order to prescribe a suitable strategy to address the issue. This task was the first direct assignment that Chaubey had offered Sharma since the latter had joined the company. Sharma wanted to make the most out of this opportunity to have his talent recognized. He had attended a course on HR analytics during his management studies and was excited to analyze the numbers and frame a prescriptive strategy. By doing so he would create value both for himself within the organization as well as for the organization itself.Exhibit 1: APTURJA Power Limited’s Profit and Loss accounts 2015–2019 (in US$ million)Note: FY = fiscal year: FG = finished goods WIP = work in processSource: Created by the authors.Exhibit 2: APTURJA Power Limited’s functional power plants across IndiaNote: MW = megawatts; km = kilometres.Source: Created by the authors.Exhibit 3: Departments at APTURJA Power LimitedSource: Created by the authors.Exhibit 4: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT NEW Hires in the first year of employmentPerformance rate: A performance rating was given by the immediate manager based on mapping the employee’s key result areas.

He was happy about his accomplishment and overwhelmed recalling all the challenges he had overcome thus far. At the young age of 36 Rafih had undoubtedly done exceedingly well for himself as the owner of 30 FiLLi outlets across the United Arab Emirates with a business worth AED50–60 million. Rafih had garnered much attention from being featured in news articles to being invited to deliver TED Talks. Although he was happy with the way his business had evolved Rafih was in no mood to go slow. After creating a successful business in the United Arab Emirates he aspired to take the brand global and he had developed a global expansion plan using the franchising model. However the challenge was the fast-changing market with new entrants in the marketplace. Was retaining customer loyalty in the local market and creating a new market in other geographic locations too aspirational? Was franchising the right expansion strategy? Up to that point Rafih had never invested funds in marketing and advertising; the company had depended on word-of-mouth publicity which had certainly resulted in the desired outcome. But would that strategy be adequate as the company moved forward? These questions had to be answered and the path ahead chosen carefully. the FiLLi BrandThe story of the genesis of the FiLLi brand dated back to 2004 when Rafih popularly known as FiLLi among his school friends took over his father’s cafeteria business. Abdul Hamid had set up a small cafeteria in the Mamzar area of Dubai in 1991. When Rafih came to Dubai in 2003 his father’s business was not doing well. Rafih took a job as a merchandiser with a fast-moving consumer goods company and simultaneously started working in his father’s cafeteria. Rafih’s interest in the business grew and after a few months he asked his father to allow him to manage the business. His father graciously agreed to let his ambitious son take over and as they say the rest was history.Curious and observant Rafih quickly noticed the customers’ fondness for tea—or kadak tea as the Arabs referred to it. The cafeteria had served only sandwiches and juices but Rafih started serving tea based on his customers’ demands. However he did not want to serve them regular kadak tea which was available at all food establishments and cafeterias; instead he wanted to offer his customers something special. To accomplish that goal Rafih followed a specific process while preparing tea—from choosing the ingredients to how the tea was boiled and strained. Through each step he took care to create a different taste. He successfully created a tea that was different from the tea sold at other cafeterias. He fondly named it FiLLi tea after the nickname his school friends had given him. He started offering samples of FiLLi tea to his customers and he noticed people’s acceptance of the tea when they began to bring friends and family to the cafeteria to taste it. He consciously focused on tea over other items as the tea business was high-volume. Slowly due to word-of-mouth publicity his network of customers grew.Rafih knew he was serving a different kind of tea; he therefore priced it at AED1.00 as opposed to AED0.50 which was the price for tea in the other regular food establishments. His zeal to create a specialty tea with a distinct unique taste led him to experiment by adding zafran to the tea. In doing so he created FiLLi Zafran tea. Zafran or saffron was an exquisite spice that was well known in the Middle East. Rafih was aware of the popularity of the spice which was usually added to milk sweets and other food items to give it a specific aroma and taste. Zafran also had health benefits. FiLLi Zafran which Rafih priced at AED2.00 seemed to click with the palate of tea consumers in Dubai. Rafih’s experiment created history—his customers loved FiLLi Zafran and demand for it grew. The increasing popularity of FiLLi Zafran led to a spike in the cafeteria’s sales from AED500 a day to AED10000 a day. The hardworking entrepreneur used funds he had managed to save from his service settlement after quitting his job to redesign and refurbish the cafeteria. Following that Rafih’s efforts and aspirations were reflected in the ambience of the cafeteria the product that was sold and the price at which it was sold. FiLLi Café had arrived. Four years of hard work paid off in 2008 when Rafih opened his second outlet in Mankhool an upper-class location in Dubai. This outlet was much bigger and had a more “upmarket” feel than the modest cafeteria in Mamzar. The regular FiLLi tea was now priced at AED4.00 and the FiLLi Zafran tea was priced at AED5.00. “It was not easy to gain acceptance in the minds of people who were used to the small cafeteria” Rafih reminisced. It took almost a year for business at the Mankhool outlet to start picking up. However Rafih’s belief in his product his patience and his hard work paid off when the Mankhool outlet started doing well. From that point on FiLLi began its fast-paced journey of becoming a well-known brand in Dubai. By 2018 FiLLi had 30 outlets across the United Arab Emirates in prime locations. As the company grew its employee base expanded from a few people to 450 workers in various departments (see Exhibit 1).Money Matters Rafih followed the old adage “a penny saved is a penny earned.” He proudly claimed that he had never taken out a loan to expand his business—even though it had taken him several years to grow from one to 30 outlets. First he made his company profitable and then he planned his next outlet based on the profits he had generated. And the business was profitable with a remarkable 575-per-cent growth in net revenue over the last four years (see Exhibit 2).Focusing on What Matters Most: Marketing at FiLLi Rafih had never invested any funds in marketing. He explained “If I had put money in marketing and advertising I would not have had enough funds for expansion.” He also believed that advertising may or may not have brought customers to the outlet whereas good reviews by his current customers did. Thus he focused on what he thought was most valuable: word-of-mouth publicity. He let customers sample his product so they could experience and develop a taste for FiLLi tea.Since 2012 FiLLi had been very active on all major social media platforms including LinkedIn (1559 followers) Twitter (957 followers) Instagram (8547 followers) and Facebook (120304 followers). Rafih believed that “in today’s times if you are not on social media you are as good as not being there at all.” He realized the power of social media to make or break a brand and he acknowledged that one negative comment from a user could negatively impact the brand. The company used social media platforms to share updates or announcements such as the opening of a new outlet or the feature of its products in the news; the platforms were also used to create customer engagement through contests. One of these was the “Sip a Selfie” contest called “One Nation One Taste” where customers were asked to take a selfie holding a FiLLi tea cup and upload it to Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #OneNationOneTaste. Winning entries could earn up to AED1000 worth of FiLLi vouchers. In addition to the company’s social media accounts Rafih had a good social media presence through his personal social media accounts. He was actively promoted in the media due to his entrepreneurial spirit which in turn helped the brand. FiLLi’s personal brand story appealed to customers on a human level.OperationsAs of 2018 each of the 30 FiLLi outlets across the United Arab Emirates was managed directly by Rafih. On average 40000 cups of tea were sold daily across all 30 outlets increasing to 50000 cups a day on weekends. Rafih’s ambition was to open 100 outlets by 2020. After the success in the United Arab Emirates Rafih wanted to make FiLLi a global brand. Thus he needed to develop an expansion plan. The aim was to first focus on countries that had a preference for tea (see Exhibit 3) gain a stronghold in these markets and then target expansion in coffee-consuming markets. The global expansion plan consisted of countries such as the United Kingdom the United States Canada and countries in North Africa in addition to the Gulf Cooperation Council and Asian nations including India. For outlets outside of the United Arab Emirates Rafih had chosen to use the franchising model. He worked with an American company called Francorp to help him navigate the franchising process. He noted “I chose everything with a long-term vision and therefore choosing the right partner was very important.” The company had already signed up for 100 locations in six countries with franchises in Qatar the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Bahrain and India (Mumbai).  More than Just a Cup of Tea: The Brand JourneyRafih’s passion for unique taste consistent quality and a great tea-drinking experience led FiLLi on a steep growth trajectory in a very competitive market. By 2018 FiLLi was registered as a brand in several countries (see Exhibit 4). Rafih proudly called FiLLi the “Starbucks of tea” because he was aware of the premium price he was charging his customers for the great taste and experience he was offering. In fact he had filled a gap for specialty tea in a market for tea lovers. His passion for high quality and excellent taste led him to source his tea from Assam in India and his zafran from Iran. Both of these places were well known for having the best quality products in the world. FiLLi tea cups: FiLLi’s tea cups were made of thick paper and bore the brand colours orange and mahogany. The logo was printed on the cups (see Exhibit 5).FiLLi logo: The logo was circular with a picture of Rafih in the centre and the brand name FiLLi underneath the picture. The text “Tea n’ Talk” was situated at top of the logo emphasizing the owner’s belief in enjoying great tea with a great social experience. The text “Since 1991” was featured at the bottom of the logo to indicate the company’s legacy and origin. FiLLi café outlets: Rafih focused on the design and ambience of his outlets as much as on the quality of the products and the process of creating them. He said “We don’t just serve tea we give our customers a great experience a place to socialize.” The outlets were designed to ensure that customers had a relaxing and comfortable environment in which to enjoy their tea (see Exhibit 6). The stores had warm earth tones with hues of orange brown and caramel to give them a classic tea tone. The mahogany décor complimented the calm relaxing ambience and the rich flavour of FiLLi tea. FiLLi store prototypes: FiLLi’s existing line of stores included kiosks stand-alone cafés and in-mall stores. There were three prototypes: large medium and small FiLLi outlets.Typically large FiLLi outlets were approximately 120 square metres (1200 square feet) and had a seating capacity of up to 160 people with a provision for both indoor and outdoor seating. Medium outlets had a seating capacity of up to 100 people with an indoor seating capacity of approximately 60 and an outdoor seating capacity of approximately 30. Small outlets had a seating capacity of up to 40 people and were about three square metres (30 square feet) in area. Store locations: FiLLi outlets were located at places with good accessibility visibility and convenient parking for customers. FiLLi menu: In addition to the signature FiLLi tea and FiLLi Zafran tea other beverages (hot and cold) as well as snack items were included on the menu. Snack items were prepared using ingredients discreetly chosen by chefs who worked with experts to enhance the taste. The range of food items included sandwiches burgers and wraps to cater to most people’s taste preferences. Some of these items were introduced as limited-type offers or limited-type editions and were continued later if they were found to be popular among consumers. Most of the products on the menu were served in all of the outlets unless a specific outlet was not equipped with a kitchen of the required specification. While most owners of food and beverage establishments may have found it stringent or cumbersome to comply with the municipal requirements in the United Arab Emirates Rafih said that compliance enabled him to offer products and services that met the expected standards of quality.Customer SegmentAlthough FiLLi’s products were initially more popular with Arabs and Indians its customer base had expanded to include more nationalities including South East Asians such as Filipinos. FiLLi had also sparked an interest in Europeans who relished the taste of the tea. Rafih said that his European customers referred to the FiLLi tea as chai latte. Over 200 nationalities lived in the United Arab Emirates so people were exposed to a diverse range of cuisines and beverages there. FiLLi benefited from these diverse demographics because most people had been exposed to tea consumption; those who had not were given the opportunity to experience tea drinking as something new and to develop a taste for it. FiLLi catered to all age groups—young students working professionals families older people—and all indulged in Tea n’ Talk.Tea Market versus Coffee MarketThe market for coffee and tea was growing and was expected to increase 30 per cent by 2021. According to Euromonitor the tea and coffee market was expected to reach US$242.7 million by 2019; in 2014 it was US$182.2 million.The coffee market was bigger than the tea market which was expected to grow more slowly. According to a Gulf News article “In the past five years looking at CAGR [compound annual growth rate] for coffee in terms of volume it grew by about 9 per cent mainly driven by on-trade performance. Tea on the other hand grew by about 7 per cent again driven mainly by on-trade [performance].” The rapid growth of the tourism sector in the United Arab Emirates was the main reason for this demand. According to Anselm Godinho the managing director of International Conferences & Exhibitions in Dubai “The country’s traditional coffee culture and an expanding tea market complement increasing investment in the café coffee and tea businesses estimated to be worth between [US] $350 million and [US] $400 million.” The United Arab Emirates had more than 4000 coffee and tea cafés and as had often been claimed tea was the second-most widely consumed drink after water. James George a research analyst at Euromonitor said: “The South Asian population especially Indians as well as Arabs have a culture of tea consumption in its various blends and flavours in a relaxed environment along with snacks and food.” According to the International Coffee and Tea Festival the United Arab Emirates was the largest re-exporter of tea and per-day tea consumption in the United Arab Emirates was approximately 19000 kilograms. Competition LandscapeRafih had said “No one is my competitor and in a way everyone who sells beverages is.” After FiLLi a few other companies entered the U.A.E. market with a variety of tea offerings (see Exhibit 7).The Road AheadAlthough Rafih was happy with how far FiLLi had come he was not complacent. He was on an aggressive expansion spree and aspired to make FiLLi a global brand after its success in the United Arab Emirates. However the market scenario had changed; new players had emerged and were vying for market share. Although FiLLi had undoubtedly created a niche for itself by filling the gap in the market for specialty teas for tea lovers and had gained popularity among its customers people still loved to try something new. How could FiLLi continue to retain customer loyalty while trying to expand internationally? To date Rafih had not invested any funds in marketing or advertising. In the future would it be wise to maintain that strategy? Was the franchising model the best way for the company to launch its global expansion? What could Rafih do to maintain the company’s competitive advantage while it began its global expansion journey?EXHIBIT 1: FILLI CAFÉ ORGANIZATIONAL CHART	Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 2: FINANCIALS FOR FILLI CAFÉ 2014–2018 (In AED millions)Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: TOP TEA-DRINKING COUNTRIES Source: “Ranked: Top 15 Tea-Drinking Countries” Euromonitor International December 15 2017 accessed May 15 2018 https://blog.euromonitor.com/2017/12/ranked-top-15-tea-drinking-countries.html.EXHIBIT 4: filli BRAND REGISTRATION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIESSource: Company documents.EXHIBIT 5: FILLI TEA CUPSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 6: FILLI CAFÉ interiorSource: Company files.Exhibit 7: Select Companies with Tea OfferingsNote: AED = The United Arab Emirates dirham; US$1 = AED3.6713 on June 1 2018.Source: Compiled by the authors with information from “Cha Chai” Dubai Zomato accessed May 15 2018 www.zomato.com/dubai/cha-cha- chai-dubai-silicon-oasis-dso; “Tea Junction Cafe & Lounge” Dubai Zomato accessed May 15 2018 www.zomato.com/dubai/restaurants/tea-junction-cafe-lounge; “Raju Omlet” Dubai Zomato accessed May 15 2018 www.zomato.com/dubai/raju-.omlet-al-quoz; Maryam Al Yammahi and Reza Rabaya “Project Chaiwala: A Tea Story” Dubai Post September 25 2017 accessed May 15 2018 www.dubaipost.ae/en/stories/project-chaiwala-a-tea-story-2017-09-25-1.3222.",1,BROWN,WESTERN ASIA,MAN,37

At his office in Texas City in the United States Lloyd Colegrove data services director at the Dow Chemical Company (Dow) was reviewing the results of a pilot study initiated by his team in one of the company’s U.S. manufacturing plants. The six-month study consisted of testing a data analytics module being used at the plant’s research and development (R&D) lab for its applicability to the shop floor. Attached to a laboratory information management system (LIMS) the module collected and analyzed data in real time from instruments tracking the quality parameters of finished goods at the plant and acted upon them to maintain high quality yields.The objective of the pilot study was to test whether the basic structure of the LIMS could be supplemented and extended plant-wide into a larger system known in the bourgeoning analytics industry as enterprise manufacturing intelligence (EMI). EMI was both a management practice and a software tool for manufacturing. It contained more sophisticated analytics than the LIMS and provided easier and faster aggregation of different data types. It also incorporated visualization tools to summarize key insights and post them on different dashboards for plant engineers to monitor and act upon. The possibility existed to scale up EMI company-wide in all 197 of Dow’s manufacturing plants across 36 countries. However Colegrove had several issues on his mind: The pilot [study] shows that plant engineers are working for the data; the data is not working for them. There is clearly an opportunity to reverse the trend through EMI. But the opportunity has also opened at least three dilemmas for me. How do we access data at the points of origin [in] real time? Can we gain user acceptance of the proposed EMI and if so how? What are the metrics with which we could measure the return on investment on EMI? GLOBAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRYThe chemical industry often served as a forerunner of the state of an economy since its products were consumed at early stages in the supply chains of user industries. Its business consisted of processing raw materials to produce chemicals used in turn as raw materials by other industries. The business was cyclical relying on basic commodities such as oil and gas and volatile. Of the 20 largest chemical companies operating 25 years ago for example only eight remained in operation in 2012. The rest did not survive for three reasons: they were not making incremental and necessary changes to stay competitive; they were not ensuring a regular pipeline of new products and they were not investing in the regular generation of patents covering proprietary manufacturing processes. The global chemical industry was witness to a churn in relation to business models. By 2012 three models were evident worldwide. The first was characterized by ownership of resources such as feedstock (as the raw materials serving as inputs for the chemical industry were known). The companies following this model focused on securing low-cost positions through economies of scale since they used a large asset base to process largely commodity-like chemical products such as petrochemicals. The second model was characterized by niche positioning. The companies following this model were leaders in specific technologies and sought to protect their intellectual property through quality innovation and strong relationships with customers that purchased their niche products. The companies following the third model such as Dow were characterized as solutions providers. They understood end-to-end value streams in different user industries developed strategic partnerships with customers to drive innovation and responded to market changes faster than their industry peers. This space was getting increasingly competitive as oil producers for example sought to generate new revenue streams by moving into the space that companies such as Dow traditionally held.More recently some American companies including Dow were creating new production capacities in the United States because of the availability of low-cost shale gas on which to run their plants. Together these companies committed up to US$110 billion of direct investment in advanced manufacturing factories in the United States. The North American chemical industry was also witness to the phenomenon of reshoring resulting from low energy costs in the United States. In a telling example of the cost advantage being offered in that country Methanex Corporation a Canadian company and the world’s largest producer of methanol was planning to close a plant in Chile and relocate to Louisiana in 2012.Process variations were a major characteristic of the chemical industry. The amount of output per unit of input known as yield also often varied for no immediately apparent reason. Both of these inconsistencies had effects on product profitability. To ensure both quality and yield it was common for a chemical plant to use statistical process control systems. These systems collected data from sensors on equipment and measurement instruments such as meters and gages embedded within the process to regularly monitor the statistical performance—and variations from “normal”—of equipment processes and materials. Depending on the product over 200 measures and variances were being monitored during the chemical transformation process by sensors devices and instruments on the shop floor. For example gas chromatography instruments measured the various chemical elements in a sample as it passed through a process. The chemical inputs or outputs from a process had to be within certain parts per million to conform to normal specifications. Temperature was another type of measure. To improve yields chemical companies applied management concepts such as lean manufacturing and Six Sigma. These companies were always looking for granular approaches to diagnose and correct process flaws.BIG DATA ANALYTICSThe term “big data analytics” referred to the analysis of data originating from different sources to identify patterns and trends according to which managers could make informed rather than intuitive decisions. Consulting firm McKinsey & Company defined big data as “data sets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture store manage and analyze.” Research company Gartner defined it as “high-volume high-velocity and high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making.”Big data analytics differed from conventional analytical approaches such as data warehousing and business intelligence in four ways: volume velocity variety and veracity. The volume of data processed in typical data warehousing and business intelligence installations was measured in petabytes (i.e. 1000 terabytes) whereas big data analytics processes dealt with volumes up to geobytes. By way of comparison one petabyte was the equivalent of text requiring a storage capacity of 20 million filing cabinets of the kind used in a typical office. The velocity of big data installations supported real-time actionable processes. A retailer for example could use geolocation data from mobile phones to ascertain how many customers were in the store’s parking lot on a given day making it feasible to estimate the sales for that day even before the retailer had recorded those sales. The variety of sources from which big data could be mined included both structured data such as database tables and unstructured data originating from diverse sources such as mobile phones social networks sensors video archives radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips and global positioning systems. Finally the veracity of data referred to the inherent discrepancies in the data collected bringing the reliability and trustworthiness of the data itself into question.Any data that could be captured in a digital form had the potential to be analyzed using big data tools. The key algorithm in big data was known as MapReduce. The algorithm was part of the back-end analytics platform developed by Google in 2000. Having by then indexed 20 billion web pages amounting to 400 terabytes Google faced three major challenges: the data were largely unstructured the volume of data was huge and the overall size of the digital universe was doubling every two years. Google engineers rose to the challenge by designing an analytics platform consisting of a parallel cluster of low-cost commodity servers each containing a central processing unit and a disk to hold a subset of data. In using MapReduce at Dow Colegrove notedThe MapReduce algorithm performs four types of procedures: it reads data from the disk; it maps the data by applying a variety of filters; it reduces the data by summarizing it in some specified ways; and it writes results back to the disk. By mapping and reducing the data across a parallel array of servers you can cut down its processing time dramatically from six hours to less than 30 minutes per petabyte. The Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence Challenge Chemical plants had been the pioneers of what later came to be called big data as it pertained to manufacturing. The arrival of data historians in the 1980s had enabled process engineers to collect and store data both technical and non-technical from manufacturing operations. The data historians (mostly in an R&D capacity) stored terabytes of structured data generated daily from sources such as sensors monitors and meters accompanying each piece of machinery on a shop floor. However up until recently plants including Dow’s had been generally better at collecting and storing data than using it in a holistic fashion. Most success up to 2012 with using data was derived from dealing with a variance in a process locally—at the point of the variance rather than within the context of the whole process—as in resetting temperature controls on a piece of equipment. R&D engineers worked on historical insights whereas process engineers in a plant worked on mostly local issues. Neither saw the thread that connected the data to the things going on both within and outside of an enterprise. They were busy collecting data instead of contextualizing it. For example they would troubleshoot based on a post-mortem of the data after a problem with product quality or yield had emerged but then months or years later would find themselves in the same situation and having to do the post-mortem all over again. They would continue to measure a parameter for years as a matter of habit without ascertaining whether the data was relevant or could add value to decision making.A large chemical plant would normally have between 1500 and 3000 measures ranging from for example tracking the viscosity of a liquid to monitoring the electrical impedance on a motor. Each measure was known as a tag and each tag was a source of data in an EMI system. The question was how to turn tags into valuable insights so that tags were not just a local variable in the vast chemical transformation process.The advent of supply chain connectivity in the 1990s established a loop that soon became seamless. Although engineers had access to technologies that helped them “listen” to business processes in the same way that marketers listened to customers they were struggling with incorporating those technologies into a mix that could extract actionable insights from the data. One of the reasons for their struggle was that the plant and machinery infrastructure in many manufacturing companies was old. In sum the challenge lay not in generating data since data historians statistical process control software and long-term quality management practices were already well established; rather the challenge for an EMI initiative lay in making the data actionable. Colegrove saw this as an opportunity and a means to enhance company performance in the long run.In anticipating a move from data collection and storage to an integrated EMI system Colegrove thoughtThe EMI system will have three characteristics in its final form. It will encompass in a single platform the sampling collation and analysis of both structured and unstructured data from various sources in the manufacturing value chain including the company’s vendors. It will do so in real time. It will focus on finding value in existing data rather than on adding new measures to generate more and more data. DOW CHEMICAL OVERVIEW Founded in 1943 in Midland Michigan in the United States Dow had manufacturing sites in 197 locations in 36 countries. In 2011 it was the fourth-largest chemical company in the world by revenue at $59.98 billion. The company employed about 52000 people and had five business divisions (see Exhibit 1). Dow was the world’s largest producer of ethylene which was a feedstock for many industries. Its ethylene capacity was Dow’s single largest competitive advantage and with a commitment in 2012 to a $4 billion investment in plant capacity for ethylene it provided the foundation for growth into the future. The 5000 products in Dow’s portfolio were used as raw materials by businesses involved in providing for example clean water affordable housing healthy foods and renewable energy.Originally making inorganic chemicals Dow had expanded into organic chemicals petrochemicals and then plastics. In recent years it had moved beyond those singular sectors into operating at their intersections. Dow was redefining its core capabilities from being the best in one area to working at the intersection of multiple areas for the greatest good. It had identified several areas where it could achieve world-class breakthroughs aimed at finding solutions to global challenges. Food was an example of Dow moving beyond singular sectors; the company had deployed its skills in chemistry to genetically modify canola seeds yielding a type of canola oil with maximum omega-9 fatty acids for use by fast foods companies. Thus Dow had taken 1.5 billion pounds (about 680 million kilograms) of fat out of the American diet. Another example was Dow’s BETAMATE an adhesive that eliminated the need to weld metal to metal and then metal to plastic. Its use by car manufacturers had taken 30–40 pounds (roughly 13.5 to 18 kilograms) off the weight of every car leading to a reduction in gasoline consumption in general. For many years the average age of Dow employees was 51. It had since dropped significantly to 41. The company had an average employee retention rate of 14 years. This was largely owing to the launch of a reinvention program during the early 2000s by Dow’s Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris.  Colegrove saidThere are three overarching challenges facing the global chemical industry: imminent large scale retirement of older employees; shortages of core engineering skills among the new generation of job seekers; and the general unpopularity of the chemical industry as an employer of choice. Millennials have little recognition of the relevance of the chemical industry to society drawn as they are to IT [information technology] and financial services as career options.As part of establishing a new foundation for innovation Dow had been hiring statisticians data scientists and big data experts across the organization since 2005. The average time from the discovery of a product to its launch had since decreased from seven years to 14 months and products were being customized rather than made for stock. Colegrove explainedDow has a unique engineering culture. Its engineers are known to design the solution around the process not the process around the solution. They value their professional autonomy. For example Dow’s process automation series known internally as Manufacturing Operating Discipline was designed not by process automation engineers as in many chemical companies but by chemical engineers familiar with the intricacies of the process. Extracting Value from Big Data: Developing EMI at DowDow plants had access to a lot of data; each facility had a statistical process control system as was common in the industry to collect measurements related to process instruments on the shop floor. Data was stored in any plant at four sources: instrument software; the LIMS; process historians which created local copies of data; and enterprise systems such as SAP. Extracting data from the existing systems carried a time lag. Dow engineers had to use a locally written code to extract the data transfer it to a spreadsheet (such as an Excel spreadsheet) and route it to a statistical tool (such as JMP statistical software from SAS) where a surveyor analyzed it. This practice was prone to both human and machine errors as well as significant time delays. Getting the data into the spreadsheet alone could take a week. No data would come up for analysis unless there was a compelling reason such as a problem requiring urgent resolution. Most of the analysis pertained to examining problems after they had occurred rather than troubleshooting in real time or anticipating them beforehand to prevent them from occurring. Until 2011 Dow was mostly using its R&D lab and R&D engineers to track tags and data and to collect measurements in the LIMS—mostly related to product quality.Colegrove had three decades of experience in both research and manufacturing. Holding a PhD in chemical physics from Texas A&M University he had begun his career at Dow in 1990 at its Polymers R&D and was involved in improving analytical methodology in various plant labs. He soon moved into manufacturing where he went on to set up the applied statistics group the first of its kind at Dow. In his early days in manufacturing in the 1990s Colegrove was surprised to notice that Dow deployed data analysis practices developed in the early 1970s characterized by the most basic spreadsheet tools. The situation was however typical of the chemical industry which was over a century old. He also noticed that he could extract value out of the existing data streams at Dow manufacturing by using advanced tools and more powerful computing capability which had become available by then. By 2005 Colegrove had started collaborating with external “data scientists” (the term had not yet gained currency) and inviting them to work with Dow engineers on piecemeal projects. However to his dismay he soon discovered that Dow chemical and process engineers—who were among the best and the brightest in chemical engineering and recruited from premier universities around the world—considered the computational techniques to be the purview of the “privileged few” and something that people in R&D would find more valuable. This was mainly because process engineers had neither an educational background nor on-the-job experience in data analysis which for them had a certain mystique around it. This continued to be an issue and Colegrove wanted to bridge the prevailing gap between core engineering skills on the shop floor and data management capabilities which were quickly becoming a necessary skill set on the shop floor. The launch of an EMI pilot project in early 2012 in the polymer division of the Midland plant was a step toward bridging that gap. At that time Dow was moving progressively into the manufacturing of customized products. Increasing levels of customization had resulted in a multi-product environment requiring complex changeovers of both equipment and processes. Monitoring these changeovers and producing data on product quality and utilization of inputs had become critical in the polymer division.  Dow had an R&D lab in each individual division of its manufacturing locations which in addition to allowing for research into new products and processes of the division provided production support to the division. At its core each lab was in the information business—storing managing and processing both current and historical information on a variety of process parameters—in which the LIMS was a key component. At the Midland plant pilot site the EMI software that Colegrove was testing was integrated with the LIMS to allow engineers in the R&D lab to respond to the needs of customization in the polymer division; it delivered test results in real time to production engineers. Thus the R&D lab had become the site of all innovation and exploration; however the downside was that these individuals had no control over the real-time processes in the plant. Colegrove felt it would be better if the production engineers were engaged directly in EMI activities.  The pilot test provided other insights. First the pilot test team observed that production engineers were better at collecting and storing data than interpreting it. The engineers were not familiar with contextualizing the data nor with recognizing the difference between valuable data and not-so-valuable data. Second some process metrics had been in place at the plant for 30–40 years. Plant engineers had become so accustomed to the existing process metrics that even when Colegrove’s team demonstrated that the metrics had nothing to do with efficiency the engineers had a hard time letting go. Since the best value would be created by these plant engineers and not just by R&D staff sitting in the lab Colegrove wondered how he would get their buy-in for EMI.Several possibilities existed for the application of EMI. For example EMI would enable Dow engineers to ascertain which of the multiple build-to-order configurations for a new chemical compound would have the least impact on manufacturing costs. Fine-grained data from EMI could also provide insights on developing substitutes for and variants of existing products. Real-time data could enable plant operators to be proactive rather than reactive potentially eliminating their use of non-valuable data in situations where data collection had become a habit.Another potential benefit of EMI was maintaining consistency in practices when dealing with issues. Plant supervisors at Dow factories around the world often interpreted similar data differently owing to different experiences educational backgrounds and even personal beliefs which often bordered on biases. With the adoption of well-developed algorithms to process data and a common dashboard to display the results EMI could ensure that plant supervisors would reach identical conclusions on witnessing identical process behaviours. EMI was also necessary from the point of view of Dow’s customers who were large and small businesses in a variety of industries. For example a customer making personal care products expected its raw material vendors to provide historical evidence about the sources of its chemical ingredients and EMI facilitated compliance with regulations around product safety which was crucial in the personal care products industry. It also enabled its customers in the pharmaceuticals industry to comply with pharmacopeia rules on plant monitoring as part of drug regulatory requirements.THE CHALLENGE AHEADAs part of planning for the Midland plant EMI pilot project Colegrove had put together a three-member team to examine the possibility of launching a full-fledged analytics system at a plant. Over a luncheon meeting they drew out the possibilities for EMI beyond the pilot site (see Exhibit 2). They envisioned an opportunity to track the tags across the entire operation of a plant and then across the organization. Colegrove wanted his team to play the role of enabler. He was keen that plant engineers should do the analysis themselves rather than seek the help of organizational resources such as the information technology department or have the R&D engineers at each plant do the analysis for them. Being on the shop floor they were better equipped in his view to listen and respond to the signals that the machines were sending out.Colegrove identified several challenges of scaling the EMI pilot project:We collect a lot of data at a Dow plant. But as it happens in a large organization much of that data does not get looked at. Data does not become information until it is analyzed. Without analysis the data will not have value. That is why I am keen that data should not only be accessed at the point of origin but also be analyzed at the point of origin. Data silos add to the complexity of production lines. I want to keep it simple. We also do not want to make investments in replacing current databases and building new ones. EMI should not add substantially to our costs.The first challenge was around the data—accessing it at the source equipment/process and accessing it in real time. Accessing data at the point of origin meant eliminating the need to move it to a parallel data space which would mean a time lag in downloading data from multiple sources in the plant and getting it into spreadsheets for analysis. The parallel space detracted from direct interactions on the go among plant engineers which were integral to sharing best practices. The redundancy inherent in parallel space would also contribute to data islands (data stores with non-existent or limited external connectivity) which would in turn forestall operational efficiency. However the concept of real time was not the same across Dow plants. It varied with whether it pertained to batch processing or continuous processing in the production line. In batch processing the machine run often took a break depending on internal issues such as the need for remedial intervention or on external issues such as a shortfall in sales orders. In continuous processing there was no provision for a break. If the machine parameters were not on par they would drain resources without a break without the knowledge of plant engineers. Real-time tracking of data was thus more important in continuous processing. Colegrove saidBoth collection and analysis of data need to be real time. The analytics platform should incorporate metrics which are mission-critical to enable continuous monitoring of process health. The metrics should be relevant to different levels of shop floor management. The platform should have graphical dashboards so that users see only those charts and graphs that are relevant to their specific areas and take remedial action on events as they happen. For instance operations staff would use a visual dashboard for inventory accuracy reports quality achievement metrics and equipment downtime graphs. The dispatch staff might use a dashboard to track on-time shipping completion percentages and premium freight costs reports.A second major challenge was adopting big data innovation at Dow. EMI practices and software were new to plant engineers. The diffusion of this innovation required their buy-in and was crucial to scaling it company-wide. Among other things addressing two issues—simplification and integration—was important to gaining the buy-in of plant engineers.Colegrove explainedA common reaction from process engineers while the pilot [study] was under way was: “Your system your suite with all those functions . . . is too complex.” They saw it as complex because they were required to not only read the data but interact with it and they were to do it real time. It is therefore important to simplify the module before scaling it up. An option I am looking at is to make the suite modular.This option meant cutting the suite into specific modules. Energy for example could be a module. Energy was a major cost element at Dow as in all chemical plants. Dow had set specific targets through an energy intensity reduction program which was tracked at the C-suite. Plant engineers had been regularly implementing measures such as putting better insulation around reactors and revising the inputs in favour of materials with lower energy requirements. A plant-wide EMI initiative could add valuable real-time information to the energy reduction effort and assist in making decisions leading to reduced energy consumption more quickly. Other examples of possible modules were waste recovery—waste was a major cost element in a typical chemical plant—and recycling in view of the growing importance of environmental sustainability. As part of simplification it was important for Dow to ensure that the modules would be easy to install on individual workstations. Operators could be given a package that was pre-programmed so that they could install it with no more than a few easy clicks. The package could also have default dashboards. The dashboard could offer multiple possibilities of data extraction—pie charts bar charts and colour codes—enabling flexibility to move the pieces around to comply with reporting needs at different levels. Work would have to be done to ensure that EMI technology would meet this need for simplicity.Integration which meant assembling data from processes equipment and legacy systems was also crucial to securing mass acceptance by Dow plant engineers and the company in general. This would be less complicated in a plant that Dow had built from the ground up than in plants that Dow had acquired worldwide but integration would still be complex. Complexity could arise because the proposed EMI was to be positioned between two layers—SAP and automation—both of which were global when EMI was meant to be local. Colegrove saidEMI would be owned and managed at each factory by plant engineers from within that factory. The user group itself should create dashboards by generally playing around. Pull factors rather than push factors would come into play in deploying EMI. It is the only way of ensuring that data would stay at its point of origin. It also means that the role of my team will be limited to providing users with tools to mine their own data. A final challenge for Colegrove pertained to measuring the impact of the EMI initiative. Return on investment would be linked closely to the key performance indicators of each plant. Operational reliability was a major key performance indicator and it varied not only with each plant but with each process. Return on investment could be calculated based on the number of shutdowns avoided and the lowered turnarounds for maintenance. Colegrove explainedCurrently a few engineers in each plant would go every Friday to a database to upload specific pieces of data. It typically takes all afternoon for them. With EMI capability we would eliminate that work altogether. It amounts to giving say five hours of work back to each engineer in a plant. If you look at it over a 52-week time frame that is a lot of manpower/womanpower brought back into the plant for other things. I need to identify deliverables metrics like that to make a compelling case for EMI at Dow. What would those tangible evidences be?Colegrove and his team had gained enough insight during the pilot project to know that Dow could benefit from an EMI initiative. But they also understood that the success of an EMI initiative would depend on many factors. Colegrove wondered how he should proceed. Should his team continue the pilot project and gather further insight into the specific metrics that mattered? Should the team modularize the EMI initiative or roll it out on a broader scale to let the engineers play around with it and learn on their own? Was this the right time to be making such demands of plant engineers or would it be better for a start to keep it in R&D? Or with no immediate problems to fix should Colegrove wait until there was a problem to be solved in case EMI was just the latest fad within the big data phenomenon?

Ltd. (Xinke) which belonged to Jiangxi Xinke Investment Co. Ltd. released its business strategy the Greenland Xinke platform’s founder and chief executive officer Jinsheng Miao posted the following on WeChat: Along the way some people thought it was ridiculous when Xinke built crowd innovation cafés. Some people thought it was questionable when Xinke created the Zhongke Xinke Crowd Innovation Fund platform. Today Xinke has built the first nationwide crowd innovation space ecology which makes Xinke a respectable company. There may be ups and downs along the road but for the ultimate goal I’ll do nothing but trek night and day.By 2017 the development of entrepreneurial services in China had been taking place for less than 10 years and the concept of the crowd innovation space (CIS) had been introduced only four years prior. Although Xinke had experienced growth only in the past three years the firm had already undergone two transformations in its service patterns: from the Xinke Café to the Greenland Xinke platform to the Xinke CIS Fund—in other words from offering the single service of project communication to introducing multi-dimensional services. Now in March 2017 the firm had to determine how it would meet the needs of entrepreneurs with increasingly mature services.The Era of XinkeThe successful release of its crowd innovation eco-strategy was a milestone in Xinke’s development. This was a project the Xinke team had struggled for several months to complete. To recognize the team’s hard work Miao held an internal celebratory party both to thank everyone for their work and to take the opportunity to speak openly with his team. A few hours after the release of the eco-strategy Miao said “Finally we are taking another step forward. From the crowdfunding café to the crowd innovation eco-strategy we started the company on a whim and now we are putting our hearts into growing the company. Along the way there have been rewarding surprises and challenging bumps.”The history of Xinke’s growth was a microcosm of the development of thousands of CISs in China (see Exhibit 1). The iterative upgrading of entrepreneurial services had not been achieved by the simple moves of one company; rather it had succeeded through multiple factors within the context of the entire era. growiing xinke Due to a great deal of uncertainties in the entrepreneurial process it could be difficult to grasp the key links among entrepreneurial opportunities entrepreneurial resources and business operations. Therefore a number of entrepreneurial projects in China had been shelved in their infancy. In June 1987 China’s first business incubator was established in the Wuhan East Lake New Technology Entrepreneurship Centre. The incubator-based entrepreneurial service centre quickly spread to all parts of the country. With the prevalence of venture capital and the growth of the Internet entrepreneurial services were continuously improved and upgraded. The industry was moving towards a resource-sharing model. A new convenient low-cost all-factor and open-ended entrepreneurial service platform—the CIS—emerged as a new paradigm of entrepreneurial services. China’s first creative innovation space was the “New Workshop” established in Shanghai on October 1 2010. Since 2010 many crowd innovation service platforms based on resource sharing had emerged including Tencent Open Platform and 3W Coffee. It was estimated that the number of CISs exceeded 5000 in 2010 with an average of more than 700 being added every year. Shifting Modes and Driving the Market After 40 years of reform and opening up to foreign markets the Chinese economy was moving from being factor driven to innovation driven. Innovation was often accompanied by demand-oriented resource integration. As a promoter of dynamic resource allocation CISs were committed to resource sharing and played an important role in economic growth. At the same time the open market under economic transformation had also reacted to CISs and had become the driving force for its iterative upgrade. Compared to the international community funds in the Chinese market were relatively ample. As long as there was demand investment institutions—including various incubators and venture capital funds—were supportive and inclusive of entrepreneurs. They would continue to interact with entrepreneurs and CISs to create better entrepreneurial conditions.Service Upgrades Paving the Way for TechnologySuccessful CIS operation modes at home and abroad showed that the spaces created by CISs were not composed of a single element. This was especially true of the spaces created in the era of open innovation 2.0. In addition to the standard configuration of venues and basic services CISs needed to offer novel entrepreneurial services to attract entrepreneurs. The basic service content of a CIS could be highly reproducible. Therefore in order to create service differentiation and to compete service upgrades were needed. Such upgrades were difficult to achieve and could not be done recklessly. Technology helped corporate decision-makers find access to service upgrades. In 2016 the turnover of technology contracts in China reached ¥1140.7 billion a yearly increase of 16 per cent. Domestic technology market transactions had increased significantly. The prosperity of the technological environment laid the foundation for the rapid iteration and development of Internet technology. The maturity of Internet technology had profoundly changed China’s economic model and service mode. The strategic emerging fields were mainly represented by five major industries—namely information technology high-end manufacturing bio-economics green low-carbon technology and digital creativity—all of which continued to grow rapidly. Big data cloud computing sharing modes artificial intelligence (AI) and other technical concepts had provided new possibilities. Such technologies could help CISs meet demand and allocate resources. Especially in the shared office areas that branded themselves as “smart and agile” basic office needs (e.g. the Internet photography printing scanning faxing) and smart office needs (e.g. facial recognition technology network reservation venues advanced teleconferencing video equipment) were inseparable.THE COFFEE SHOP: WHERE THE ENTREPRENEUR’S DREAM STARTedMiao had been a university professor leading a relatively stable life when he decided to resign from his steady job in 2014 and jump into the business world. The idea to get into business had sprung through a WeChat group conversation Miao had had with some of his master of business administration (MBA) classmates from the Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. In the first month after resigning Miao conducted research at home hoping to find a breakthrough idea from which to start his business. However either there were no prospects in the industry or the market entry barriers were too high so Miao did not find anything right away. Instead a public tweet that coincidentally popped up in his notifications gave Miao an idea. The article in the tweet was a comparative introduction to some innovation crowdsourcing service platforms including Tencent Open Platform Kr Space and 3W Coffee (all of these had emerged after 2010). Miao thought it might be easier to create a platform instead of a physical product; also the start-up cost was small and entrepreneurial services were in high demand. At that time the city of Nanchang in China lacked a mature entrepreneurial service platform so the market potential was huge. Miao therefore decided to create a platform in Nanchang for entrepreneurs to connect resources.Entrepreneurs’ Café Crowdfunding Equity	In the second half of 2014 Miao went on a business trip to inspect the many entrepreneurial cafés and incubators in Beijing and Shanghai in an attempt to learn from them. During China’s National Day news caught Miao’s attention that a café Gude Café was up for sale. On further investigation he found that Gude Café was both large and comfortable which would make it very suitable as a café for entrepreneurs to facilitate project communication. He immediately called some friends from his MBA program to build an entrepreneurial team which included Guosheng Huang Jun Chen and Zhilong Zhou. Miao then successfully purchased Gude Café.One day in October 2014 as the team was sitting in the café Zhou said “Now that the crowd innovation café is so popular people with a bit of capital are tempted to try it. Should we follow the trend?” While the response from the other team members was positive they shared a concern about funding for the project as expressed by Chen: “Yes Zhilong is right. Don’t say that we can’t see the prospects of a crowd innovation café. [However] even if the prospects are good where can we get the funding?” 	 Miao replied “The funding is not the issue. Currently the popular crowdsourcing mode can fix that.” Miao did not answer Zhou’s and Chen’s questions directly but he mentioned an idea he had been considering. “This is not just a simple coffee shop but a place where entrepreneurs can grow and a place where all those random but creative ideas belong. If we just talk with no action this will always remain just a conversation. We need to confirm our brand name and get things running.” The crowdsourced coffee shop idea immediately got a positive response from the team. Chen pounded the table and said “Yes crowdsourcing! How come I didn’t think of that? We don’t have that kind of money but that doesn’t mean others don’t have it.” At the end of that year Xinke Café was launched based on the Internet + café + crowdsourcing model and was devoted to providing a communication opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors. Xinke Café was the first online-to-offline (O2O) café with a crowdsourcing model to be launched in Jiangxi Province. To attract and retain customers and leverage platform resources Miao led the entrepreneurial team in designing Xinke Café’s business model and clarifying its core business which included four main aspects: First in addition to providing a meeting place for relatives and friends and a place to drink coffee Xinke Café offered red wine and food. Second for theme-based salon events Xinke Café offered catering services; guests could also use the fully-equipped spaces to organize salon events. Since its inception the café had hosted nearly 100 themed salon events (e.g. a cigar and red wine party a ladies’ society an expert lecture hall and a commercial film broadcast as well as salon events focusing on enterprise management tourism promotion and health care). Third the café offered matchmaking opportunities for high-quality entrepreneurial projects including those of leading economic figures bankers investors entrepreneurs media figures and members of the Chamber of Commerce. The shareholder teams of the industry elite provided financing channels for hard-working entrepreneurs with great ideas and helped to find suitable project investors. Finally the founders wanted to create a creative market for cafés. Xinke Café was the first O2O café in Jiangxi Province. All the books and novels on display there had been recommended by Xinke’s shareholders or by Xinke members. Customers could find shareholder or membership information using the commodity code on an item and purchase that item straightaway. The products could also be purchased through the official website. Insufficient Stamina Limited ServiceA month passed and through the connections Miao had gathered over the years Xinke Café gradually got onto the right track. Coffee sales activity participation fees and membership fees soon generated income for Xinke Cafe for the first time. In a short time Xinke Cafe had become the most popular café platform for local entrepreneurs to exchange ideas and conduct project collaborations. Xinke’s influence in Nanchang increased day by day. However whenever Miao sat sipping coffee in the café he was often frowning and appeared to be deep in thought. One day Miao came to inspect Xinke Café as was his custom. After these routine checkups he usually went home directly but he did not do so that day. He found an open seat ordered a cup of coffee and looked at his assistant Jiali Liu and asked “Jiali what do you think about the recent operations of Xinke Café?” Liu paused to formulate her answer and then replied “It’s good; the activities are running very smoothly. Some of the frequent customers have said that the platform provided by Xinke has given them a lot.” Miao said “Yes but this is the problem! The participation rate of the events and the satisfaction of the customers are indeed constantly improving but have you noticed that most of these meetings are made up of old faces and we seem to be just waiting?” Liu understood what he meant right away and asked “Mr. Miao what are you going to do? Do you want to promote Xinke or expand?” Miao did not answer directly but said “The only way to constantly meet the needs of entrepreneurs is to constantly learn to stay updated with trends. Xinke must go through a transformation; it is just a matter of timing.” AN INCUBATOR PLATFORM READY TO SPREAD ITS WINGS It did not take long for Miao to find the right time to change. In September 2014 Keqiang Li the premier of China put forward the concept of mass entrepreneurship in the opening speech of the 2014 Summer Davos Forum. In 2015 the concept became the new engine of national economic development. In March 2015 the phrase “crowd innovation space” officially appeared in “Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on the Development of Crowd Innovation Spaces to Promote Public Innovation and Entrepreneurship.” Local and national governments began to fully support innovation and entrepreneurship services at all levels—for example by accelerating the construction of CISs for innovation lowering entry barriers for innovative entrepreneurship strengthening fiscal funding guidance improving entrepreneurial investment and financing mechanisms enriching innovative entrepreneurial activities to fully support innovation and developing entrepreneurship services. A large number of entrepreneurial service enterprises emerged across the country. This policy was good news. It was like gospel for entrepreneurs but it also acted as a wake-up call for them. After all whoever started first would have the first-mover advantage.With a Supportive Policy It Was Time to UpgradeIn spring 2015 Miao and Liu participated in an exhibition of representative start-ups in Jiangxi Province. There a young businessman in a suit walked directly toward Miao; he did not shake Miao’s hand but he nodded to him. Miao could not hide the pride in his face. As he walked away Miao smiled and said “Jiali do you know him? He is also doing a crowd innovation space service and his business is almost the same as ours although it’s not quite as good. But because the young businessman’s business was supported by the local government it has expanded progressively and promoted itself very well.” Liu thought for a moment and replied: “Yes recently mass entrepreneurship is everywhere and all the local governments are making a move.” Miao’s excitement also came with worries. Nanchang was the most desirable choice of location for Miao but he recognized the network effects of Nanchang had not yet appeared. Many companies were secretly eyeing this “big market” and Xinke was not the only contender.“Competitors are moving forward which means we are going backward” Miao said explainingWe chose a resource-sharing platform because it has infinite possibilities for the future. The establishment of Xinke Café was based on this original intention. Nowadays there are many restrictions. Not only is the choice of services limited but there are also limitations in our ability to meet the needs of entrepreneurs. The scale of a business is difficult to expand in a short period of time but Xinke is trapped under a ceiling.Liu replied “I heard that the Nanchang municipal government has been preparing the ‘Hongcheng Mass Entrepreneurship Plan 1.0.’ [Through it] certified CISs can receive support in terms of tax breaks funding and so on. Recently we have also visited some CISs. Why don’t we use the mass entrepreneurship opportunity to get government support?” Miao seemed to have anticipated this and nodded firmly saying You’re right. We must fight for government support. The transformation and upgrading of entrepreneurial services are inevitable. When I saw the mass entrepreneurship news I was thinking about transforming ourselves. However doing it all by ourselves would be very difficult. On top of that government support is limited. We need to have something really special to stand out. Miao and Liu were aware that the CIS was facing a major transformation.With Unexpected Help Exploring the Business ModelIn the midst of its dilemma Xinke received help from Xinzhong Huang the vice-president of Beijing Oriental Garden Environment Co. Ltd. Miao and Huang met at one of Xinke’s road shows. Huang acknowledged the impact of Xinke’s activities especially its financing ability. After learning about Xinke’s development intentions Huang used the crowdfunding café model and the success of the Xinke incubator to recommend Xinke to the Greenland Group (Greenland) a leading real estate company. To Miao’s surprise Greenland called one week later to invite Xinke to set up a location in the Nanchang Greenland 303 Twin Towers. Miao felt he should determine the best opportunities for co-operation between Xinke and Greenland to control the direction of their collaboration. He was eager to convene a team to analyze the mission vision status quo and development of the Greenland initiative in the Nanchang market. Additionally he thought about a possible new business model for Xinke. After three days of constantly reformulating his plan Miao finally began to form an idea. Considering his desire to get the collaboration settled as soon as possible Miao immediately called Jingbin Li the deputy general manager of Greenland’s Jiangxi Real Estate division. Site Subletting and RepositioningIn May 2015 about 10 young and middle-aged men in suits were sitting nervously after having greeted each other in a conference room in the Greenland Twin Towers. This was the first formal meeting between the business representatives of Xinke and Greenland. Discussions between the two teams (Jingbin Li from Greenland and Miao and Liu from Xinke) were frank. Liu got up and distributed the prepared business plan saying “Entering Greenland is a golden opportunity for us but we also hope that the co-operation will have a high degree of complementarity which will enable . . . a win-win situation. If you simply let Xinke open a Xinke Café 2.0 in Greenland that would not mean a lot.” Miao looked at Jingbin Li and said confidently After analysis we believe that Xinke and Greenland can work together to do site subletting. There is space in Greenland a business model from Xinke and the aggregate experience of the entrepreneurs. We hope that Xinke can rent some space in the Greenland Twin Towers. Xinke will design the space as an exchange area a road show area and a joint office area. The exchange area will mainly be used to organize collaboration meetings and entrepreneurs’ salons to explore promising entrepreneurial projects. The road show area will mainly provide opportunities for the display and financing of quality projects. The most important and most occupied [area] would be the joint office area. Space will be rented to quality projects at a price below the market average. At the same time Xinke will provide a complete one-stop service to accelerate the growth of entrepreneurship. In short we are building an entrepreneurship service platform and co-operating to achieve a leap in crowd entrepreneurship! He went quiet and was met with warm applause in the conference room. After two weeks of further discussions both sides settled on a co-operation model. In the tallest building in Jiangxi—the Greenland 303 Twin Towers—they would create a Greenland and Xinke crowd innovation platform based on the shared CIS office model. Greenland not only provided high-quality infrastructure support for the development of Xinke but also offered soft services through the enterprise service platform. At the same time Greenland created some preferential conditions such as making the first year rent-free; Xinke thus got a fail-safe deal from the collaboration. After the co-operation was established the Greenland Xinke Platform attracted more high-end shareholder resources and incubated high-quality projects by leveraging the Greenland enterprise service platform and the Xinke brand.With Greenland’s global service platform and Xinke’s high-quality shareholder resources Xinke was able to rent out the remaining space to start-up enterprises or office teams as well as assist in handling company registrations industrial and commercial tax registrations and other services including information services such as product promotion; brand marketing; project financing; technical training for marketing; talent management; and holding entrepreneurial training forums associations salons and other activities. There was also free catering with coffee and snacks and Xinke provided spaces for conference rooms salons and road shows. More than 30 companies and entrepreneurial teams settled on the Xinke platform enjoying the entrepreneurial venues and services provided by Xinke. Xinke co-operated with these companies on the design for the layout of the office-sharing business plan. Xinke had successfully transformed from innovator to sub-landlord. With support from government policy and Greenland Xinke was further along the path of becoming a CIS. AN ENTREPRENEUR-DRIVEN CISAfter co-operating with Greenland creating the CIS became Xinke’s main focus. However the profits from the sublease were limited and it was difficult to continuously support the innovation of Xinke with meagre profits. Xinke’s development was gradually falling into a period of stagnation and the multiple objectives of both revenue and profits made it impossible to meet the demands of entrepreneurs. Xinke was rejecting the needs of a large number of entrepreneurs. After a year and a half of exploration and reflection however Xinke finally found a way to open up more opportunities.In February 2017 Xinke took the lead in releasing the first crowd innovation ecology in China—the Xinke crowd innovation eco-strategy which clearly defined entrepreneur demand as the core and the Zhongke Xinke Crowd Innovation Fund as the driving force. It created a six-in-one eco-chain including incubators a crowd innovation fund a venture capital mobile app a venture capital café an enterprise service platform and a business school to provide a comprehensive solution for China’s entrepreneurs. Xinke created an efficient ecological model that served social enterprises.Crowd Innovation Funds and Serving Entrepreneurs In August 2016 Xinke was supported by Zhongke Merchants Investments Management Group Co. Ltd. (Zhongke Merchants) and completed a round of financing. This time Miao focused on the investment requirements of entrepreneurs and assembled an investment team. He took the lead and Ji Wang the vice-president of the original online group’s investment business took the negotiation role; Xiaopeng Li was responsible for the analysis of prospects at the technical level; Lei Zhu assumed the role of investment director; and the chief financial officer’s role was assumed by Ninghui Pan who was mainly responsible for investment evaluation of specific areas (e.g. project valuation investment ratios etc.). While these individuals formed the key team they were unable to find quality projects that lacked resources. It was at this time that Xinke received government assistance.The Jiangxi Agricultural Department recommended to Xinke a project called Gude Agriculture. Gude Agriculture was a novel agricultural project focused on safe nutritious rice and other agricultural products. The core technology was microbial flora management which could achieve the production of high-quality rice with zero fertilizers and zero pesticides. The founder of the project Saishan Li had been working on cultivating researching and planting wild rice for 30 years. In 2009 Gude Agriculture produced 1070 kilograms of organic wild rice per mu which far exceeded the usual levels. In 2012 Saishan Li’s family’s ecological farmland technology was patented and the results were remarkable. The group required funds labour and other resources to operationalize its technology and Saishan Li hoped to get Xinke’s full support. Miao saw the core competitiveness of Gude Agriculture and immediately decided to let Gude Agriculture settle in Xinke. In January 2017 Gude Agriculture won the angel round of investment led by the Zhongke Xinke Crowd Innovation Fund Platform and successfully built an ecological three-dimensional breeding demonstration base on the banks of Poyang Lake the largest freshwater lake in China. After working with Gude Agriculture Xinke took the initiative to develop businesses based on Jiangxi’s advantageous resources focusing on agriculture education and tourism. To build an all-around high-quality service project Xinke also successively invested in firms such as Shanghai Medical Blue and STEAM and provided office space business model guidance road show training and other entrepreneurship services. Compared with professional mutual fund management companies the CIS had some distinct advantages in project discovery and incubation. When the investment business was gradually rolled out the transformation and growth Xinke had undergone was apparent to Zhongke Merchants. In December 2016 Xinke joined forces with Zhongke Merchants to launch the Zhongke Xinke Crowd Innovation Fund with ¥10 billion which was used to drive investment and incubate start-ups that had development prospects. The main profit would be achieved through mutual fund management and future investment returns. The main target of investment was quality crowd innovation projects such as those in self-driving automobiles and AI. At the same time Xinke was also working on the integration of project communications joint offices investment and financing and other decentralized services and it gradually transitioned to a venture capital incubator model with the mission of comprehensively incubating entrepreneurship. In addition to direct investment Xinke carefully planned road shows for promising projects and enhanced the quality of the road shows to attract better investors. Once a project was successfully financed Xinke was able to obtain considerable service fees. With excellent service for high-quality clients Xinke’s brand value was consistently improving. Xinke Venture Capital: Connecting the ResourcesOn the days surrounding the release of the crowd innovation eco-strategy Xinke was frequently featured in the news resulting in huge brand promotion. This was thanks to a press conference organized by the Nanchang municipal government to which 50 or 60 members of the media from other provinces were invited along with the central media local provincial media municipal media and social media influencers. Xinke gained a great deal of publicity in Jiangxi and across the whole country. Further to implement the Xinke crowd innovation ecology Miao decided to establish an online media platform to connect multiple resources and meet the needs of entrepreneurs in disseminating and receiving information. Miao delegated this to Yuanyuan Wu who was responsible for advertising. Wu had five years of media experience and had been a reporter for three years at Beijing Business Daily. In March 2017 the WeChat public account “Zhongke Xinke Venture Circle” was formally formed. Wu was in charge of the account and was editor-in-chief of the public number. Zhongke Xinke Venture Circle was a media platform that integrated online and offline aggregated maker resources tutor resources and investor resources. The online venture capital circle used the WeChat public account as the carrier focusing on the promotion of entrepreneurial information related to the project as well as information on entrepreneurial activities for makers and investors. The “Looking for Partners” road show focused on investment and financing. Each road show would be promoted online and each was a quality project jointly guided by experts and mentor teams.Shared Office Investment ServicesWith the shared office both the investment service and the online media service gradually got on the right track. The shared office as the basic service however was in a lag phase and could not keep up with the pace of development. Now that he had Greenland’s support Miao felt it was time for Xinke’s shared office business to expand beyond the Nanchang market. As early as the end of 2016 Miao discovered the following: First major demand for shared offices existed primarily in the central business district of each city; the more high-end office buildings there were in a city the greater the demand was for offices. Second smart offices were the inevitable outcome of shared offices. As a result Xinke decided to focus on service content innovative service models and improving service quality to improve the original shared office business and create a high-end office platform with smart and agile office facilities and aggregated business collaboration resources. To develop the high-end shared office area Xinke focused on the central business districts in the largest cities landmark office buildings and the development of smart shared-office areas. Target customers included small offices in various cities big companies and small and micro-enterprises that focused on corporate image and high-quality entrepreneurial projects. With its co-operation with Greenland as a breakthrough point Xinke quickly cut into this niche market. In order to implement the plan and specify the break-even point as soon as possible Miao divided the target cities of the shared office project into Class A (first-tier cities such as Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Shenzhen) and Class B (second-tier capital cities such as Nanchang or landmark cities similar to Suzhou). Class A cities had higher rental costs but the estimated profit from these was more than ¥1 million which was about twice as high as that of Class B cities.While planning the layout of the shared office plan Xinke would include building a smart shared-office system on the agenda. In the Internet era Xinke was committed to connecting all spaces equipment facilities and back ends to respond to demand and resource allocation through the cloud and big data. Xinke also improved the sharing of high-end hardware office facilities to provide an agile and high-efficiency office experience. For example smart lighting smart code access control smart conference rooms and a smart photocopying system were arranged in Xinke’s shared offices in every city. In addition in terms of software Xinke grafted soft entrepreneurial services onto t",,,,,
e hardware system by providing a one-to-one exclusive secretary a shared front desk designers marketing services and other human resources. Positioning itself as a high-end shared office brand Xinke’s shared offices allowed each resident to enjoy VIP service high-end office space and a smart office. With the goal of creating a new brand for the shared office Miao gave a strong name to the rising shared office business: ThinkerWork.STILL ANYONE’S GAMEThroughout Xinke’s three-year growth Miao had always insisted that “the only constant is change.” Reviewing the era of mass entrepreneurship he had aimed to meet the needs of entrepreneurs. He had led Xinke in overcoming obstacles and successfully created an ecology and dream factory for entrepreneurs. However the number of competitors in the industry was increasing and the number of high-quality entrepreneurs and projects was very limited. The situation of supply exceeding demand led the entrepreneurial service industry to begin to shift from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market. CISs were facing the problem of the “homogeneity” of their models and services. And Xinke was facing the difficult problem of determining how to stand out as a leader among many CISs.Could the crowd innovation ecology designed by Xinke inject new vitality into the development of the CIS? How should Xinke’s crowd innovation eco-strategy be improved? How could Xinke realize professionalization in and improvement of the crowd innovation ecology?EXHIBIT 1: CHINA’S CLASSIFICATION OF CIS OPERATION MODESNote: CIS = crowd innovation space; WeWork is an office leasing company in New York USA.

The company which owned large retail chains including Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar had been expanding its footprint across the country by acquiring several regional and national chains. Most of the acquisitions by Future Retail were in small-format stores with value positioning in locations where Future Retail had limited presence. HyperCity however was an upscale hypermarket chain with a strong presence in geographies where Future Retail’s flagship Big Bazaar was already present. While this acquisition was likely to help Future Retail expand its retail network and gain more economies of scale for its back-end operations it remained to be determined how HyperCity fit into its existing portfolio remained to be determined. Also HyperCity was suffering losses and turning around a loss-making company would be another challenge for Future Retail.In 2017 Future Retail was expanding its network of stores to more locations offering the convenience of proximity to its customers. However customers in urban India were shifting to e-commerce for better pricing and the comfort of shopping from home. Pure-play food and grocery e-commerce players such as bigbasket were becoming increasingly popular and efficient. Global lifestyle e-commerce player Amazon.com Inc. had also entered the online food retailing business. At one end customers were shifting to e-commerce for their medium to large planned purchases while small neighbourhood stores (popularly known as kirana stores) and cart vendors remained the popular choice for small quick purchases. By expanding its network of stores across different formats would Future Retail be able to attract more customers moving to online retailers? Would the company be able to match the convenience of home delivery offered by small neighbourhood stores? How could Future Retail attract customers to its stores given the strong competition from small neighbourhood stores and online retailers? Retailing in IndiaIn 2017 India was the second most populous country in the world. Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12 per cent from 2012 to 2016 retail was one of the largest industries of the Indian economy. The size of the Indian retail industry was ₹39 trillion in the fiscal year (FY) 2015–16 and was expected to reach ₹97 trillion by FY 2021–22. The industry however was fragmented with a large unorganized sector made up of small mom-and-pop stores. Organized retail was relatively new in India and included corporate-owned shopping malls department stores supermarkets and hypermarkets concentrated in urban areas (see Exhibit 1). The key drivers of growth in India’s organized retail sector were growth in the economy a rising middle class increasing disposable incomes evolving consumer trends changing lifestyles and increasing levels of urbanization.Food Retailing in IndiaFood and grocery retailing included cereals packaged foods fresh produce dairy products poultry seafood and other household goods. The Indian food-retailing sector generated ₹22 trillion in revenue in FY 2016–17 and was growing at a CAGR of 10 per cent. Despite its large size general trade (GT) or the unorganized sector including kirana stores cart vendors and mandis (markets that sold fresh meat and produce) dominated the industry. Unorganized players had lower overheads and competed fiercely with organized players by offering the convenience of free home delivery credit purchases and favourable locations. Modern trade (MT) or the organized sector accounted for less than 3 per cent of the sector with concentration predominantly in urban centres. MT however was forecasted to grow by 25 per cent in FY 2017–18. The dominance of GT was a consequence of the shopping and consumption practices in India. Indian customers had a strong preference for fresh produce which led to frequent food and grocery purchases. On average customers purchased fresh produce from cart vendors as frequently as three times a week. Shopping for staples and household products was done weekly rather than monthly. Less than 10 per cent of the population owned a vehicle so very few used a car for shopping. Approximately 95 per cent of customers visited a store within a three- to five-kilometre radius of their homes. As a result of these shopping patterns neighbourhood stores that offered free home delivery became the preferred shopping choice for Indian customers. However MT was quickly gaining acceptance among customers especially in urban areas. Only about 30 per cent of the Indian population of 1.21 billion people lived in urban areas but they accounted for nearly 70 per cent of Indian gross domestic product. The growing Indian food and grocery retail market had attracted several players some of which were owned by large corporate houses that had diverse interests (see Exhibit 2). This growth was driven mainly by the increasing numbers of metropolitan consumers who wanted to shop for all of their grocery requirements under one roof. The large assortment offered by these retailers including global merchandise also attracted urban customers. Private label was another differentiator for many organized retailers. Private label products priced 5 to 15 per cent lower than the national brands attracted value-conscious customers. Some retailers had also introduced exclusive private label products in categories where national brands did not have a strong offering. Private label products were able to offer higher profitability and competitive distinction to retailers. While the phenomenon of private labels in the food and grocery segment was very prominent in developed countries it was a relatively novel concept in India. As customers in India had a strong preference toward fresh produce many organized retailers tried to address this preference by acquiring produce directly from farms thereby shortening the supply chain. Many retailers offered value-added products such as cut vegetables and freshly made batter to attract busy health-conscious customers. As customers preferred stores located close to their homes many organized players had started small supermarkets conveniently located near residential areas. Some of the retailers had also started home delivery at select locations to address the challenge of transportation.India was arguably a subcontinent and not just a country with varied cultures diverse cuisine and food preferences. Even within a state there were wide variations in tastes eating habits and the use of ingredients. Most food brands and retail chains were therefore regional rather than national. To meet the diverse needs of customers stores across the country varied their merchandise mix making local stores and local chains more successful than national chains. Despite these differences Indian customers were similar to customers in others parts of the world in that they valued the concept of value for money. This shared characteristic prevailed across all socio-economic segments and was a benchmark of customer satisfaction.Future Retail LimitedFuture Retail Limited the retail arm of Future Group was the largest retailing organization in India. By 2017 the company had operations in several retail formats including departmental stores hypermarkets supermarkets and specialty stores for electronics as well as home furnishing and decor. The company operated several national chains including Big Bazaar (hypermarkets) Food Bazaar (supermarkets) Foodhall (premium supermarkets) Easyday (neighbourhood supermarkets) Ezone (electronics specialty store) and Fashion at Big Bazaar (abbreviated fbb) a department store. PantaloonsFuture Retail Limited formerly known as Pantaloon Retail India Limited (PRIL) started its operations as Manz Wear Private Limited in 1987 dealing with fabric for men’s clothing. Subsequently the company launched the formal-trousers brand Pantaloon followed by a chain of menswear stores called Pantaloon Shoppe aiming to convert customers accustomed to purchasing stitched clothing to purchasing ready-to-wear garments. In 1997 the company expanded its offerings to the whole family and launched an 8000-square-foot high-fashion family department store in Kolkata called Pantaloons. The Pantaloons store offered affordable yet aspirational products for Indian middle- and upper-class customers. The store sold apparel and lifestyle brands for the whole family under one roof which was a novelty for Indian customers at that time. Starting with inspiration from global departmental stores Pantaloons customized its stores for the Indian custom of families shopping together. Pantaloons changed the stores’ global aisles layouts to L- and U-shaped counters to make the space comfortable for families to stand around. Pantaloons also introduced the brands John Miller Lombard and Annabelle under its private label program. Pantaloons was one of the most successful department stores in the country and by 2012 it was present in 35 cities with 65 stores and 21 factory outlets covering a total retail space of more than 2 million square feet with annual sales of about ₹17 billion. During this period PRIL aggressively expanded its operations into several other retail formats including food consumer packaged goods (CPG) and electronics and several novel industries including insurance and financial services. However the flagship chain Pantaloons bore the burden of increasing debt to fund the company’s expansion. To reduce its debt and maintain the company’s increasing focus on food and the CPG retailing business PRIL sold a controlling stake in Pantaloons to Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd. Following the spinoff of Pantaloons from the broader business PRIL changed its name to Future Retail Limited.Big Bazaar and Food BazaarIn 2001 Future Retail (then PRIL) entered into food and grocery retailing by launching a chain of hypermarket discount stores called Big Bazaar in three cities—Kolkata Bangalore and Hyderabad. Each of the stores had a floor space of approximately 50000 square feet a cold storage area and sometimes a pharmacy. Big Bazaar stores offered a wide range of products including apparel electronics kitchenware sporting goods luggage and jewellery in a modern retailing environment. Although Big Bazaar offered services such as easy parking fixed prices and merchandise return privileges similar to a Western hypermarket the stores had a non-linear layout similar to traditional Indian markets. Based on insights on the shopping styles of Indian customers gleamed from extensive visits to neighbourhood markets the store design had a certain level of built-in chaos to give the feel of the local market. Globally food and grocery accounted for about 70 per cent of a large hypermarket’s merchandise mix where customers bought food and other household products during their monthly shopping trips. Customers in India however frequently bought food products for daily use from small neighbourhood stores rather than stocking up during visits to large-format stores. Also for Indian shoppers a visit to a large-format store was an outing for the family. Further as Indian customers had a low inclination toward packaged food and bought more staples and fresh produce food and grocery were low-margin categories. Big Bazaar therefore kept food and grocery to just 30 per cent of the merchandise with high-margin apparel and home products making up the remainder. Many Indian customers preferred to touch and feel the products before buying them; Big Bazaar stores therefore offered loose self-serve grains that consumers could inspect in addition to prepackaged grains. For fresh produce Big Bazaar enabled customers to see touch choose and weigh fruits and vegetables.Future Retail opened its first supermarket Food Bazaar in 2002 soon after launching Big Bazaar. Food Bazaar stores were located either within Big Bazaar stores or at independent locations. Expanding rapidly in the first six months Future Retail opened 42 Food Bazaar outlets including 18 stand-alone stores ranging in size from 5000 to 14000 square feet. Each Food Bazaar store stocked an average of 7000 products and sold fresh produce CPGs staples and ready-to-cook products.Although the stores had a strong emphasis on customer service and shopping ambiance the company ensured customers did not associate the store with high prices. Big Bazaar marketed on the promises of “more for less” and “our products at your price” to attract price-sensitive customers. The Big Bazaar team observed that in many affluent Indian households the house help did the routine grocery shopping. As the group promoter Kishore Biyani founder and chief executive officer of Future Retail said “Big Bazaar is a classless store that caters to all sections of society. You will often find the driver and the car owner shopping side by side at Big Bazaar.” It was therefore important to make the store comfortable not only for homemakers but also for housemaids. Big Bazaar came up with several campaigns such as Isse sasta aur acchha kahin nahin (You will not find it better and cheaper than this anywhere) and Umeed se dugna (Twice your expectations) to position itself as a value-price store. Big Bazaar also ran promotions where customers could recycle old products for store credit which was similar to the GT practice in the country.To deliver strong value for customers and higher margins for the company Future Retail developed a strong portfolio of private label brands including Sunkist Tasty Treat Golden Harvest Premium Harvest Sach Ektaa CleanMate and CareMate. The company aggressively promoted its private label brands in Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar stores with competitive pricing and side-by-side placements with national-brand products. A strong private label portfolio also helped the company to negotiate with national-brand manufacturers for better margins. There were times when Big Bazaar temporarily discontinued stocking prominent national brands such as Kellogg’s Lay’s Kurkure and Cheetos for more favourable margins and trade terms. Big Bazaar stores were large and the number of stock-keeping units was high. As the value-based pricing business model required the company to be lean on salespeople the company invested heavily in posters and cut-outs and put them up in every section. Big Bazaar invested approximately ₹3 million to ₹4 million in visual aids at each new store with a recurring investment of approximately 5 per cent of sales thereby providing a comfortable shopping experience to customers in its stores.Future Retail expanded aggressively over the next few years. Biyani said “Retail is like riding a bicycle. If you stop pedaling you'll fall.” By 2017 Future Retail had 235 Big Bazaar stores across 124 cities in India totalling over 10 million square feet of space. KB’s FairpriceCustomers in India shopped for food and grocery items at small neighbourhood stores (kiranas) which accounted for 97 per cent of the market. Future Retail launched KB’s Fairprice a neighbourhood convenience store concept in 2007 in Delhi to cater to frequent small purchases. These stores were 600- to 900-square-foot modern self-service stores that stocked all of the essential household products. These no-frill stores had no air-conditioning or fancy displays and were located near residential areas to provide shopping convenience. By 2011 India had 200 such stores across the country.EzoneFuture Retail started an electronics specialty store called Ezone in 2002. Ezone stores were set up both in the form of stand-alone stores as well as within Big Bazaar stores. The store sold national and international electronics brands for a range of product categories including audio accessories communication computing home entertainment home and kitchen appliances imaging personal entertainment and gaming.CentralFuture Retail launched Central a novel concept of a seamless shopping mall in 2004. Future Retail leased out space in the mall to different national and global brands for a fixed rent and proportion of the sales from the leased space. Mall stores housed over 300 brands across lifestyle categories such as apparel footwear and accessories as well as music books coffee shops food courts supermarkets and discotheques. Additionally Central housed Central Square a dedicated space for product launches impromptu events and art exhibitions. By 2017 the company had 35 Central stores.FbbFashion merchandise was always a significant part of Big Bazaar considering the higher margins it brought and Future Retail’s business strategy. With a focus on affordable fashion the company launched fbb a chain of apparel stores in 2008. These stores offered an assortment of youth-focused office wear daily wear and sportswear under its private label brands. The stores were either located within Big Bazaar or stand-alone stores in malls. By 2017 fbb had 54 independent stores across 32 cities in addition to its presence in 235 Big Bazaar stores.AcquisitionsFuture Retail was aggressive in its expansion right from its inception and acquisition of regional and national players was at the core of its expansion strategy (see Exhibit 3).Big AppleBig Apple a convenience store chain in the National Capital Region had 65 outlets that sold food and groceries. Future Retail acquired Big Apple in 2012 thereby expanding its reach in Delhi and the National Capital Region to supplement its 100 KB’s Fairprice small-format stores.Nilgiris 1905 (Nilgiris)Nilgiris was a supermarket chain with 140 outlets in the southern states of Karnataka Kerala Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Nilgiris operated its stores through a network of franchisees. Nilgiris Dairy Farm Ltd. was an iconic brand established in 1905 with a strong portfolio of dairy bakery chocolates and staples. Nilgiris had manufacturing facilities strong back-end operations distribution centres and a fleet of vehicles to service its outlets. Future Retail acquired Nilgiris in November 2014 for ₹3 billion thereby expanding its network in South India and gaining expertise in running a successful franchise network.EasydayEasyday was a national retail chain owned by Bharti Retail Limited with stores in hypermarkets supermarkets and neighbourhood stores. The company had over 200 stores in 144 cities across the country with revenues of approximately₹20 billion in 2015. Future Retail acquired Easyday through the merger route in 2015 and expanded its reach into 77 new cities. Easyday was a strong retail brand especially in small-format stores. With the acquisition of Easyday Future Retail became India’s largest retailer. To streamline formats and have a homogeneous brand portfolio Easyday hypermarket stores were rebranded as Big Bazaar outlets while Future Retail’s neighbourhood convenience stores and small supermarkets—KB’s Fair Price and KB’s Conveniently Yours—were rebranded as Easyday neighbourhood stores or supermarkets. With a focus on small format Future Retail expanded the Easyday network and by 2017 the company had 538 Easyday stores across 137 cities in the country.Heritage FreshHeritage Fresh was a chain of 124 supermarket stores in South India with store sizes ranging from 2000 to 8000 square feet. Heritage Fresh stores sold household products fast-moving consumer goods staples and fresh produce. Future Retail acquired the Heritage Fresh chain along with its bakery and agricultural-sourcing division in November 2016.HyperCityHyperCity was a chain of upscale hypermarket stores owned by Shoppers Stop a leading department store chain in Mumbai. Shoppers Stop entered into the food and grocery segment by launching HyperCity in 2006. HyperCity offered a range of products across categories such as food and grocery fashion electronics home furnishings home needs sports toys and stationery. HyperCity was positioned as an upscale hypermarket to provide an international shopping experience with a large modern and exciting environment. It sourced its merchandise from both local and international markets. HyperCity had an exclusive supply agreement with Waitrose & Partners a top supermarket chain in the United Kingdom for sourcing global merchandise. HyperCity etched a strong presence in urban centres with 19 large stores across the country by 2017. However the company was posting losses year on year and had reported a loss of ₹839.9 million on revenue of ₹11 billion in FY 2017. Future Retail acquired HyperCity in October 2017 for ₹6.55 billion. HyperCity was Future Retail’s first acquisition of a hypermarket chain; it had previously focused mainly on acquiring small-store formats to expand its reach.MOVING FORWARDThrough the inorganic route of expansion Future Retail had addressed the heterogeneous market and secured a strong local presence and a deep acceptance among customers. However there was a strong emergence of online retailers making swift inroads into the market by offering large assortments deep discounts and the convenience of home delivery. Customers were quickly switching to e-commerce for planned food and grocery purchases while kirana stores and local mandis remained the preferred choice for unplanned and fresh-produce purchases.With changing customer lifestyles would Future Retail be able to maintain its leadership position? As it looked for a larger share of the retail pie how would it deal with an increasing customer preference toward the convenience of online ordering? How would it handle the competition from omnipresent neighbourhood stores and cart vendors?EXHIBIT 1: KEY Organized-retailing Formats IN INDIASource: Compiled by case author from Michael R.

It was common knowledge that the products of large food and beverage corporations did not in the very best case represent an antidote to remedy these issues. A regular target of criticism had been PepsiCo Inc. (PepsiCo) a large multi-brand conglomerate that had not denied the association between some of its products and global health issues. As far back as 2010 the chief executive officer (CEO) at the time Indra Nooyi had recognized that “society people and lifestyles have changed” and that PepsiCo had no choice but to move in healthier directions. By 2021 PepsiCo had made impressive strides in reducing the negative health and ecological impacts of some of its products but criticism persisted that the conglomerate was not going far enough.  Would it be possible for PepsiCo to further address these criticisms and if so how?PepsiCo and the Food and Beverage IndustryCompanies in the food and beverage industry transformed raw agricultural goods into consumer food products and then packaged and distributed these products. In over more than half a century the industry had blossomed from a collection of mom-and-pop operations to a trillion-dollar powerhouse led by huge international corporations. Products from familiar names such as The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) Nestlé SA (Nestlé) and Kraft Foods Group Inc. (Kraft) dominated the industry and could be found in all corners of the globe.Headquartered in Purchase New York PepsiCo was a world leader in convenient snacks foods and beverages with more than 267000 employees across a wide portfolio of brands including five major billion-dollar brands—Pepsi Frito-Lay Tropicana Products Inc. (Tropicana) Quaker Oats Company (Quaker) and Gatorade Company Inc. (Gatorade)—found in more than 200 countries around the globe. In 2020 under the direction of CEO Ramon Laguarta PepsiCo’s estimated total net revenue amounted to US$70.4 billion. PepsiCo’s success was clearly the result of the company having built its empire on the manufacture and distribution of instantly recognizable products. The company’s ability to market its products also represented a core competence while product development had the potential to be a new source of competitive advantage.Industry Growth ConstraintsUnlike other industries the food and beverage industry faced a rather unique constraint: food consumption was ultimately tapped as individuals could consume only so much food. Regardless of a person’s income consuming a steady rate of approximately 2000 calories per day was in the best health interests of women as was consuming 2600 calories per day for men. As of 2013 the worldwide food industry produced 2884 calories per person each day while North America produced 3663 calories per person each day. Food and beverage companies were therefore left with two options: convince consumers to eat more or increase profit margins by adding value to existing foods so that consumers pay more.Food ProcessingFood processing was the means by which food companies added value to low-margin whole foods. Selling commoditized whole foods while best for the consumer resulted in low margins for food companies. To process food crops such as corn soy and wheat underwent intensive processes such as wet milling whereby cornstarch as an example was broken down into the seed kernel’s component parts. Food companies removed nutrients and vitamins that attracted bacteria and added synthetic versions of them later. Doing so meant that the food did not expire too quickly and allowed the food companies to expand their market reach beyond their localized environment increasing performance exponentially. Ultra-processed foods were defined as foods that underwent multiple processes contained many added ingredients and were highly manipulated. Examples of ultra-processed foods included sweetened breakfast cereals soft drinks chips chocolate ice cream packaged soups and french fries. Almost 50 per cent of the food Canadians ate was from ultra-processed foods whereas US citizens received almost 58 per cent of their calories from ultra-processed foods. Speaking directly to breakfast cereals as the pinnacle of ultra-processed food registered dietitian Chelsey Amer told food website The Daily Meal that a slice of pizza was a smarter meal than a typical bowl of cereal.Processed food also allowed companies to manipulate the ingredients of its products to take advantage of both the pricing variability of raw materials and the latest nutritional trends. Using a process called “food fortification” food producers could replace costly ingredients with engineered ingredients that were based on low-cost corn and soy crops. As an example high-fructose corn syrup was a low-cost replacement for sugar. With the help of government subsidies and the concentration of major agriculture companies such as Monsanto Company Tyson Foods Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company food and beverage companies were able to substantially reduce the costs of processed foods by limiting the ingredients to two primary crops: corn and soy. By using the derivatives of corn and soy food scientists avoided the limitations of perishable food and made their own version of butter (margarine) fruit juices (fruit drinks) and whipped cream (Cool Whip). A search through the processed food aisles of grocery stores revealed products that had corn and soy derivatives including among others high-fructose corn syrup citric acid lactic acid glucose fructose maltodextrin ethanol sorbitol xanthan gum sucrose and ethyl acetate. It was estimated that close to 90 per cent of products in the grocery store contained either a corn or a soy derivative or both as did the following products: ketchup Twinkies peanut butter salad dressing painkillers soft drinks burgers and maple syrup.Food processing was therefore a key means by which value was added to highly commoditized and low-margin whole foods. Paraphrasing a General Mills Inc. vice president Michael Pollan said:Selling unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods will always be a fool’s game since the price of agricultural commodities tends to fall over time whether they’re organic or not. It will always be hard to distinguish one company’s corn or chickens or apples from any other company’s. It makes much more sense to turn the corn into a brand-name cereal the chicken into a TV dinner and the apples into a component in a low moisture naturally sweetened apple piece infused with a red-wine extract.Companies therefore earned more profits by processing and adding value to fruits and vegetables. One example of this approach was in PepsiCo’s Tropicana “100 % Pure Orange Juice” a product that claimed to give “your body a full day’s supply of Vitamin C—a dietary antioxidant—plus all the potassium you’d find in a medium sized banana” conveniently packaged in plastic containers to allow for a long shelf life.Onslaught of CriticismCriticism of the industry had grown rampant in the last decade by those claiming that the industry’s practices were responsible for fundamental health issues. For instance although the wet-milling process afforded food companies with enormous flexibility when designing food processed food often required systemic chemicals hormones antibiotics pesticides toxins and additives. In 2019 the United States Food and Drug Administration conducted a study that tested for the presence of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in food on grocery store shelves. This non-biodegradable chemical had leached into soil air and water and as a result had been found in the blood of 97 per cent of Americans partly through the consumption of food. Although the findings concluded that in most cases the level of contaminants found in the food would not be a health concern many independent experts disagreed. The various ways in which PFASs affected the body were still unclear but one route of harm appeared to be the immune system.As of 2016 more than 1.9 billion adults globally were overweight and at least 650 million were clinically obese. An estimated 38 million children under the age of five were obese or overweight worldwide in 2019. In the United States nearly 14 per cent of children between the ages of two and five 18 per cent of six-to-11-year-olds and 21 per cent of 12-to-19-year-olds were considered obese. According to 2015–16 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than 70 per cent of US adults aged 20 and older were overweight or obese with about 42 per cent considered obese according to 2017–18 CDC data. This problem was not isolated to developed countries as the prevalence of obesity worldwide had nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016. More than 50 per cent of adults in China were classified as overweight 16 per cent of whom were considered obese. Qatar was one of the worst-affected countries with more than 70 per cent of its populator either overweight or obese. A recent study concluded that being statistically obese “was tied to a 27 percent increase in the odds of dying within the study period” in which the research was conducted.McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the global economic impact of obesity was roughly $2.0 trillion which was equivalent to the gross domestic product of Italy or Russia. Moreover obesity had the same impact on the global economy as armed conflict and only a slightly lower impact than smoking. Increased health problems associated with obesity included high blood pressure high levels of triglycerides type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis sleep apnea many types of cancer and mental illnesses. Obesity was believed to account for 80 to 85 per cent of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Food’s Role in Health ProblemsThe key causes of obesity and its associated diseases were increased consumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor and calorie-rich foods with high levels of sugar and saturated fats combined with reduced physical activity. Unhealthy foods were defined as generally nutrient-poor products that were high in sugar salt or fat which included confectionery; sugary cereals; sugary soft drinks; ice cream; fast food such as hamburgers french fries pizza and fried chicken; processed meat and meat products such as hot dogs and sausages; sauces such as ketchup mayonnaise dips and dressings; and ready-made meals. Despite eating these foods people often remained hungry as unhealthy foods did not possess adequate amounts of amino acids essential fatty acids and antioxidants. In effect consumers needed to consume three slices of bread today in order to gain the same nutrients that one slice of bread provided in the 1950s. The same effect had occurred as a result of simplified soil levels caused by overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides: one now needed to eat three apples to obtain the same amount of complex nutrients that one apple provided in the 1950s. On top of this portion sizes had increased dramatically over the past decades—not because human beings had grown in their need for more calories but because any increase in the portion of food products allowed for higher prices without a corresponding and equivalent increase in the cost to food producers.In response to growing criticism food and beverage industry advocates argued that the power to improve the food available in the marketplace was in the hands of consumers. John Mackey CEO of Whole Foods Market Inc. stated:We love ice cream. We love popcorn. We love French fried potatoes. And the market is providing people what they want. I don’t think there’s an access problem. I think there’s a market demand problem. People have got to become wiser about their food choices. And if people want different foods the market will provide it.However many argued that the prevalence of saturated fats and salty and sugary foods in our diet was not a result of market trends as it was nearly impossible for the average consumer to navigate through the dizzying claims of healthy processed food by marketers. Consumers lacked the time and the resources to conduct the extensive research required to distinguish between what was healthy versus unhealthy resorting instead to cues such as claims found on packaging of added fibre and omega-3 fatty acids or reduced sugar levels.Some of the leading addiction researchers believed that highly processed modern-day foods interacted with the brain in ways similar to drugs of abuse. Mark S. Gold a distinguished professor and chair of psychiatry at University of Florida College of Medicine pioneered the hypothesis of “pathological attachment” which referred to our propensity to become addicted to hedonically appealing foods. Studies involving sugar chocolate and other foods suggested that as was the case with the consumption of drugs continued consumption of these foods caused changes in the frontal part of the brain that governed insight and impulse control. The moment a person put a chocolate-glazed doughnut or other high-sugar high-fat food into their mouth their brain would release opioids giving food its pleasure and making them want to keep eating. The brain also released dopamine the chemical associated with feelings of reward. American pediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig argued that sugar was as addictive as cigarettes and that “sugar switched on the same hormonal pathways as nicotine.”But the addiction to salt sugar and fat was really only part of the story. Consumer taste buds were very fluid meaning that they could be conditioned to expect certain amounts of salt sugar and fat in food which made it extremely difficult to reduce the consumption of these ingredients. In 2011 consumers rejected the low-sodium soup line of Campbell Soup Company (Campbell’s) because of its poor taste. Consumer taste buds had been conditioned to expect certain sodium levels to the point that any small reduction led to a substantial shock to how they defined “good” soup.Critics also claimed that the industrial food complex had reduced the diversity of the foods that farmers grew which arguably caused negative health effects. “As small and mid-size farms got swallowed up by the massive monoculture operations now considered ‘conventional’ the varieties of fruits and vegetables grown on those farms got whittled down to just those few that shipped the best and had the longest shelf life.”Eating a more varied diet was “associated with a higher intake of macro- and micro-nutrients as well as higher nutritional adequacy and diet quality.” In effect dietary diversity scores appeared to have an inverse relationship with obesity suggesting that greater diversity in an individual’s diet reduced the likelihood of obesity and diabetes.Finally many studies had shown that low-income consumers or consumers more severely hit by economic fluctuations such as the one associated with the 2020–21 pandemic were particularly susceptible to relying on less healthy food. Drawing parallels to the economic recession of 2008 strong sales were recorded by such products as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Delissio frozen pizza the processed cheese product Velveeta and nostalgic favourites such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid. Kraft’s net revenues increased by 19.4 per cent between July and late September of 2009. On top of this many people lived in food deserts defined as large geographic locations where healthy food was not accessible to consumers living in that location.Organic Food TrendsThere was no question that consumers and the general public were beginning to catch on to the negative effects of the food and beverage industry. US sales of organic products both food and non-food reached $55.1 billion in 2019 representing a 5 per cent increase from 2018. Worldwide organic food revenue was anticipated to be about $416 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 12.4 per cent each year. Although organic food consumption appeared promising it still represented a tiny portion of total food consumption and not all organic food was considered healthy. It was important to keep in mind that because organic and natural food tended to be more expensive 1 per cent of unhealthy food had many more calories than the same percentage of healthier food meaning that the growth in organic food was likely an exaggerated amount when considering the amount of food consumed as opposed to sales.Corporate Social Responsibility in the Food and Beverage IndustryAmid growing criticism toward the food and beverage industry food companies responded with a seemingly endless set of claims that they were socially responsible: The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz) listed “ongoing improvements to the nutrition of our product portfolio transparent and responsible marketing and communications and alignment with credible science and public health goals” as some of the actions that the company was taking to support its “commitment to people.” Coca-Cola stated “Wherever we can we’re making many of our beverages better and more nutritious by providing vitamins minerals and electrolytes while also introducing more dairy and plant-based beverages.” A similar sentiment was echoed by PepsiCo in the following statement:As consumers increasingly demand more-nutritious food and beverages we continue to add product offerings with positive nutrition like whole grains fruits and vegetables dairy protein and hydration. At the same time we are making many of our products more permissible by reducing added sugars sodium and saturated fat to keep up with evolving consumer tastes and preferences.Consumers undoubtedly had a wider selection of healthier products than they did in the past. Although claims of reductions in calories salt sugar and saturated fat and of increases in protein fibre omega-3 fatty acids vitamins minerals and whole grains were plastered all over food and beverage products many interpreted these claims of social responsibility as “nutriwashing.” Nutriwashing involved the adding and marketing of healthier nutrients such as vitamins minerals and fibre to highly processed food to make the food appear more nutritious to consumers. This resulted in confusing messages about healthy eating.Food and beverage companies had also been criticized for focusing their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts on physical activity. For example since 1985 Gatorade a PepsiCo brand had been recognizing the United States’ most elite high school student athletes through the Play It Forward initiative “that empowers athletes to give back to other athletes to realize their potential through sport.” Kraft Heinz launched Kraft Hockeyville in Canada to help communities across the country refurbish hockey arenas in need of repair. The New York Times reported that Coca-Cola funded an organization to shift public health messaging away from diet and toward exercise. In a paper titled “An Epidemic of Obesity Myths” the former Center for Consumer Freedom (now the Center for Organizational Research and Education) an organization sponsored heavily by the food industry stated that “A hefty number of studies had shown that the trend of rising obesity rates was attributed not to increased intake of food in general (or any particular food) or to the influence of restaurants but rather to less physical activity compounded by a variety of other factors that are constantly being explored.”However research showed that the amount of energy burned through exercise was far less important than the number of calories consumed. “When it comes to reaching a healthy weight what you don’t eat is much much more important [than exercise].” The average American was advised to consume approximately 2250 calories per day (2000 for women and 2500 for men) yet consumed up to 3600 calories per day. Walking for 60 minutes at a very brisk pace expended approximately 210 calories. This meant that the consumer remained as much as 1390 calories above the recommended intake despite the exercise. The integrity of the industry’s CSR initiatives was further weakened in light of the $24.6 million it spent in political lobbying in 2019—a good chunk of which had gone to opposing increased nutritional requirements new labelling information and advertising restrictions. PepsiCo’s lobbying expenses rose to $3.7 million in 2020 from $3.5 million in 2019. According to the New York Times the American Beverage Association a trade association that represented and lobbied on behalf of the non-alcoholic beverage industry raised $6 million from PepsiCo and Coca-Cola to successfully aid in passing legislature in California that prevented any new local beverage or food taxes—including sugar or soda taxes—for 12 years. Between 2011 and 2015 PepsiCo and Coca-Cola “opposed 28 bills and supported one. Among the opposed bills 12 were soda taxes four were Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regulations and one was a limit on soda portion sizes in New York.”When Canadian consumers were consulted about new food labels back in 2013 and 2014 they pushed hard for labels that distinguished between “naturally occurring” sugars and “added” sugars. In response food producers pushed back and convinced regulators that consumers had a “limited understanding” of what added sugar meant and that such labels would have led to market confusion. When a recent study asked three food producers to reveal the difference between natural and added sugar content two dodged the request indicating that they were within legal requirements while the third (Campbell’s) indicated that 11 out of 19 grams of sugar in one of its soups was added sugar. In the United States where making such a distinction between added and natural sugar was law the same Campbell’s product contained an additional three grams of added sugar.Food companies were eager to pre-empt government regulation by self-regulating. A study conducted by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine examined the food industry’s efforts to self-regulate wherein participating companies pledged to limit child-targeted advertising to healthier products in an effort to reduce growing public concern about the linkage between food advertising and childhood obesity. Despite these promises by the food industry the study found that “no significant improvement in the overall nutritional quality of foods marketed to children has been achieved since industry self-regulation was adopted.”Both Kraft and PepsiCo used green symbols on their food packaging to inform customers that products with such symbols were healthier than other products offered by the same company. This green symbol was meant to help consumers identify healthier food. However critics were quick to recall the Smart Choices program where unhealthy foods such as Froot Loops Fudgesicle popsicles and Frosted Flakes were branded with the Smart Choices logo despite their lack of nutritional content. Froot Loops for example was 41 per cent sugar. Similarly Kraft was recently criticized for providing financial support for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in exchange for being able to insert the academy’s Kids Eat Right label on some of its products. Kraft Singles was one such product that had this label despite the fact that Kraft was not legally permitted to call this product cheese and instead had to call it “pasteurized prepared cheese product.” More generally food companies also used pictures of farmers animals vegetables and crops on their packaging to give the false perception of natural and unprocessed despite the fact that many of these products contained ultra-processed foods.CSR at PepsiCoBack in 2006 PepsiCo changed its “Fun for you” slogan to “Better for you” and “Good for you” backed up by a diversification of products including fruit juices nuts and oatmeal. Nooyi the CEO at the time did not see the change in slogan as a trade-off for profits and insisted that both were possible as reflected in her motto “Performance with purpose” which referred to delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and the planet. Since being appointed CEO of PepsiCo Laguarta had taken a similar stance in transforming PepsiCo into a more sustainable company. In 2019 PepsiCo announced eight ambitious goals and commitments that spoke to the sustainability of people in both developed and developing countries (see Exhibit 1). In terms of marketing to children PepsiCo committed to responsible marketing including joining global regional and national pledge programs that ensured “signatories advertise only products that meet specific common nutrition criteria to children under the age of 12.”Like their competitors PepsiCo worked to fortify its processed food with nutrients and to more generally make its unhealthy products less unhealthy; nevertheless it too was criticized for nutriwashing. For instance although PepsiCo’s Quaker Dark Chocolate Chunk Granola Bars were advertised on the package to have “Fiber & Omega-3” the granola bars were full of unhealthy ingredients such as white and brown sugar corn syrup evaporated cane juice hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils caramel colour and sorbitan monostearate. Incidentally the Quaker brand was many argued PepsiCo’s leading health brand.PepsiCo acquired many healthy brands including TrueNorth nut snacks SoBe Lifewater Naked Juice KeVita SodaStream and Bare Snacks and launched its own brands including Imagine Snacks and Bubly. Since 2011 PepsiCo continued to increase its research and development (R&D) budget by 45 per cent to help expand product offerings. In addition PepsiCo launched the Nutrition Greenhouse Accelerator in North America in 2018 to support 10 food and beverage companies that focused on health management personal wellness and encouragement of a healthy diet. Over the course of six months these companies received $20000 and mentorship from PepsiCo with the best company from the cohort receiving a $100000 cash prize at the end of the program.Although PepsiCo devoted immense resources to R&D it was yet to produce products that showed the same level of innovation as those products produced by the companies it tended to acquire. Its in-house progress for the most part represented incremental improvements rather than the courageous radical changes to its operations. Put another way the core of PepsiCo’s business remained the products that had been and continued to be responsible for the aforementioned negative health effects.PepsiCo’s FuturePepsiCo sustained much criticism for its contribution to obesity and disease but it also put forth a number of ambitious policies and implemented innovative changes to its products and operations. Failure to implement such changes would present an immense risk as analysts were increasingly concerned that food companies were going the way of tobacco firms which had been “perennially held responsible by governments for the health problems associated with their products and penalized accordingly.” There was growing belief that it was in PepsiCo’s nature to cause social issues and that any attempt by PepsiCo to act as a force for change would be at odds with the company’s fundamental purpose of profit creation. As explained by the American Journal of Public HealthThe social behavior of many food and beverage corporations is met with skepticism because the paradox of corporations actively marketing and selling products that are harmful to health on the one hand while engaging in health initiatives on the other hand is deemed insurmountable. This leads those critical of the role of corporate actors in the (global) food system to argue that given these efforts “food systems are not driven to deliver optimal human diets but to maximize profits.”Why would PepsiCo want to shift to using ingredients that on the one hand represented higher costs (e.g. organic or natural ingredients) and on the other hand would not exploit consumer vulnerability to saturated fat salt and sugar? Would PepsiCo not lose market share to competitors that did not follow suit? At the extreme should PepsiCo completely disassociate itself from unhealthy ingredients and products? If so when? And could PepsiCo be a first mover strategically thus creating a source of differentiation among the competition? Should the company straddle the market being in both the unhealthy product mix and the healthy product mix by keeping true to higher-margin unhealthy products while introducing new healthier products? Another option would be to use PepsiCo’s marketing and public relations team to exaggerate its efforts despite remaining true to its core unhealthy products. This approach would afford the company constant returns while creating the image that it was changing. To this point perhaps PepsiCo’s marketing team could point the finger of blame away from how many calories people consumed to how few calories they burned. As Nooyi PepsiCo’s CEO at the time said “Why aren’t we going after computer and cable-TV companies for creating a sedentary lifestyle?”There was no denying that PepsiCo Coca-Cola Nestlé and other food and beverage companies had shaped consumer tastes and behaviours over the last few decades. One had to wonder whether it would be in PepsiCo’s best interests to use this same power to shift consumer tastes to a healthier trajectory. Was there a strategic advantage for PepsiCo? Should it collaborate with its peers to lead to a broader industry transformation? Was it possible to use PepsiCo’s expertise in product design packaging manufacturing and distribution to make these new healthier products more enticing? PepsiCo had built its empire on the manufacturing and distribution of instantly recognizable products. Was continuing this trend important in deciding on a future strategy? One thing was for sure doing nothing was not an option. The world was changing and PepsiCo did not want to be left behind.Exhibit 1: PepsiCo Inc.’s COMMITMENTS to NutritionProducts—Reduce Added Sugars Sodium and Saturated FatsReduce added sugars: More than 67% of beverage portfolio volume will have less than 100 calories from added sugars per 12-ounce serving by 2025.Reduce sodium: More than 75% of foods portfolio volume will not exceed 1.3 milligrams of sodium per calorie by 2025.Reduce saturated fats: More than 75% of foods portfolio volume will not exceed 1.1 grams of saturated fat per 100 calories by 2025.Global Labelling PolicyOur products will provide on the side or back of our packaging nutrition information on the amount of energy (as calories kilocalories or kilojoules) protein carbohydrates total sugars total fat saturated fat and sodium per 100-gram or 100-millilitre serving.

A month later The National Institute for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) an Indian government think tank also announced its ambitious target of achieving 100-per-cent electric cars (e-cars) in the county. On September 7 2017 during a meeting with automobile industry representatives transport minister Nitin Gadkari reiterated the government’s stance on clean energy vehicles and said “Petrol and diesel vehicles need to make way for electric powertrains and engines running on other fuel variants such as ethanol and biofuels.” He added “I am going to do it whether you like it or not. I will bulldoze.” Reacting to such a tough statement by the minister chairman of the Indian automaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (Maruti) R.C. Bhargava stated “Customers can’t be forced to buy EVs [electric vehicles].” He went further to say “Before implementing the shift to clean technology the government should try and build consensus among various segments of the auto industry.” Earlier Kenichi Ayukawa Maruti’s managing director and chief executive officer had expressed similar sentiments. Reacting to the Indian government’s ambitious plan of replacing all fossil fuel vehicles with e-cars in the country by 2030 he said “It will be very difficult for the industry to change things from tomorrow. . . . I have never seen that kind of a change in the world.” Questioning the commercial viability of the plan the affordability of e-cars and the availability of appropriate infrastructure he added “There are some difficulties in expanding sales as cost is very high. How will we absorb that kind of thing[?] . . . We have to communicate to the government about [the] industry’s concerns.”Demand and cost conditions for fully electric vehicles were not at all favourable. But the government’s announcement was requiring some rethinking by Maruti on its strategy. Apart from meeting regulatory compliances it had to ponder how to retain its leadership position in the car market. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. (Mahindra) a major force in the automotive segment had already taken the lead in manufacturing e-cars. If Maruti delayed its entry into the e-car market it could lose its lead. However a quick entry could subject the company to uncertainty and risk.Maruti Suzuki: A Leader in the Passenger Car SegmentEstablished in 1982 Maruti was a joint venture between Maruti Udyog Limited India and Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki) Japan. Maruti aimed to make cars available for every individual family need budget and lifestyle.  It believed in consumer satisfaction through continuous innovation in car design and services. The company was also committed to environment protection and took pride in its corporate social responsibility in the areas of village development road safety and skills development.At the time of Maruti’s establishment India produced just 40000 cars per year. By 2017 Maruti alone produced 1.5 million cars every year with 15 models and 150 variants. Maruti’s models were designed with superior specifications which resulted in high resale value and less service requirement for the models. Maruti cars also provided more mileage with less fuel consumption and lower carbon dioxide emissions. Maruti cars not only excelled in performance efficiency and environment-friendliness they were also cost efficient. Maruti manufactured affordable cars for the vast middle-class Indian population. Economies of scale provided the cost leadership the company needed. Maruti cars ranged from ₹266000 to ₹861000. Because of their small size and durability Maruti cars were suitable for Indian road conditions (see Exhibit 1). Along with these advantages good mileage and a nationwide service network that spanned over 1500 cities and towns made these cars immensely popular. With more than 40-per-cent market share (see Exhibit 2) Maruti was a distinct market leader in India’s automotive passenger vehicle segment. In 2015 Maruti was ranked number one in customer satisfaction for the 16th time in a row in a JD Power Satisfaction Index Study.Mahindra and Mahindra to Head Electric vehicles RaceEmerging as a distinct entity in 1947 (after the partition of the country) Mahindra aspired to become one of the world’s 50 most admired global brands by 2021. It wanted to acquire leadership through products that were technologically superior innovative and differentiated as well as through global expansion. Famous for its rugged and reliable automobiles Mahindra was a federation of companies divided into 11 sectors ranging from automobiles to real estate. It was India’s largest utility vehicle manufacturer. It also had a leadership position in the several other businesses in which it operated. Mahindra forayed into the electric vehicle business in 2010 when it bought the Bengaluru-based e-car manufacturing unit—Reva Electric Car Company. By May 2017 Mahindra had invested around ₹6 billion in the development and sale of electric vehicles. But demand was not catching up with production. Mahindra expected great potential for such vehicles despite the low demand. It also believed that such potential in a highly price-sensitive market could be reaped only by cost-cutting measures and reducing the entry price.Mahindra manufactured e-cars in its Nasik and Chakan factories in the state of Maharashtra. The e-cars it manufactured could reach a speed of 85 kilometres (km) per hour and run for 140 km on a fully charged battery. Batteries were essential for the production of e-cars and other vehicles. Mahindra imported battery cells and assembled them in battery packs at a facility in Bangalore in Karnataka state. The facility had a capacity of around 400–500 units per month. Expecting a steep rise in demand and reducing costs through large production Mahindra was stepping up its investment in electric battery packs. It planned to increase the production of battery packs at the Bangalore facility to 1000 per month. In its eagerness to win the e-car race Mahindra also planned to set up a new battery pack facility at Chakan with a planned capacity of 5000 per month. Mahindra expected that with such initiatives the cost of batteries would decrease by two-thirds of its prevalent cost. With a reduction in the cost of batteries and other motor components Mahindra expected the cost of car manufacturing to drop by 20 per cent. It was also simultaneously working on new technologies that would enable it to manufacture vehicles that could reach a maximum speed of 200 km per hour and cover a distance of 350–400 km on a single charge.Besides the internal cost-cutting measures Mahindra was relying on the government’s production subsidy for electric vehicles to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Although Mahindra was hopeful about the success of its cost-cutting measures and increasing demand it was looking for consistency in government policies. Pawan Goenka the managing director of Mahindra emphasized the need for consistent policies: “The only plea we have is for the government to be consistent with the subsidies they are giving. The responsibility of cutting costs thereon lies on the OEMs. However you can’t expect a return in the next two–three years; will have to look at the long-term returns.”Like the Indian government Mahindra saw a great future for e-cars. Therefore Mahindra’s chairman welcomed and expressed his support of the ambitious plan of the government to shift to e-cars by 2030: “It could happen earlier too considering the sort of disruption that is happening. . . . Sometimes it’s better not to question the practicality of it. This is a desirable and feasible goal for India. The spectre of 1.2 billion people having their own [fossil fuel powered] cars is a nightmare.”Electric Cars: Global ScenarioPollution control and environmental sustainability were global concerns. Replacing cars powered by fossil fuels with e-cars was one way to address this concern. Therefore many countries had set targets to replace petrol and diesel cars with e-cars. Norway aimed to achieve a target of 100-per-cent e-cars by 2025. Germany wanted to achieve this target by 2030 and the United Kingdom aimed at achieving the target by 2040. To achieve their targets these countries had been giving incentives in the form of tax deductions or other subsidies to consumers producers and supporting infrastructure providers (see Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4).Boosted by the research and development (R&D) efforts of many governments and private sector firms all over the world new competitive e-car models had started appearing in the market by 2010 when Nissan  Motor Co. Ltd. (Nissan) launched the world’s first 100-per-cent zero-emission e-car. Nissan’s Leaf was released for mass market distribution in Japan and the United States. With a price of US$32780 the 2010 Nissan Leaf could travel up to160 km on a fully charged battery. Over the years its mileage continued to improve and in early September 2017 Nissan announced the launch of its 2018 Leaf model with a 40 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack and a driving range of 240 km on a single charge for the base price of US$30875. The next year’s model the 2019 Nissan Leaf was expected to have a 60-kWh capacity and a driving range of 360 km. Since the launch of the Leaf in 2010 Nissan had been able to sell around 280000 units making it the world’s bestselling e-car.In the e-car segment a close competitor of Nissan was Tesla Inc. (Tesla). Tesla introduced the Roadster its first electric sports car in 2008. Although it had plenty of speed the Roadster was expensive at US$109000 which kept it out of the general consumer’s reach. However in 2011 Tesla launched the 7-seater Model S sedan with a range of up to 260 km and a price of US$57400. The intermediate model had a range of 370 km and the premium model offered a range of 480 km per charge. Although it became a commercially viable vehicle for Tesla it was an expensive vehicle for the general consumer. Tesla further expanded its product range by introducing the Model X a sport utility vehicle in September 2015. In July 2017 it also added to its product range the Model 3 a lower priced high volume e-car. The base price for the Model 3 was US$35000 with battery pack of 50 kWh and a range of 350 km. The Model 3 was also available with a battery pack of 70 kWh and a range of 500 km for the price of US$44000.Other major global auto players had also launched their own e-car variants. Some well-known models were BMW’s i3 Renault’s 20e Volkswagen AG (Volkswagen)’s e-Golf Hyundai Motor Company (Hyundai)’s IONIQ and others. However of the 1 billion cars on the world’s roads only 2 million were electric. General awareness about e-cars was relatively low not only in developing countries like India but also in developed countries like the United Kingdom. Sander van der Veen the U.K. manager of the electric charging organization NewMotion commented on the general lack of awareness: “At the moment general consumer awareness of EVs is pretty low in the UK. . . . It’s the responsibility of governments car manufacturers and companies like NewMotion who support the charging infrastructure to help raise awareness and educate the next generation of car users.” Electric vehicles were not yet a success anywhere in the world but growth prospects looked positive. There was impressive growth in e-car sales in 2016 when around 750000 new e-cars were sold raising the total number of e-cars on the road to over 2 million compared to 1 million in 2015. With a 29-per-cent market share Norway led in the sale of e-cars globally. It was followed by the Netherlands and Sweden with market shares of 6.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively. Other leading countries in e-car sales were China France and the United Kingdom with market shares of close to 1.5 per cent each. Until 2015 the United States had accounted for the largest market for e-car sales. However in 2016 China surpassed the United States accounting for more than 40 per cent of all e-cars which was double the amount of e-cars in the United States.Along with the growth in e-car sales there was improvement in the charging infrastructure but the number of e-cars in circulation was still far below the optimum scale for production. It was expected that with the achievement of economies of scale the price of e-cars would decline substantially making them more affordable to everyday buyers. According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and by the International Energy Agency mass production would lead to a rapid decline in the cost of manufacturing and would increase energy density. The existing status of R&D confirmed continuous improvement in the cost of e-cars to narrow the gap between the cost competiveness of e-cars and conventional vehicles. The report forecasted that e-car stock would range between 9 and 20 million by 2020 and between 40 and 70 million by 2025. The information was based on targets set by different countries announcements made by OEMs and projected e-car sales. However the report also cautioned that much would depend on government policy the business environment the supporting ecosystem public procurement policies the speed of R&D in innovative technologies and financial incentives among other factors. Favourable changes would facilitate early adoption of e-cars. Other studies including one by Stanford University were also positive about the future of e-cars. That study predicted that by 2030 the demand for fossil fuel vehicles would completely wane which would have a major impact on their cost the quality of service and convenience of use.Elecric Car Scenario in IndiaIn 2016 three different types of cars were operating in India: conventional fossil fuel cars hybrid cars and fully electric vehicles (see Exhibit 5). The annual Indian car market size was around 2.5 million passenger cars but the market for e-cars and other electric vehicles was very limited. The 5000 e-cars on Indian roads accounted for less than 1 per cent of total car sales in the country. Mahindra was the only company in the country manufacturing e-cars: the e2o Plus and the eVerito. The price of Mahindra’s e2o Plus ranged between ₹757000 and ₹1.127 million whereas the price of the eVerito ranged between ₹950000 and ₹1 million. Tata Motors Limited (Tata) another major Indian car manufacturer was in the process of launching e-cars and had already proposed the concept of the Tiago EV and the electric Nano. Although Mahindra was the only automaker in the passenger e-car segment there were many other companies active in the commercial vehicle market. For example Mahindra offered two electric commercial vehicles the e-Supro passenger and cargo van and the e-Alfa mini rickshaw; Tata offered the e-Starbus; and Ashok Leyland another automobile company offered the circuit series of electric buses.Many multinational automakers such as Nissan and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) also had advanced technology in this sphere but their products were expensive. Mahindra had an advantage by being the first mover in the challenging Indian market. Constrains in Boosting Demand An average fully charged e-car battery gave impressive mileage at approximately 140 km but the cost was very high. Battery cost accounted for around one-third of the total manufacturing cost of e-cars and most Indian consumers could not afford expensive cars. India was also largely dependent on imported batteries due to its insignificant deposits of lithium a key raw material used in most electric batteries. However efforts were under way globally to manufacture electric batteries using alternative materials such as aluminum which was not only cheaper but also safer than lithium and required less charging time. India had large deposits of the aluminum ore bauxite which implied that the cost of batteries was expected to improve in India’s future. Aluminum batteries however had a relatively short shelf life. Also its advantages which had only been proven in laboratory settings thus far had yet to be seen in real-world settings.Limited battery charging infrastructure was another major constraint for e-cars. Mumbai and Nagpur were two of the few cities that had battery charging stations. Otherwise India’s infrastructure for chargers was weak. Some e-cars such as Mahindra’s e2o Plus could be charged at home using a 15-ampere charging socket which took eight or nine hours although faster charging options existed that reduced charging time to one and a half hours. To make matters worse the country had frequent breakdowns in its electricity supply. The lack of a commercial charging network long charging times and an inconsistent electricity supply constrained the demand for passenger and commercial electric vehicles in the country.Automobile Policy in IndiaThe automotive industry accounted for 7.1 per cent of India’s gross domestic product and employed around 32 million people directly and indirectly. This industry was a major consumer of crude oil but with its poor oil reserves India depended mainly on imported oil. Its high import bill was one reason for the country’s bourgeoning trade deficit. A significant movement toward e-cars along with a shift toward green energy sources would not only help the country control pollution levels but also generate significant savings in oil import (see Exhibit 6). An additional benefit of electric vehicles was that they were more energy efficient. Emphasizing India’s reasons for leading the e-car revolution Ashok Jhunjhunwala the principal advisor to the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy noted that with battery prices falling electric vehicles would be most sought after in the next five to six years. He then warned that if India waited until that time it would end up importing electric vehicles instead of oil.To lead the electric vehicle revolution the government came up with several initiatives. In 2013 the Government of India launched the National Electric Mobility Plan 2020 with the objective of achieving national fuel security by promoting hybrid and electric vehicles. To achieve its objective the government launched another program in 2015—the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles commonly referred to as the FAME scheme (see Exhibit 7). Also in 2015 to further promote the adoption of electric vehicles the National Green Tribunal banned the registration of new diesel vehicles in India’s capital city Delhi. The roll out of a new indirect tax reform in the form of the Goods and Services Tax in July 2017 was expected to reduce the tax burden on passenger vehicles although the government nullified this benefit by raising taxes on premium cars. Political leaders belonging to the incumbent government passed on any anti-fossil-fuel declaration. The government was providing consumer subsidies for e-cars but fiscal imbalance was casting doubts on their sustainability. Besides the country did not yet have an electric vehicle policy so car manufacturers were not sure whether the benefits would continue for e-cars. Unlike the governments of many other countries which promoted electric vehicles the Indian government had no provision for a tax incentives for electric car owners. India had also made substantial investments in oil refineries. Therefore car manufactures the public and analysts all feared that the government could succumb to its large fiscal deficit and pressure from oil companies and fail to reach its self-imposed deadlines. Given the uncertain environment many well-known global car brands in India including Hyundai Honda Motor Company Inc. Toyota and Mercedes-Benz were finding it difficult to convince their parent companies to direct investments toward the Indian market. Investment in E-Cars and Components in India by Multinational CompaniesSuzuki indicated its intention to set up a joint venture with Toshiba Corporation and Denso Corporation with an investment of ₹12 billion million in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. It aimed to use these locally manufactured batteries in domestically-developed hybrid and fully electric vehicles by 2020. Nissan was also exploring the demand for its e-car the Nissan Leaf within the government and in private-sector firms. It was also interested to learn if the car could be assembled in India to meet local conditions and whether parts could be manufactured in the country itself. Tata had signed an agreement with Volkswagen Europe’s largest automaker to develop components and new vehicles. Tesla the U.S. electric vehicle maker was planning to set up a factory in India to cater to local demand for e-cars but it was looking for a waiver on restrictions to import its high end e-cars until its factory was built in the country. Although many foreign companies had shown interest in investing in the production of e-cars and components in India they appeared to be waiting for more clarity on the evolving economic environment before venturing into the country.Shifting from Fossil Fuel Cars to E-CarsMahindra which had already launched two models of e-cars was intending to electrify its range of vehicles. Analysts were expecting that it would come up with a series of fully electric extra utility vehicles (so-called XUVs). Other car manufacturers were also preparing their e-car platforms. These manufacturers had already indicated their intention to launch e-cars by 2020. Audi India for example was ready to launch e-cars by 2020 while Hyundai which had originally planned to launch a hybrid car had shelved its hybrid plans and was shifting its focus to an e-car. Maruti wondered if it should wait for the uncertainty to clear and watch other car manufacturers experiment with their e-car models thus taking a second-mover advantage. Or maybe it should expedite the process of building e-cars and keep its leadership position intact. What was at stake for Maruti if it delayed its move to e-cars for few years? Investment costs were very high but leadership was also important. If it opted for entry in the e-car segment what would be its best entry mode to effectively manage the competition in the crowded market? The stakes were very high and depended greatly on the consistency of government policies.Exhibit 1: Indian Road Condition and Driving HabitsMost Indian roads are narrow and congested. Potholes are common sights on these roads. Encroachments on footpaths force pedestrians to walk on roads. Either Indian laws do not meet global safety standards pertaining to drink driving helmets and child restraints or there is lack of enforcement of these laws. These conditions lead to chaos on Indian roads.A survey conducted by the Ford Motor Company indicated that 49 per cent of respondents in India spend more than 100 minutes every day driving their cars. More than one-fourth of the respondents also admitted to excessive use of mobile devices while driving for taking selfies text messaging or accessing emails and various social media sites. About 56 per cent of them admitted to speaking over their mobile devices while driving. Around 55 per cent also changed controls on the music system while driving.Source: Prepared by the author with information from Dinu Hazrat “70% of Indian Drivers Have Unsafe Driving Habits Says Ford Survey” DNA accessed March 25 2018 www.dnaindia.com/business/report-70-of-indian-drivers-have-unsafe-driving-habits-says-ford-survey-1908875; Dipak K.

EXHIBIT 5: Comparison of Conventional Cars Electric Cars and Hybrid CarsConventional CarsConventional cars had internal combustion engines which ran on fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel. The engines were operated by burning the fuel. The heat generated from combustion caused expansion of gases which pushed the pistons that turned the wheels. However the combustion or burning of fuel emitted carbon dioxide and other harmful gases which contributed to air pollution and global warming.Electric CarsElectric cars did not have internal combustion engines. These vehicles had electric motors which were run using the energy stored in batteries. The energy stored in batteries was released electrochemically. In such a process there was no burning of fuel and hence no emission of any kind making such cars pollution-free.There were other important differences between the two types of cars. Around 70 per cent of components of e-cars were different from conventional cars. The two types of cars also differed in terms of number of moving parts. Electric motors had just one moving part whereas conventional cars had more than 100 moving parts. Because of their having fewer moving parts electric cars required less maintenance which lowered maintenance costs. Less maintenance also made these cars more reliable.In addition to lower maintenance costs these cars were also more fuel cost efficient. According to one estimate electric cars could travel approximately 70 kilometres for US$1 which was more than twice the efficiency of a conventional or gasoline car.However despite their low running and maintenance costs electric cars had not yet gained popularity. They were expensive with the major cost being the battery which accounted for approximately one-third of the total manufacturing cost. Another constraint was the limited range per single charge of the battery. Most batteries had a range of 160–240 kilometres. Besides the batteries having a limited battery life which necessitated periodic replacement there was also a need for widespread recharging infrastructure with 24-hour electric power and stable voltage and current. Skilled technicians were also required for the servicing and maintenance of electric cars.Hybrid CarsHybrid cars were a combination of traditional fossil fuel powered cars and electric cars that comprised two engines—a combustion engine and an electric motor. Combustion engines in these cars were run by burning petrol or other fossil fuels whereas their electric motors used stored energy from an electric battery that could be charged when the car was run on fossil fuel. Hybrid cars had low emissions compared to conventional cars and they could provide a smooth ride.Source: Created by authors with information from “How Do Gasoline & Electric Vehicles Compare” Idaho National Laboratory accessed October 2 2017 https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/compare.pdf; John Farrell Electric Vehicles Report: Part 1 — Electric Vehicles Are Going Mainstream Clean Technica October 2 2017 accessed December 13 2017 https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/02/electric-vehicles-report-part-1-electric-vehicles-going-mainstream/; Adam Vaughan “Electric Cars: Everything You Need to Know” The Guardian July 26 2017 accessed November 6 2017 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/26/electric-cars-everything-you-need-to-know.Exhibit 6: India’s Targeted Energy Capacity Mix (in Gigawatts)Source: Compiled by the authors with information from “In 10 Years Renewal Sources Will Dominate Half of India’s Energy Capacity” Business Standard April 19 2017 accessed March 23 2018 www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/in-10-yrs-renewable-sources-will-dominate-half-of-india-s-energy-capacity-117041900200_1.html.Exhibit 7: FAME India Scheme 2015Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1 = ₹64.8 on April 30 2017; IEC = Source: National Automotive Board FAME—India [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India] Government of India Ministry of Heavy Industry & Public Enterprises April 27 2015 accessed March 22 2018 http://dhi.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/Fame_India_Revised_270415.pdf. endnotes",0,,,,

The home was a residential child-services facility that was more than 100 years old with a gross income of about US$10 million per year. Although many operational and strategic challenges lay before her Williams commented on what she saw as an immediate priority—doing something about the low morale. She noted “One of my concerns here is morale. Our house parents work seven days on and seven off in a stressful environment. They only make about $22000 each per year [plus housing food and benefits].”The house parents were the heart of the organization—the tangible expression of its mission. Therefore Williams wanted to gain a deep understanding of the cause of the low morale so that she could formulate a recovery strategy. Morale was infectious and Williams recognized that downward-spiralling morale could affect the children and even compromise the firm’s core mission. She suspected that lagging morale among house parents contributed to high employee turnover which in turn disrupted the sense of security and continuity that was critical to providing a healthy home environment to children whose lives had seen too much disruption already.Williams initiated an engagement with a team of organizational consultants. Her charge was simple: “I want a deep understanding of what drives morale and what we can do to make CCHF a more satisfying place to work.” The team conducted extensive interviews made observations and theorized about the causes of low morale at CCHF (see Exhibit 1). With the issues that emerged from the data Williams hoped to identify the root causes of ebbing morale and then craft corresponding remedies to ensure the continued success of CCHF. Williams’s objective was to identify five to ten themes relating to poor morale and propose solutions to address each theme. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CCHFCCHF was established as the Florida Christian Orphanage in 1908 in Bunnell Florida a small town about 20 miles (30 kilometres) northwest of Daytona Beach. Its purpose expressed in its charter was “by the help of God and the co-operation of all good people to found a noble Christian institution for the relief education and training of destitute fatherless and motherless children who may look to us for help.” Though the scope of the mission evolved in the 1930s to recognize “functional orphans”—children who were abused abandoned or neglected—the mission had remained largely the same for more than a century.By the mid-1950s the home began to migrate from dormitory-style facilities to cottage-style accommodations with house parents who were attuned to the psychological and developmental needs of the children. In 2013 the facility had 13 cottages each supervised by dedicated house parents (a husband and wife team) and a trained therapist.In addition to the residential cottages CCHF expanded in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s to include a gymnasium an Olympic-sized pool a day-care facility a chapel a counselling centre and a school building on its 40-acre (16-hectare) site. In 2012 CCHF launched its most ambitious expansion ever with the development of its 300-acre (120-hectare) Jackson Youth Ranch on donated land about 100 miles (160 kilometres) away from its existing campus. The ranch would have most of the same services facilities and commitments as the Bunnell facility. When fully built out—a function of capital funding and additional staffing—the facility would accommodate 200 to 300 children. The Bunnell home served about 100 residential students in 12 cottages. Sixteen more students were housed in the first two residential cottages at the Jackson Youth Ranch. OPERATIONSAt the heart of CCHF’s operations was the Residential Facilities Program (RFP) and at the heart of the RFP was the effectiveness of the house parents and residential therapists. The job of the house parent was particularly demanding and stressful partly because of the “24-7” relentlessness of the job and partially because house parents bore the burden of having overall responsibility for the welfare of eight to 10 children—typically teenagers some of whom were not socially well-adjusted. House parents worked seven days on followed by seven days off. During their “off” week they lived in separate housing on the campus away from the residential cottages. Nevertheless it would be easy for the house parents to feel as though they had no home at all as they shuttled between two homes that were occupied by others on alternating weeks.The house parents’ day began early and ended late. They were responsible for making breakfast and ensuring that their children were dressed and ready for school. For house parents with younger children (aged 6 to 8) this part of the day could be especially challenging. If one child was sick or uncooperative one of the house parents would likely have to attend to that child leaving the other parent to manage the other eight or nine children. The parents were also responsible for transporting the children to school and to extracurricular activities. The younger children generally attended the on-site elementary school. Middle schoolers and high schoolers travelled to local public schools. On top of that house parents took the children to medical appointments counselling sessions and other health-related appointments. Late afternoons and evenings were filled with preparing dinner overseeing homework dealing with disciplinary issues showing care and affection and ensuring that everyone was bathed and ready for the next day. If the unexpected occurred—a child that needed special medical attention a sick house parent or a car that needed servicing—the day could become especially challenging. Beyond all this house parents had their own marriage to manage which sometimes included their own children. All house parents were married and served with their spouses. Daniel Fontaine the chief financial officer (CFO) had observed that the turnover rate at CCHF was above the industry average—something that concerned him as they pressed forward with operational expansion at the Jackson Youth Ranch. The cottages could be divided into three types. Most were categorized as residential group care. However two cottages were designated as emergency shelters and one was designated as a specialized therapeutic group home for children with more severe psycho-emotional challenges.In addition to the residential cottages the campus also included apartments where cottage “graduates” could move once they turned 18 and graduated from high school provided that they were working or continuing their education full time. The purpose of these apartments was to provide a supportive environment that allowed more freedoms than the residential cottages but still offered a measure of accountability with respect to personal finances and constructive behaviour. CCHF also offered training for prospective foster care parents and provided family and psychological testing and counselling services primarily for children and their parents associated with the foster care program. Lastly CCHF ran a well-regarded day-care centre that served about 100 children from the Bunnell area. Volunteers had been an important part of CCHF’s culture. In addition to local volunteers CCHF had a small campground that attracted volunteers from all over the country especially in the winter to perform a variety of tasks not directly involving the clients. CULTUREFrom its founding CCHF had cultivated a culture of caring (“serving”). At the staffing level it was critical that employees had a sense of caring—of being God’s hands and feet—to the displaced children. The term “mission” was frequently used to describe why people chose to work there. Indeed to become de facto parents to at-risk youth required a large measure of both caring and self-sacrifice. Charles Richardson the vice-president of development said that donors tended to give because of their Christian commitments to serve the disenfranchised also frequently using the language of mission or calling to describe their motives (see Exhibit 2). Prominent in historical Christian ethics was the importance of serving the disenfranchised and outcasts—behaviours that were frequently reported of Jesus Christianity’s founder in the ancient Christian scriptures.Important aspects of the CCHF culture could also be seen in the most recent strategic planning document (see Exhibit 3). Fontaine commented that CCHF had been off-budget in recent years and that the home was considering starting a for-profit thrift store to help bridge persistent gaps in its operating budget. Of particular concern was the 35 per cent miss on contributions from individuals. Fontaine was concerned that this reflected a general decline in church membership in the denomination with which the home was associated—a trend that had persisted for several years. On the bright side fee-for-service funding now constituted almost half of the revenues and continued to hit budget expectations. The largest portion of fee-for-service funding came from the state government which provided a stipend for each child placed in the home by the state.Rapid institutional expansion had posed challenges to CCHF’s culture of caring. The former CEO had placed a high priority on expanding services. With operations now on two campuses and having grown well-beyond residential care of children senior management had been occupied with the growth and the delivery of these ancillary services. Upon assuming her role as CEO Williams was quick to circulate among the line employees as well as her staff in an effort to listen and show concern. The high turnover rate coupled with anecdotal evidence collected by Williams convinced her that the morale issue threatened the home’s core values (see Exhibit 3) and potentially its ability to operate effectively. Would further expansion such as launching a for-profit store amplify this potential cultural fracturing or might it be able to somehow mitigate the disenfranchisement that seemed to be intruding into the culture?In the centre of the campus was a small pond with a bridge across it named the “Bridge of Hope.” It was a cultural artefact that spoke clearly of the mission of CCHF—to bridge a troubled past to a productive future through a loving community. The atmosphere on the campus bespoke of order; the campus was well-groomed. Fontaine and Richardson comported themselves with an earnest demeanour suggesting that their work was more than just a job. Professionally dressed but not stylish they reflected appropriate solidarity with the clients they served.SETTING HER AGENDAAfter reflecting on the summary of the consultants’ research (see below) Williams would need to derive the causes of declining morale and propose steps to reverse the trend. This was not about making everyone happy; it was about ensuring that CCHF’s historical value commitments were integrated into the employee experience. Only in that way could the commitment to be a caring community to parentless children be truly realized. Selected observations from consultantsAlthough there were arguments on a weekly basis the female children were generally perceived as well-behaved but this was because they were older and in their mid to late teens. In general the fewer children in a house the greater the opportunity for connection with the house parents and subsequently less incidence of poor behaviour. The importance of connection was stressed as one parent noted: There are times when we have fun and joke and laugh and play around—things a normal family would do. They respond better to that when you do have to give them instructions or correct negative behaviour because they don’t just see you as that person who is always trying to change them but they see you as a person who really cares about them.Given that the typical length of stay for a child at CCHF was 18 months the opportunities to create connection were vital. With regard to interactions between sets of house parents the couples were civil but not well connected to each another. Couples typically only met with one another at formal meetings for an hour once a week. The consultants found that some house parents expressly did not like other house parents and that methods of discipline and creating rules differed between couples. This was of note because the less consistent the house parents were across units the more volatile a house could become because the children’s expectations could not be maintained. Some house parents expressed frustration with the lack of consistency they were able to provide. One source of stress for house parents was the inherent challenges of caring for children who may not easily come to trust the house parents or express overt appreciation for their efforts. While children who were actively being cared for did not often express appreciation it was mentioned that some previous residents returned to visit and that this was when appreciation was expressed. House parents revealed that time spent connecting with children (e.g. talking with children about their goals plans and backgrounds) facilitated the development of good relationships but that there was only really time for this after all of the housework was done and the requisite paperwork completed. The house parents also noted that connecting with the children was the most meaningful part of their jobs and they thought that measures should be taken to allow them to spend more time doing this with the children. The amount of regulated paperwork required in the houses was seen as a barrier to achieving this goal as well as a source of frustration. Additionally repetitive training modules on safety security and procedures were also viewed as burdensome.Given that house parents worked in teams of married couples the stress of the position put notable stress on their marriages but some also felt it had strengthened their relationships. However some house parents ended up divorced. At the time of the inquiry the house parent supervisor was new; he was also the children’s therapist. This was regarded as a possible conflict of interest that could affect both how the supervisor could act as a therapist to the children when the acting parent figures were his employees and also how the supervisor could act as a manager when the children were his patients. House parents expressed a desire to see improvements made in management. They viewed the new CEO and the intention to improve culture as a positive step but noted that many of the important administrative positions were filled with the same employees who had been at CCHF for years and did not seem to be interested in changing. House parents also reported feeling that there was a lack of support and that they were under-appreciated by management. Overall of those interviewed the house parents were optimistic about the new CEO but continued to express a desire for changes to those in administrative positions. It was of note that during the consultation the house parents revealed that there was no formal system in place for matching children housed at CCHF with house parents and that the implementation of some such system was something that they would like to see to better match personalities between children and house parents. House parents also expressed a desire for more assistants. Such personnel were very helpful when a house parent needed to devote more attention to a specific child in the house (such as taking that child to a doctor’s appointment or after school program). With an assistant available the house parents could do what needed to be done and rest assured that the other children were still cared for. One house couple was asked to describe their typical day. The consult noted the following comments: Male spoke and mentioned that Female starts her day at 5 to 5:30 a.m. She gets up and gets ready and gets the girls’ medications ready. The girls are up at about 6 a.m. to get ready for school. Male and Female then administer the girls’ medications and the girls do their morning chores (clean bedrooms etc.). Male and Female have breakfast for the girls; the girls clean up their mess and Male and Female supervise to make sure they clean everything up. They take the girls to school and usually get back around 7:30 a.m. and check their e-mail and do paperwork. Two days a week they have to pick up groceries and they have to go to a training session one day a week that is about two hours long. Male said that on Monday they have about an hour of extra time and usually try to do some extra work before they go pick up the girls at around 2:30 p.m. Male and Female usually try to prepare dinner around 1:30 to 2:00 since most of them [the older girls] work right after school and need to be transported. Also any medical appointments usually are scheduled for the afternoon as are tutoring sessions and organizational meetings (e.g. Girl Scouts). One day a week Male and Female go into the community to take the girls out (e.g. to shopping or parks). Male said that they pretty much are on the go running the girls to places until about 7:30 p.m. The girls who work usually work until 9:00 p.m. at which time the house parents must pick them up. The girls are also responsible for their nightly chores be it vacuuming cleaning the kitchen etc. so Male and Female supervise that as well. Male mentioned that they work with the girls hand-in-hand to make sure the house is in good shape. Usually around 10:30 everyone is home and in bed.Feeling that they made a difference in the lives of the children was important to the house parents. One couple was asked how long they intended to stay at CCHF and they responded that their original goal had been five years—which they were already halfway through—but that they would consider staying longer if they had a positive effect on the children and if morale were improved. Regarding job satisfaction under the new CEO one husband said “This week I’d probably give myself a 7 or 8.” He mentioned that if he had been asked this question a month prior he “would have said a 2 or 3 but now it’s a 7 or 8” because of the improvements they had seen and what they also hoped to see. The wife said that the new administration really wanted to hear what the house parents had to say whether positive or negative so they felt like they were being listened to and supported. Talks with two former residents at CCHF revealed that the general model for creating a family atmosphere (e.g. siblings life skills encouragement chores and punishment) was generally successful. With regard to house parent turnover the former residents noted that the restrictions placed on house parents such as parents not being able to help children financially may have been a contributing factor. They also noted that male parents were not allowed to be alone with the children or to have physical contact with them consequently “appropriate touch” was missing from their lives while in residence at CCHF. This was seen as especially important for the younger children. Female house parents were permitted to be alone with children but because her male partner could not the female parent had little or no time to herself. The issue of low pay was seen by the former resident as a factor in turnover as well. It was enough of an issue that they were aware of their house parents’ dissatisfaction while they were at CCHF. Echoing statements made by the house parents who were interviewed both former residents mentioned that a lack of support (such as from an assistant) seemed to increase stress levels for the house parents. The consultant opined that low pay was probably less of an issue for turnover than the restrictions in the houses. Not all house parents interviewed were unsatisfied. One couple who had previously been foster parents expressed an appreciation for the support provided at CCHF but noted that the management of boys particularly those with behaviour issues was the primary disrupting factor in the homes and that one solution to turnover and stress might be for CCHF to take in fewer “angry and abusive kids.” What to doAfter reviewing the consultant’s notes Williams had to decide how best to proceed. How could she use the information garnered from the reports to help reach her goal of establishing positive morale at CCHF? What recommendations should she make to improve morale?  EXHIBIT 1: A PRIMER ON QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGYThe term “qualitative methodology” covers an array of overlapping techniques and methods in pursuit of differing goals. This research employs a method known as grounded theory (GT) which simply stated seeks to theorize about a particular phenomenon (in this case low morale) in a particular context (the Christian Children’s Home of Florida in the fall of 2013). Crucial to good GT is understanding the phenomenon from the perspective of the participants. For this reason researchers tend to initiate conversation with observations and broad open-ended questions. GT further employs an iterative approach to hypothesizing and data collection. As additional data are gathered hypotheses are revised to reflect the ongoing process of synthesis. It is common to get disparate data. Different members of the organization may have different perspectives on either the causes effects or cures of the morale problem.The primary data forms in GT are field notes—a compendium of observations interviews and preliminary hypotheses or reflections. Field notes are then categorized using a technique known as axial coding which seeks to identify themes that emerge from the data and particular contexts that might account for apparently conflicting responses or interpretations. Data saturation occurs when additional data seems to offer no new insights into the phenomenon. Researchers must be careful about generalizing GT findings to other contexts. Researchers are split about whether GT should be used to support recommendations. The purists suggest that understanding the phenomenon is the end of GT while the pragmatists are quick to insist that a thorough understanding can support constructive action.Source: Barney Glaser and Anselm StraussEXHIBIT 2: MISSION of Christian Children’s Home of FloridaTo empower children and families to experience God’s love and care as revealed in the ministry of Jesus Christ.VISIONTo be a place where children are safe and loved; where youth are given the opportunity to be healthy self-sufficient adults; where families become strong; and where every person is treated as a unique creation of God.CORE VALUESDevelopment of spirit mind character and body within a Christian contextHolistic family-based services within a culture of safety and excellence Lifetime commitment to practicing integrity generosity and service to others Interdependent relationships fostering self-sufficiency Celebrating and encouraging diversity inclusiveness and unconditional love The importance of the connectional relationships with clergy and members of congregations the Florida Conference and our generous donors Visionary innovative effective leadership and management Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 3: STRATEGIC PLANNING PRIORITIESPriority One: Serving More Children and Families in More Ways and in More PlacesImplications: The establishment of satellite offices will result in the decentralization of some services currently provided on the main campus in Enterprise.

Despite having undergone multiple corporate ownership transitions—from its founding as a subsidiary of Nokia in 1998 to its acquisition by a Swedish private equity firm EQT in 2012 and its subsequent sale to Godin Holdings in 2015—Vertu had established a uniquely recognizable positioning in the luxury phone handset niche. Vertu phones which were best described as phones for people who did not need phones were differentiated by their bejewelled embellishments and a worldwide concierge service available at the touch of a button. Vertu’s appeal—the ostentatious display of wealth—was sought after by ultra-high net worth (UHNW) individuals as the luxury phones were instantly recognizable status symbols akin to luxury watches. In the early 2000s the introduction of luxury-priced full-featured iPhones; the decline of conspicuous consumption among UHNW individuals after the financial crisis; and the anti-corruption movement in Asia had rendered Vertu’s business model unsustainable. Or was it? Uzan faced a critical decision in July 2017 upon the liquidation of Vertu—sell or license the remaining brand assets to a luxury brand owner or retrench in China to focus on existing customers without taking the ethical and reputational implications of the brand in the rest of the world into consideration.THE LUXURY MOBILE PHONE MARKET CREATED BY VERTU“Extraordinary phones for extraordinary people” was Vertu’s tagline to promote its range of high-priced handsets aimed at wealthy and prestigious customers. In 2000 Nokia the Finnish company that dominated the mobile phone market at the time created Vertu as a wholly owned subsidiary. The name Vertu was derived from an 18th-century word meaning “an item created from precious materials often for a practical purpose.” Vertu launched its first “extraordinary” product the Signature at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris on January 21 2002. Embedded with nearly five carats of ruby bearings the first handset was priced at a record-setting £6500 ($10500).The company’s mandate was to create a niche market of luxury handsets replicating the luxury watch market for the growing number of UHNW individuals. In the era of conspicuous consumption not only had the number of individuals with assets of more than $30 million risen globally but ostentatious displays of their wealth were also prized as de rigueur (i.e. fashionable) status symbols. The ornate designs of the most sought-after luxury goods reflected their wealthy owners’ desire to be instantly recognized as such. At a time when popular Samsung clamshell handsets sold for $500 Vertu created the category of luxury handsets for the world’s wealthy populations. The luxury handsets were created by skilled British craftspeople in a single manufacturing facility set up in Church Crookham Hampshire in 2000. “They sold the $11000 phones like expensive watches in boutique stores in tony neighbourhoods” said John Biggs and Steve O’Hear of TechCrunch. Instead of chasing the most current technological innovations Vertu focused on the craftsmanship style and service that their customers sought. The company was headquartered in the United Kingdom with boutiques and authorized dealers around the world.According to the Economist American actress Gwyneth Paltrow was Vertu’s first customer. Her experience with the brand particularly the 24-7 dedicated concierge service was highlighted in Vertu’s promotional material. When Paltrow mislaid her phone’s power charger during a trip she pressed the ruby button on her phone and within minutes the Vertu concierge delivered her a new power charger. The concierge service was available globally in five languages. Each Vertu customer’s preferences were kept to allow the concierge to tailor the service offerings. Celebrity fans included well-known models actresses and trendsetting singers such as Mariah Carey and Madonna. Actress Jennifer Lopez reportedly owned three different handsets from the Vertu range. “After all” according to Danielle Keighery a Vertu spokesperson “as with luxury watches ink-pens and cars your choice of mobile phone is increasingly a form of self-expression. And although celebrity customers get all the attention obscure rich people are buying the phones too.” Competitors were quickly attracted to this product market. GoldVish Mobiado Savelli Gresso Givori and Bellperre engaged in one-upmanship tactics raising the stakes in offering flamboyant luxury handsets for the international jet set. France’s Atelier Haute Communication and Denmark’s Aesir Copenhagen which had been industry entrants during this period subsequently withdrew as the market became saturated with competition.By 2007 Vertu was producing 57000 handsets a year with worldwide sales of £150 million ($300 million). The product line was expanded to include customization options such as the diamond-like carbon coating used in Formula One engines 18-carat red gold detailing stainless steel back pillows facet-cut sapphire keys and matching black leather cases. A limited edition “Vertu for Bentley” handset featuring newmarket tan Bentley calfskin leather was created to entice Bentley luxury vehicle owners with phones inspired by their hand-built automobiles. The price started at $16500. Vertu was an international success story in the luxury mobile phone market.FAREWELL TO THE BLING PHONEThe global financial crisis of 2007–08 impacted the zeitgeist (i.e. the spirit) of the time with respect to luxury goods. Press coverage documented this shift in attitude. In 2008 a New York Times headline proclaimed “Conspicuous Consumption Goes Out of Style” and posited that not since the Great Depression had there been such a complete change about-face: “Today bejewelled fashionistas are pegged as tone-deaf Marie Antoinettes. ‘It’s not good taste in our business to walk into a party loaded with the biggest diamonds you can find’ said Bud Konheim CEO [chief executive officer] of fashion brand Nicole Miller.” Julien Tornare president of Vacheron Constantin a Swiss luxury watchmaker predicted that his industry would move toward a period of subtle luxury: “I think people are going to go with more conservative not ostentatious—something more discreet that only the connoisseur would know and appreciate not the bling bling.” In June 2007 when the price of the average mobile phone handset was approximately $200 Apple launched the iPhone at a starting price of $500 beginning the era of the “accessible luxury” feature-packed smartphone. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Nokia Vertu had been using the Nokia-supported Symbian operating system which in the early 2000s had been popular on all of its handsets. However the launch of both the Apple iPhone and Google Android devices had dramatically changed the market landscape. According to statistics from Kantar Worldpanel the U.K. market share for devices using the Symbian operating system had dropped from 26.1 per cent in 2010 to 0.6 per cent in 2012. In October 2012 faced with a declining market position in the mobile phone business Nokia sold 90 per cent of Vertu to EQT a Swedish private equity group for £175 million ($280 million). This transaction caused some concerns to the industry observers as the EQT fund managers had very little business-to-consumer experience and none in the luxury sector that Vertu was operating in. At that time Vertu’s annual turnover was approximately £224 million ($350 million). The company employed more than 1000 people around the world including 600 in the United Kingdom. Discussing the sale one headline bid “Farewell to the Bling Phone.” Upon reading the Financial Times reporting on “Vertu’s demise” Adam Clark Estes noted “It’s time to shed a tear for the dying gawking-worthy fad—popular among rappers and Russian oil tycoons alike—that we call the bling phone.” He pointed out that the real growth in the luxury phone preceded the iPhone introduction commenting “Want to make it a bling phone? Buy an expensive case.” This viewpoint was shared by other influencers such as Rhiannon Williams who said “Those with flashier tastes could employ the services of businesses built around blinging up existing iPhones with diamonds or creating 24-carat gold cases rather than splash out on an expensive handset which will still require replacing every few years.”VERTU SIGNALS ITS OPULENT RETURNA new strategy emerged after the change in ownership. Under EQT’s management Vertu replaced the outdated Symbian operating system with one from Google. The £7000 ($11000) Android-powered Vertu Ti touch screen smartphone was launched in 2013. Vertu’s president and CEO Perry Oosting described his products as being on par or better than rival devices on the market. Vertu Ti was a step up from previous phone models that industry critics had argued relied too much on their “bling” accessories to attract customers. Oosting shifted the company’s focus to China the biggest market for luxury phones and home to its new pool of wealthy customers. In 2013 Chinese consumers purchased approximately $102 billion worth of luxury consumer goods representing almost 47 per cent of the world’s total. By 2014 China represented the largest number of consumers of luxury goods globally. Vertu’s annual turnover in 2014 increased to £159 million ($272 million).In 2013 Daniel Thomas of the Financial Times struck a positive note in an article entitled “Vertu Signals Its Opulent Return.” His review included a complimentary passage: “In a smartphone market moving towards ever sleeker and lighter handsets the latest luxury device from Vertu has a reassuringly expensive heft that can only come as a result of a jewelled titanium frame.” The resurrection was short-lived. An estimated 20 to 50 per cent of the luxury goods purchased in China had been for gift-giving to government officials. Restrictions on business gift giving in China were introduced in 2013 as President Xi Jinping’s new administration identified battling corruption as its top priority. After the government’s ban luxury Swiss watch imports to China dropped 27.5 per cent. The government aggressively pursued high-profile prosecutions of corruption by introducing a distinct chill factor in Vertu’s most important market. In June 2013 Oosting stepped down as Vertu’s president and CEO. He was replaced by Massimiliano Pogliani who had joined Vertu as chief marketing officer in late 2012.After only a few short years of ownership EQT sold Vertu to Godin Holdings (Godin) a Hong Kong–based fund for £39 million ($60 million) in 2015. Godin which was registered as an investment vehicle in Hong Kong was controlled by hedge fund manager Gang Chen from Beijing by way of the British Virgin Islands on behalf of a low-profile Chinese investor group. Pogliani stepped down as Vertu’s chief executive stating that it was “an appropriate time to pass on the baton of leadership to a new team.” Billy Crotty was brought in by the Chinese owner but he left within three months. As part of a minor organizational restructuring senior marketing executives and other sales executives were made redundant including the regional head of sales in the Middle East—a key market for Vertu. THE FREE FALLThe change of ownership did not help Vertu as it continued to struggle in the challenging luxury mobile phone market. Compared with its impressive sales of 57000 handsets in 2007 Vertu sold only 20000 handsets in 2015. Godin failed to file its 2015 company account for Vertu which according to a former Vertu executive was not filed “because of the impending sale and Ernst & Young were working toward finalizing this once the sale had been concluded. They were satisfied that the new owner had the funding to continue the business.” The last filing in 2014 recorded a loss of £53 million ($90 million) on sales of £110 million ($185 million). Gordon Watson who had been with Vertu since 2010 was quietly promoted to CEO in February 2016. In November 2016 Vertu had its first major restructuring since its inception by Nokia. Two hundred jobs were cut equivalent to approximately one-fifth of its workforce. Watson perceived an opportunity to double the company’s active customer base and he shook up a business that had grown fat. “We had a big multinational mindset not a lean start-up one” he said describing the organizational structure inherited from Nokia as “bureaucratic.” He planned to put Vertu “back on the map” by cutting its product range to one core model of smartphone with continued investment in the Signature feature phone. The company had launched five distinct smartphones between 2013 and 2015. Watson believed that such a move had been unwise as it created confusion for customers who had bought a new phone and were approached to buy another one only months later. He said that the price point for a non-customized Vertu phone should be £4000 to £7000 ($4800 to $8400). Despite all of the good intentions and efforts Vertu management was unable to turn the tide and the free fall continued. In 2016 Vertu’s sales performance was disappointingly low with only 9000 handsets being sold globally due to the delay of new product launches. Toward the end of 2016 according to an email he sent to senior staff Chen started to look for additional investors to support growth through the development of new products. In November 2016 Chen met Murat Hakan Uzan a Turkish billionaire who had been exiled to Paris to discuss a potential partnership. Uzan was not new to the Vertu brand as he had been a customer for years and had many Vertu phones in his collection. An investment deal was subsequently agreed on. Uzan agreed to take over management of Vertu’s brand design rights and patents for £20 million ($25 million) in December 2016 in exchange for the elimination of €32 million ($34 million) of shareholder loans from the company’s books. “Vertu is a powerful brand with an acknowledged market niche. I look forward to working with the team and providing the investment to enable Vertu to realize its full potential” Uzan told the Daily Telegraph via a spokesperson.THE QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTIONThe spokesperson went on to disclose that further negotiations between Chen and Uzan had led to Godin selling Vertu to Baferton Ltd. a Cyprus-registered company run by Uzan in March 2017. The sale price was only £1 ($1.3). According to Uzan this agreement took place without any due diligence because of the lack of any accounts that Godin had produced or provided. However a former Vertu executive disputed that statement: “Full due diligence had been done Uzan and his team had full visibility of the Vertu business from Nov. 2016 through to the ‘sale’ in March 2016.” “Baferton shares our vision: 1.5 billion smartphones are sold each year and there is demand for a high-quality exclusive product with associated services” said Watson of Vertu. “Working with Baferton we’ll be equipped to develop the Vertu business the brand and the service.”The deal resulted in Vertu being controlled by a family that Nokia and Motorola had previously accused of having committed a massive fraud. The Uzan family had borrowed money from these telecom giants in the 1990s to finance Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. (Telsim) which formed today’s Vodafone Turkey. The loans defaulted and the Uzan family was alleged to have misappropriated cash to support its lavish lifestyle. Motorola and Nokia subsequently won the lawsuit and the compensatory damages validated the accusation that the Uzan family members had borrowed billions of dollars in bad faith. The judgment in the Nokia and Motorola action represented only one chapter in the story of the denouement of the Uzan family. The Uzan family had been one of Turkey’s wealthiest. Its dozens of companies included a bank a broadcaster two electricity companies and the mobile operator. However the Uzan family was involved in various business and political disputes in Turkey leading to the fall of the family’s business empire. When the family’s assets were seized by the Turkish government the family fled and received political asylum in France.Headlines mocked the folly of Uzan’s purchase of Vertu. A Gizmodo reporter described the transaction as “a bad business decision made by a guy from a family with a bad history of business decisions” in a report headlined “Ridiculous Rich Person Phone Brand Vertu Somehow Continues to Exist.” Public disputes about the takeover soon dominated the press. According to Chen money that Uzan had promised for Vertu never arrived including for his shareholder loan and to relieve the company of “the short-term cash crunch and threat of liquidation.” “He [Uzan] clearly had no intention to fulfil his commitments” Chen alleged. “After the completion of the equity transfer by Vertu Mr Uzan’s team only provided a bank transfer screenshot.”Lawyers for Uzan rebutted by saying that “the new owner has examined the company’s finance contracts and relationships and has been shocked to discover that many suppliers have not been paid for a year and a half and was concerned to discover that staff-related payments had not been made regularly.” This was observably true as Godin had failed to contribute its pension funding obligations for February and March 2017. On the other hand a former Vertu executive pointed out that these pension contributions were not made on the request of Uzan on the basis that his company would inject cash into Vertu in March 2017. Uzan’s team claimed that they would pursue Chen through the courts in China with respect to Godin’s unlawful use of company assets but it was never contested. VERTU ON ITS LAST LEGSShortly after taking over Vertu Uzan removed the senior management team and put Jean-Charles Charki in charge. Charki who had his own history of questionable business deals was the socially prominent son-in-law of Nicolas Sarkozy’s former chief of staff and interior minister. Vertu’s assets including some store leases were transferred to Vertu AK a newly formed French company that Uzan controlled.Citing concerns about the control of the accounts Uzan suspended payment to Vertu pension funds for April and May 2017. In May 2017 in an effort to stop the financial bleeding the company without notice abruptly suspended Vertu’s value-added services—including its concierge services vertu.me and iPass global Wi-Fi roaming service. “I have two of these phones that are basically useless now” said Kenneth Tong. “$40000 worth” he added. Tong expressed the frustration that all Vertu owners must have experienced when Vertu abruptly stopped providing on-demand concierge services to its affluent customers.In June 2017 the Telegraph reported that Microsoft—which had completed its acquisition of Nokia’s mobile phone business in 2014 and was still the leaseholder for the headquarters that Vertu subleased—alleged that approximately £2.5 million ($3.2 million) in rent was overdue. It reported that the property services provider CBRE was owed nearly £420000 ($540000) most of which was overdue and had advised Vertu that it was halting waste collection cleaning and pest control services. Additional major creditors were named including the microchip giant Qualcomm Incorporated and the IT (information technology) provider Acora. During the week of June 19 2017 Vertu staff at the United Kingdom headquarters presented the company with a petition demanding answers regarding the missing pension scheme payment. In addition to the claims by suppliers about unpaid bills another sign of distress surfaced: production was cut back below capacity. Approximately 200 workers at the headquarters alleged that their wages were overdue. On June 20 2017 Vertu officially moved its corporate office from Church Crookham Hampshire United Kingdom to Paris France and named the new entity Vertu AK France. On the same day Vertu AK signed a £30 million ($40 million) deal with China’s TCL Communication an existing partner of Vertu to use its technologies to make 30000 Vertu phones in the United Kingdom. The company press release from the new Paris-based headquarters announcing these events also referred to past Vertu milestones including having sold more than 500000 devices worldwide being available at approximately 300 stores (56 of which were Vertu Boutiques) in 62 countries and having more than 225000 registered users.THE COLLAPSE OF VERTUVertu was on life support and its operation became increasingly unsustainable. On June 29 2017 Uzan revealed plans to put Vertu’s manufacturing arm Vertu Corporation Limited into a “pre-pack administration” to wipe out heavy debts. A pre-pack administration sale was a legal method to sell a business to a trade buyer third party or current directors operating under a new company. Such a sale which could be used when a firm faced creditor threats offered the advantage of business continuity and court protection as an alternative to a lengthy liquidation process when a business was insolvent. Uzan sought to buy Vertu out of administration for £1.9 million ($2.5 million) based on a valuation provided by Lambert Smith Hampton a commercial property consultancy. Uzan sought to receive creditor approval on July 7 2017 at the British High Court application hearing in order to transfer assets to a new company unencumbered by existing debts estimated at “tens of millions of pounds.” Charki who was by then Vertu’s sole remaining director had stated in his witness statement filed in the High Court on June 29 2017 that Vertu was insolvent in support of the application. It had consolidated losses of £128.5 million ($167 million) and debts of approximately £64 million ($83 million). Vertu was unable to meet its June 30 2017 payroll obligation of approximately £500000 ($649000). Charki told the court that only approximately £350000 ($454000) would be recovered if Vertu were to be liquidated. “A significant number of the company’s creditors are currently unpaid and the company is in breach of its payment terms to them” Charki testified. “There is likely to be a far better outcome for the company’s creditors as a whole in an administration than would be the case if the company were to be wound up.” Griffins a large insolvency practice in the United Kingdom was appointed to oversee the pre-pack administration for Vertu.In his submission to the court Charki assigned blame for the company’s situation squarely on Godin: I believe that a change of management following the sale to Godin coupled with poor strategic choices by Godin led to a freefall in sales. Under Mr. Chen’s ownership cost-cutting measures were introduced to match the decline in production volumes which by the end of 2015 had fallen to around 15000. He elaborated “Both Nokia and the company [Vertu] failed to anticipate the smartphone revolution that began in around 2007 along with the turbulence that resulted from the 2008 financial crisis.” On the afternoon of June 29 2017 Uzan’s representatives including the law firm Harbottle & Lewis informed the staff that they would be paid only if the creditors approved the pre-pack administration.The pre-pack administration for Vertu did not materialize as expected. On July 6 2017 Uzan’s Vertu AK withdrew the application for pre-pack administration and Vertu officially entered liquidation. Vertu collapsed with the loss of 178 U.K. jobs and owing 327 unsecured creditors approximately £43 million ($56 million). Uzan explained the situation via a press release posted on his social media account. Adam Harris and Kevin Goldfarb of Griffins were appointed joint liquidators of Vertu on July 12 2017. The Times newspaper later disclosed that the liquidators found Uzan had already transferred Vertu’s overseas branches and intellectual property to Vertu AK. Furthermore the liquidators had received a large number of allegations from external sources regarding the conduct of the company and its management. At the same time Chen was quoted as saying he had appointed lawyers and intended to sue Uzan for the “illegal act” of holding Vertu’s shares requiring the deal to be struck out and to be paid huge compensation. Both sides of the dispute denied each other’s allegations and declared their intentions to sue the other party.With the completion of the liquidation process Uzan needed to rethink the fate of Vertu. After all the brand was a well-recognized leader in the luxury mobile phone industry that served a niche market globally. As an entrepreneurial business veteran who had founded many companies Uzan was eager to turn a new page for his newly acquired brand. Should he flip Vertu to another luxury brand owner to make a quick exit or continue business in key markets such as China where the majority of Vertu customers resided? It had become a difficult business decision for Uzan and he needed to consider the ethical and reputational implications of these options.ENDNOTES",1,WHITE,NORTHERN EUROPE,MAN,50

Ltd. (Parle)’s Kaccha Mango Bite and Perfetti Van Melle Group B.V.’s Alpenliebe. Pulse sales were even higher than those of multinational brands Oreo and Mars which had been in the Indian market since 2011. Pulse achieved this astounding success with hardly any promotion or advertising for the brand. The journey for Pulse began in April 2015 when the Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group a diversified conglomerate operating out of Noida India launched Pulse in three states in India as test markets. In the very first year of its launch sales of Pulse exceeded ₹1 billion. With its stupendous success the brand was launched in other states and by January 2016 the company had a pan-India presence. Within two years Pulse had surpassed ₹3 billion in sales and the company was able to meet only 60–70 per cent of the demand. Eventually competitors launched similar products and cheap imitations started to be sold at roadside kiosks. In view of these developments the DS Group needed to consider how it could keep up with Pulse’s sales momentum. Should it extend the Pulse brand to other formats and flavours? Should it focus on meeting the domestic demand or should it explore overseas markets? These were some of the options the company could explore to sustain Pulse’s competitive advantage. COMPANY BACKGROUNDThe DS Group was founded by Lala Dharampal (the “D” in DS) in 1929. He started with a small perfume store in Chandni Chowk Delhi and eventually launched chewing tobacco in 1948. He was later joined by his son Satyapal (the “S” in DS) who earned the title of sugandhi (perfumer) as a result of his profound knowledge of perfumes. He used this knowledge to innovatively blend tobacco with various fragrances. Under Satyapal’s guidance the company launched its flagship brand BABA the first branded chewing tobacco. The brand took the country by storm and since then the company had engaged in launching a host of innovative products including the famous chewing tobacco brand Tulsi and Rajnigandha pan masala a betel nut product. The DS Group slowly diversified into non-tobacco businesses. It entered the food and beverage industry (F&B) in 1987 by introducing Catch a branded salt packaged in tabletop rotary dispensers—the first of its kind in India. The DS Group eventually launched a portfolio of spices and beverages under the brand name Catch. In 1999 the DS Group also entered the confectionery segment with the pioneering launch of a herbal mouth freshener called Pass. The DS Group further diversified its offerings making its presence felt in the hospitality dairy agro forestry and printing and packaging industries. With the government tightening regulations on the sale of smokeless tobacco products the company’s focus in the consumer goods segment especially F&B increased over the years. The DS Group launched Chingles mini chewing gums in 2012 and in 2013 it expanded into dairy products under the Ksheer brand. Pulse was the latest brand in the confectionery segment launched in 2015 under the umbrella brand of Pass Pass.The company’s revenues and profits in fiscal year (FY) 2012/13 were ₹33.6 billion and ₹2.9 billion respectively. The F&B segment contributed approximately 22 per cent to the firm’s turnover which was reported to be around ₹77 billion in FY 2015/16. THE CONFECTIONERY MARKET IN INDIAThe per capita consumption of confectionery in India was among the lowest globally providing a great opportunity for growth. With the country’s economic boom and increase in customer spending several domestic and multi-national companies expanded their operations in the Indian confectionery market and the per capita consumption of confectionery items increased.The confectionery market was broadly divided into three categories: chocolate gum and sugar confectionery. Within the non-gum non-chocolate sugar confectionery market hard-boiled candies formed the largest segment and showed promising growth. The hot climate in India led to a preference for hard-boiled candies over chocolates which would quickly melt in the high temperatures especially in summers. Gum was seen by the Indian middle class as a luxury item and was mostly consumed in urban markets. Although the margins were larger in high-end chocolates about 40 per cent of the confectionery unit sales came from candies priced at ₹0.5. Most of these sales were through unorganized retail comprising small kirana (mom-and-pop) stores and roadside kiosks and the candies were sold as single units rather than multi-unit packs or bulk purchases. The purchases were frequently made on impulse and children were the primary consumers. Many of the shopkeepers used low priced candies instead of coins to provide change to customers. Since entry and exit barriers in the hard-boiled confectionery segment were low many small local manufacturers also operated and sold through unorganized retail. Thus success in the low-priced low-margin hard-boiled confectionery segment depended largely on volumes. However customers’ brand loyalty was low and whatever little loyalty they exhibited was toward a particular flavour such as mango orange or coffee. Mango flavour (24 per cent) and the raw mango flavour (26 per cent) constituted 50 per cent of the hard-boiled candy segment followed by caramel (20 per cent) and orange flavour (16 per cent).Companies that dominated the hard-boiled candy market included Perfetti Van Melle India Pvt. Ltd. (PVMI) Parle and ITC Ltd. PVMI was the leader in the confectionery market. It had entered the Indian market in 1994 with its brand Center Fresh in the gums category; it gradually expanded its portfolio to include approximately 15 brands across different sub-categories. PVMI’s revenues in the confectionery segment surpassed ₹20 billion in FY 2014/15. Some of its leading brands included Alpenliebe a mix of caramel milk and butter; Mentos a chewy mint candy; and Chlormint a breath-freshener candy. PVMI was known for its quirky and clever television commercials that appealed to and connected with a wide audience. Some of its notable taglines were “dimag ki batti jala de” (lights up one’s brain) for Mentos “dobara mat puchna” (dare not ask again) for Chlormint and “zubaan par rakhe lagaam” (keeps one’s mouth shut) for Center Fresh. PVMI enjoyed a strong distribution network comprising nearly 5000 distributors and approximately 10000 sub-stockists that made PVMI’s products available to small towns as well. The company created a multi-tiered distribution system dividing the products into three categories based on the brands. Each category had a different distributor each of whom visited the retailer once every week. Thus PVMI managed three visits to each retailer per week while the rivals’ distributors paid the retailers a once-weekly visit. The kiosk owners who found it difficult to buy multiple product types at one time because of limited working capital would end up buying some of PVMI’s products during every visit. This led to an increase in the volume of sales of PVMI’s candies in these outlets.The other dominant company was the homegrown Mumbai-based Parle known for its Parle-G biscuits the largest selling biscuit brand in the world. The company participated in different categories of the confectionery market. Its best-known brands included hard-boiled candies Mango Bite and Kaccha Mango Bite; Melody a caramel candy with chocolate interior; and Kismi flavoured caramel bars. Kaccha Mango Bite was Parle’s largest selling candy. It was advertised as “kacche aam ka Xerox” (an exact copy of raw mango) with actor Amitabh Bachchan as an endorser of the brand.The other strong company ITC had a number of variants and flavours under two brands—Mint-o and Candyman. With ITC’s presence in cigarettes and packaged food products it enjoyed strong distribution in urban as well as rural India. Because of its cigarette business the company’s products were also made available at its large network of paan shops. PULSEThe LaunchThe DS Group launched Pulse in April 2015 after thoroughly researching the market over two years. Rajiv Kumar vice-chairman of DS Group noted “We never focus on bottom lines; if the product is fine then bottom lines have to come. Most of our [research and development] projects involve a lot of time and that is our biggest investment. We don’t launch till we are completely confident about the product.” The company studied the taste preferences of Indians and learned that the tangy flavour of raw mango was liked by all age groups across the country. This result was nothing new for the company given the success of Parle’s Kaccha Mango Bite candy. However the study also revealed that raw mango was not consumed as it was but almost always had a pinch of salt sprinkled over it the chatpata (sweet and sour) flavour tickling the taste buds. Kumar said in an interview that his briefing to the research and development team was “Your eyes should close automatically to relish it [the taste of candy].”Based on consumer insights the company developed Pulse a hard-boiled candy with a raw mango flavour and tangy salty powder filling the centre. The product was different from other candies both in form and in taste. The candy initially gave a mix of sweet and sour tastes and as one reached the core of the candy the powdered salt and spices within the hard exterior of the candy imparted a strong sour taste.The green-coloured candy was initially launched in pillow packs in Gujarat Rajasthan and Delhi National Capital Region as test markets. These territories were chosen on the basis of preference for a mix of sweet and sour tastes. The demand in the test markets exceeded the company’s expectations so it decided to launch the candy in other major cities of India and eventually to establish presence across India.MarketingThe DS Group had decided to use its famous mouth freshener brand Pass Pass to expand its portfolio in the confectionery business. Earlier in 2012 the DS Group had launched Chingles mini chewing gums with Pass Pass as the umbrella brand. Thus Pulse candy was also launched under Pass Pass. Pulse candy had appealing packaging with shiny green and black colours giving the candy a distinctive look compared to other candies available at the retail outlet. The candy’s unique taste and form instantly struck a chord with customers who began talking about the candy among their family and friends. The two-stage taste experience of the candy was described by consumers as “masala [spicy] bomb” or “magical core” highlighting the enthusiasm created by the candy in the market. The overall feel and taste of the candy left most consumers amazed and craving more. This craze drove customers to buy in greater volumes usually five to 10 candies in one purchase. Many of them talked about the brand on social media. Initially most purchases were made by youth but word-of-mouth publicity and online reviews helped the brand gain quick awareness and adoption among all segments including schoolchildren college students and working professionals.Traditionally candies were sold at ₹0.5 but fewer ₹0.5 coins in circulation and higher raw material costs were increasingly driving the industry to increase the unit prices of candy to ₹1. However around the time Pulse was launched in 2015 86 per cent of the candies in the market including Parle’s Mango Bite and Perfetti’s Alpenliebe were priced at ₹0.5; most of these candies weighed around 2–2.5 grams. Pulse weighed 4 grams and was priced at ₹1. The huge demand and short supply led many retailers to sell Pulse at a premium of 50 per cent in spite of the company’s efforts to keep a check on the retail price. A senior official at a consumer-packaged goods company commented “Pulse came as a disruptor into the market. But the presence is too limited. Pulse received a good acceptance and then a supply shortage was created. It is a good marketing trick.”The DS Group used its existing distribution network of about 1 million retailers to sell Pulse. The DS Group enjoyed an extensive network because its leading brand Rajnigandha had more than 70 per cent of the market share in the paan-masala category and was available in different nooks of the country. The DS Group used this strength to establish a pan-India presence for Pulse by January 2016. Simultaneously the company focused on increasing its production in India. Instead of establishing its own plants the company relied on contract manufacturing. Shashank Surana vice-president New Product Development at DS Group stated in April 2016 “Instead of locking up capital in setting up our own manufacturing units for Pulse we decided that it was best to tie up with contract manufacturers. We just had two partners initially which we have expanded to seven to be able to cover the entire country and we are in talks to tie up with another.” The group initially spent nothing on above-the-line advertising or sales promotion. However the candy earned extremely favourable responses from early adopters who shared their experience with Pulse on social media. Some of them even posted videos on YouTube detailing the candy’s attributes. Gradually the company established below-the-line activities such as in-store promotions and displays and outdoor advertising. The online marketing by the candy’s fans was so powerful that the catchphrase “pulse of India” used by many of the fans to describe the candy was adopted by the company in its hoardings. Inspired by how the digital communities shared their journey with Pulse right from opening the package to experiencing the taste inside the mouth the company launched a digital media campaign and started actively engaging with the customers. Interestingly Pulse had many more mentions on social media platforms than established products like Parle’s Kaccha Aam and Dabur India Ltd.’s Hajmola candy (see Exhibit 1).In 2016 the DSGroup introduced two more flavours to Pulse—guava and orange—also under the umbrella brand Pass Pass. The candies were also made available through the leading online retailer in India Amazon.com in special bulk packs designed in the shape of a pyramid. Pulse had also strengthened its position in organized retail stores where it was also made available in bulk packs. The company launched a television commercial for Pulse in April 2017 almost two years after its introduction. Surana explained “We believe this was the right time to launch the TVC [television commercial] as now we are at a situation when we are catering to the demand of the markets across India. The TVC now will help us in reaching out to more consumers.” With the tagline “Pran Jaaye Par Pulse Na Jaaye” (Life can be given up but not Pulse candy) the advertisement reflected the heights to which individuals could go to save their Pulse candy from others. The advertisement laden with humour connected well with its primary target audience in the age group 15–35 years and garnered about 20 million views across different social media platforms.Opportunities and ChallengesWithin two years of its launch Pulse had become the leader of the hard-boiled candy segment and it recorded sales of ₹3.26 billion in FY 2016/17. The Indian sugar and gum confectionery market had reached ₹85 billion with the hard-boiled candy segment growing rapidly from one-third to nearly half of this market over one year. The gums and eclairs segments came a distant second and third with a 20 per cent and 14 per cent market share respectively (see Exhibit 2). The gums and eclairs segments displayed lack of innovation and experienced sluggish growth. Although jellies were a relatively newer segment in the sugar and gum confectionery market and accounted for a mere 1-per-cent share that segment was seeing exponential growth like the hard-boiled candy segment—which was the main driver of overall growth of the confectionery market. According to Sameer Shukla executive director at Nielsen India “Innovations new launches of brands and variants are driving candies segment growth to a 15-per-cent level almost double the rate at which [the] confectionery category is growing at.” Pulse had a close competitor in Kopiko a coffee-flavoured candy produced by Indonesian PT Mayora Indah Tbk (Mayora Group) with Inbisco India Pvt. Ltd. as its sole distributor in India. Kopiko recorded sales of ₹3.06 billion followed by Kaccha Mango Bite in the third position with ₹2.29 billion in sales (see Exhibit 3).The success of Pulse saw many competitors launch similar or new variants priced at ₹1. For instance Parle launched a spicy version called Parle Spicy Kaccha Mango Bite; PVMI launched Alpenliebe Gold; and ITC was test marketing a very similar variant Candyman Tadka available in two flavours raw mango and pineapple. Local small manufacturers came out with cheaper imitations called Spicy Beats Plse and Pluse to take advantage of the demand–supply gap for Pulse. These products copied the package design of Pulse making it difficult for customers to differentiate fake from real forcing the company to take legal recourse against the counterfeit products. LOOKING AHEADPulse succeeded in catching customers’ attention through its innovativeness but could it sustain the brand differentiation over the long term in the highly competitive candy market? What if anything could the company do to sustain its competitive advantage? Another pertinent question was whether the company should focus on domestic markets first given that the demand exceeded the supply or expand into international markets. Did the product’s phenomenal national success guarantee its success in other markets? Did the company have the right product for an international market given that the candy was developed for the Indian palate?The company also needed to consider how far it could stretch the Pulse brand to launch new products. It was planning to extend the brand into the beverage segment with an all-India launch of a mango drink called Pulse Mango Masala Maar Ke. The drink was being test marketed in Delhi National Capital Region with a 250-millilitre PET (a recyclable plastic) bottle priced at ₹15. The Indian soft drink beverage market was growing at a rapid rate of 15 per cent per annum. The soft drink market reached ₹145 billion in 2017 out of which the fruit-based beverage segment contributed ₹50 billion. Mango contributed 80 per cent of the sales of fruit beverages. With the likes of The Coca-Cola Company’s Maaza PepsiCo Inc.’s Slice and Parle Agro Pvt. Ltd.’s Frooti already present in the market with their mango variants Pulse would be challenged by the incumbents if the DS Group did go ahead with a national launch of its drink.

In 2020 however the airline faced a new and unforeseen challenge: the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Suddenly the world’s airline industry had to decide how to respond to a global crisis. Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic Star Alliance was already facing critical issues related to its organization and strategy. Its success had always depended on effective management of the network’s member airlines. That factor would prove even more critical during the pandemic when airline travel suddenly and unexpectedly dropped to half of its original volume across the world and was not expected to regain its status for some time. For over 20 years Star Alliance members had contributed value to the alliance and reaped numerous benefits in return that helped them become strong competitors. Other airlines recognizing the value and strength of an alliance had formed their own rival airline networks. Would this strategy help airlines survive the COVID-19 crisis? Was group-based competition needed to thrive during a pandemic?The Global Airline IndustryThe COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020 and spread across the globe. In response severe travel restrictions were introduced in all countries. As demand for travel plummeted passenger occupancy in planes declined and health and safety costs mounted. All airlines sought emergency funding wherever they could usually from their home governments. Observers recognized that the future of the industry was being reshaped although what new form it would take was unclear. Before attempting to accurately predict the airline industry’s future understanding its history and economic fundamentals was necessary.During the preceding decades the global airline industry had been transformed by new regulatory policies and company strategies. The United States deregulated pricing and domestic routes in 1978 and the European Union followed suit in 1997. Although regulatory hurdles still prevented cross-border mergers in many countries airlines were able to pursue various new strategies. One strategy global airlines used to extend their global reach was a bilateral and multi-partner alliance known in the industry as a “constellation.”Star Alliance was created in May 1997 by an agreement among five international airlines: Deutsche Lufthansa AG (Lufthansa) United Airlines Inc. (United) Air Canada Thai Airways International Public Co and Scandinavian Airways System. The following year four more airlines joined the alliance: Varig Air New Zealand Limited Ansett Australia and All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd.. Expansion continued regularly and steadily from that point. The main goal of the founding members was to expand their global network of service and attain many of the synergies that a merger provided while maintaining their independent identities. Two years later two new airline alliances emerged with a plan to reap the same benefits that Star Alliance seemed to be enjoying. Oneworld was formed by founding members American Airlines Inc. (American) and British Airways and SkyTeam was formed the next year by Delta Air Lines Inc. (Delta) Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.The Rise of Airline ConstellationsStar Alliance was a new type of organizational structure in the airline industry but one that would soon become relatively common. This structure consisted of multiple member airlines enabling collaboration in certain activities within limits. Antitrust rules did not allow sharing specific types of information coordinating pricing or sharing profits. However each member paid a share of the costs of the organization and had specific rights in the governance of joint activities.Historically airline alliances had been bilateral—that is between two companies. In 1998 for example Air France was part of 24 different bilateral alliances with different airlines across the globe—all of them remaining distinct and separate. Star Alliance however grouped such relationships into one network and coordinated bilateral arrangements between member companies. Multi-partner alliances established common branding and standards for the various member airlines. In some cases the alliance helped its members aggregate large aircraft purchases.Initially Star Alliance relied mainly on its two largest members—United and Lufthansa. In 1999 these two airlines together served 578 destinations in 106 countries. By 2020 Star Alliance had grown its membership to 26 airlines and served over 1300 destinations in 195 countries (Exhibit 1). However multi-partner alliances in the global airline industry were a common practice even before Star Alliance formed its network. In 1989 Delta had formed a network of three airlines with Swissair AG/SA and Singapore Airlines. Star Alliance then formed the first major network several years later in 1997. Rivalry among large constellations soon flourished when American and British Airways joined Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Qantas Airways Limited to launch Oneworld in 1999 and the next year Aerovías de México S.A. de C.V. (Aeroméxico) Air France Delta and Korean Air Co. Ltd. joined together to form SkyTeam.Like Star Alliance the other two constellations also expanded over the years adding and replacing members over time (see Exhibit 2). In 2017 the three major airline alliances had built immense networks accounting for almost 58 per cent of the industry’s total global capacity. By 2020 each group had a footing in every major region of the globe.Benefits of Star AllianceTraditional airline profitability boiled down to only a few key drivers of revenue and cost. The main revenue drivers were passenger capacity load factor and yield. Pricing of flights could vary often in response to the degree of competition in the route. The percentage of seats that were occupied on a flight known as load factor was an important indicator of profitability. Mileage programs were used to promote customer loyalty develop future business and increase liquidity. Credit card partners involved in these programs bought miles for their customers in advance of when they would be used. On the other side of revenue the main drivers of cost were labour (i.e. flight personnel) fuel and advertising. Star Alliance members sought to gain from the network in many ways. The alliance provided members access to destinations outside of their home base. Coordinating arrival and departure times allowed the group to operate an efficient network with high load and tight connections which was known as codeshare synchronization. The constellations also promised better customer service by allowing the airlines to share lounges mileage programs and various costs in other areas. Members could also take advantage of common standards combined training programs and the alliance’s brand identity while maintaining their own independent status.Network OptimizationStar Alliance offered its member airlines an extended hub-and-spoke system which was considered a key competitive advantage. The hub-and-spoke system first became popular in domestic air travel in the United States after deregulation of the route structure. In this system the main airports in the country served as hubs through which passengers were channelled to and from various spoke airports that connected the hub to the ultimate destinations. For example Star Alliance made it possible for United passengers to travel to Munich Hamburg Frankfurt and other German cities through the Dusseldorf hub. Similarly because Lufthansa did not fly to Denver New Orleans Honolulu or Seattle in the United States from Frankfurt Germany its passengers could fly to Chicago and United would then take them to their ultimate US destinations. For a given route (e.g. New York United States to Frankfurt Germany) one partner would bring passengers to a hub airport from spoke locations and take them to destinations beyond a partner’s hub airport on the other side of the route. This service which was referred to as using a bridge was enabled by the network structure of such alliances (see Exhibit 3).In 2016 Star Alliance introduced an additional co-operative relationship called “connecting partners” in an effort to augment its global network. Partner carriers would be able to connect to the Star Alliance network without becoming full alliance members. However passengers would be offered connections only to the flights of connecting partners according to certain status-based privileges. Juneyao Airlines was announced as the first connecting partner in October 2016.With the hub-and-spoke system becoming widespread most major airports became dominated by a single large carrier. Limited availability of landing slots gates and takeoff times made it difficult for other carriers to serve new locations. This advantage combined with other benefits resulted in increased revenues for Star Alliance members. By 2019 combined Star Alliance member revenues reached over US$200 billion (see Exhibit 4). The organization also had the largest membership list the most seats the highest revenues and the fastest growth although other constellations were not far behind (see Exhibit 5).  Joint PurchasesAnother objective of airline alliances was to combine purchases and increase each member’s buyer power as the chief executive officer (CEO) of United noted: “About one-third of United’s costs involve people. But the other two-thirds represent enormous opportunities for working together for buying purchasing and co-operating among the group.” Potential economies of scale were available to members through joint purchasing in several areas. The annual combined amount of Star Alliance member purchases of goods and services was approximately $15 billion. This amount included expenses for office equipment fuel catering and maintenance but excluded aircraft purchases.In 1998 United claimed to have saved $20 million due to a total $1.5 billion in combined purchased services. In 2014 all Star Alliance carriers serving London’s Heathrow Airport migrated into the new Terminal 2 which allowed them to share many common ground costs. Similar initiatives of alliance members sharing locations and resources also led to savings and improved passenger service in various other international hubs. Passenger BenefitsThe formation of Star Alliance provided customers with an integrated worldwide airline network with global recognition. By 2020 Star Alliance had maintained the largest network covering 195 countries (98 per cent of the world) and serving over 1300 airports. In 2017 Star Alliance’s CEO Jeffrey Goh was asked if the constellation had reached its full size or if it had plans to continue to expand to which Goh replied “We will never say no but we are pretty comprehensive in our network today.” Focusing on customer relations the alliance aimed to enhance global travel making it more convenient and simple for its customers while meeting their needs in ways that individual airlines could not. Whenever possible the member airlines tried to use gates in the same terminal with neighbouring gates allowing for convenient transfers and passenger connections. When delays occurred the connections were protected monitored and proactively re-accommodated on a proactive basis. Most passengers were offered “through check-in” service that led them through their final destination. The simplicity and consistency of quality in member services helped customers feel that they were travelling with the same standard of service throughout the entire trip.Loyalty ProgramsBased on extensive marketing research Star Alliance made various changes to meet the expectations and needs of its frequent international flyers. Customers could earn mileage points whenever they travelled on any Star Alliance member airline. The points would accumulate and could be credited toward different frequent flyer programs of Star Alliance carriers. This allowed customers to use every point earned to reach elite status within the various programs sooner as well as to redeem their reward miles throughout the alliance network.Star Alliance also added two status tiers—silver and gold—in the loyalty programs of member carriers to recognize and reward loyal customers across the entire alliance. Gold status allowed customers access to the highest level of service at airports around the world and priority treatment from check-in to baggage claim. Elite customers enjoyed a seamless travel experience and tangible benefits. Upon presentation of their card or status customers were directed to the lounges of Star Alliance carriers which provided fine cuisine beverages access to global news Internet access and other business amenities. Gold status customers also had clearance to more efficiently pass through airport security in more than 130 airports around the world.Star Alliance travellers enjoyed various other benefits including Internet tools for smart phones and tablets and the latest technology services. All airlines sold tickets and tracked reservations but Star Alliance’s website featured online tools that allowed customers to plan their travels at all times. The site was integrated with the booking systems of member airlines and was linked to a main computer reservation system. Corporate clients were a key profitability factor for all major airlines and especially those with long-haul routes. Star Alliance offered various incentives specifically for corporate clients including discounts across the network of its member carriers. It was also the first alliance to feature global conventions and events services that allowed delegates from all over the world to enjoy discounts across the entire Star Alliance network.Other Forms of Airline Co-operation Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam provided a range of benefits to both their member airlines and passengers. However the various other forms of co-operation among airlines were also effective. For example interline and codeshare arrangements allowed airlines to sell seats on connecting airlines and sometimes share a flight’s code information. All members of an alliance agreed to interline agreements which served passengers travelling with two or more airlines on the same itinerary. Even airlines across different alliances often shared interline agreements. Code sharing allowed two partner airlines to list one specific flight as their own and carry two different reservation codes. Like interline agreements code sharing had been a common practice in the industry before alliances became popular. For example Star Alliance member Air Canada was maintaining 25 codeshare agreements in 2013 including one with Etihad Airways a non-aligned Middle Eastern airline.Star Alliance and similar networks occupied the space between codeshare agreements and more substantial forms of business co-operation such as joint ventures and mergers. Alliance members shared flight code airport lounges loyalty programs and an umbrella brand. However revenue and pricing sharing was forbidden unless specific members formed their own bilateral joint venture agreement. Alliances were therefore able to avoid many of the antitrust issues associated with typical joint ventures and similar strict forms of business co-operation.A special type of joint venture for specific routes granted airlines antitrust immunity. The partner airlines essentially acted as one on these specific routes coordinating their pricing and schedules and even sharing their revenues. By 2012 these special joint ventures were one of the most common forms of co-operation in the airline industry accounting for 87 per cent of traffic carried across the North Atlantic. Most of them were agreements between large carriers who were also part of a major global alliance. In 2018 60 per cent of American’s international capacity was included in some form of joint venture agreement. In the same year joint venture partnerships included 58 per cent of Delta’s and 46 per cent of United’s international capacity.In 2018 Delta anticipated that it would earn $500–600 million in incremental revenues by 2020 resulting from its joint venture partnerships. Much of that revenue was expected to be passed along to customers but despite the benefits that airlines claimed they were passing on to passengers governments were reluctant to extend antitrust immunity through these joint venture partnerships except for routes that had no significant impact on competition. Regardless in 2015 the United States Department of Justice conversely found that joint venture partnerships often increased rather than lowered ticket prices.The most involved form of business co-operation short of a complete merger was an equity investment agreement. Delta took this approach during the 2000s when it acquired stakes in China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited Air France-KLM S.A. Korean Air Co. Ltd. Virgin Atlantic and LATAM Airlines. Delta invested a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic which proved to be its most successful outcome in this type of strategy. Virgin Atlantic provided Delta greater access to several transatlantic routes while Delta opened access to several popular US destinations previously unavailable to Virgin Atlantic. This type of strategy however could be risky for the investor who was also exposed to severe potential losses. In early 2020 for example Delta invested $1.9 billion for a 20 per cent stake in LATAM; a few months later this investment was worth less than one-tenth of that amount at approximately $150 million after the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 26 2020.Managing Star Alliance The combined management of Star Alliance was a challenge with a large number of global airlines that included United and Lufthansa two of the largest and most powerful airlines in the world. United’s chairman Gerard Greenwald noted that Star Alliance was “bound together only by four pages of governance with no formal ownership ties.” In fact no formal structure was created to manage the alliance at the time of its creation.This situation changed the following year however when a new focused management team was charged with implementing a five-year business plan to be approved by Star Alliance’s member airlines. From then on strategic decisions would be directed by a core group of executives chosen by the alliance’s member airlines. The new management board reported to the chief executive board which dealt with issues of strategic importance. Star Alliance also formed several committees that were comprised of experts from member carriers and from the alliance itself. In 2019 Star Alliance became a corporation under German law (i.e. a GmbH) with a limited staff and offices in Frankfurt Airport in Germany (see Exhibit 6).Quality ControlProviding customers with a consistent quality of service regardless of which airline they travelled with was a key success factor for Star Alliance. The five founding members therefore set rigorous standards that were expected to be met by any new member. While members did not maintain a completely homogeneous product Star did have a set of standards with regard to the quality of basic amenities and services that were met by all incoming member airlines.A new member typically had previous partnerships with each of the other member carriers individually. This precaution ensured that code sharing could be implemented right away. No other requirements for partnerships outside of the alliance were needed. However when airlines joined Star Alliance they often abandoned their previous partnerships or integrated them into the constellation.Brand ManagementIn founding Star Alliance the members created a brand name that would become known internationally but would not become a substitute for their existing brands. Members did not lose the individual airlines’ differentiation by brands identities customs and service styles. The main advantage of the alliance network was its ability to give passengers access to a single global network that was as seamless as possible along with the established status and recognition of the member airlines. Star Alliance managers used an umbrella brand that allowed each airline to keep the original logo complemented by the Star Alliance logo on the plane’s forward fuselage and on ticket jackets promotional items and signs.By 2020 the three major alliance umbrella brands—Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam—served as a signal for the level of service and the breadth of network that customers could expect. However the individual performance of each member airline still mattered. If a customer had a poor experience on a flight both the reputation of that airline and the reputation of the alliance could be harmed.Over the early years of Star’s existence the absence of core values service styles and products within the alliance did not pose an issue for member performance. Passengers seemed unconcerned about differences in travel experience with separate airlines perhaps because all members were well respected airlines in their own right. Since 2017 the alliance had developed a digital transformation strategy aimed at delivering a distinct and seamless travel experience.Alliance Organizational Costs Star Alliance’s costs were mainly related to information technology and human resources. Making member reservations and inventory systems compatible with each another was the main challenge. After nearly two decades of efforts and investments in new technology and training Star Alliance had built and was maintaining an advanced technology infrastructure to support the operations of its carriers and the seamless transition of passengers between member carriers.Star Alliance continued to spend resources and effort to help members deliver consistent services across the alliance. Similarly Oneworld developed an intensive training program for its members. At the heart of that program was a set of core messages agreed to by the partners including “recognizing people as individuals and respect for individuals while celebrating the different cultures and atmospheres between the airlines.”Future of Airline Constellations Industry ConsolidationDespite a complex web of regulations the global airline industry had steadily moved toward long-term consolidation as airline constellations continued to expand by adding members to their networks. With additional airlines joining existing alliances the overlap in route structures of member airlines kept increasing. This factor was a key consideration for incumbent members in their assessment of new applicants for membership.Entry and exit from an airline constellation depended on the terms of the membership. For example at Star Alliance an airline that wanted to enter the network had to show that it could meet the alliance’s standards. Existing members voted on accepting a new member with voting shares based on the size of each airline. By 2020 Star Alliance had become a mature alliance organization that had developed a stable membership base a standard set of rules and efficient processes. The three major alliances had reached a comparable level of market share in the industry. Airline mergers and co-operation had also reached a saturation point. Further consolidation of airline organizations would likely face strong opposition due to antitrust regulations.Potential Changes in the Hub-and-Spoke ModelSince its inception the main focus of Star Alliance had been to optimize the hub-and-spoke network of the airline industry which it saw as a key benefit. However beginning in 2015 point-to-point flights seemed to be increasingly popular especially ultra long-haul flights (LHF).With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the advantages of LHFs became increasingly evident for two reasons. First unlike with the hub-and-spoke system point-to-point networks allowed airlines the choice of flying only the most economically viable routes without health and safety concerns from layovers. Second by the late 2010s new planes were being developed for non-stop ultra LHFs. However despite these advantages LHFs still had two major limitations. First due to the long-distance nature of their routes the profitability for airlines was even more vulnerable to extreme fuel price fluctuations. Second fatigue posed a serious health threat to passengers flight crews and pilots on these routes. The PandemicThe greatest challenge for the airline industry however was the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis was expected to reach a total loss of $84.3 billion for the industry in 2020 with passenger demand falling to 54 per cent globally (see Exhibit 7). During the early months of the pandemic from January to July 2020 over 7.5 million flights were cancelled. In April 2020 64 per cent of all planes around the world were grounded. The drop in demand and required social distancing in seat assignment led to a decline in passenger load for those flights that were not cancelled. In addition new safety and health compliance costs promised to have a serious impact on the cost structure of all airlines.Before the COVID-19 outbreak the airline industry was projected to continue on its course of consistent growth. In most emerging markets and developed countries trips per capita were expected to increase steadily from 2019 to 2038. Popular regional routes were also expected to see strong passenger growth. The highest rate of growth was expected between the Middle East and the United States with a projected passenger traffic increase of 5.5 per cent annually from 2019 to 2038. In response to the new COVID-19 travel restrictions airlines designated new routes between certain countries that were labelled “corridors.” Many national governments also expanded investments in their country’s airlines or provided other forms of support such as unemployment benefits. There was great uncertainty about how the pandemic would evolve and how businesses worldwide would respond. Travel projections from organizations such as the International Air Transport Association changed often with new information related to the COVID-19 virus. In June 2020 passenger levels were forecasted to not recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 and the global fleet in service might not recover until 2022. The crisis affected all global airlines and had a major impact on the world’s two main aircraft manufacturers Boeing Company and Airbus SE. Major airlines were expected to significantly reduce their purchase of new aircraft during the 2020–2025 period by as much as 6000 fewer products than had been projected—an annual reduction in purchases of 66 per cent.Individual Airline ResponsesThe first major response by the world’s airlines was to lobby for increased government support and funding. By August 2020 governments around the world had provided over $125 billion in financing for domestic airlines with an additional $30 billion expected in the coming months. The US government in particular had provided $58 billion through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act in March 2020 with an additional $25 billion expected before the end of the year. Of this aid $25 billion was given in the form of loans for general expenses and an additional $25 billion was provided in the form of grants to cover payroll expenses. These loans were extended with rather severe conditions placed on executive pay and dividends.This aid was not extensive enough to prevent massive airline layoffs after the support period was over as passenger demand continued to falter throughout 2020. The three largest airlines in the United States—each one a founding member of Star Alliance Oneworld or SkyTeam—announced record layoffs as the government’s financial support ran out. In the summer of 2020 American Airlines Inc. released over 19000 employees representing almost 20 per cent of the company’s workforce and Delta planned to lay off almost 2000 pilots. United announced that it expected to lay off up to 36000 employees by October 2020. The airline industry was clearly retrenching which presented a major challenge for alliance members: could they reduce capacity in a co-operative manner? Another consideration was the uneven governmental support for global airlines during the pandemic with different governments having different levels of interest in their national airlines. Some national airlines were expected to survive the crisis others would probably reduce the reach of their network and most airlines would undoubtedly be indebted to their respective government. How would these trends affect the management and membership of global constellations such as Star Alliance?Star Alliance’s ResponseAlliances played a key role in the industry’s response to the pandemic. For example Star Alliance created a travel information hub that provided health precautions and general information about COVID-19 to all passengers. The alliance also created a set of health and safety procedures for its member airlines to follow that included regulations for passenger use of face masks cleaning and disinfecting requirements and operating steps to follow if a passenger developed COVID-19 symptoms. These actions were intended to increase the level of comfort of passengers. However the normal rate of air travel was not expected to recover for several years after the eventual end of the pandemic. Before the outbreak of the pandemic Star Alliance had been facing various questions about its future. For example the constellation had to determine whether it should continue to grow by introducing new services to extend offerings to its loyal passengers or maybe allow individual airlines to operate more freely as separate entities under the umbrella brand. Within its network the alliance had to determine if joint venture partnerships should continue to grow or if the benefits were no longer relevant. However all questions about structure and strategy had been set aside as the world faced its worst health crisis in over a century. The main question for Star Alliance now became one of survival. What could the alliance do to help its members weather the COVID-19 crisis? It clearly did not have the funds to provide support like governments could. But it could help rebuild the trust of customers and promote safe travel arrangements. Beyond that level of assistance what would Star Alliance’s role be at the end of the pandemic?Exhibit 1: Operations of Star Alliance Member Airlines 2018Note: RPK = revenue passenger kilometres; ASK = available seat kilometres.

(Berkshire Hathaway) had grown by leaps and bounds in various sectors including financial services insurance real estate utilities energy and diversified manufacturing sectors. The company had become a conglomerate of more than 80 operating entities spread into various strata of business.Since 1965 Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares had on average grown by almost 21 per cent per year as measured against the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 which itself had grown an average of 10 per cent per year. Thus the company had achieved growth more than double the S&P index.The company existed as a primordial example of value-driven growth but one with distinctive facets attributable not only to its phenomenal growth but also to its dividend policy. From its formation in 1955 until 2017 Berkshire Hathaway had never paid shareholders in the form of a cash dividend; yet the company’s share price was among the highest in the world. The company had been a staunch propagator of not paying dividends and had preferred to reinvest earnings in business. This approach was the result of the strategic outlook of the company’s chairman Warren Buffet. Considered by Graham & Doddsville as a “superinvestor” who focused on value investing Buffet was able to steer Berkshire Hathaway to an overall gain of 1088029 per cent in book value per share (see Exhibit 1).However at Berkshire Hathaway’s May 2017 annual general meeting Buffett reportedly said:A time could come reasonably soon even while I am around when Berkshire will have more cash than it can reasonably and profitably deploy. And Berkshire may choose to return those funds with additional stock buybacks or it could be dividends. Thus questions arose as to what factors were influencing the dividend paradigm of the company in 2017 and whether the company should heed Buffett’s suggestion and pay a dividend. COMPANY INFORMATIOnHistoryIn 1929 Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company merged with Valley Falls Company and formed Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. In 1955 Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Company and formed Berkshire Hathaway. Seabury Stanton who was experienced in the operations rather than strategy headed this new company. But local and international competition along with the falling prices of cotton turned the company’s future grey. In 1961 Berkshire Hathaway had to reduce its operational days to four days a week at many plants due to the continued losses year after year.In 1963 Buffett and his associates were purchasing Berkshire Hathaway shares because Buffett expected profit from a forecasted buyback. By 1965 Buffett and his associates held significant shares in the company. Stanton who wanted to strengthen his family control wished to buy back shares from Buffet and agreed to a price of US$11.50 per share; however in the official offer letter Stanton sent he quoted a price of $11.37½ per share. Stanton’s letter angered Buffett who was purchasing a major stake in the company. Subsequently Buffett and his associates took over the company’s management. At that time the company had 2300 employees and two mills. In 1969 Buffett became the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and the company continued with a strategy of diversification. In 1987 the Wall Street Journal reported that Berkshire Hathaway’s stock had surpassed the Dow Jones average. On October 19 of the same year (later known as Black Monday) the stock market crashed. Berkshire Hathaway however managed to survive the collapse and by 1988 Berkshire Hathaway which had been trading over the counter as off-exchange stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. At listing its highest price was $4300 per share which was a significant increase from the price of $7.50 per share that Buffett had paid in 1962.AcquisitionsIn 1967 as the first step in moving away from the cyclical nature of the textile industry which was unable to yield stable profits the company purchased the National Indemnity Company and the National Fire & Marine Insurance Company. The purchased companies primarily dealt with automobile insurance which was more stable than the textile industry.In 1968 Berkshire Hathaway acquired Sun Newspapers a group of Omaha weeklies. The next year the company acquired Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Company based in Rockford (Chicago) Illinois. The company continued its acquisitions acquiring Wesco Financial Corporation in 1970. The company also continued its foray into the newspaper business acquiring what was then the Buffalo Evening News.In 1985 Berkshire Hathaway closed the last textile mill thus marking its exit from the textile industry. The company also continued its growth making monumental acquisitions that included companies such as Blue Chip Stamps a loyalty program; Nebraska Furniture Mart one of the largest home furnishing stores in North America; the Scott Fetzer Company manufacturer of the well-known Kirby vacuums World Book reference materials and other products for the home; and the Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company.At the end of the 1980s Berkshire Hathaway acquired a significant portion of the shares of many well-known and established companies such as Gillette Corporation US Airways Group the Coca-Cola Company and forest products enterprise Champion International Corporation.In 1996 Berkshire Hathaway achieved a major milestone with its insurance business acquiring the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). That acquisition and the company’s other investment decisions sent Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price to $36000 per share.The company continued with valuable and diverse acquisitions as the calendar turned to the 21st century. Prominent companies among these acquisitions were Benjamin Moore & Co. and Johns Manville in 2001; Shaw Industries Group Inc. and Pampered Chef Ltd. in 2002; McLane Company Inc. in 2003; Medical Protective (later MedPro Group) and Forest River Inc. in 2005; Russell Brands LLC Business Wire and Brooks Sports Inc. in 2006; TTI Inc. Clayton Homes and Boat Owners Association of the United States (Boat U.S.) in 2007; Cavalier Homes Inc. in 2008; Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC (BNSF Railway) in 2010; Lubrizol Corporation in 2011; Oriental Trading Company Inc. in 2012; television station WPLG and Charter Brokerage LLC in 2014; Louis Motorcycle Company in 2015; and Precision Castparts Corp. and Duracell Inc. in 2016. Share ClassBerkshire Hathaway had two classes of shares—Class A and Class B—trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares had existed even before Buffett took over the business. Berkshire Hathaway had never split those stocks. As of January 24 2018 approximately 11 per cent of the Class A shares were held by members of the general public; 48 per cent were held by institutions and 41 per cent by insider investors. At the end of 2017 the average price of Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stocks was $297600 per share.The Class B shares were created in 1996. They gave the Class A shareholders the right to convert each Class A share into 30 Class B shares. The intention was to allow small investors to hold a stake in the company—a response to the threat of financial entrepreneurs who were attempting to create alternative investment vehicles. On January 21 2010 each Class B share was split into 50 shares thus increasing the number of Class B shares in circulation. As of January 24 2018 approximately 35 per cent of Berkshire Hathaway’s Class B shares were held by members of the general public; 47 per cent were held by institutions and 19 per cent by insider investors. At the end of 2017 the average price of Berkshire Hathaway’s Class B stocks was $200 per share.DIVIDEND POLICYBuffett’s strategy was to make it a priority to diligently reinvest earnings in the company’s existing multi-sector businesses. In 2012 Berkshire Hathaway made capital expenditures of $12.1 billion in current businesses and new acquisitions. Buffet also highlighted Berkshire Hathaway’s presence in numerous sectors which provided the company with varied options showing that the company was in a strategically advantageous position.Buffet’s principles were articulated in a two-step priority which made it clear that funds would not be used for dividend payments: (1): The first priority with available funds would always be to evaluate whether they could be diligently reinvested in the existing businesses; (2): The next step was to search for acquisitions unrelated to the current businesses. Buffet considered another valid use of funds to be share repurchase at a fair price. The company employed a share repurchase option under which the shares would be repurchased at a premium up to 120 per cent of book value. Buffett considered the share repurchase option to be a better alternative to a dividend payment.ExampleTo emphasize why the repurchase option might be better Buffett provided an example with two scenarios. Assume there were two equal owners of a business with a net worth of $2 million. If the return on net worth was 12 per cent per annum the earnings would be $240000 per year. Assume there also existed a buyer who had agreed to buy into the company at a value of 125 per cent of net worth. The offer thus implied that the market value for the company would be $2.5 million and each individual share would be worth $1.25 million.Scenario A: Pay Out One-Third of the Earnings as a Dividend and Reinvest the Remaining Two-ThirdsThis scenario reflected the preference of investors who wanted a balanced investment policy that catered to both current income and capital appreciation. In year zero one-third of the earnings ($240000 × 1/3 = $80000) would be paid to the owners as a dividend which gave each of them an income of $40000. After payment the company would be left with $160000 to reinvest in the business. Earnings would continue to grow and dividends would increase proportionately. Thus dividends and earnings would grow by 8 per cent per annum (12 per cent earned on net worth less 4 per cent paid out from net worth).After 10 years the company’s net worth would be $4317850—the result of the original $2 million compounded at 8 per cent per annum. The dividend payment would be $86357. The market value of each individual’s holding would be $2698656.Scenario B: Sell OffThis scenario reflected Buffet’s philosophy and was followed by Berkshire Hathaway.Under this scenario there would be no dividend payment and the entire earnings would be reinvested in the business. In order to maintain an income without dividends each owner would sell 3.2 per cent of their respective holding. Based on the prospective buyer’s offer the sale would earn 125 per cent of the shares’ book value. So in year zero each owner would be able to earn the same $40000 from the sale of shares ($2.5 million × 3.2 per cent ÷ 2). At the same time the entire earnings of $240000 would be reinvested in the company which has a growth rate of 12 per cent per annum. After 10 years the company’s net worth would be $6211696—the result of the original $2 million compounded at 12 per cent per annum. Because the owners had been selling shares each year the percentage of each owner’s share would have dropped. After 10 years each owner would hold 36.12 per cent of the business which would amount to a value of $2243665. The market value would be 125 per cent of the net worth meaning the market value of the individual shares would amount to $2804425. Thus the sell-off scenario while providing the owners with their required income added more value to the capital—approximately $105770 more than with the dividend scenario.Buffet’s other argument against paying dividends considered the needs of individual shareholders. When a company paid a dividend it decided the amount that each shareholder would receive. Thus dividend payments permitted the company to decide the shareholder’s income. For example if a company decided to pay out 40 per cent of the earnings any shareholder who wanted income amounting to 50 per cent or 60 per cent would be dismayed. The sell-off option however allowed shareholders to sell their shares in accordance with their income requirement.To reassert the philosophy of sell off as a substitute for dividend Buffett revealed that from 2005 until 2012 he had annually divested 4.25 per cent of his shares. Thus his original holdings of 712497000 B-equivalent shares were decreased to 528525623 shares—a loss of almost 26 per cent. However even though the percentage of Buffet’s ownership had decreased the book value of his holdings had increased significantly from $28.2 billion for 2005 to $40.2 billion for 2012—a gain of over 140 per cent.CURRENT FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DIVIDEND DECISIONAs of the end of 2017 Berkshire Hathaway was in possession of $115.95 billion in cash and short-term investments. Buffett had accepted that these investments had earned a pittance. Keeping so much money in the bank decreased the real value of the reserves because the yield on the cash balances was less than the inflation rate. A portfolio manager calculated that Berkshire Hathaway was in a position to pay a one-time dividend of $20 billion and still be left with enough cash to cover future investment requirements.Buffett acknowledged that many potential acquisitions had been reviewed in 2016 but rich valuations inhibited the deals. Therefore Buffett could not identify any promising stocks that could be purchased at a fair price. Berkshire Hathaway had planned a massive acquisition of Unilever NV through a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary the Kraft Heinz Company but misunderstandings between Unilever and Kraft Heinz led Kraft Heinz to withdraw its bid.Buffet had said that his inclination was toward share repurchase instead of a cash dividend payment because a dividend payment implied a promise of payment forever. However Berkshire Hathaway’s share repurchase offer was applicable only when shares hit 120 per cent of book value and early in 2018 both the Class A and Class B shares were trading near 170 per cent—far above the company’s limit for repurchase.DECISIONConsidering the history of Berkshire Hathaway and Buffet’s historical investment strategy what would you recommend the company do with almost $116 billion in cash and cash-equivalent reserves? Are Buffet’s strategic reasons for not paying dividends sustainable? Is the company’s share repurchase plan still a viable alternative to a dividend? Looking at Berkshire Hathaway’s financials (see Exhibits 2–4) if you were in Buffet’s position would you alter the dividend policy or leave it unaltered?

We wanted a campaign that expressed our brand values that went beyond tokenism or photo opportunities something daring and provocative that tackled taboos. This is what attracted us to the idea pitched by . . . Y Films which saw us      creating an ad with a band of transgender musicians called 6 Pack Band.Shiva Krishnamurthy general manager beverages Hindustan Unilever LimitedIn January 2016 the 113-year-old tea brand Brooke Bond Red Label (Red Label) a sub-brand of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) created a groundbreaking advertising campaign that launched India’s first transgender pop band 6 Pack Band. The campaign comprised six videos that were conceptualized by media and marketing services company Mindshare India along with its unit Mindshare Fulcrum and Y Films. The campaign also featured Bollywood celebrities won numerous awards and managed to reach over 25 million people in just six months. By mid-2016 Red Label’s 6 Pack Band was clearly hitting the right notes with its target audience but questions began to be raised about the future of the campaign: What should the brand do next? Should it create more content around 6 Pack Band or abandon it altogether? Should the firm seek out other relevant and thought-provoking social issues for advertising purposes? If so which issues should it address and how?Hindustan Unilever Limited HUL the Indian subsidiary of Anglo–Dutch fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Unilever was one of the largest players in the Indian FMCG sector and a market leader in most of the categories in which it competed. Its product range extended over 20 categories that included soaps shampoos detergents beverages ice cream skincare and oral care (see Exhibit 1). HUL had the largest number of brands featured in the “100 Most Trusted Brands” list for 2015 published by The Economic Times Brand Equity. HUL’s net revenue for fiscal year 2015/16 was nearly US$4.7 billion an increase of about 4 per cent over the previous year. Brooke Bond Red LabelTea was of particular importance to HUL’s beverage portfolio because India was a tea-drinking nation with 90 per cent market penetration. HUL was a market leader in the $1.46 billion Indian tea market and its beverage portfolio comprised tea brands Red Label Taj Mahal Taaza 3 Roses and Lipton. Brooke Bond had entered the Indian market in 1900 and launched its Red Label tea in 1903. The company was acquired by HUL through an international acquisition in 1984. According to HUL’s 2015/16 annual report five of its brands (Lux Dove Clinic Plus Ponds and Vim) had sales above $150 million and six (Surf Excel Brooke Bond Wheel Rin Lifebuoy and Fair & Lovely) had sales above $300 million. Brooke Bond was the only brand from the company’s food and refreshment category with sales over $300 million. Marketing CommunicationsIndia’s FMCG sector boasted more advertising and marketing spending than any other with HUL being the largest contributor to the sector. HUL’s advertising and promotion spending in the first quarter of 2016 was $169 million a 22.06 per cent increase over the same quarter of the previous year (see Exhibit 2). Over the previous 10 years digital media had grown substantially to become an integral component of Indian consumers’ media consumption habits. According to research done by eMarketer a New York-based research company digital media accounted for 12.6 per cent of total advertising expenditure in India in 2015 and this was likely to increase to 14.3 per cent (i.e. over $1 billion) by 2017 (see Exhibit 3). One report from the Internet and Mobile Association of India and KPMG stated that India would have 500 million Internet users and 314 million mobile Internet users by 2017 (see Exhibit 4). This switch to digital formats drove companies to create content that was able to entertain engage and connect with the target audience; as such HUL used innovative communications to tell compelling brand stories that resonated with consumers’ lives. Corporate Goal Brand Purpose and Brand Communications Unilever adopted the corporate goal to “make sustainable living commonplace” in 2010. Since then the corporation had undertaken numerous projects in the areas of sanitation hygiene and nutrition across the globe. Some of Unilever’s brands (e.g. Knorr Dove Lipton and Domestos) had been categorized as “sustainable living brands” because they had “integrated sustainability into both their purpose and products” (see Exhibit 5). These brands grew twice as fast as others in the company’s portfolio and contributed to half of its overall growth. Evidently consumers preferred to purchase brands that delivered social benefit as well as ensured product performance and affordability. According to Unilever’s chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed “One of our core beliefs is that you cannot have a healthy business in an unhealthy society.” Unilever’s sustainable living brands contributed towards its goal of doubling business while simultaneously reducing its environmental footprint and increasing its positive impact. In a developing market like India Unilever’s subsidiary HUL adopted unique marketing approaches that ensured an increase in product consumption and fulfilment of a larger societal purpose. The firm’s “Swasthya Chetna” (“Health Awakening”) program (launched under HUL’s Lifebuoy brand) was India’s largest health and hygiene education program; it educated people on the importance of hygiene in preventing illness by adopting a simple handwashing regime. With Dove HUL hoped to “create a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety for women.” In 2016 Dove launched its “Let’s Break the Rules of Beauty” campaign aiming to redefine the existing standards of beauty and inspire Indian consumers to embrace diversity.Brooke Bond aligned its communications with the vision of its founder Arthur Brooke who had chosen the name “Bond” to signify the bond between the brand and its consumers. Red Label’s brand proposition “Swad Apnepan Ka” (“Taste of Togetherness”) showcased moments of bringing people from diverse backgrounds and cultures together over a cup of tea. The brand had attempted to bring about behavioural change among its target audience by creating purpose-based communications highlighting issues related to relationships bridging the Hindu–Muslim divide and fostering gender equality. Shiva Krishnamurthy of HUL’s beverage segment emphasized that “Great brands need to stand for a purpose and have a point of view. Red Label is about bringing people together and [we believe] that a tasty cup of tea can play a role in doing so.” THE BROOKE BOND Red Label CAMPAIGN: 6 Pack BANDCampaign Idea–Content DayHUL used a mix of both traditional and digital media for reaching its target audience. While it used mass media like television radio and print to address social issues that reverberated with a wider audience profile the firm relied on digital media for more thought-provoking content. The success of a digital campaign required the creation of content that was “talkable” original and relatable. According to Unilever’s media director for South Asia “Unless consumers really like what you have done there is no reason for them to share it.” This context which valued original and engaging content led HUL (along with its media agency Mindshare India) to organize “Content Day” where content creators from across the country were invited to pitch their ideas for HUL brands. The “Content Day” held in Mumbai on June 12 2015 saw participation by some 35–40 content partners with producers platforms radio channels television networks digital platforms and social media platforms all vying with each other to pitch their ideas for various HUL brands. Y Films the “youth wing” of Yash Raj Films presented an idea of creating a transgender music band for the Red Label brand (see Exhibit 6). When the idea was first floated within Y Films company insiders believed it was too radical and feared that Unilever would never support such a bold idea. Their fears were not without reason; Red Label tea was sold across India from metropolitan cities to Tier 2 and 3 cities. It was possible that the idea of a brand-promoting transgender band would appeal to open-minded millennials residing in the metropolitan cities but the idea could also alienate the brand’s more traditional users.However contrary to the detractors’ beliefs HUL conceded; they felt Red Label could be meaningfully integrated with this kind of content. The campaign was designed to address the stigma attached to the “third gender” by bringing about behavioural change among the target audience; it also enabled the brand to demonstrate its credo of making the world a more welcoming place. To this end the idea of a transgender band gave parent company HUL the opportunity to align with Unilever’s global #UNSTEREOTYPE campaign a movement to remove from its advertising all forms of gender-based lesbian gay bisexual and transgender (LGBT) stereotypes.Campaign DesignThe idea of a transgender band was ground breaking but it came with its own set of difficulties. HUL and Mindshare India did not want the concept to be a short-lived “one-hit wonder” or to seem like something done merely for the sake of getting attention. They were aware that if the idea of a transgender band was not handled with sensitivity and care there was the possibility of grave consumer backlash. Once HUL approved the idea of the band Y Films faced a major challenge: finding the right transgender talent. This task was particularly difficult because of the scarcity of transgender actors and artists. For six months the agency searched extensively across metropolitan cities and small towns using formal and informal methods to identify the right candidates. Auditions and talks with pro-LGBT non-governmental organizations like Humsafar Trust were conducted along with interactions with people who had worked on books and documentaries concerning transgender issues. The team looked for candidates that had the right screen presence voice and attitude and finally chose six members for Red Label’s 6 Pack Band: Asha Jagtap Bhavika Patil Chandni Suvarnakar Fida Khan Komal Jagtap and Ravina Jagtap. The band then received nine months of intensive training that included pronunciation and voice modulation. Y Films hired a choreographer an award-winning stylist and the Bollywood singer Sonu Nigan to transform the group into pop stars. Campaign Rollout The first music video by 6 Pack Band “Hum Hain Happy” (“We Are Happy”) was launched on YouTube Indian radio stations and streaming applications (apps) in January 2016. With this launch HUL Mindshare India and Y Films introduced India’s first transgender band—6 Pack Band. The band soon released five more music videos featuring Indian movie stars Hrithik Roshan Arjun Kapoor and Salman Khan as well as singers Zanai Bhole and Sonu Nigam. While “Hum Hain Happy” was inspired by Pharrell Williams’ song “Happy” and focused on the happy-go-lucky attitude of the transgender community the second video “Sab Rab De Bande” (“All Are Creatures of God”) showcased the ridicule and rejection that members of the transgender community often faced not only from the general public but also from their family members. The song was inspired by a couplet from the Guru Granth Sahib the sacred religious scripture for Sikhs and conveyed the touching message that all are equal in the eyes of God irrespective of caste community or gender (see Exhibit 7).According to Ashish Patel of Y Films “Gender equality is not about male versus female; it is much broader and this idea had to be conveyed to the younger generation in a way that was acceptable to them.” The company wanted to ensure that the videos were distinctly different from traditional forms of advertisement so the use of branding was subtle. In the video for “Hum Hain Happy” a number of red props were used to suggest Red Label’s brand colour. Likewise in the video for “Sab Rab De Bande” band members wore red saris and the video ended with the actors enjoying tea in red cups.  Product placement was ensured through similarly subtle cues in the video including a Red Label painting that appeared on a storefront and a tile of the brand. In “Sab Rab De Bande” the brand’s message was integrated into the lyrics: “Let us learn from the tea leaves that do not change colour with respect to caste or religion” and further “Everyone takes the same sugar.” Another key phrase used in the lyrics was “Chal chaai peete hain” (“Come let’s have some tea”). Acceptability Engagement and AwardsHUL Mindshare India and Y Films won numerous awards and accolades for 6 Pack Band. According to HUL’s website “People became aware of the brand’s purpose and more importantly sales of the brand rose as a result of the campaign although [this period] was not bereft of other Brooke Bond marketing activities.” The campaign won top honours at the 63rd Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity (held in France) and won the prestigious Glass Lion prize in a category introduced to recognize culture-shifting work that positively impacted gender inequality and injustice. The video for “Hum Hain Happy” was selected as an Honoree for public service and activism by the Webby Awards which recognized excellence on the Internet. The overall campaign also won six gold trophies at the Advertising Club’s EMVIES 2016 held in Mumbai.A Millward Brown study revealed the following statistics about the 6 Pack Band campaign:Brand awareness reached 59 per cent in key geographic areas. Within these areas 70 per cent of respondents were able to correctly link the band to Red Label tea.The consideration score of Red Label reached 69 per cent.Brand penetration increased by over 400 basis points during the campaign’s duration.Of all “views” of the campaign 60 per cent occurred through mobile technology with further sharing happening across social media apps like WhatsApp Facebook Messenger and Google+.The band’s videos achieved an engagement rate of over 2 per cent compared to the industry benchmark of 1.07 per cent. The content on Red Label’s Facebook page had an engagement score of 981 out of 1000—a first for the brand.The band’s videos garnered over 10 million views on YouTube within three months after their launch with organic viewership reaching 25 per cent against an industry average of 11 per cent. The videos also streamed on various popular apps including Gaana Hungama Wynk and Saavn. One of the videos organically trended on Saavn and landed on its masthead. The video featuring Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan managed to achieve 100 per cent organic views.The band had over 2 million views on Facebook and earned the company a total public relations value of ₹100 million. The band also performed at a number of major events including the prestigious Royal Stag Mirchi Music Awards presented annually for excellence in music. the ROAD AHEADRed Label’s 6 Pack Band had managed to strike the right chord with its intended audience. The brand was able to leverage a bold idea and weave it into its brand’s story. The innovative communication enhanced sales awareness of the brand’s purpose and also won awards. However the promotion’s success raised questions about the future. What should Brooke Bond Red Label do next?

The “Hijras” as they were referred to in India led a difficult life often abandoned by their families at a very young age; they lived in slums and red light areas. Subjected to ridicule and abuse transgender persons primarily earned their living by visiting houses where births or marriages took place to shower blessings on the newborn child or newlyweds in exchange for money (which depended on the status of the household). Their blessings were considered auspicious. However as society evolved and subsequent generations began to disregard traditions the transgender community had to look for additional avenues for income. Lack of societal acceptance and low literacy levels forced most of them into prostitution and begging. On the bright side irrespective of their misfortune and humiliation the transgender community seemed happy and carefree. It was this perception that became the key insight for the first music video “Hum Hain Happy.” In recent years acceptability of the transgender community increased. The landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of India in 2014 granting legal status to the third gender has been a big step in this direction.Source: Created by the case authors based on “Transgender in India” Census 2011 accessed May 1 2017 https://www.hul.co.in/Images/hul-annual-report-2013-14_tcm1255-436326_en.pdf; Rema Nagarajan “First Count of Third Gender in Census: 4.9 lakh” Times of India May 30 2014 accessed May 1 2017 http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/First-count-of-third-gender-in-census-4-9-lakh/articleshow/35741613.cms; Dhananja Mahapatra “Supreme Court Recognizes Transgenders as ‘Third Gender’” Times of India April 15 2014 accessed December 10 2016 http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Supreme-Court-recognizes-transgenders-as-third-gender/articleshow/33767900.cms.Exhibit 7: ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF “SAB RAB DE BANDE”Source: Translated by the case authors.endnotes",0,,,,

It was the last week of September 2015 and the staff at JSW Steel Ltd. (JSW) was busy planning and setting targets for the next quarter. Kumar had recently been promoted to the post of assistant general manager to spearhead customer relations and logistics planning at JSW. In the next few hours he needed to submit his report to the board recommending whether to continue transporting steel coils using the company’s own logistics department or to outsource the work to Barn & Co. a convenient yet costlier option.On the day of any other board meeting Kumar would not have been nervous but this time he knew that even the slightest error in logistics planning would mean that customers would leave the company and take their business to foreign competitors. Given the changing competitive landscape and growing uncertainties Kumar was under immense pressure from the logistics team to outsource the transport of steel coils to Barn & Co. However his own thoughts were aligned toward JSW continuing to transport the steel coils keeping JSW’s goodwill in mind. With less than six hours remaining for the meeting he needed to re-evaluate the options and make a final decision.THE COMPANYJSW was one of India’s largest steelmakers with five manufacturing plants across the nation. The company generated annual revenues of ₹465.5409 billion in 2015 and continued its legacy of being the leader in the steel industry. The company’s largest plant was situated in Toranagallu a village near the Bellary district in the southern state of Karnataka India and stood as a testimony to the company’s commitment and dedication to India’s fast-paced and low-cost steel production. It produced a variety of customized steel products such as hot-rolled (HR) coils cold-rolled coils thermo-mechanically treated bars wire rods sheets galvanized sheets and galvalume sheets. JSW also produced colour-coated sheets in different sizes and texture-forms in its other plants. The Toranagallu plant manufactured special grades of steel that were extensively used in high-end applications such as the manufacturing of large-diameter pipes prefabricated metal structures and components for the auto sector. The plant was strategically located close to the ports of Goa Chennai and Mumbai. In accordance with its corporate vision and core values the company wanted to be the front-runner in sustainable steelmaking and had best-in-class practices for ensuring quality steel products and services. It had received numerous awards for its initiatives and for inculcating a greener philosophy among its employees processes and products. The result of one such initiative was its “green” supply chain on which the company heavily relied to reduce its carbon footprint and thus contribute constructively to the cause of the environment. The business model helped to create social societal and monetary wealth for the company. The company made every possible effort to supply materials to its domestic customers through the existing road and rail networks and the newly adopted sea routes. STEELMAKING AND PIPE MANUFACTURINGJSW followed the best practices in steelmaking and adopted advanced technologies to optimize its production. The company used iron ore coke and limestone in a blast furnace or a Corex and the end product of this reduction process was molten hot metal and slag. The process of extracting the hot metal and slag from either of these furnaces was called tapping. The tapped slag became the raw material for JSW’s cement production facility and the tapped hot metal was used to produce steel. The hot metal was further processed by blowing through pure oxygen (liquid oxygen of 99.97 per cent purity) to remove the excess carbon. Numerous alloying elements such as vanadium chromium nickel cobalt and titanium were further added to enhance the steel’s properties and features such that the resulting processing of this hot steel into slabs and subsequently into coils and sheets met the special purposes for which they were intended. The HR coils were then shipped to customers who used them for their business purposes such as manufacturing of pipes and tubes.The coils received by the pipe-manufacturing customers were put through a flattener and then welded at the edges through a fully automated process that usually consisted of submerged arc welding (SAW). This process required the coils to be clean to avoid strains in the welded joints. Moreover delivery of the HR coils needed to be as per the schedule as the set-up of these pipe manufacturers was done on per-order basis. The final products of SAW were pipes that were used to transport water from reservoirs supply natural gas and connect fuel lines around the world. Such usage was termed as being critical which led to precision in manufacturing.LOGISTICS PLANNINGJSW had partnered with the Indian Railways for the supply of its materials throughout the country. In 2014 JSW developed a sea-route option to ship the majority of its supplies to pipe manufacturers in western India. The operations were mostly centred at the Goa port that was owned by the company. Kumar was instrumental in developing the sea route and was able to achieve the company’s goal of sustainable supply-chain operations. Although the sea route was a giant step toward JSW’s green supply chain the logistics department faced challenges in operationalizing it.The major issue associated with the sea route was securing the availability of a suitable barge and dealing with the barge vendors (see Exhibit 1). Barge vendors were divided into two classes: Class I and Class II. Class I barge vendors had barges that could carry up to 10000 tons and they kept their barges clean. Although Class I barges delivered on time 80 per cent of the time the problem was that JSW (and others) had only a 30 per cent probability of securing a Class I barge. The Class II vendors had barges that could carry up to 8000 tons. These barges were mostly unclean as they carried materials such as coal and iron ore. Although Class II vendors were available most of the time unlike the Class I vendors they presented issues with on-time deliveries (which they accomplished only 35 per cent of the time). Kumar was aware of these facts and always planned accordingly but due to busy sea traffic the task was becoming increasingly difficult.KUMAR’S DECISIONJSW needed to ensure the availability of coils to its customers as per their agreement (see Exhibit 2). In recent years the domestic market had observed steel dumping from China and Kumar was aware that any customer dissatisfaction would result in loss of business. Although he had planned the previous deliveries meticulously the overall pressure on him was growing continuously. In addition the issues that constantly plagued his mind were the availability of barges the possibility of late deliveries and possible damages to the coils during transport. The JSW officials at the Goa port provided information on the availability of different types of barge vendors; however their accuracy was limited. In March 2015 the company received several complaints regarding order fulfilment which Kumar attributed to the lack of coordination and lack of information about the availability of barges at the Goa port. JSW’s management was not happy with the incident and had asked Kumar to evaluate the options of outsourcing all logistics to a reliable third party. During the 2015 Confederation of Indian Industries conference Kumar came across an agency that was recognized by the port officials and provided information on the availability of barge vendors that had a significantly high record of accuracy (see Exhibit 3). The agency operated throughout the country and provided this information at a premium. After giving much thought to the issue Kumar concluded that paying a premium to this agency for more accurate information on the availability of the barges could be a more viable option than outsourcing the entire operation. He further felt that he could negotiate the rate for this information from the agency at ₹250 per ton. In April 2015 Kumar received a letter from Barn & Co. an independent third-party logistics service provider expressing its desire to handle JSW’s logistics operations. The company had previously done business with JSW and it had proven its skills in providing vendor-managed supply support during the initial days of JSW’s sea route–based supplies. After a series of discussions Barn & Co. submitted a proposal to JSW (see Exhibit 4). Kumar felt that the cost involved was a little higher than the present expenses of ₹3080 per ton but the proposal if implemented could completely take the burden of logistics planning and material supply from the company. However Kumar was at a crossroads. On one hand he felt that going with Barn & Co. could help JSW streamline its operations; on the other hand he still felt that keeping the operations in-house would benefit JSW. Kumar was lost in thoughts when a beep on his phone drew his attention to the message he had just received. It was from Barn & Co. inquiring about the status of the proposal. Kumar thought of the following saying which he could not agree with more: “The mind is more sensible than the heart. If you are sure listen to your heart; if you are confused listen to your mind.”Exhibit 1: Barges used by JSW STEEl LTd. for the Sea routeSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: Agreement between JSW STEEL LTd. and its customerTo whomsoever it may concern:This letter is issued by XXXXXXX-customer name-XXXXXXX (henceforth mentioned as first party) to JSW Steel Ltd.

Ltd. (Ziwo) was faced with a series of urgent decisions. In 2008 Ziwo was the market leader of agricultural material retailors in Shenyang in Liaoning Province China. However the agricultural supply chain in China had changed rapidly due to the transition of Chinese cropland from decentralized to centralized distribution. As a middle link in this chain Ziwo’s market share was crowded by upstream suppliers and its margin was squeezed by downstream buyers. Meanwhile Ziwo was also in increasingly fierce competition with horizontal competitors and new entrants.Ziwo had suffered from a sharp decline of market share and income from 2008 to 2011. In this situation Yu considered integrating the supply chain vertically to survive the dilemma. As the CEO of Ziwo he had to answer some questions. First was it necessary for Ziwo to implement the vertical integration strategy to win back competitive advantages? Second which direction should the vertical integration strategy take— forward or backward? Third how could Ziwo achieve vertical integration under its current circumstance?The AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN IN CHINAAgricultural MaterialsAgricultural materials (AM) were the substances used in the process of agricultural production mainly fertilizer pesticide seeds and agricultural machinery. In China the basic agricultural materials were seeds fertilizer and pesticide all of which shared common market characteristics.Wide Product VarietyThe AM companies in China were not competitive. There were only a handful of seed companies in developed countries each with a large market share. However there were many seed companies in China (see Exhibit 1) each with only a small market share. The top 50 seed companies in China together only held 35 per cent of the market share. As a result there were numerous categories of seeds on the market. For instance an average of 35 kinds of corn seeds were nationally approved every year; a total of 420 types had been approved from 2004 to 2015 (see Exhibit 2). Among all the seed companies only 7 per cent of them had registered capital of more than ¥100 million (see Exhibit 3). Further with inadequate research resources and little intellectual property protection most seed companies invested just a mere 2 per cent of sales revenue in research and development—far below the international standard of 10 per cent. As a consequence there was little to no product homogeneity in seeds fertilizers or pesticides.Periodic Product DemandThe demand for agricultural materials was especially periodical and time-sensitive. Fertilizer for example was intensively used only before cultivation. Hence the fertilizer retailers needed to manage their inventory and distribution to respond to high demand before spring ploughing.Technical RequirementsThe proper selection and application of agricultural materials needed professional guidance. Pesticides had to be properly selected according to the type of agricultural product and when it was planted. As well the dosage and time of the application had to be precise.Agricultural ProductsAgricultural products (AP) were the commodities produced from cultivating plants and animals such as wheat and corn. In China the AP market for corn rice wheat and other grain crops had few sales channels and the products were often damaged in transport and storage.Limited Sales ChannelsFarm households provided most of the labour for producing agricultural products in China. Unlike larger AP enterprises in developed countries the individual farm households were unable to participate in a large-scale system of supply and demand. Instead they had one sales channel: grain traders. These were groups of local individual merchants who bought agricultural products from local farm households at low prices then sold them to granaries at a higher price to make their profit.Underdeveloped LogisticsSimilarly the logistics system in China was underdeveloped especially in the AP market. According to the State Grain Administration of China the unscientific operations of AP storage and transport damaged 8–10 per cent of the total grain output. The result was a massive loss of 15–20 million tons of agricultural products at a cost of ¥18–24 billion.The Agricultural Materials–Agricultural Products (AM–AP) Supply ChainUnlike the large farms in the United States which planted about 1000 acres per farm Chinese cropland was planted as farm household units. The average farm household cropland was less than 8 mu (about 1.3 acres or half of a hectare and thus highly decentralized. This strained what was already an underdeveloped logistics system which also took its toll on the supply chain. The result was a multi-level AM–AP supply chain that involved AM manufacturers wholesalers and retailers; and farm households grain traders small granaries and large granaries (see Exhibit 4).The AM portion of the supply chain consisted of four parts: AM manufacturers AM wholesalers AM retailers and farm households. The AM manufacturers produced agricultural materials such as seeds fertilizers and pesticide. The manufacturers commonly selected an AM wholesaler to sell the materials in city areas. The AM wholesalers in turn sold and distributed the materials to AM retailers in each small town. The AM retailers then sold the materials directly to local farm households in the rural area. Finally the farm households applied the seeds fertilizers pesticides and other agricultural materials to their cropland to produce corn rice wheat and other grain crops.The decentralized nature of cropland distribution meant that most AM retailers dealt with frequent demands for small orders from farm households. With the underdeveloped logistics system distribution of the agricultural materials through the whole materials portion of the supply chain also went through multiple hierarchies to meet the fragmented demand in time.The AP portion of the supply chain consisted of farm households grain traders small granaries and large granaries. Farm households both used agricultural materials and produced agricultural products. After harvesting the farm households sold their agricultural products to grain traders for income. Then grain traders transported the products to small granaries and the small granaries gathered and sold the products to large granaries. The decentralized cropland distribution meant that farm households harvested their crops in small quantities. With the multi-layered sales channel and poor logistics system agricultural products had to be collected through multiple market hierarchies from the grain traders to small and large granaries.ZIWOYu established Ziwo in 2001 as an AM retailer in Yu’s hometown Shenyang the largest city in Liaoning Province. Ziwo sold fertilizer pesticide seeds and other agricultural materials. Ziwo succeeded as a middle link in the local agricultural supply chain stocking products from upstream suppliers and selling products to downstream customers. Upstream SuppliersZiwo was too small a retailer to purchase directly from AM manufacturers so it needed to purchase products from AM wholesalers at their higher prices. Ziwo purchased its supply from Shuangfeng Agricultural Materials Sales Agency. Although upstream manufacturers and wholesalers made most of the profit in this supply chain Ziwo profited because agricultural materials were in short supply at the time. Downstream CustomersZiwo’s customers were farm households with small-scale croplands. Most of the farmers had limited education. Typically they purchased their agricultural materials from acquaintances and because the farmers were unable to distinguish among the products they purchased what their acquaintances recommended. The farmers were not brand loyal instead following choices made by those with experience and education such as village elders and local teachers.Ziwo targeted local customers from Yu’s hometown. In its first two years of business Ziwo’s major clients were Yu’s acquaintances. Yu himself lacked comprehensive knowledge of agricultural materials so he studied at Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Science. He could therefore provide Ziwo’s customers with qualified products and professional guidance. As a result Ziwo earned a good reputation and attracted continuous purchases from the local farmers. Ziwo started as a small AM retailer in the AM–AP supply chain but grew over the next few years. By 2006 Ziwo had become one of the largest AM retailers in Shenyang City.DEVELOPMENT DILEMMAZiwo’s good fortunes did not last long. In 2006 China implemented a series of laws and regulations that centralized the previously decentralized cropland distribution. Farm households that owned small-scale cropland were gradually replaced by agricultural cooperatives large grain production households and family farms (ALFs for short) that possessed large-scale cropland.These changes had considerable impact on the original AM–AP supply chain (see Exhibit 5) and led directly to a drop in Ziwo’s income (see Exhibit 6). Because their cropland was centralized and larger ALFs had more bargaining power which squeezed Ziwo’s profit margin. It also became worthwhile for AM manufacturers and wholesalers to sell products directly to the ALFs cutting out Ziwo the middleman. The manufacturers’ and wholesalers’ expanded business scope crowded Ziwo’s market space as well increasing the competition. The potential for profits drew even more new entrants into selling agricultural materials especially attracting local brokers with hometown advantages in geography and reputation. Ziwo did not have an effective solution to the problem of increasing competition from industrial market entrants. The competition had become cutthroat. The demand for agricultural materials in Shenyang City had remained stable; however the increasing number of retailers and increasing product homogeneity strengthened the market pressure. The demand and supply imbalance forced prices down which caused Ziwo great losses.By 2008 the disordered competition among AM manufacturers wholesalers retailers and local brokers had become fierce. Ziwo had cut prices to maintain its market share but by the end of 2011 Ziwo’s income had dropped to what it was when the company was started in 2001 (see Exhibit 6).VERTICAL INTEGRATION IN the AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAINThere was an old saying in China: “Poverty gives rise to the desire for change.” But how was Ziwo to change? Yu and his senior management team began sorting out the new AM–AP supply chain.The AM–AP Supply Chain in 2011There were no plans in the AM market to technically integrate the use of fertilizer pesticide and seeds. ALFs tried to reduce their cost of production by purchasing directly from AM manufacturers at a low price. However because AM manufacturing was not yet advanced in China the materials were commonly produced by different manufacturers. Thus ALFs were challenged in matching diverse products from different manufacturers for purchase. Also the technical services varied among the manufacturers increasing the quality risk for ALFs. The ALFs had their technical demands and AM manufacturers needed new sales channels to promote their products and gain market share.The AP market was also suffering. Low grain prices and limited sales channels had reduced farmers’ profits. Farm households with grain output too small to deal directly with large granaries had to trade at a lower price with grain traders. The ALFs although larger still were not gaining advantages with their product quantity because it did not meet the demand of large granaries. Therefore the farmers had to bear the cost of grain transportation and the risk with loss of product quality. The large granaries also suffered because the quality of the grain they collected varied and the layered supply process added significantly to their purchase cost.The Advantages of ZiwoZiwo had been in the AM–AP supply chain for 10 years. Yu was experienced and his company had some advantages. The qualified products and service Ziwo offered had earned the company a good reputation and a wide social network in Shenyang. And with Yu being a local his already rich social network had grown with his decade of working experience in the agricultural industry.Ziwo also offered expertise in agriculture. From the beginning Yu kept learning acquiring a great deal of agricultural knowledge and becoming an agricultural expert. During his study Yu also met many agricultural experts such as Yang Na a professor at Shenyang Agricultural University and Liang Chen a professor at the Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences.Whether to Vertically IntegrateOn December 5 2011 Yu held a meeting with the senior management team at Ziwo to discuss how they could use Ziwo’s advantages to respond to the changes in the AM–AP supply chain. Yongning Yang the chief marketing officer started the discussion. He advocated paying attention to the changing need of their customers. In the initial stages customers mainly demanded agricultural materials but with the changes their demands had expanded to include technical service risk avoidance and sales channels for their agricultural products. Ziwo was not meeting customers’ needs if it stuck to just selling agricultural materials. Yang suggested restructuring Ziwo’s major business to provide multiform services especially support with a sales channel. Yang maintained that the only way to keep and attract customers was to enter the downstream business and provide a sales channel for farmers to sell their products.Lijun Li Ziwo’s chief operating officer was in favour of providing sales channels but wanted to protect the company’s original major business. He felt the company could engage in the upstream business by guiding farmers to buy agricultural materials directly from the manufacturers. This would decrease the transaction costs for both farmers and manufacturers. Li believed that if they could manage both the upstream and downstream business Ziwo would gain a significant competitive advantage.Weile He the chief financial officer was concerned that the company’s financial position could not support vertical integration. Ziwo’s market share had fallen three years in a row and the company’s cash flow was limited after having deficits for two years. He concluded that there was not enough money for the company to vertically integrate by merging with companies downstream or upstream. His suggestion was to implement vertical integration by seeking co-operation from other companies.The Plan for Vertical IntegrationAfter considering the situation and analyzing Ziwo’s strengths Yu and the management team decided that Ziwo would implement forward and backward integration at the same time to provide diverse services and products. The goal was to meet customers’ needs for technical service a sales channel risk avoidance and continued purchase of AM products.In early 2012 Ziwo changed its major business from selling seeds fertilizer and pesticide to providing an agricultural technology consulting service and a grain sales channel. Ziwo built on its good reputation expertise and Yu’s social network to integrate the supply chain vertically in Shenyang (see Exhibit 7).Technical SupportZiwo provided ALFs with free technical support in plans that combined fertilizer pesticide and seeds. Yu and Professor Yang Na provided the expertise. This became the key differentiator attracting ALFs to work with Ziwo. To obtain the free technical service ALFs had to enter a contract with Ziwo agreeing to two key terms: First ALFs had to use the agricultural materials specified by Ziwo and Ziwo would provide the qualified materials at a price not higher than the average market price. Second ALFs had to sell their quality-assured grain output to Ziwo and Ziwo promised to purchase the grain from the ALFs at a price not less than the average market price.In 2012 nearly 40 per cent of Ziwo’s former customers signed a contract with the company. Eleven of the customers owned over 1000 mu (165 acres) of cropland each and 15 of them owned over 500 mu (82 acres) each. In total Ziwo had provided free technical services to cropland that totalled more than 20000 mu (about 3300 acres). With demand for agricultural materials and huge grain output on this cropland scale Ziwo gained significant bargaining power with upstream AM manufacturers and downstream large granaries.Co-Operation with Large GranariesZiwo co-operated directly with large granaries and provided them with high-quality AP. Ziwo also required a contract from the granaries in exchange for the high-quality AP. In this arrangement Ziwo collected the agricultural product from the ALFs for the large granaries without using grain traders or small granaries. This meant that Ziwo could pay the farmers a higher price than they would get from the grain traders and the granaries still saved on the purchase cost getting a large-scale supply of high-quality product without incurring the cost and inconvenience of purchasing from several small granaries. This gave Ziwo bargaining power with the large granaries who then contracted to purchase all the agricultural product provided by Ziwo as long as the product met the requirements for quality. Ziwo earned revenue by charging for the trade by sale volumes.Collaboration with AM ManufacturersZiwo collaborated directly with AM manufacturers that needed to expand their product sales channel. With its resources of ALFs customers who had great demand for agricultural materials Ziwo had gained bargaining power with the AM manufacturers. Ziwo contracted with the AM manufacturers to provide adequate high-quality agricultural materials at a price not higher than the average market price and helped the manufacturers sell agricultural materials directly to the ALFs in Shenyang. With this setup Ziwo eliminated the AM wholesalers and retailers and reduced the transaction cost for both the AM manufacturers and the ALFs with more profitable AM prices. Ziwo earned revenue in this stream also by charging by sale volumes.Measure of SuccessThe ALFs increased their grain output with the autumn harvest of 2012. One of Ziwo’s customers reported that he spent less money on agricultural material over the year but yielded a larger grain output. Meanwhile he sold the grain to Ziwo at a price higher than the market average increasing his income 20 per cent over the previous year.Ziwo’s new business created a buzz in Shenyang. A number of ALFs from the neighbouring area were enticed to co-operate with Ziwo as were the AM manufacturers and large granaries. In 2013 Ziwo increased its contracts with ALFs to 36. Ziwo was then providing services to over 40000 mu (6590 acres) of cropland in total. Ziwo went into partnerships with nine AM manufacturers and four large granaries. The next year Ziwo’s business scope was enlarged again. By 2015 Ziwo’s service involved 75 ALFs 21 AM manufacturers and eight large granaries covering over 110000 mu (18121 acres) of cropland. Ziwo’s revenue also peaked that year (see Exhibit 6).FUTURE CHALLENGEYu was pleased with Ziwo’s success but he was more concerned about the threat from Chinese Internet giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) and JD.com Inc. (JD). They had entered the agricultural supply chain by launching an e-business in agricultural materials. In July 2015 Alibaba launched its online AM channel and began negotiating contracts with offline AM companies. The same year JD also launched its online AM channel. Other Internet giants such as Lenovo Group Ltd. were also entering the market space.The Chinese Internet giants were entering the agricultural supply chain as they had done in other industrial chains. Since 2010 the retail e-business had heavily impacted the traditional industries. In 2014 the apparel retail e-business forced Giordano International Limited a fashion brand retailer to close 165 physical stores in the Chinese market. The e-business in electronic retail forced Suning Commerce Group a well-established Chinese electronic retailer to close 68 physical stores and build its own online store for survival. Internet technology was also generating new media that occupied the largest portion of that market space in 2015 leading to the failure of traditional media (see Exhibit 8).Yu could not help but wonder if Ziwo’s future was secure. Would Ziwo also be vulnerable to the influence of Internet technology?EXHIBIT 1: NUMBER OF SEED COMPANies IN CHINA (2011–2016)Source: “Analysis of the Market Scale and Structure of Chinese Seeds Industry in 2016” China Industry Information August 31 2016 accessed March 18 2017 www.chyxx.com/industry/201608/443637.html.EXHIBIT 2: NUMBER OF NATIONALly APPROVED categories of CORN SEEDS (2004–2015)Source: “Analysis of the Status and Development Trend Prediction of Chinese Seeds Industry in 2016” China Industry Information August 24 2016 accessed March 18 2017 www.chyxx.com/industry/201608/441071.html.EXHIBIT 3: REGISTERED CAPITAL OF SEED COMPANIES IN CHINA 2016Note: 751 19% signifies there are 751 seed companies with registered capital under ¥5 million accounting for 19% of all seed companies in China.Source: “Analysis of the Market Scale and Structure of Chinese Seeds Industry in 2016” China Industry Information August 31 2016 accessed March 18 2017 www.chyxx.com/industry/201608/443637.html.EXHIBIT 4: AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN IN CHINA (2001–2008)Note: AM = agricultural materials (seeds fertilizer pesticides etc.); AP = agricultural products (corn rice wheat and other grain crops).Source: Created by the case authors based on Xijun Yu (chief executive officer Ziwo Agricultural Service Co.

Ltd. (Kutesmart) was being lowered from the roof and replaced by the logo for a new brand Cotte Yolan (Cotte). This change came at an unusual time for the company. Kutesmart was mainly in the made-to-measure (MTM) mass production business of clothes and customer-to-manufacturer (C2M) solutions-based industry upgrades. After almost four years of diligent preparation for an initial public offering (IPO) the company aimed to submit its application to be listed on ChiNext—a NASDAQ-style board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China. Although the company had previously wooed the market with its high growth healthy cash flow and zero inventory—thanks to its innovative C2M business model based on data technologies (see Exhibit 1)—in 2018 Zhang Daili founder and chief executive officer of Kutesmart still needed to convince potential investors that Kutesmart could not only maintain such success but also extract more value from its industry databases. In the 2018 digital era successful corporations often differentiated themselves with their ability to offer advanced products efficient operations and high-quality customer services. How could Kutesmart enhance its business capabilities with the big data and Internet technology it had developed? Would digital transformation in the traditional manufacturing business entail an IPO as Zhang expected? APPAREL MANUFACTURING IN CHINAFor almost three decades China had been a global hub of garment manufacturing known for its high efficiency low operating costs and increasingly advanced techniques and technologies. With a 39 per cent global market share China was the world’s largest apparel and textile exporter dominating the global low-to-medium-end market through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In 2018 China’s apparel manufacturers produced over 22 billion pieces of clothing; approximately 1.5 trillion dollars of clothing sold within the Chinese domestic market and approximately 1.5 trillion were exported to foreign markets. Like many other labour-intensive manufacturing industries China’s garment manufacturers faced challenges as China’s economic growth slowed wages and other production costs rose and consumer structure and preferences changed. The manufacturing of low-end apparel items in particular was shifting to Southeast Asian markets such as Vietnam Bangladesh and Cambodia while China still possessed some competitive advantages in the manufacturing of more complex items. Chinese national statistics showed that the sector’s value-added growth slowed to 3.8 per cent in 2016—compared to the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6 per cent from 2011 to 2015. In 2016 the industry produced 31.4 trillion pieces of clothing—a 1.64 per cent decrease from 2015; the production size by retail sales increased 6.8 per cent to ¥1 trillion compared to a 9.3 per cent growth rate a year earlier. Exports whose share of revenue peaked at 86.8 per cent in 1998 were decreasing in recent years. In 2016 the value of China’s apparel exports declined 9.35 per cent to $160 billion. With a population of 1.4 billion China was also itself a major garment consumer market. The manufacturers were gradually divided into two camps: some continued with a mass market strategy to offer affordable clothes; another group of apparel enterprises turned to making luxury and high-end garments to serve the rising middle class in the market. The ¥500 billion menswear segment in China in which Kutesmart operated was a growing but smaller segment compared to womenswear. Traditionally men’s clothing had fewer varieties which led to less frequent purchases. However with consumers born after the 1990s becoming a core group in China’s consumer market the menswear segment was on the rise and was expected to achieve a CAGR of 4 per cent until 2020. The appetite of younger consumers had grown beyond basic features to include stylish and individualistic outfits and the demand for mid-range to high-end men’s clothes was increasing according to Euromonitor International. In order to win in the market menswear manufacturers needed to upgrade their products with more individualized designs and refine their distribution channels from offline to online and offline-online hybrids. APPAREL MANUFACTURING IN GLOBAL MARKETSThe United States and Europe were the world’s largest apparel import destinations. Together the two markets accounted for about 63.9 per cent of the world’s total; however the two markets’ domestic manufacturing industries were waning. Garment manufacturing represented only a relatively small percentage of gross domestic product in the United States—about 0.1 per cent in 2016. Employment in the industry had decreased more than 80 per cent over the last two decades. The majority of the apparel companies chose to outsource and/or offshore their manufacturing to developing countries in order to save labour costs and increase capacity leaving only high-value jobs such as research and development (R&D) design and marketing onshore. The manufacturers that stayed in the United States were generally small factories with an average of 20 employees focusing on high-fashion high-value quick-turnaround and high-margin orders. Most of these factories were located in cities such as New York and Los Angeles and supported the local fashion industry. The textile and clothing manufacturing industry played a more significant role in Europe especially in countries such as Italy France and Spain. The industry mostly consisting of small- and medium-sized enterprises employed 1.7 million people and represented about 6 per cent of the total manufacturing jobs in Europe. Companies with less than 50 employees accounted for over 90 per cent of the clothing manufacturing workforce and produced almost 60 per cent of the added value. Over the last decade the industry had undergone radical changes to maintain its competitiveness by moving towards producing high-quality clothes and high-value-added products—which inevitably led to a decline in volumes. Some companies chose to relocate production to low-cost countries. Even luxury companies such as Kering SA and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE manufactured products almost exclusively through contractors in developing countries.THE TRANSFORMATION OF KUTESMARTKutesmart which specialized in manufacturing high-end bespoke suits and MTM men’s clothes was an apparel group based in China’s northern province of Shandong. The company had 5700 staff members and a portfolio of business brands: CAMEO RED COLLAR RCOLLAR and RPRINCE. From 2014 Red Collar’s MTM revenue maintained an annual growth rate of over 50 per cent with 80 per cent of orders coming from overseas markets and 20 per cent from the domestic market. The company enjoyed an impressive net profit margin of over 25 per cent.The company started as a garment OEM factory in 1987 before the Red Collar brand was established in 1995. While China’s ready-to-wear industry was still at its peak in the early 2000s Zhang was aware that the traditional business model of garment manufacturers was not sustainable. Apparel OEMs often faced fierce competition due to homogenization and the long and complex value chain involving layers of agents making it difficult for apparel manufacturers to achieve significant profit margins and to manage capacity and inventory. Zhang strongly believed that the only way out for garment makers was the mass production of made-to-order products as it would answer directly to consumer demand and therefore minimize inventory and the cost of intermediaries. Moreover the economy of scale gave this model high efficiency and low cost and the tailored differentiated nature of the product could increase profit margins. THE TRANSFORMATION OF KUTESMART’s INFORMATION SYSTEMThe company’s information system had been at the centre of Kutesmart’s digital transformation journey. Since the company embarked on this journey in 2000 its information system had been evolving as the company’s business strategy moved forward. Before 2007During this period Kutesmart’s main businesses were OEM the production of standardized clothes on a large scale and its custom-made business which was in its infancy. In 2000 Kutesmart implemented its first information technology (IT) system which was provided by Yonyou a major business software company in China. Kutesmart implemented Yonyou’s software package for accounting and financial management including general ledger transaction and inventory management tools.As the company gradually shifted its production to tailor-made suits it started to face higher demand in material quality and a tight production timeline. The original financial software could no longer meet the company’s needs in managing material supply chains and effectively enforcing contracts. In 2001 Kutesmart started searching for the most suitable enterprise resource planning (ERP) system supplier that could meet the company’s special demand for planning both standardized mass production and custom production. Through trial and error the company finally identified an IT supplier that specialized in providing ERP solutions for the apparel manufacturing industry. With the ERP system in place Kutesmart was able to collect real-time production data and generate dynamic data profiles that would facilitate market forecasting. The system synchronized information flow in the supply chain by connecting sales and production and the company could trace the production of each item. The company had previously received complaints from customers of tailor-made clothes for late delivery or for the lack of certain required material due to insufficient material management. The ERP system enabled Kutesmart to significantly improve material planning and timely delivery due to the efficient coordination of materials. 2007 to 2009In 2007 Kutesmart made a major strategic decision to focus on the mass production of MTM clothes and position Cotte as a high-end men’s suits brand. Mass production and tailor-made seemed to be contradictory business models; however technology enabled a synergistic combination of the two thereby simultaneously satisfying customer demand for individualization and the manufacturers’ requirement for scale and cost. The core of this MTM mass production model was the ability to realize diversification and customization of products through a flexible and rapid end-to-end process—from R&D and production to sales and delivery. To achieve this goal Kutesmart decided to redevelop its information system. This included establishing an MTM e-commerce platform rebuilding the ERP system upgrading the computer-aided manufacturing system and transforming the computer and network support system as well as the office automation system. The implementation of the MTM e-commerce platform RCMTM took several steps. First Kutesmart connected its business partners such as tailors’ shops in New York with the company’s online system enabling mutual data exchange through a web interface; second Kutesmart implemented a marketing and customer relationship management system to more effectively track interactions with customers; and finally Kutesmart integrated its systems with the upgraded ERP system and an online self-service tailoring system to meet the company’s business needs in serving both small- and medium-sized business clients and individual clients.2009 to 2017Since 2009 Kutesmart’s focus had been on building an information system where customers could order tailor-made products directly from manufacturers through an online platform (see Exhibit 2). To realize this vision Kutesmart purchased more than 2000 pieces of intelligent manufacturing equipment and gradually improved more than 40 information systems that covered every aspect of operation including computer-aided design (CAD) advanced planning and scheduling warehouse management and manufacturing execution. Each system was completely interoperable and the real-time sharing of data and information eliminated information silos. The production and supply chain management process was automated. The intelligent systems not only captured data from the customers’ side but also from Kutesmart’s workers thereby matching workers’ skills with particular customers’ needs.Through suppliers customers could order their individualized suits and clothes on RCMTM; the order information—including all measurement details and customer preferences—would be compiled and stored in a radio-frequency identification card and distributed among Kutesmart’s production lines. Kutesmart’s database maintained the measurement records of more than two million past customers; this database working in integration with CAD and computer-aided process planning systems enabled RCMTM in theory to generate trillions of patterns in five minutes that fit 90 per cent of the body types in the world. As a result of advanced information and production technology the factory could make 4000 customized suits each day and guaranteed delivery within seven working days. Capitalizing on the information and production systems Kutesmart achieved an above-industry-average net profit rate of 20 per cent by maintaining the cost of the MTM suits just 10 per cent higher than mass produced ready-to-wear clothes. Unlike in traditional garment manufacturers’ heavy inventory model where the factory manufactured garments before actual sales Kutesmart’s customers had to make payment when they placed their order; such a model effectively enhanced Kutesmart’s cash flow and reduced its inventory to zero. On the consumer-facing side in August 2015 Kutesmart launched Magic Manufactory a mobile application (app) for individual customers to order tailored clothes directly from the company. After a customer opened the app and selected a type of clothing a 3-D model would appear on the screen. The app allowed the customer to select every detail of the tailor-made clothes—from texture and styles of the pockets collars and buttons to the initials embroidered on the clothes. When the design was completed the customer could make an appointment for Kutesmart’s “smart tailors” to take their measurements at their homes. The positioning system could help the customer locate a tailor nearby. As 3-D measurement technology advanced the system was soon able to capture customers’ measurement details via mobile phones. The Human Factors of TransformationIt took Kutesmart more than 10 years to build up its current information and production systems which continued to evolve as the company embraced new technologies and techniques. As chair Zhang was leading the company’s transformation and innovation journey. Kutesmart was a family business initially jointly run by Zhang and his younger brother who were responsible for production and sales respectively. As the property development industry had experienced a boom since the 1990s Zhang’s younger brother decided to pursue other business opportunities in real estate. Zhang however pursued the garment business as he felt a responsibility to maintain and develop the family business.Zhang described himself as an open-minded and technology-savvy leader. He visited BMW AG in 1989 during his trip to Europe and learned how technology could enhance production efficiency and quality through automation. After visiting a factory producing customized clothes in Japan Zhang came up with the initial idea of combining automation and customization to elevate Kutesmart’s production. Since then Zhang had visited advanced enterprises overseas on a regular basis to learn cutting-edge technologies and management practices. During Kutesmart’s transformation Zhang developed a management theory that put customers’ demands at the centre. According to the theory employees of each unit should focus on fulfilling customers’ demands. To implement the customer-centric strategy in 2014 Zhang initiated a restructuring to flatten the company’s organizational structure. Kutesmart made a bold move by eliminating multiple layers of reporting procedures within the company. The reorganization broke up more than 30 large and small departments and groups with more than 80 per cent of middle-level managers no longer holding their previous titles. Although the staff was still working in a department-like unit each member was responsible for his or her own targets. These units were formed based on specific customer demands and could be dismissed once the demands were fulfilled. According to Kutesmart the company was based on “self-organization.” Once a particular employee encountered a problem in work the employee could initiate a so-called “strong organization” to immediately engage a team of subject experts to solve the problem. The strong organization would be dismissed when the problem was solved and the solution would be codified into Kutesmart’s process system (see Exhibit 3).Transformation in the Digital age The emergence of disruptive new technologies such as advanced robotics artificial intelligence sensors cloud computing and the Internet of things had been changing the global manufacturing industry. Concepts such as Industry 4.0 which emphasized highly automated factories with machines interconnected with information and communications technologies were also profoundly shaping the future of manufacturing. After Zhang’s daughter Yunlan became president of Kutesmart the company’s future strategy became a key question she and her team sought to answer.Yunlan led her team to develop the concept of “Internet + Industry.” In her view the best way for the company to grow was to form alliances with partners and customers in what she termed a customer-to-manufacturer (C2M) ecosystem—instead of focusing on individual products. Kutesmart developed this strategy into a product called source data engineering (SDE) which provided the solution of “Internet + Industry” to traditional manufacturers. This solution including a set of IT and operations consulting services helped companies especially small- and medium-sized enterprises to transform towards flexible agile and customized manufacturing. This solution had been implemented in more than 20 industries and 60 projects.After adopting the SDE solution manufacturers could become members of Kutesmart’s C2M platform (see Exhibit 4) where members shared client resources. The larger the number of modified factories with the SDE solution the greater the ability to meet the diverse needs of consumers; meanwhile with more orders the factory would be able to run more effectively and maintain its profitability. Zhang envisioned that 2019 would be the turning point for Kutesmart when the platform could reach a significant scale.Meanwhile a potential hurdle of this model was the capacity of Kutesmart’s IT department which was responsible for implementing the SDE solutions for partnering companies. Currently Kutesmart employed about 170 IT specialists who were responsible for not only SDE solution services but also other system maintenance and new system development work. Each project required Kutesmart to send IT engineers to the site to evaluate and diagnose issues. Human resources and hardware costs were the two main constraints for the IT department if it had to provide SDE solutions on a large scale.Kutesmart’s overall vision for the company involved connecting different innovations into the company’s technology ecosystem. At the core of this ecosystem was a platform for managing and leveraging data including those residing in different subsystems of the organization. This technology ecosystem would be supplemented by a re-engineered operational process for manufacturing customized products based on customers’ specific requirements and an improved decision-making and problem-solving process that centred on a more agile organizational culture.The company’s president was confident about Kutesmart’s future in the age of digital disruption: “In the future Kutesmart will become a platform company just like Alibaba [Alibaba Group Holding Limited] and JD [JD.com Inc.] the go-to place for tailor-made products.” With the company’s highly successful transformation experience Kutesmart’s management needed to develop a set of strategies for capitalizing on its capabilities and embracing opportunities in the digital age. The company had already ventured beyond apparel manufacturing into a new line of growth: providing educational programs a one-stop shop or turnkey solutions to small- and medium-sized Chinese manufacturers seeking to transform and upgrade their capabilities for the digital era. As the founder of Kutesmart’s platform Zhang envisioned expanding the platform into an ecosystem: manufacturers across industries that received Kutesmart’s transformation consulting services would be connected to the platform where customers could order personalized products directly from the makers. Could this strategy help Kutesmart take its business to the next level? What were the opportunities and challenges?Exhibit 1: customer to manufacturer through data engineering Notes: C2M = customer to manufacturer; C2C = customer to customer; B2M = business to manufacturing; M2M = manufacturing to manufacturing.Source: Company file.Exhibit 2: Kutesmart Data Technology plus Smart Internet of Things                           Note: AGV = automated guided vehicle.Source: Company file.Exhibit 3: Kutesmart Problem-solving process Source: Company file.Exhibit 4: Kutesmart’s Big Data Platform Notes: CRM = customer relationship management; BL System = body labelling system; OMS = order management system; CAD = computer-aided design; MES = manufacturing execution system; ERP = enterprise resource planning; DSS = decision support system; HRMS = human resource management system.Source: Company file.",1,ASIAN,EASTERN ASIA,MAN,

By December 2017 his 14 years of experience had enabled him to orchestrate the development of the personal computing hardware business from concept to successful commercialization. The Devices division was able to generate growth showing that the company had the potential to do well in the hardware market amidst an increasingly competitive landscape.Since joining Microsoft in 2004 one of Panay’s key roles had been to oversee the strategic direction of its personal computing hardware business. The company’s multitude of products and services presented both opportunities and challenges for its future. The recent economic rise of China and other Asian countries has been a theme in garnering the growing attention of the company. In May 2017 Panay unveiled Microsoft’s new product the Surface Pro in Shanghai. The brand was becoming increasingly global with China growing into the Surface line of devices’ second largest market. As the Asia Pacific team under Panay’s command began to chart its strategic course for the next few years two key options were apparent at this crossroads. The first was to invest in further geographic expansion in Asia Pacific and strengthen Microsoft’s device presence by introducing new products. However to do so the company would have to be sure it could retain its competitive edge in the longer run as competition intensified in the hardware space. The second was to reposition and focus on other high-potential businesses in cloud solutions. Could Microsoft Asia Pacific forgo pursuing growth in its devices portfolio to focus on software services? The company had to choose an option for its strategic focus.Headquartered in Washington State in the United States Microsoft was a technology company that sold operating systems productivity and service applications business solutions server management and software development tools and video games. It designed and built devices such as personal computers (PCs) tablets and gaming consoles all of which could be integrated with its cloud offerings. Being one of the world’s largest and most innovative companies Microsoft was a pioneer in both the operating systems of the 1970s and the cloud-based solutions of today. While the strategy of software-based offerings worked well with vendors and end consumers people’s ever-evolving needs had transformed workplaces everyday experiences and the competitive landscape. New threats came from “ecosystem” businesses like Apple Inc. (Apple) that offered hardware and software that were interoperable using cutting-edge technology and innovative cloud platforms. Besides external threats by incumbents new start-ups and “unicorns” like Dropbox Inc. and Cloudera Inc. threatened to disrupt the industry with competitive pricing and comparable solutions. In this dynamic environment Microsoft Asia Pacific had to react quickly to enhance its current situation and explore new revenue growth options.ABOUT MICROSOFTFounded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 Microsoft had grown from a humble operating system provider into a multinational technology company. Often referred to as one of the world’s top software companies Microsoft had been at the forefront of innovation for several decades and had transformed itself from a pure software company into a provider of devices consulting and other ancillary services. The company was best known for its software products which included MS-DOS Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer Microsoft Office Microsoft Azure and hardware devices like Surface and Xbox (see Exhibit 1).The well-established organization was also one of the largest in the world. Microsoft conducted business in over 190 countries and had 114000 employees. Its total revenue in 2016 amounted to US$85.3 billion with a combined operating income of $20.2 billion. The company operated in a few main business segments: Productivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing which generated revenues of $26.5 billion $25.0 billion and $40.5 billion respectively (see Exhibit 2). Microsoft Office server products the Microsoft Windows operating system and Surface which were all key products produced revenues of $23.6 billion $19.2 billion $8.1 billion and $4.1 billion respectively. Microsoft’s recent innovation was its cloud-related services. Being one of the only companies with hybrid private and public cloud-serving businesses the firm was positioned to help clients migrate to the cloud and gain value through ancillary services such as intelligent first-party devices and machine learning.Microsoft aimed to build a family of computing devices that would operate seamlessly across platforms to address consumer needs. As the world moved to a “mobile-first cloud-first” era Microsoft formed a worldview that was “centered on the mobility of experiences that in turn are orchestrated by the cloud.” Mobility helped reinvent productivity and processes in every critical aspect of consumers’ lives. This was done by integrating devices and productivity solutions. In 2016 Microsoft announced that revenue from More Personal Computing had fallen 6.0 per cent year-on-year (YoY) reflecting weaker performances in Windows original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and phones. In contrast within this segment revenue for Surface had actually grown by $486 million or 13 per cent YoY due to successful new product releases such as the Surface Book (see Exhibit 3). In a rapidly transforming era where competitive threats came from both the hardware and software fronts Microsoft stood at a precipice. On the company’s approach Panay said “The transformative moment started when we really got into how to create the software with the hardware instead of starting in two different places.” Microsoft sought to strengthen its foothold in the technology market by also providing customers with a complementary suite of productivity solutions.TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND COMPETITIONCloud ComputingOne technology that was becoming increasingly pervasive across the world was cloud computing which referred to the practice of delivering computing services such as analytics storage data management networking software and others through the Internet. This technology reduced the heavy capital expenses that had been required in the past for on-site data centres. Cloud computing reduced the costs of infrastructure set-up and maintenance while providing speed and scalability. Ultimately productivity and performance were improved through regular updates reduced network latency and security. According to Gartner Inc. (Gartner) a leading research and advisory firm the entire cloud market was expected to grow from $209.2 billion in 2016 to $383.4 billion in 2020. Within it the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market would grow the fastest from $25.3 billion in 2016 to $71.6 billion in 2020. Software as a service (SaaS) would experience growth from $38.6 billion to $75.7 billion across the same period as it was still expected to be the second-largest cloud segment in 2020 behind cloud advertising. The adoption of cloud computing would become increasingly mainstream spurring growth in the infrastructure service space.Intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of things were projected to be the key drivers of increasing demand for cloud services which provided the infrastructure necessary to facilitate these breakthroughs. Gartner also predicted that by 2021 over half of the global firms already using cloud computing in 2017 would migrate to an all-in cloud strategy. With the big promise of significant growth going forward competition was expected to intensify among players in the industry.Microsoft was the leading provider of cloud-based services with Amazon.com Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation (commonly known as IBM) ranked second and third respectively. Other key players were Google LLC Oracle Corporation Salesforce.com Inc. and SAP SE. Peers of Microsoft Azure the company’s cloud-based platform included Amazon Web Services which led the IaaS space. However Microsoft Azure was the leader across all three segments of the cloud—IaaS PaaS and SaaS (see Exhibit 4). Microsoft aimed to leverage its expertise and scale to help migrate clients to the cloud reliably and cost effectively. It could do so by offering its Microsoft SQL Server Visual Studio System Center and Azure products through its combination of public private and hybrid clouds.Personal ComputingGartner ranked the top three vendors for enterprise desktops and notebooks as Dell Inc. HP Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd. These vendors controlled a combined 58.4 per cent of the global revenue share in 2016. While traditional PCs and notebooks were fast commoditizing the emergence of new technologies with hybrid form factors such as detachables threatened to disrupt the hardware industry on the back of a declining PC industry. In the fourth quarter of 2016 shipments of traditional desktops and notebooks declined by 1.5 per cent YoY according to International Data Corporation (IDC). Annual PC shipments declined YoY by 5.7 per cent in 2016 (see Exhibit 5). Within the traditional PC market the top five players were Lenovo Group Ltd. HP Inc. Dell Inc. AusTek Computer Inc. and Apple respectively. Along with challenging macroeconomic conditions the rise of smart phones had contributed to the decline in the market. As lifestyles became more hectic and consumers began to demand lightweight high-powered devices ultramobile premium devices such as Microsoft Surface had started to gain traction among end consumers and enterprise clients. Another key trend would be the ability to ensure seamless usage across different devices. For example desktops should be able to share information easily with tablets or notebooks to ensure a seamless user experience. This was especially useful given the rising trend in remote working and collaborative workplaces thereby changing the usage scenarios of a typical user. In the PC industry players looked to defend market share by building on core competencies and tapping on their loyal user base.However instead of maintaining the status quo with competitive dynamics Microsoft sought to revolutionize the way people worked with productivity devices by taking a first step into creating a device of its own in 2012. That year Microsoft launched the Microsoft Surface Pro its first two-in-one device which could switch from a traditional laptop into a tablet. The firm then led subsequent innovations in exploring new form factors that attempted to meet the mobility and versatility needs of the modern lifestyle. This included adding detachable displays digital inking and biometric security features to some products. The firm then introduced new products such as the Surface Book Surface Hub Surface Laptop and Surface Studio over the next few years.OPEN INNOVATION AT MICROSOFTMicrosoft had started out as a purely software company creating and selling the Microsoft Windows operating system and Microsoft Office productivity tools. However due to changing trends in the world and the rise of the gaming industry the company decided to make its first foray into hardware with the release of the Xbox in 2001 and the Xbox 360 in 2005.Subsequently Microsoft innovated further in the software space with new versions of the operating system such as Windows Vista and development products such as the Microsoft Visual Studio. In 2008 the firm launched its first version of Microsoft Azure providing a cloud platform for its solutions and products. In 2011 Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies to enhance its real-time communications portfolio. In June 2012 the company launched the Surface Tablet PC the first “personal computer created in-house by the firm. On the company’s business approach to innovation Panay said that Microsoft was “going to keep pushing innovation . . . to keep investing but [that it wanted] those investments to proliferate across to [its] partners as well” adding “it’s just a great opportunity for the PC market to continue to grow and give customers what they need.” By then Microsoft had ventured from software into creating hardware and then moved toward integrated cloud-based offerings such as Office 365 and Xbox Live. These were all tools that could be used seamlessly with Surface and Xbox 360 products delivered through a cloud layer. The company invested a total of $12.0 billion per year in 2015 and 2016 representing 13.0 per cent and 14.0 per cent of revenue respectively. The commitment allowed the company to constantly produce product differentiation and decide which enhancements were the most vital. As a result Microsoft had built up a strong portfolio of more than 60000 global patents granted with another 36000 patents pending. Strategic research at the firm went beyond immediate product considerations; the firm funded research at both the corporate and the business-segment level to ensure it was capitalizing on long-term business opportunities. It also had a specialized research division Microsoft Research which worked closely with top universities to develop the frontiers of computer science.In creating what was known as the Windows ecosystem Microsoft had committed to designing and marketing better first-party devices. It spurred further innovation and generated more demand through creating more personal computing experiences for end users. The company’s ongoing investments in innovation helped to grow its ecosystem in order to improve the way people communicated worked played and learned in the modern world. Its success thus far was due to its ability to nurture the right products and experiences for global users.DESIGN INNOVATION—THE SPECIAL INGREDIENTWhile Microsoft emphasized developing its businesses to thrive in the modern world product innovation was the essence of its business success. At Microsoft design innovation was a strategic imperative.In the case of Surface Microsoft created hardware that optimized daily tasks in the modern workplace. Traditionally workers used desktop PCs but doing so limited mobility and collaboration. For example when workers left the office they were often unable to bring their work with them resulting in lost productivity or the need to be always bound to their desks. With the increasing prevalence of remote working it became all the more important for hardware to facilitate collaboration and working outside of the office.Microsoft had an internal multidisciplinary Surface team that worked on the creation of products for the future. The team understood problems created original ideas experimented with new form factors and helped to bring new products to market. The company practised a form of design thinking called inclusive design which referred to a method of drawing on the experiences and needs of humans across a diversity of perspectives. The principles of inclusive design and their relevant details were as follows:Recognize exclusion—“As designers it’s our responsibility to know how our designs affect these interactions and create mismatches”Learn from diversity—“Inclusive design puts people in the center from the very start of the process . . . Human beings have amazing capabilities to adapt to different situations and understanding those adaptations is the key to real insight”Solve for one extend to many—“We all have abilities and limits to those abilities. Everyone experiences exclusion as they interact with our designs . . . Inclusive design works across a spectrum of related abilities connecting different people in similar circumstances”The concept of empathy was central to these principles. Observing how people adapted to the world helped Microsoft to understand and empathize with experiences from a multitude of perspectives. According to Panay:A part of being product makers is listening to our customers and pushing ourselves to evolve and improve with every generation of devices we create. We’re forever seeking innovation encouraging positive change. [It is] what we do and what our customers do but [we] can promise . . . one thing that will never change is our commitment to our customers and our dedication to ensuring [the] Surface experience only gets better.Microsoft design teams went beyond traditional user-centred design as they understood the need to check balance and measure how their designs enabled inclusivity among users. That perspective allowed for greater access and the incorporation of empathy into the design of the product helping to create a world that made lives better regardless of any disability. Through focus group discussions and hundreds of research hours Microsoft came to understand that the workplace of today—ranging from offices to on-site factory floors cafés and even parks—had changed significantly. People were increasingly demanding devices that bridged their work life and personal life. As such the Microsoft team sought to create a lightweight high-performance foldable and detachable device. The team then moved to create numerous prototypes and worked relentlessly to improve the product. In one apt example of innovation design over two years of development the team took inspiration from books and folios to pioneer a state-of-the-art hinge that mimicked a carpet rolling out when it was opened to ensure more balanced weight distribution.After much experimenting and collaboration the team came up with laptop hardware that was both detachable and elegantly foldable—the Surface Book. The design process did not stop at just one product in the Surface suite; the suite expanded into a multitude of use cases and form factors that served a diversity of industries. Panay commentedWhen you’re innovating and thinking about software and hardware together and where the future of computing might be and what the form factors might be and how this world comes together you’re always thinking about other things for sure . . . Innovation doesn’t end with the last product you ship it really starts there.Microsoft understood that in order to truly compete against incumbent ecosystem competitors who had their own catalogue of tablets laptops and desktops it had to innovate further and integrate solutions seamlessly so that both enterprise and retail customers would have had their needs met sufficiently (see Exhibit 6). Ngee Ann Polytechnic a reputable higher learning institute in Singapore with over 14800 full time students was a client for Microsoft’s Surface products. Lecturers at the institute utilized the Surface Hub a multi-touch digital whiteboard with conferencing and collaboration tools to manipulate digital drawings on screen and easily illustrate teaching concepts to students. From the students’ point of view looking at a digital screen instead of the usual physical whiteboard increased levels of engagement. They were able to learn via Skype for Business on the Surface Hub when interacting with overseas guest lecturers. There was also potential for collaboration between the cloud and devices as the school was beginning to explore facial analysis tools with the Surface Hub’s wide-angle cameras.THE INTELLIGENT CLOUDMicrosoft had been a pioneer in providing comprehensive cloud services globally. Its flagship cloud solution Microsoft Azure was a holistic suite of cloud services that enabled developers and information technology (IT) professionals to create implement and manage applications. This was made possible with a global network of data centres owned by Microsoft as the cloud service provider. Azure could automate integrate and improve business processes with the help of on-premise applications SaaS and application programming interfaces. Essentially companies that used Azure could leverage application integration and complementary software such as Office 365 Azure Security Center and Dynamics CRM (a customer relationship management software package). Microsoft provided Azure and Microsoft SQL Server services to Fullerton Health a corporate health care solution provider in Singapore to build a single data platform that managed billions of medical records. Other than data management and storage Azure allowed the client to create mobile applications that provided patients with personalized insights cost estimations and self-care recommendations. On reviewing the platform’s effectiveness Ted Minkinow chief information officer of Fullerton Health commented “We also experienced increased productivity because we can spin up servers and shut them down when needed without having to concern ourselves with the capacity limitations of our own hardware.” Additionally the client further leveraged cutting-edge technologies by using the machine learning capabilities of Azure and SQL Server to help physicians gain actionable insights in a personal way for their patients. In this way doctors were able to build accurate predictive models that identified diseases before they became aggravated thereby helping to improve the quality of patients’ lives. With the help of developer tools automated data crunching and the cloud Fullerton Health was able to raise its efficiency and reduce costs not just for itself but also for its customers.Such partnerships could be mutually beneficial as through them Microsoft gained the right knowledge and industry experience to improve its service offerings while clients on the other hand could use the tools to drive digital transformation and better scale their business ultimately crafting a competitive edge in their market. Migration towards the cloud was not a phenomenon exclusive to just one industry. In fact Microsoft’s cloud services encompassed industries such as health and life sciences retailers government financial services and manufacturing. In the financial industry for example Azure could be deployed to help bankers redefine customer journeys enhance risk management and improve customer insights.MICROSOFT ECOSYSTEM PARTNERSHIPSThe company made Surface suite products available to customers through a network of distributors and device resellers. Apart from pure hardware distributors and resellers could also sell Microsoft software solutions. When dealing with end customers resellers could offer multiple solutions that provided enhanced value-add. For business-to-business (B2B) sales the option of bundling products together provided more comprehensive solutions to prospective clients.Microsoft offered a few key services to its ecosystem partners. First it could give advice whenever partners requested the assistance of Microsoft experts. For example Microsoft technical consultants could provide pre-sales and deployment support for its partners. Second Microsoft organized training courses to share knowledge and continuously upgrade both its ecosystem partners and its key clients. Events organized for members ranged from training on artificial intelligence and Office 365 to discussing the demands of the modern workplace. Microsoft partners could also access the firm’s partner university at little or no cost to learn about new products. Third the firm offered marketing material and lead generation devices to help partners improve efficiencies in reaching potential customers.Microsoft had benefited from playing an active role in managing its partner ecosystem through knowledge sharing and collaboration. Panay said “I think of our partners as partners and not competitors at all. As we create the technology and are able to make those investments in innovation we’re not keeping it to ourselves. We’re pushing it to our partners as fast as we can.”THE FUTURE OF COMPUTINGConsidering how the Asia Pacific region would change over the next few years due to digitalization and a burgeoning middle class the choices to (1) invest more into selling cloud services and (2) introduce new products and gain more market share in the Surface business both carried immense potential. The Asia Pacific team considered the respective costs benefits and strategic importance of each option.Intelligent CloudHow could cloud technologies transform Asia? In Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) IDC predicted that the public cloud services market would surpass $10.0 billion in 2017. IaaS spending would grow 35.8 per cent YoY to $4.8 billion surpassing SaaS spending for the first time. The key drivers of demand could be attributable to digital transformations that aimed to be agile and cost-effective. This included banking and finance industries that used cloud services for non-core functions. Within APEJ the top three players were Amazon Web Services Microsoft and Alibaba Group Holding Limited with a consolidated share of over half the market. Furthermore the Singaporean government had committed SG$80 million towards the SMEs Go Digital Programme to help firms build digital capabilities including data and cybersecurity. This could possibly alleviate the current talent shortage of competent IT professionals in companies within the region. Only 30 per cent of companies in the country was estimated to have migrated to the cloud indicating there was much more room for adoption to accelerate within the next three to 10 years.With Microsoft’s leading position it could invest further to gain a greater market share and acquire new clients for the growing business. Furthermore in Singapore 44 per cent of enterprise respondents were taking a cloud-first approach to IT and that figure was projected to rise to 59 per cent in 2018. The Surface team had the technology and track record to help Singapore and other Asian enterprises migrate to the cloud successfully. However this would require resources to be put into educating prospective clients and ramping up efforts in cybersecurity to tackle the typical concerns associated with digital transformation. Should the company engage enterprises directly or focus more on collaborating with its ecosystem partner network to sell its cloud solutions?Personal ComputingTurning attention to the future of personal computing devices the PC market was facing a few structural changes driven by shifts in usage behaviours and user desires. According to IDC traditional PC shipments in Singapore showed a slight decrease in 2017 of 2.1 per cent YoY. The notebook PC category experienced shipment growth of 5.1 per cent YoY while desktop PC product categories declined 23.7 per cent YoY. Demand was driven by commercial orders within the public sector. The demand patterns highlighted a key insight: end users saw less need to work on a large stationary device and rather preferred lightweight high-performance solutions. From a broader perspective IDC predicted that APEJ spending on IT services would surpass $95.0 billion by 2021 attributing the continued growth to numerous smart-city initiatives and digital transformations. The hardware market which was able to facilitate the IT spending and upgrades was likely to benefit greatly.While the global PC market continued its slight decline the smaller segment of hybrid two-in-one and detachable devices was growing. In the first half of 2017 market research company GfK SE reported that computers with new form factors had already generated sales amounting to $7.2 billion in Asia Pacific. Microsoft being a very early mover in adapting to evolving needs could stand to further cement its position by investing in new product distributions and marketing. While Microsoft was still a software company it could certainly play a key role in growing its hardware share of the market by leveraging its current ecosystem partner network and marketing strategies. Previous projects such as the collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic suggested that Surface had great potential to explore in terms of collaborating with other industry verticals such as finance and manufacturing. Furthermore the high level of digital readiness among consumers in Singapore for example would facilitate product adoption. Likewise Surface could capitalize on the burgeoning middle class in the fast growing APEJ region which constituted about 60 per cent of the world population. As the global devices market was predicted to expand by 2 per cent in 2018 driven by rapidly growing countries such as China expanding the product family further across the region could help Microsoft’s hardware division gain increased traction among enterprises and retail customers alike. More products could be introduced allowing Microsoft Asia Pacific to compete more effectively against traditional PC hardware ecosystem incumbents that boasted strong product portfolios. However issues such as building up distribution channels marketing budgets and language customization had to be considered in the context of previously untapped markets and customer demographics. LOOKING AHEAD: JANUARY 2018Microsoft’s reach had grown beyond that of most companies in the world. With both the many opportunities and the many obstacles that lay ahead should Microsoft leverage its core competency in technology and software to further invest in selling and improving cloud services in APEJ? This could be the company’s opportunity to grow its cloud market share in Asian cities aspiring towards full digital transformation. Or should Microsoft focus on bringing new products from the Surface family into the Asia Pacific region and increase the marketing and distribution of devices there? This could differentiate the company as a reliable hardware and complete solution provider to a growing consumer base.EXHIBIT 1: MICROSOFT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURESource: Created by the authors based on “Facts about Microsoft” Microsoft 2017 accessed April 20 2018 https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#BusinessOrganization.

Drought shipping disruptions fuel shortages economic instability and war have long been recognized as potentially disruptive threats to global food supplies. More recently experts have warned about overpopulation climate change pollution and biodiversity loss as additional risks. Despite concerted efforts to eradicate world hunger under the United Nations’ 2000–2015 Millennium Goals FAO estimated that 795 million people were undernourished in 2015. Skeptics fear the situation could become much worse. Optimists on the other hand point to farming and food-system innovations as the path to a future of continuing abundance and increasing health. Though experts agree that it will be possible to meet the nutritional needs of more than 9 billion people by 2050 there are heated debates about whether the innovations needed to reach the target can be achieved within reasonable boundaries of risk and cost. Hence companies in the farming and food industries face the prospect of substantial change and perhaps even disruption to their traditional products and business models as society adjusts to the new realities of the market political context and natural environment. Challenges to Food SecurityChallenges to food security come from both the demand and supply sides: a growing population fuels the world’s demand for caloric intake at a time when global agriculture yields have stabilized or even declined and unexploited natural resources have become scarce.   Demand-Side ChallengesPopulation GrowthThe United Nations estimates that the world population will reach 9.7 billion people by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. Solutions for feeding over 9 billion people by 2050 are being carefully studied and documented. The World Resources Institute indicates that this will require an increase in the number of food calories available for human consumption by 2050 of 69 per cent in comparison to the 2006 baseline. When the food needed for cultivating livestock is taken into account this demand surge is estimated at an even more staggering 100 per cent or 6000 trillion calories per year.Shifting DietsGlobal reductions in poverty have sharply increased the demand for calories as newly emerging middle-class families shift their diets from vegetable-based protein sources to meat dairy and fish. Meat-based diets consume far more resources than vegetable-based diets because of the land needed to raise livestock and the food and water needed to grow animal feed. Livestock farming also contributes to climate change as a result of methane emissions from animals and land deforestation (i.e. the removal of vast tracts of trees that absorb carbon). For example when cattle farmers switched their animals’ diets from meat by-products to plant products following the outbreak of meat-borne mad cow disease in the early 2000s a boom in soybean demand prompted South American farmers to cut deeply into forest lands to clear fields for soy cultivation. The total toll on climate change from the combined effects of animal emissions and cultivation is substantial. Author James Cascio used energy data generated by Stockholm University and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology to determine that “the greenhouse gas emissions arising every year from the production and consumption of cheeseburgers in the United States is roughly the amount emitted by 6.5 million to 19.6 million SUVs [sport utility vehicles].” If diets continue to shift away from plants as global incomes continue to grow the pressures on the climate land and water supply will continually increase.  Supply-Side ChallengesFood Waste and LossNearly one-quarter of all calories produced for human consumption are lost or wasted. Food loss stems from spoilage and spillage in the pre-consumption stage; it emerges when prepared food is disposed due either to excess production or to eventual spoilage. Consumption-stage waste is a major problem in the developed economies of North America Oceania and Europe. In developing countries by contrast the biggest losses emerge at the stages of production handling and storage.Natural Resource Limits and DegradationAgricultural production uses 70 per cent of the earth’s accessible fresh water and 85 per cent of its arable land supply. The available resources are often overexploited and are sometimes destroyed in short-sighted attempts to boost farming profits especially in low-income areas where smallholder farmers lack the education or the financial means to balance financial and environmental concerns for sustainable long-term outcomes. Water scarcity is a large and growing problem for agriculture and many crops are grown in areas of high water stress. Experts fear that we may see negative effects of water scarcity on global agricultural output in the near future especially if problems such as overextraction and pollution of available groundwater supplies continue at current rates. Many small countries import a significant portion of their annual grain supplies and there are worries that large countries like India and China could follow suit if unsustainable water pumping activities are not curtailed. China is enacting programs and policies to improve water management but the risks to food security from poor water management remain strong. By 2030 the gap between expected global water demand and supply could reach as high as 40 per cent. The outlook for land is similarly problematic. Unfarmed arable land lies primarily in forests—which are needed to control the greenhouse effect and preserve biodiversity—or in peat bogs—which release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere when drained. Scientists warn of grave consequences from continuous exploitation of these lands. Although climate change is expected to release arable land from ice cover in some far northern regions droughts floods and high temperatures are predicted to devastate some currently fertile southern farming zones. Russia Canada and northern European countries may see a net gain in agricultural land as a result of global warming. Iceland for example has been able to grow barley since the turn of the century as a result of the higher temperatures resulting from changing ocean currents. On the other hand rising seas will threaten low-lying coastal farmland in countries like Bangladesh. The net effect of climate change on farmland availability is difficult to predict in the near term but what seems certain is that change is coming—and with it perhaps come social and economic instability. Pollution compounds the problem of a shrinking supply of resources. Farming is a major source of soil and water pollution as overused pesticides and fertilizers seep into the ground and run into streams and oceans. At the same time approximately 40 per cent of the world’s agricultural land is seriously degraded and the loss of soil fertility leads to sharp declines in agricultural yields. Soil preservation and restoration will play an important role in assuring future food security. Social Inequity and Labour ScarcityA scarce supply of experienced and knowledgeable farm labour has emerged as an additional concern for future food security. In many low-income countries farmers lack the knowledge and technology that would allow them to improve their crop yields. The small scale of their farms and their limited access to market information prevents them from negotiating better selling prices for their harvests. Poor systems for food preservation and transportation further reduce their profits as crops spoil on the way to market. Moreover safety and health risks result from low knowledge levels and lack of access to protective clothing and equipment insurance and organized labour. Cycles of poverty and hardship drive young people out of low-income farming communities in search of a better lifestyle. Even in high-income farming communities few young people enter the industry as most prefer careers with greater security and lower stress.Food Security OpportunitiesThe bright side of any challenging situation is that it brings opportunity for change. Food and agribusiness form a $5 trillion global industry and the trend of investing for future food security means the value of this industry will only grow. A McKinsey & Company report estimates that global investments in food and agribusiness companies tripled in 10 years reaching a whopping $100 billion by 2013. High yields exceeding even those of energy and information technology assure that the trend will continue.Solutions to global food security problems range from innovative seeds crop protections and farming methods to new products and business models intended to reduce food waste shift dietary patterns and manage risk. Big businesses typically strive to implement well-defined processes at scale rather than to adapt to the unique local requirements of agricultural systems. Global agribusiness companies focus on laboratory research using tools like genomics combinatorial chemistry environmental science toxicology crop transformation and nanotechnology. In contrast entrepreneurs are often willing to focus on specific local needs that require low-tech solutions. They more readily accept and advocate for business model changes such as vertical farming and food redistribution or repurposing.Technology-Based SolutionsGenetically Modified CropsUsing genetic modification technology growers can genetically alter crops to boost their resistance to drought pests flooding and other impending risks of climate change and environmental degradation. The public is widely divided about the long-term safety and wisdom of leveraging biotechnology in general and genetically modified organisms (GMO) in particular in the pursuit of food security. Advocates including hundreds of researchers and government institutions argue based on scientific evidence that GMO crops are safe and have not posed major environmental or health risks in regions where they are grown. Nevertheless activists continue to warn of risks. Chief among their concerns is that GMO crops decrease biodiversity and place food security in the hands of a small number of high-tech agribusiness companies. Critics also argue that evidence to support the beneficial effects of GMO crops (e.g. higher crop yields and lower use of pesticides) is unsupportive or inconclusive and that other modern farming methods such as rotational cropping could be more effective than genetic modification technology in boosting crop yields without posing any of the feared GMO risks. Laboratory-Produced FoodIn recognition of natural resource limits scientists have been working on growing meat in laboratories. Though researchers are not yet able to reproduce the taste and texture of a juicy grilled steak they have been successful in cultivating meat cells that receive favourable reviews for taste—especially when prepared with condiments or other flavour enhancers. A critical challenge for commercializing the meat at present is the high price. For example in 2013 a Dutch lab-grown burger was offered at a price of more than $300000; however researchers in several so-called clean meat companies have been working to reduce the price since then. Many people are optimistic that lab-grown food will offer affordable and tasty alternatives to farm-grown meat in the near future. In another example of growing food in the lab scientists are generating sugar as an intermediate product of cellulosic biofuel production. As land shortages drive the search for alternative growing spaces and climate change disrupts traditional growing geographies the search for laboratory solutions to food production is likely to grow.  Precision Farming and Big DataAdvances in information technology can increasingly boost agricultural efficiency and profitability. For example farmers are able to increase crop yields and optimize the application of fertilizers crop protectors and water using granular data (e.g. drone- or satellite-generated data for every 10 square metres of field) and sophisticated tools that integrate information about weather soil and market prices. The resulting resource efficiency also lowers costs. Mobile phone technology can be especially helpful to farmers in emerging markets where data about production and demand is currently limited. Improving access to information about crop conditions and market prices can increase farmers’ productivity and give them greater power over the terms of trade. Low-Tech and Business-Model SolutionsImproving Agricultural Productivity in Low-Income AreasIn many developing countries the productivity of farming is low due to outdated techniques. In addition to high-tech solutions using drones and big data low-income areas can benefit from low-tech solutions like improving soil fertility expanding cropped areas increasing irrigation efficiency and reducing post-harvest losses. A major study led by the International Water Management Institute for example shows that hunger poverty and water are closely correlated. More efficient management of rain water combined with small-scale irrigation yields great gains for low-income communities.Growing Differently Eating DifferentlyApart from improving productivity farmers can focus on growing crops that provide the most calories while using the fewest resources. According to experts from the World Wildlife Fund the amount of water required to produce 1000 calories of beef is 10 times as much as it takes to produce 1000 calories of bananas or plantains. Consumers can also do their part by reducing overconsumption of calories and limiting consumption of resource-intensive foods. Research conducted by the World Resources Institute shows that widespread implementation of three consumption-based solutions (reducing overconsumption of calories reducing overconsumption of animal-based proteins in general and reducing consumption of beef in particular) could close the food gap by as much as 30 per cent while simultaneously reducing the use of agricultural resources and resulting harmful environmental impacts. Switching to an insect-based diet could be especially beneficial. According to research by the FAO insects are already a part of the diets of around 2 billion people worldwide. Insects are nutritious and high in protein; moreover compared to livestock they can be raised with minimal environmental impact. At the very least insects can be used to feed animals. For example a start-up called Kulisha markets high-protein “Edibugs” as an alternative to conventional animal feeds. The bugs are actually black soldier fly larvae that feed on organic waste materials some of which are donated by food companies seeking better means of waste disposal. The company’s founders claim that each bag of Edibugs diverts five pounds of food waste from landfills.Changing the Farming Business ModelFarming can also move into urban warehouses or even into individual homes. Vertical farms use controlled-environment agricultural technology in which light humidity temperature and gases are carefully balanced to grow food in vertically stacked layers inside warehouses shipping containers and other repurposed spaces. Since vertical farming is multi-seasonal it can multiply the productivity of farmed surfaces by a factor of four to six depending on the crop while using fewer resources than traditional farms. At the household level indoor farming can even be done in an apartment. PlantCube is a small appliance that looks like a smart-controlled refrigerator. It can be placed in a space-constrained kitchen to grow vegetables in the home using technologies like those applied to large commercial vertical farms.Reducing Food Loss and WasteMuch of the food loss that occurs in developing economies stems from pest infestations or bruising and compression during handling and storage. Researchers have found that plastic storage bags and small airtight metal silos can prevent pests and other harmful elements like mould and moisture from damaging crops during handling and storage. Plastic storage crates have also been shown to have advantages for preventing bruising and crushing during transport. In developing markets each of these potential solutions faces scaling challenges such as high up-front costs or limited availability but governments and support agents are working to close these gaps. If successful these measures could greatly reduce the 48 per cent of global food loss and waste that occurs during production handling and storage.Changes in food labels can reduce food waste in developed economies where consumers or institutions might throw away food before it has really spoiled. Labels that typically read “sell-by” “best if used by” or “use-by” refer to the quality or flavour of the food but not to its safety (i.e. whether the food would cause someone to be sick). Food producers retailers and government regulatory bodies are acting together to seek solutions to simplify and clarify the differences in food safety and taste. Interventions to educate consumers and change their behaviour will ultimately be part of the overall solution.    Waste can also be reduced through food redistribution. A New York non-governmental organization Transfernation picks up extra untouched food from events and corporate cafeterias on demand and takes it to the closest local feeding program. Using a mobile-phone application it connects food donors with paid volunteer transporters who deliver the food to charities that feed local people in need. Calling itself “the Uber of extra food” this group had redistributed over 50000 pounds of food to New York City shelters within two years. Services like this can make a dent in the high volume of food waste in the urban areas of developed economies. The basic requirements of ample food donors transporters and food bank locations are easily met in densely populated city centres. Government policies may also be needed to limit the liability of food donors in the event that food unintentionally causes harm to the recipients. Food System Change and DisruptionIt will take years even decades for our current food and agricultural ecosystems to transform to meet the needs of the future. Like all economic and social revolutions there will be winners and losers. The winds of change are strong and seem poised to strengthen as current trends of population growth and resource exploitation advance. Some of tomorrow’s winners are likely to be found among today’s innovators and adapters. Tomorrow’s losers are likely to be those who cling too tightly to the past without recognizing the opportunity of bringing much-needed solutions to market. Those who move will find many like-minded supporters and collaborators to accompany them on the way for there are few more pressing problems in need of innovative solutions that that of global food security.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2021 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2021-03-12In early 2017 chief financial officer Krista Paton reviewed the 2016 financial performance of her fledgling company (see Exhibit 1) Urban Axes and could not believe the numbers. Started as a “side hustle” by Krista and partners Shaun Hurley Stuart Jones and Matt Paton in 2016 Urban Axes was the first axe-throwing entertainment venue in the United States. The business opened one location in Philadelphia Pennsylvania in September 2016 and by late December 2016 Urban Axes had already far exceeded the financial modelling that Krista had designed to identify low- medium- and high-performance earnings objectives.Krista and her co-founders had some big decisions to make. Given the business’s enormous early acceptance by customers the earnings potential of Urban Axes’ unique business model and the business’s first-mover position what options did Urban Axes have for expansion? How quickly should the co-founders make their move? Would Urban Axes be a career bull’s eye and generate enough earnings for the partners to quit their day jobs and go all in on axe throwing?AN UNLIKELY ENTREPRENEURIn many ways Krista age 34 did not fit the profile of an entrepreneur. As an undergraduate she explored many areas of interest beginning with computer science and ending with a degree in Spanish and modern languages with minors in international business and computer science. While an undergraduate Krista worked nearly full-time in retail for mobile phone service provider Sprint Corporation before moving into the company’s internal audit department.Exposure to auditing led to Krista’s pursuit of a master of business administration in finance which in turn led to her first job in the finance department of the international consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble Company (P&G). Krista’s initial P&G position in Cincinnati Ohio earned her recognition as a high-potential employee. A series of promotions within a variety of product lines followed including roles as senior internal auditor Bounty financial analyst customer team finance manager Canada household needs finance leader and Gillette upstream finance and strategy manager. The promotions had involved transfers—in 2011 to Philadelphia Pennsylvania and in 2013 to Toronto Ontario Canada. Krista attributed her rapid growth at P&G to intellectual curiosity something she felt came naturally to her. “I like to look at a question form a hypothesis and then collect and use data to prove or disprove those assumptions. That was a behaviour P&G really encouraged and valued in its employees.”As a high-potential woman in finance Krista was excited to be part of a large company with rich opportunities for travel and career advancement. She also capitalized on P&G’s mentoring. Early on she identified a senior female executive whose leadership style she admired and wanted to emulate. Her mentor was “strong and decisive but also a very good listener. In meetings she was a little less loud and more reserved. She asked thoughtful questions considered the information and then made clear decisions. I thought she was everything you want a leader to be.”Thinking back on her early successes at P&G Krista recalled telling a co-worker “I intend to be a P&G lifer. I really like working for ‘the Man.’” However the postings to Philadelphia and Toronto had had unintended consequences and set the stage for a reluctant entrepreneur to make a dramatic career change.A BIRTHDAY PARTY GIVES RISE TO BUSINESS OPPORTUNITYWhen Krista moved to Toronto in 2013 axe throwing as indoor experiential entertainment was just starting. Participants would throw axes at a wooden target and attempt to “stick” the axe for points scoring more if they hit the bull’s eye. Krista was part of one of the first social groups to celebrate a friend’s birthday party by throwing axes together. She recalled thinking “This was so much fun; it must exist in the United States.” She did some quick research discovered that it did not yet exist in the United States and said to her then-boyfriend Matt Paton “This would go great in Philly.” She and Matt called two friends Shaun and Stuart both Australians with successful careers in information technology (IT) who flew to Toronto to check out the opportunity. Shaun and Stuart immediately shared Krista’s excitement about launching axe throwing in the United States (see Exhibit 2).Krista’s first move was to contact the lead axe-throwing organization in Toronto to learn if it had plans for US expansion and would consider partnering with Krista’s group. The organization claimed that it already had US expansion plans. Krista’s enthusiasm cooled as she told herself “What do we know about running an axe business? Let’s keep thinking about it.”Krista recalled that after an especially bad day at an unrewarding job one of her potential partners announced to the group “I’m doing this. Are you in or out?” The Toronto organization had not made any movement into the United States so Krista’s friends started looking for real estate in their target Philadelphia market. Very shortly thereafter Urban Axes was born.“We all approached Urban Axes as something we’re going to dip our toe in” Krista recalled. The planning and supervisory responsibilities were divided among the partners. As the only woman and the only American on the founding team Krista experienced some professional and cultural struggles. Matt Shaun and Stuart were all Australian men with IT backgrounds and had previously worked together. They shared a cultural outlook an easygoing temperament and a history as colleagues and friends. Krista jokingly described the three as “basically all the same guy.” As the only partner with a financial background Krista tended to think differently about the business challenges and solutions. What made the partnership work however was a shared set of values about business integrity and a willingness to keep a dialogue going to resolve any differences.Krista described their balance of power and their method for conflict resolution in the following way:At the end of the day we have the same fundamental beliefs and goals. We recognized [that] we’re on the same side. We want to do things correctly. That was a lucky thing that we shared common values since it is not something you can really know about someone until you work with them. A lot of times we’d say “Let’s keep talking about it.” Eventually we’d get to a vote which is not very Australian.Voting was rarely needed Krista said but it worked for the partners as the most equitable method of finalizing decisions.Gender played a conscious and important role in Urban Axes’ initial concept. In many stories and cultures the stereotypical lumberjack wielding an axe was a strong burly and usually bearded man. To avoid biases and to appeal to all genders Krista served as the face of the company. In addition the group hired a woman as their first general manager to launch the Philadelphia location and manage day-to-day operations. “We made conscious choices about me being the face of the company” Krista stated. “We wanted Urban Axes to be inviting and approachable. We wanted to avoid the stereotype that axe throwing is only for bearded tatted dudes in their 30s. We wanted to be welcoming to all genders and ages from the very beginning.” To reinforce this image Urban Axes managers and staff represented a mix of genders and appearance and were hired for personality and customer service aptitude. The positioning worked and Urban Axes quickly attracted a broad mix of customers from corporate events to bridesmaid celebrations.EXPERIENTIAL ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYWhile still only a small segment of the overall entertainment industry the experiential entertainment segment was growing. The size of the location-based (or experiential) entertainment industry was expected to grow to US$17 billion by 2023. Attracted by the growth potential many businesses that originally focused on selling only goods modified their business model to include location-based experiences. Companies such as Baskin-Robbins and Taco Bell were investing in location-based experiences via museums hotels and other initiatives.Perhaps better known in this segment were trends such as escape rooms jewellery- and bead-making shops and ceramics-decorating stores as well as bigger brands such as Topgolf Punch Bowl Social and Dave & Buster’s. The target audience of this segment tended to be millennials with men and women often dividing by type of entertainment. The size of the location-based experiences industry was $218.6 million in 2015 and was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 32.1 per cent from 2019 to 2025.The US Census Bureau stated that the estimated number of US millennials in 2017 was 56 million people. The data further showed that millennials were the largest generation by population in the United States Exhibit 3 shows the US census by generation in 2017. As the largest generation currently in the US workforce millennials would soon reach their prime earnings years. This generation commanded an estimated annual consumer spending power of $1.3 trillion. A study by Harris Group analyzed the spending habits of millennials and discovered that 78 per cent preferred to spend money on experiences over goods. Spending on concert tickets athletic events or cultural experiences was becoming increasingly popular.The study also found that 69 per cent of millennials experienced “FOMO”—that is fear of missing out. Millennials dedicated about 59 per cent of their income to experiences and the remaining 36 per cent to goods. With the rise in social media platforms such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram it was important for millennials to maintain their social identity and regularly update their social status. Creating sharing and capturing pictures of memories was very important to millennials and helped them in finding like-minded individuals and creating a sense of community especially when sharing experiences such as unique forms of entertainment. The rise in this trend of social media use supported the growth of businesses such as Urban Axes that offered distinctive and fun location-based experiences.The consumer price index for urban consumers in the United States was 140 in 1992 and it had risen steadily over the decades to 240 in 2016. This rise in the consumer price index indicated an increase in wages and standard of living. According to the 2015 American Community Survey median household income for rural households was $52386 about 4 per cent lower than the median for urban households $54296. About 13.3 per cent of people in rural areas lived in families with incomes below the official poverty thresholds. The poverty rate for people in urban areas was 16 per cent. This showed that the standard of living in urban areas was higher than in rural areas.Philadelphia was the most populous city in the state of Pennsylvania. The city had more than 100 colleges and more than 340000 students ranking fifth in the country for number of college students. Attracted by lower rents and more-affordable lifestyles many young New Yorkers were moving from New York City to Philadelphia. According to the US Census an average of 3500 New Yorkers moved to Philadelphia each year between 2006 and 2010.Population growth increased consumer spending on location-based experiences a rising consumer price index and higher urban household income made Philadelphia an attractive market for Urban Axes.First-Mover AXE THROWER: BUILDING A BUSINESS AND A BRANDAlthough the partners had extensive corporate experience they did not conduct a sophisticated market analysis or feasibility study before launching Urban Axes.According to Krista “We weren’t giving up our day jobs—this was a side hustle. We could limit our risk. If a lot of things had gone differently we might not be here today. If we had to personally guarantee a long-term lease for example that might have changed things.” According to Krista the partners’ start-up planning process involved developing a marketing plan; detailed financial models for low- medium- and high-performance targets; and general operating principles derived from the team’s observations at axe-throwing venues in Toronto. They decided not to conduct market surveys of potential customers as even their closest friends gave skeptical responses. “What we kept hearing when we ran the idea by people was ‘Really you’re going to do that?” Krista laughingly remembered. “We’d say ‘Trust us. You’re going to love it’ and we were right.”Krista’s extensive finance experience proved to be invaluable preparation for building Urban Axes:It gave me a great understanding of many aspects of business. I got to see anything related to numbers which is really everything. How much do we spend on marketing? Why did we choose those programs? Are they good investments? How does our supply chain work? I was involved with tax complexities vendor negotiations customer relationships—those were all things I had exposure to over the years which gave me a very broad business understanding.The financial models that Krista built started with a base case to cover costs and make a little side money. Most of the fixed costs were predictable. The one big unpredictable variable was how many people would want to pay money to throw axes. The co-founders’ approach to risk mitigation meant that they would retain their day jobs set limits to their capital investment exposure build contingency plans into their business plan and enter into an initial lease agreement that did not require a personal guarantee.THE URBAN AXES EXPERIENCE IN PHILADELPHIAFor their first location the partners selected a 6000-square-foot former industrial building in the gentrifying neighbourhood of Kensington Philadelphia. The site combined several key location factors: sufficient space to install multiple target lanes a mix of commercial and residential properties and easy access. The rough authentic look of the space complimented axe throwing.Since it was situated within a residential neighbourhood the Urban Axes site had to ensure that its hours of operation and occupancy limits both complied with zoning and met the approval of the neighbourhood association. As a novel business type Urban Axes applied for a permit under the nightclub licensing rules. Finding an insurer willing to underwrite such an unfamiliar business posed steep challenges as well especially since Urban Axes offered a “bring your own bottle” option that required all customers to show proof of age of 21 years or older. From both an insurer and a potential customer perspective safety concerns posed an early and serious obstacle to acceptance. Mixing axes and alcohol seemed like a reckless idea. Krista’s team knew that safety had to be a top priority in the design and implementation of their plans.The customer experience was loosely based on the Canadian model adapted to US entertainment norms. Each group of six to 12 guests received a coach to stay with them through their 2.5 hours of training and play. The training began with safety. All rules within the business were carefully designed with customer and staff safety as their number-one priority. The partners knew that any injuries would spell the end of their business.Coaches who were hired based on personality (as no one had experience with axe throwing) demonstrated to customers how to hold and throw the axe to score points on a bull’s eye-style target that was similar to but much larger than a dartboard. The coaches’ performance became an early differentiation for Urban Axes. Coaches were trained to make the guest experience safe unique memorable and fun. Training represented a significant expense for the business. Each new hire completed 60–80 hours of rules and safety training based on Urban Axes’ in-house training manual. Next trainees “shadowed” an experienced coach and gradually assumed a larger role under their coach’s supervision before taking on their own guests.Krista noted that her three Australian partners brought their cultural values to the company structure. They designed a compensation package that was generous compared to those offered by most service industry jobs. The Urban Axes package for all staff included living wages; benefits such as health insurance for all full-time employees; and a type of quarterly profit-sharing plan. The partners chose to invest in employees with the goal of attracting and retaining high-quality employees minimizing turnover and ensuring a consistently high quality of customer experience. Originally staff were not allowed to accept tips though eventually tipping became optional for customers.The key to building a one-of-a-kind business was word-of-mouth marketing based on a superior customer experience. Urban Axes wanted its guests to feel just as Krista had when she went to that Toronto birthday party—that it was so much fun you just had to do it.ENTER THE COPYCATSUrban Axes launched in September 2016 and within six months the first competitors had set up shop in the vicinity of Philadelphia. The Urban Axes team anticipated numerous new entrants within the next six months. Urban Axes watched newcomers poach its staff imitate its style and engage in competitive pricing. The partners thought about what they could make proprietary about Urban Axes. As first movers they believed they had a sustainable competitive advantage. As Krista said “It was huge in this business. Being the first one was powerful. It gave us the opportunity to set the tone for the industry. We’ve established axe throwing as a super fun activity very controlled very safe. Not all our competitors have been able to set that same tone.”As for its unique attributes Krista described Urban Axes by saying “We’re better because operationally we’re extremely strong. Having three partners in IT we’ve developed some tools that make us way more organized put together and professional than some of our competitors. Some are visible to customers some are not—the way we book and do scheduling for instance.”Krista’s competence in financial management added accurate forecasting and budgeting to the organization’s skill sets. With a solid handle on budgeting and financial analysis the fledgling group was confident they could self-fund. Their financial plan included risk mitigation to help them avoid going into debt or being compelled to trade equity for outside investors.Still Urban Axes had to learn a lot more about its competitors. Marketing became a greater expense pricing had to be re-examined and the group re-evaluated the value proposition of their customer experience. As Krista summed up “We felt the need to communicate our value proposition better and get more consumer insight.”FIRST MOVER OR FOOTNOTE?After barely four months of operations Urban Axes’ healthy financial performance led Krista to believe that the business had enormous growth potential. But she was also aware that past achievements would not always translate into successes in the future. Krista had lived in Philadelphia and had a good understanding of the market labour and business laws of the state. To enter new markets in other states the team would need to understand local regulations and evaluate demographics. The operating procedures would have to be varied by state. The company would also need to grow its organizational capacity to manage multiple locations. Krista would have to create new financial models that captured the unique challenges and opportunities of new markets.The questions she and her partners faced were many and complex: Where should Urban Axes go from here? Should the business go deeper into Philadelphia and the greater metro region to saturate a market that the partners understood? Should the business enter other regional markets that the partners were unfamiliar with? Should Urban Axes stay with its existing “urban” style or should it move into suburbs? Should the co-founders franchise or partner? Should they look to sell the business or to acquire other businesses? Should the partners quit their day jobs and go all in?EXHIBIT 1: Urban AXes FINANCIAL INFORMATION Exhibit 1 (Continued)Staffing assumptions:General manager’s salary is a fixed cost.$50000 per year + 10% bonus potential + health benefits.Coaches are variable costs as they are employed only when the company has bookings and limited walk-in hours.

Since MSIL had ₹75 billion in surplus cash many expected it to invest this cash in the new project which required an initial capital expenditure (CAPEX) of only ₹30 billion. Many investors did not like MSIL allowing its parent company to set up this project and accused the company’s management of corporate misgovernance. At the same time MSIL announced its third-quarter results for fiscal year (FY) 2014. The company had managed to beat the estimates; it reported better-than-expected results mainly due to cost reductions and a favourable exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen. MSIL also showcased two cars at the India Auto Expo in February 2014: the compact Celerio which was based on automated manual transmission (AMT) technology and the mid-sized Ciaz. Since none of the competitors had a car to match Celerio analysts expected MSIL to increase its market share in the coming year.Though the price of MSIL’s stock had declined institutional investors were clearly divided on whether to remain invested because of MSIL’s good financial performance or to sell their shares because of the company’s poor governance practices. Seven fund managers met the top management of MSIL to express their unhappiness over the company’s decision to allow SMC to start the new plant. Subsequently 16 fund managers asked MSIL’s management to scrap what they called an “oppressive transaction.” At the same time many other analysts were clearly impressed with the company’s recent financial performance and were recommending that investors buy its stock. For example equity research reports from Morgan Stanley IDFC Bank Ltd. Dion Global Solutions Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group all gave MSIL’s stock overweight recommendations at this time. One of the fund managers summarized the view of these investors by saying “If you get too fussy about corporate governance there will hardly be any companies to invest in unless you are willing to overlook returns.”BACKGROUND: MSILMSIL originally known as Maruti Udyog Limited and popularly known as Maruti in India was incorporated in February 1981 by the government of India. A year later the company signed a joint venture agreement with SMC of Japan. Initially SMC had a 26 per cent stake in MSIL. The company started manufacturing cars from its Gurgaon plant in 1983 when Hindustan Motors and Premier Ltd. were the only players in the passenger car market in India. MSIL soon became known for its innovative products and its sales grew from 40000 cars per year in 1983 to 1.15 million cars per year in late 2013. SMC increased its stake in MSIL to 50 per cent in 1982 and again in 1992 by issuing new shares. In May 2002 the government of India announced a two-stage divestment program which allowed SMC to increase its stake to 54.2 per cent. MSIL made a rights issue of shares and the government of India renounced its rights. In return SMC paid a control premium of ₹10 billion to the government of India. The government of India divested another 25 per cent of its shares in 2003 through an initial public offering of the shares where each share was priced at ₹125. The government of India completely divested its stake in the company in May 2007 and SMC held 56.2 per cent of the shares in MSIL by the end of December 2013 (see Exhibit 1). With a product portfolio of 14 cars (with more than 150 variants) MSIL held more than 50 per cent of the market share in terms of the number of cars sold in India. Its products varied from entry-level cars like the Alto to stylish cars like the S4. Its service network spanned over 1446 cities and towns and serviced over 1.2 million cars every month. Its sales network similarly spanned over 1020 cities in India. MSIL’s plants were located in Gurgaon (with a total capacity of 900000 vehicles per year) and Manesar (with a total capacity of 550000 vehicles per year).  In addition to manufacturing and selling cars MSIL was involved in second-hand car sales fleet management and car financing. The company reported net income of ₹23921 million on gross sales of ₹481147 million for FY 2013 (see Exhibit 2). INDIAN AUTOmobile INDUSTRYThe Indian automobile industry was normally divided into four broad categories: passenger vehicles commercial vehicles three wheelers and two wheelers. Two-wheelers dominated the industry with a 77 per cent market share during 2007–2013 (see Exhibit 3). With a total production of around 3.5 million vehicles per year the passenger and commercial vehicle industry in India was the sixth-largest in the world. Hyundai Motor Company with a market share of around 22 per cent was the second-largest player in the passenger car market in India. Some of the other major players in this market were Honda Cars India Ltd. Tata Motors Limited and Toyota Kirloskar Motor with market shares of 6.60 per cent 6.18 per cent and 3.50 per cent respectively. Utility vehicles (UV) and multipurpose vehicles (MPV) accounted for a 29 per cent market share in the passenger car market in India. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. was the lead manufacturer in the UV segment with a market share of close to 50 per cent at the end of 2013 (see Exhibit 4).One could find cars using both petrol and diesel engines in India. Diesel engines worked on compression ignition whereas petrol engines used spark ignition and had smaller compression ratios. Since diesel was denser than petrol it gave 15 per cent more energy per litre so diesel engines gave higher mileage than petrol engines. The maintenance costs of diesel engines were also comparatively lower than those of petrol engines. However manufacturing diesel engines was more complicated so diesel engines cost more. Petrol engines ran at a higher speed and were much quieter. Though diesel prices were controlled in India oil marketing companies had been allowed to hike diesel prices by around half a rupee every month since January 2013. Consumers in India were highly price sensitive and considered overall costs when purchasing cars. This increase in diesel prices and the higher cost of diesel cars (which had cost around 20 per cent more than petrol cars) resulted in a 14 per cent reduction in the demand for diesel cars. According to research reports by ICRA the market share of diesel cars was expected to fall from 55 per cent to 35 per cent by 2015–2016.The falling demand for diesel cars forced MSIL to shelve plans to expand diesel engine production at its Gurgaon plant in October 2013. MSIL sold only 88000 diesel cars in the third quarter of FY 2014 compared to 107000 the previous year. Since the profit margin of diesel cars was higher this shift in demand toward petrol cars was expected to affect the profit margin of the company. While many foreign auto manufacturers were attracted by the high growth rate in India’s passenger vehicle market to increase their investments in India the lower sales growth rate from April to December 2013 forced many analysts to revise the projected growth rate for the sector to around 5 per cent for 2014–2015. Demand for cars in India depended on various factors including personal disposable income bank financing rates the growth rate of the urban population and the cost of fuel (see Exhibit 5). The growth rate of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had decreased from 7.5 per cent in 2011 to 4.4 per cent in 2013 and the demand for passenger cars had also come down after 2011 (see Exhibit 3). The benchmark repo rate or the rate that the Reserve Bank of India used to moderate the interest rate in India increased from 5 per cent in 2010 to 7.5 per cent in 2013. Since about 75–90 per cent of passenger car sales were financed through loans a higher rate of interest adversely affected such car purchases. However India’s urban population was increasing rapidly and expected to reach 500 million by the end of 2020 (up from 300 million in 2011). The revival of the economy and the decrease in the rate of interest was expected to help the Indian auto industry grow quickly. Gujarat plant expansionOn October 29 2011 MSIL’s board approved a decision to acquire land in Gujarat to expand the company’s manufacturing facilities and the company subsequently acquired about 485 hectares of land in Becharaji and Vithalapur Gujarat at a cost of around ₹2500 million. The expansion was supposedly put on hold due to market conditions. However on January 28 2014 MSIL announced that the proposed Gujarat plant would be operated by its parent company SMC. The plant would be set up as Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG) would be owned completely by SMC and would manufacture vehicles only for MSIL. The total cost of the plant was estimated to be ₹30 billion.MSIL’s press release announced that the vehicles manufactured by SMG would be sold to MSIL at cost plus adequate cash to cover the incremental CAPEX. The initial investment would be for 250000 units and production would begin in 2018. Subsequent expansions of the plant would be financed by internal accruals from the Gujarat plant. Given that the total land size of the Gujarat plant was 485 hectares the maximum capacity of the new plant would be 1.5 million units. The plant would have a capacity of 1.5 million cars per year and was expected to have a total CAPEX between ₹170 billion and ₹300 billion. The potential combined capacity at MSIL and the Gujarat plant was expected to supply all of MSIL’s sales until 2023. The press release also indicated that the land would be leased by MSIL to SMG on an arm’s-length basis. Though the amount of the rent was not disclosed people normally used 5–7 per cent as the capitalization rate when valuing real estate in India. SMG would initially sign a 15-year agreement with MSIL and this agreement might be extended after 15 years (see Exhibit 6).R. C. Bhargava the chairman of MSIL justified the move by saying it would be in the interests of the minority shareholders. “In layman terms if someone else is putting up a plant for me and the money for that comes without cost it is surely better rather than putting my own money and losing the earnings I could have made on it.”  Bhargava further justified the decision by arguing that SMC had a lower cost of capital than MSIL and this led to what he called “arbitrage of interest earnings.” SMC had a cash reserve of ¥420 billion on which it earned only 0.3 per cent interest whereas MSIL could earn 8–9 per cent interest on its cash reserve of ₹75 billion. SMC could invest its cash in the Gujarat plant and receive 56 per cent of the interest that MSIL earned on its cash. Bhargava summarized his arguments: “What we are doing is arbitrage of interest earnings which in India are higher than in Japan” (see Exhibit 5). Two analysts echoed this view when they stated in their equity research report that MSIL’s cost of capital was “13 per cent vs. 5 per cent for Suzuki. So it indirectly makes more money and higher [return on capital employed] if Suzuki does the investment.”REACTION FROM THE STREETThis decision surprised the market for a number of reasons. First the Gujarat plant was originally supposed to be operated by MSIL. Second MSIL had a cash balance of ₹75 billion so there was no reason for the Gujarat plant to be financed and operated by SMC. The market found the decision to be against the interests of the minority shareholders and the stock price fell from ₹1701.35 to ₹1563.2 on the day of the announcement when the broad-based indices largely remained flat. Analysts raised concerns about three points of ambiguity: (1) since SMG would be a 100 per cent subsidiary its financials would not be publicly available making it difficult to monitor the terms of the transfer-pricing agreement; (2) it was unclear how production would be split between MSIL and SMG if the demand for cars fell; and (3) it was also unclear how the future CAPEX of SMG would be funded. According to the press release SMG would sell cars to MSIL at cost plus adequate cash to cover incremental CAPEX. However it was possible that the surplus in SMG in a particular year would not be adequate to fund the CAPEX. In a year of high CAPEX SMG might charge more to MSIL making MSIL’s earnings more volatile. Many analysts also found the agreement to be “too good to be true.” Since SMG would charge MSIL for the cost of production and depreciation SMG’s expected earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization would equal its depreciation. This depreciation (i.e. cash flow) would be used to fund its future CAPEX and this implied zero return for SMC on its investment in SMG. The large amount of cash in MSIL’s balance sheet needed to be properly utilized if Suzuki was going to incur the CAPEX in the near future. Large Indian companies typically maintained huge cash and marketable securities (CMS) balances. For the 50 largest non-finance companies the median CMS was ₹42 billion at the end of FY 2013: the median CMS-to-sales ratio was 19 per cent and the median CMS-to-assets ratio was 15 per cent. Those who questioned MSIL’s corporate governance accused the multinational company (MNC) of taking advantage of the minority shareholders. Amit Tandon head of Institutional Investors Advisory Services argued that “the move increases the level of complexity and reduces the level of transparency. . . . This is an egregious behavior by an MNC looking to repatriate money from India in a dubious manner.” J. N. Gupta founder of Stakeholders Empowerment Services (another proxy advisory firm from India) also criticized the deal for lack of transparency. Gupta argued that MSIL’s cost of cars might increase during periods of lower capacity utilization because of fixed overheads. InGovern another proxy advisor argued that the deal was against the interests of minority shareholders: “It looks like the SMC subsidiary will enjoy the benefits of no business risk with assured vehicle offtake by MSIL . . . while MSIL will bear the business risk.”As per Section 188 of the Indian Companies Act 2013 any related-party transaction that was not in the ordinary course of business or not performed at arm’s length had to be approved by the board of directors and be approved by a majority of the minority shareholders. However Section 188 had not yet been enforced on the companies; the market expected it to be effective from April 2014. Similarly the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had amended its equity listing agreement whereby all material related-party transactions would need to be approved by a majority of the minority shareholders. This listing agreement would be effective from October 1 2014. A material related-party transaction was defined as one that exceeded 20 per cent of the net worth or 5 per cent of the annual turnover of a company whichever was higher. Though MSIL’s proposed action was a material related-party transaction this definition was not binding on the company as these two rules were not yet applicable. Tandon of Institutional Investors Advisory Services summarized the sentiment of the market by saying that “it appears that if Maruti closes the deal before October there will be little minority shareholders can do about it except continuing to engage with the company to try and change its mind or worse sell the stock and exit.” Bhargava however argued that the proposed move would not hurt the interests of the minority shareholders. Since SMG would manufacture and sell cars to MSIL on a cost basis SMG would not make any profit from this transaction. “So instead of Suzuki making any profit in Gujarat it will get 56 percent of the profit while 44 percent goes to Maruti’s minority shareholders.”In February 2014 seven domestic fund managers wrote to the management of MSIL saying that the proposed move was against the interests of the minority shareholders. They did not like MSIL becoming a distribution company as that would change the risk and return profile of the company. These fund managers also alluded to possible legal action if MSIL went ahead with the plan. MSIL’S SECOND PRESS RELEASEOn February 26 2014 MSIL issued a press release that attempted to clarify the controversial transfer-pricing issues. The press release gave the following explanation of how the incremental CAPEX of SMG would be financed:The cost of production of vehicles produced by the Sub[sidiary] would be calculated in an identical manner to that followed by Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) in Haryana and as would have been done if the Gujarat project had been executed by a 100% subsidiary of MSIL. This cost may be called ‘C’ and would not include return on investment and profits.In Haryana MSIL marks up ‘C’ to generate profits which includes the return on capital employed to arrive at the ex-factory sale price to its dealers. The amount of the mark up is determined at all times by market conditions. The amount of this mark up may be called ‘P.’ The sale price to dealers is thus C + P.The Capex needs of the Gujarat Sub would be met by i) the depreciation amount available with the Sub ii) by an amount generated as net surplus from the car pricing and iii) by SMC infusing fresh equity to the extent necessary. The amount of surplus added to ‘C’ would be such as would ensure that the total ex-factory price of cars made available to MSIL remains less than C + P. MSIL would sell the cars to dealers at C + P.The press release also clarified that the initial agreement was for 15 years only and that if the agreement were not extended the assets of SMG would be transferred to MSIL at fair market value. REACTION FROM THE STREETThe stock market did not appear to be satisfied with these clarifications and the stock price fell by 1 per cent on a day when the broad-based index Sensex increased by around 0.5 per cent (see Exhibit 7). Analysts again raised similar objections saying that SMC had no advantage over MSIL in running the new subsidiary. If SMC’s lower cost of capital was the reason why SMC was making the investment then SMC should also have funded the entire incremental CAPEX. Samir Arora fund manager of Helios Capital summarized the frustration of the fund managers: These days the bigger frustration is with many MNCs who try every trick in the book to cheat minority shareholders. A good example is Suzuki whose behavior has been completely anti-minority shareholder. Even after seven big mutual funds of the country objected the [chief executive officer] says the steps they have taken are for the benefit of the minority shareholders as if these MF managers are dumb and do not understand what is in their benefit. Ridiculous. A total of 16 fund managers from the mutual funds and insurance industry wrote a second letter to MSIL asking it to scrap the proposal. The letter expressed these fund managers’ concerns over MSIL becoming a shell company which would ultimately work as a distribution company for the cars manufactured by Suzuki. The letter also questioned the wisdom of the independent directors on the MSIL board. Though it was not legally necessary for MSIL to seek permission from the minority shareholders there were reports that SEBI was exploring legal options to protect the interests of the minority shareholders. BULLISH ON MARUTINot everyone was unhappy however. Even as the domestic fund managers were exploring legal options foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were bullish on MSIL and were increasing their equity stake in MSIL. On March 3 2014 the FII stake in MSIL reached 22 per cent the maximum allowed without obtaining special permission from Reserve Bank of India. There were reasons behind this optimism. MSIL’s third-quarter results for FY 2014 had beat the street estimates. MSIL had reported a 36 per cent increase in quarter-on-quarter net income increased its market share in the passenger vehicle market and reduced its cost of production. MSIL had also launched the new compact AMT car Celerio in the Indian market in February 2014. Passenger vehicles based on AMT technology had never worked in India in the past because of their high fuel consumption. The price difference between automatic and manual transmissions worked out to at least ₹100000 and AMT vehicles used to consume 40 per cent more fuel. These vehicles had never accounted for more than 5 per cent of the total sales of any automobile company in India. However according to S. N. Burman vice-president of MSIL the Celerio cost 60 per cent less to produce compared to similar products in India and its fuel efficiency was comparable to that of cars with manual transmission systems. Indian consumers liked the car very much. Demand for the car increased so much that consumers were willing to wait for seven months to get a car. None of MSIL’s competitors had a matching product and MSIL was expected to capture market share from its peers in the near future. Many analysts were also bullish on MSIL because they expected India’s economy to recover from its slow growth rate after the 2014 general elections. India’s GDP growth rate had fallen from 11.4 per cent in 2010 to 4.4 per cent in 2013 and many analysts expected the GDP growth rate to increase. Though projecting GDP was a hazardous game the market was expecting the GDP growth rate to increase to 5 per cent in 2015 and then fall to 4.8 per cent by 2019 and to a long-term average of around 3.5 per cent by 2025. Since automobile stocks did well during periods of recovery many fund managers increased the proportion of MSIL in their portfolios. Some analysts did not object to MSIL’s announcement because similar past decisions by MSIL had not hurt the interests of minority shareholders. In September 2004 the market had reacted negatively when Suzuki decided to open an assembly and diesel plant in Manesar as a joint venture between MSIL and SMC. MSIL stock similarly fell in February 2007 when Suzuki increased its stake in Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd. (earlier known as Suzuki Metals) from 51 per cent to 70 per cent. However in both cases the stock prices of MSIL bounced back after the company reported robust earnings and these plants merged with MSIL in 2006 and 2012 respectively at a fair valuation.  A few other analysts were of the opinion that the new subsidiary would start producing cars only after 2018 and hence this arrangement would have no short-term effect on Maruti’s results. Analysts expected MSIL to increase its net income by 14.65 per cent in the next five years (see Exhibit 8). WHAT MATTERS TO INVESTORS: GOVERNANCE OR PERFORMANCE?Analysts were clearly divided on what to do with MSIL stock. As fund managers their primary responsibility was to generate higher returns for their investors; however since they controlled a large fraction of shares they were expected to be active while monitoring the performance of companies in which they invested. There were numerous instances of MNCs in India taking advantage of minority shareholders in the past and institutional investors had not interfered but merely stated their unhappiness. For example when ACC Limited and Ambuja Cements (both controlled by Holcim Cements) increased the royalties to be paid to the parent company few institutional investors raised objections. Both companies managed to increase the royalties and institutional investors’ stakes in these two companies increased from 39.8 per cent to 40.5 per cent within a quarter. In similar instances involving Hero Motocorp Ltd. Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Limited and Pfizer Inc. institutional investors raised objections to the anti-minority-shareholder decisions taken by the companies and at the same time increased their equity stakes in these companies.INVESTORS’ DILEMMAAfter reaching a low of ₹1581 MSIL stock had bounced back to ₹1737 on March 14 2014. It was unclear what MSIL would do so it was unclear what the investors should do. MSIL could simply ignore the minority shareholders and go ahead with its proposal as it had done in the past. MSIL could also put the proposal to a vote of the minority shareholders and abide by their decision. According to Gupta “though it is not legally binding on Maruti to get shareholders’ approval as a good corporate governance measure it should do this.” If MSIL asked the shareholders to vote on the proposal shareholders could express their disapproval by voting against it. Otherwise the shareholders could vote with their feet by selling their shares. Alternatively if they perceived MSIL to be a good long-term investment investors might ignore the governance issues and stay invested in the company.Exhibit 1: shareholding pattern in MSIL on december 31 2013Source: Created by the authors based on “Shareholding Pattern” Maruti Suzuki India Limited accessed July 11 2014 www.marutisuzuki.com/shareholding-pattern.aspx.

In the midst of her set she received a phone call. This call was long awaited and she rushed to her father’s office to share the good news—a high-profile investor had purchased 51 per cent of the company.Al Baba Sweets was founded in 1950 by Mohammed Bachir El Baba Ghida’s grandfather in Sidon a small city in the south of Lebanon. The company a third-generation family business was a leader in the oriental sweets production and retail industry in Lebanon. The sales department was the revenue-generating means for the company and it entailed both good quality products and courteous service. Given the country’s economic situation Al Baba Sweets had been suffering from declining revenues but this new investment could help the company become the major market player. Most importantly the investor had agreed to keep Ghida’s family as the primary decision-makers of corporate strategy.Now that the necessary funds had become available Ghida and her father were considering their next steps. Should Al Baba Sweets branch out to other countries? If so which modes of entry should they use? What other possibilities were there to enhance and expand operations?A MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VIEW OF LEBANONBackgroundLebanon a small Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea had gained its independence in 1943. The country was bordered by Syria and Israel and was ranked the seventh-smallest country in Asia with 10452 square kilometres (see Exhibit 1). As of July 2018 the population of Lebanon was estimated at 6100075. The majority of the population lived within or around the capital Beirut. Lebanon was mostly a mountainous country with its highest peak at 10128 feet (3087 metres) and it benefited from dozens of minor rivers flowing from the mountains to the lands mainly to the Bekaa valley.Political and Legal SystemFollowing Lebanon’s independence the country experienced a severe civil war between 1975 and 1990 ending with the implementation of the Ta’if Agreement which created a sectarian division within the government in an attempt to solve the different views of the various political and religious groups. Lebanon’s legal system was a mix of French-inspired civil law Ottoman legal principles and Lebanon’s own rules regarding personal and family statuses. The country’s unstable political situation was related to the 2006 war fights between the different parties a lack of presidency and assassinations of major political figures. That instability had a great impact on the population the majority of which could no longer afford to spend on non-necessary products which harmed the luxury goods industry including the expensive sweets industry. On January 2019 Moody’s downgraded Lebanon’s government rating to Caa1 reflecting the high risk and financial instability of the country. EconomyLebanon’s economy was a free market mostly composed of services with tourism and banking as the most important sectors. However the tourism industry in Lebanon took a downfall after the war in Syria. The Lebanese government did not restrict foreign investment but Lebanon was known for its corruption and fraud. In 2017 the inflation rate was 4.5 per cent; between 2008 and 2015 it averaged 2.18 per cent; in 2015 it hit an all-time low of −4.67 per cent; and in 2012 it peaked at 11 per cent. In 2017 Lebanon’s gross domestic product (GDP) was worth US$51.84 billion. The GDP value of Lebanon represented 8.0 per cent of the world economy.SocialDifferent ethnic groups made up Lebanon’s population—95 per cent were Arab four per cent were Armenian and one per cent were of other origins. Numerous languages were spoken within the country such as Arabic English French and Armenian. Lebanon was considered diverse in its religions—Muslims represented 57.7 per cent of the population; Christians 36 per cent; Druze 5.2 per cent; and the remainder consisted of Jews Baha’is Buddhists and Hindus. Arabic sweets were traditionally provided during special occasions and events in Lebanon. It was popular to have these sugar confectioneries during holidays such as Ramadan. Due to the political instability in the country many Lebanese citizens had chosen to leave the country and migrate to different areas around the world.InfrastructureEven though many reconstruction projects were undertaken after the civil war to improve Lebanon’s infrastructure it was severely damaged and remained substandard suffering from high amounts of congestion. Technological developments enabled businesses to operate more efficiently. Examples included the introduction of mechanized machinery for lower operating costs and better quality and consistency in products as well as customer relationship management software that linked customer orders to the accounting production and warehouse departments of each organization. Technology had changed the shopping experience for customers and made it possible to order from and deliver products to any country in the world. However as of July 2017 Lebanon ranked 131st out of 133 countries in terms of fixed broadband speed according to the Speedtest Global Index thus indicating that Lebanon was one of the worst countries in this regard.The WORLD SWEETS INDUSTRYThe sweets market consisted of chocolates candies cakes Arabic sweets cookies ice cream and other sugar- or sweetener-based products. These products were consumed everywhere in the world and were developing in terms of product and manufacturing innovations.EuropeRevenue from the confectionery segment in Europe reached $21.52 billion in 2018 and was expected to grow 1.1 per cent annually up until 2021. As production capacity increased the market began to grow. For instance Mondelēz International Inc. (Mondelēz) a leading player in Europe had built a huge plant in Turkey and several other international companies were also moving their production abroad. This led to an increase in production capacity as well as the ability to cover all processes from production to packaging. Due to high demand for dark and premium-quality chocolate the chocolate segment was a leader in the confectionery market. Big vendors in the chocolate segment included Ferrero SpA (Ferrero) Nestlé S.A. Mars Incorporated and Mondelēz.The Association of South-East Asian Nations MarketEast Asia had one of the biggest confectionery markets in the world $15.84 billion in 2018 and the market was expected to grow annually by 1.8 per cent. The market of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) included three important confectionery segments: chocolate sugar confectionery and gum. Chocolate was the biggest segment of all and many international companies such as Barry Callebaut had chosen to focus their production on this segment due to low costs and big opportunities. Europe had the largest sweets market followed by the Asia-Pacific region the main markets of which included Thailand Vietnam the Philippines and Indonesia. Indonesia was the top consumer of sweets in the region. The drivers of this market were a growing population with increasing income and increased consumer spending on confectionery; however some drawbacks included rising health concerns government policies raw material costs and changing consumer behaviours. Sweets were usually sold in retail markets supermarkets and convenience shops. Regional and local companies who operated in this market were well connected and had distribution expertise. Major players in the ASEAN market were Ferrero the Hershey Company and Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli AG.The United StatesAs of July 2018 the population of the United States was estimated at 329.2 million 3.7 million of which had roots that could be traced to Arab countries such as Lebanon Syria Palestine Egypt and Iraq. Sugar confectionery sales in the United States constituted $11.997 billion and were forecasted to increase to $14.3828 billion by 2023. Although there were Arabic sweets in the United States they were offered by small bakeries and were not well dispersed throughout the country.The United States was a diverse country where many gourmets sought to experience different authentic cuisines from around the world. There was a growth in non-American food and it was trendy to expose oneself to different foods from exotic places. Another trend in the United States was a growing awareness of healthier food options and Arabic sweets were a healthier alternative to traditional sugar-based American products.In 2019 the sugar confectionery industry in the United States amounted to $18.961 billion and was expected to grow at a rate of 2.3 per cent. The United States was the highest revenue-generating country in the sugar confectionery industry (see Exhibit 2); however the United States was considered a very risky country in which to conduct business; 44 per cent of foreign businesses in the United States failed within four years.Saudi ArabiaIn 2017 the population of Saudi Arabia was estimated at 33100000 37 per cent of which were immigrants who mostly originated from India Pakistan Egypt and Syria. In the same year Saudi Arabia imported $119 billion worth of imports—a large part of which were food products.Sales of sugar confectioneries in Saudi Arabia constituted $463 million and were forecasted to increase to $629 million by 2023. Saudi Arabia had the eighth-highest per-capita consumption of confectionery products among the top 10 confectionery growth markets. In 2017 the market structure was formed as follows: 33 per cent was domestic production 44 per cent was imports and 23 per cent constituted trade margins. The market structure by buyer was made up of 95 per cent households and five per cent business-to-business purchases. In 2016 Saudi Arabia’s imports of snack foods including sweets were mainly from Italy Turkey and Poland as those countries dominated with both product quality and accessible prices. Sweets in Saudi Arabian shops consisted mostly of the same sweets offered in other Arab countries including baklava kanafeh and qatayef.With 70 per cent of its population under the age of 30 Saudi Arabia was an attractive growth market for a large range of food products especially confectionery and beverages. This under-30 segment was known for its fast lifestyle and high disposable income and was likelier to try new convenient food products. Saudi Arabia’s extremely hot weather conditions which lasted for almost the entire year continued to increase demand for refreshing foods and non-alcoholic beverages.The Saudi government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to assist foreign investors. The government offered many business incentives including 100 per cent foreign ownership of properties and companies in some industries and low minimum capital requirements (see Exhibit 3). The SWEETS INDUSTRY IN LEBANONBackgroundThe origins of Lebanon’s sweets empires were humble. They began as small shops in major Lebanese cities. A high presence of sugar and milk in Tripoli and the influences of the Ottoman Empire encouraged confectioners to create Arabic sweets. Now in their third fourth or even fifth generation these initially small family businesses had expanded and diversified into big companies that owned several branches in and outside of Lebanon.The food and beverages sector constituted 32 per cent of the country’s GDP in 2017. It included the largest number of industrial establishments with 1401 producers accounting for 22 per cent of industrial enterprises. Out of those 18 per cent produced sugar confectioneries and 16 per cent produced bakery and pastry products. In 2017 about 329000 tons of agri-food products were exported from Lebanon 32.2 per cent of which were sugars and sugar confectionery. The major destinations of these exports were Syria Saudi Arabia Iraq Qatar and the United States.Sector Opportunities and ThreatsArabic sweets were usually of interest to the older generation as people over the age of 40 had been familiar with these sweets long before the emergence of French or American confectionery and they had always served Arabic sweets during special occasions and events. Lebanese culture dictated that events like Ramadan Christmas births graduations and weddings were celebrated with sweets usually Arabic sweets. However young people were shifting away from Arabic sweets as they preferred the taste of American and French sweets which also happened to have more exposure over social media than their Arabic counterparts. Some manufacturers of Arabic sweets had higher retail prices because they adopted a differentiation strategy highlighting the superior quality of raw materials used compliance with international food safety standards and elegant presentation and packaging. Higher retail prices targeted Lebanese upper middle-class customers.The Arabic sweets sector benefited from a wealth of resources and technical support by private incubators and associations such as the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon which provided market data analyses legal and accounting advice and training in the field of business ventures. The Banque du Liban (Bank of Lebanon) offered sponsored financial advances to help the improvement and development of profitable ventures. Skilled relatively cost-effective and educated labour was readily available to support such ventures.Growth Rate and MaturityIn terms of industry age Arabic products were considered mature for several reasons. First they had been present in the market for more than 150 years and had become part of Lebanese culture. Products were constantly renewed through the introduction of new flavours. In addition manufacturing processes were shifting toward mechanization such as with the introduction of the maamoul molds. More investments were being made to reduce costs by further distributing fixed costs. In addition operating efficiency was set to improve with the introduction of mechanized manufacturing processes. Market share was maintained in Lebanon and was improving with new social media marketing platforms which increased brand awareness worldwide. Profitability had been in slight decline for some years due to the country’s political instability and this had been the case for all players. CompetitorsAl Baba Sweets was one of the five most prominent Arabic sweets manufacturers in Lebanon. The others were Abdul Rahman Hallab & Sons (Hallab) Douaihy SeaSweet and Amal Bohsali (see Exhibit 4). Hallab was renowned for its major customer loyalty in northern Lebanon its area of origin. Also it was a pioneer in online shopping and international delivery and remained very strong in these areas. Most of Hallab’s outlets were franchised in Lebanon and around the world. Its goal was to cater to both the older more traditional generation as well as the younger one by innovating but at the same time not changing the flavours. Douaihy and SeaSweet had very loyal customer bases in the Mount Lebanon region which was also their area of origin. Douaihy’s competitive edge was its youthful branding in terms of packaging and outlet design. Some of Douaihy’s branches offered French pastries salads and snacks to cater to the younger generation. SeaSweet on the other hand was relatively behind in terms of innovation in branding but had introduced some Western cakes and pastries to its menus. Amal Bohsali had high customer loyalty in the Beirut area and its outlets were limited to the capital itself. It preferred to stick to the traditional approach by focusing solely on Arabic sweets. AL BABA SWEETSCompany BackgroundIn 1934 13-year-old Mohammed Bachir El Baba worked at a Lebanese sweets retailer in Sidon Lebanon. Drawing on his experience as well as his talent and enthusiasm for the trade he started his own home-based sweets business in 1943. His venture was successful and in 1950 he opened a shop in Sidon offering homemade quality sweets to the neighbouring locals.Sixty-seven years later Al Baba Sweets had become a major and innovative sweets manufacturing and retailing company in the Middle East. It had seven outlets in Lebanon—three in Sidon two in Beirut one in Choueifat and one in Chtaura—and four spread between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.Mission and VisionThe company’s mission was as follows: “We strive to satisfy customer tastes while maintaining food innovations and quality standards. We work to create a welcoming environment for our customers while learning and adjusting to their needs and tastes.” Their vision was as follows: We aim to become the leading destination for traditional sweets in the Middle East and Gulf region while maintaining the best quality and hygiene standards. We want to build a team of expert employees in food and customer service. And ultimately we want to make our customer part of this family business whilst understanding his needs and adjusting to them.Value Chain and Business ModelInbound Logistics: Suppliers delivered the raw materials to the headquarters in Sidon in a closed receiving area. The portfolio of suppliers was very diversified and had a strong relationship with the company.Operations: When an online order was placed the warehouse delivered the materials to the factory which was located in the same building. Factories were equipped with machines; however the nature of some products required that they be handmade. A quality control department inspected the materials and sent the finished goods for packaging. All Al Baba Sweets retail stores throughout Lebanon made their factory requests using an online ordering system. Delivery trucks were then sent to distribute the products.Outbound Logistics: Some products were ordered online. After-sales service was handled by the customer service department which followed up on all complaints and customer satisfaction.Al Baba Sweets products were promoted by the firm itself through social media and public relations (PR) events. Retail displays changed seasonally or when new products were introduced. Sales were conducted directly in the shops or through the online buying platform which delivered globally. The latter’s orders were handled by a third-party transportation company. The accounting human resources (HR) and purchasing departments worked closely together to produce reports that were used to make C-level decisions (see Exhibit 5).Outcomes of different company operations were monitored by different departments and managers—for example the quality assurance department followed up on food quality and safety the operations department followed up on production and delivery and the outlets manager followed up on retail operations. Each Al Baba Sweets retail store had a specific target it was required to reach by the end of the fiscal year. Al Baba Sweets focused heavily on the quality of their products. They did random quality inspections at least once a week using an in-house microbiology lab. Marketing and Sales: Marketing was mainly done through social media PR events and in-store marketing. Sales took place in Al Baba Sweets retail stores or through online purchases.Service: Employees were trained on the job and through manuals on company products and services. They attended customer service workshops every six months. Other than retail targets employees worked to reach their own individual sales targets and were rewarded accordingly. The HR department oversaw scheduling analyzed and reported employee shortages resolved employee conflicts and issued warnings when directed by the general manager or outlets manager. It also ensured that employees abided by internal and external regulations. Technology was introduced in the manufacturing process as well as in operations. An online system linked the supply chain and allowed consumers to purchase products directly through the firm’s website. In addition Al Baba Sweets used third-party delivery platforms such as Zomato to have more market accessibility.Factory and EmployeesAl Baba Sweets’ labour force gave the company a competitive market edge. The company had loyal employees who had been with Al Baba Sweets for three generations. Its employees were faithful and devoted to the firm and had the unique skill set and talent to produce sweets of the highest quality and design. This was highly crucial for Al Baba Sweets as its Arabic sweets factories were 30 per cent labour intensive and its French pastries factory was 50 per cent labour intensive. Furthermore Al Baba Sweets was not fully utilizing the capabilities of its factories: the Arabic sweets factories were only operating at 30 per cent; the French pastries factory at 60 per cent.There were 60 employees distributed among Al Baba Sweets retail outlets including branch managers cashiers waiters and sales employees. The outlets were the company’s largest means of generating revenue (see Exhibit 6). During low seasons the general manager usually cut the budget and did not take on any new hires (See Exhibits 7 and 8).AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPANSION Ghida and her father were preparing for a meeting with the investor in order to discuss all of the issues pertaining to the company’s declining revenues as well as possible growth strategies. They had to decide whether Al Baba Sweets should branch out to other countries—and if so which modes of entry to use—or whether the company should focus on enhancing and expanding operations within Lebanon.Exhibit 1: MAP OF LEBANONSource: Adapted from The World Factbook s.v. “Lebanon” accessed April 5 2019 www.cia.gov/llibrary/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html last updated August 14 2019.

The invitation came from the MES program director who had contacted Innovation Works through his professional network. The program director saw a good opportunity for Pendlebury and possibly other students to gain valuable experience on a real project. This type of project also aligned with the program’s strategy to further develop its relationships within the local community. Earlier that year Pendlebury had gained some exposure to waste management and waste auditing procedures in her coursework including a waste management workshop and waste audit project through the MES consulting course. She accepted the invitation eager to enhance her expertise in waste management while gaining valuable project management experience. At a preliminary meeting with Innovation Works staff on June 11 Pendlebury learned that the week of June 18 would be an ideal time to start the waste collection for the audit which left her 48 hours to compile a waste audit plan and allow sufficient time for Innovation Works’ approval. With little time to spare Pendlebury started to formulate her plan.Innovation works LONDONThe idea for Innovation Works was introduced in a living room amid a small gathering of like-minded individuals. Together they imagined London’s very own co-working space where change-makers and innovators could intersect and cross-pollinate: a space dedicated to social innovation. The concept for Innovation Works would soon be embraced by a community of champions eager to make it happen.Pillar was one such champion. Pillar drove the early development of the project leveraging its experience in community impact and cross-sector collaboration. Working together with other local non-profit organizations such as Emerging Leaders the London Arts Council and the London Heritage Council Pillar engaged the Centre for Social Innovation (CSI) to support the development of a co-working space for social innovators in London. Located in Toronto Ontario the CSI was Canada’s first co-working space for social innovators and had been a globally recognized leader in the field of collaborative communities and innovation since its inception in 2004. Working from the CSI’s models and best practices the Innovation Works project was propelled forward.In August 2014 Pillar announced its purchase of the Garvey Building at 201 King Street in the heart of downtown London Ontario. Innovation Works had a home. Pillar programing staff and resources supported the space but at its heart Innovation Works was a community-driven initiative.Innovation Works encompassed a total of 32000 square feet (2973 square metres) over five floors (including the basement). The building was divided into co-working spaces (private desks and part-time desks) private offices meeting rooms events rooms and other amenities; each floor had a unique combination of such spaces. The basement contained a small studio used for a weekly yoga class and a co-working space. The ground floor had a large common area coffee shop meeting rooms and events rooms. The second and third floors comprised co-working spaces and meeting rooms while the entire fourth floor was occupied by two companies each and had its own separate enclosed offices and one large meeting room. The June 11 MeetingOn June 11 Pendlebury met with Sienna Jae Taylor community animator at Innovation Works to discuss the upcoming audit. Taylor explained that the reason for the audit was to pursue one of Innovation Works’ core tenets. Taylor gestured to the wall behind them referring to Innovation Works’ manifesto prominently displayed on the ground floor common area near the coffee shop. She singled out the first tenet as displayed:Put people and planet first We are connected by one shared vision: to put people and planet first. Everything we do every decision exchange system product and offering must move us closer to justice and equity.Taylor explained that Innovation Works wanted to improve its waste management practices in line with its mission to “put people and planet first.” To pursue this mission Taylor needed some help. She had some suspicions that Innovation Works’ current three-stream system (landfill recycling and organics) was not being used to its full potential but without any hard data to back up her beliefs she could not confidently formulate a strategic plan for improvement. Taylor mentioned that Innovation Works employed a single caretaker who handled waste collection and disposal into three separate receptacles. Waste pickup was provided by three different parties: one for landfill waste one for recycling and one for compost. To collect waste for the audit the caretaker recycling company and compost company would need to be notified in advance of the waste collection phase. The basement offered adequate space to store more than a week’s worth of waste.Moving forward with the PlanAfter the June 11 meeting Pendlebury reflected on Taylor’s desire to improve the use of the three-stream system at Innovation Works. The daily fluctuation in occupants and activities at Innovation Works presented a challenge. Pendlebury wanted to mitigate the potential for day-to-day abnormalities in waste production to affect the data collection and subsequent analysis. She wanted to design an audit that captured an appropriate sample for analysis and then provide Taylor with relatively detailed actionable data but with limited resources. She had access to some data from a previous student’s project at Innovation Works. That data included monthly energy and water consumption (see Exhibit 1) and the number of pickups for the three streams of waste (see Exhibit 2). Pendlebury had recruited four volunteers (including the MES program director) to help her conduct the audit assuring them they would need only one evening to complete the audit together. She also determined that she would have time to assemble all the necessary supplies to complete the audit provided she first completed a supply list.Pendlebury got to work organizing her ideas by drafting an audit plan document. She had agreed to submit this document to her volunteer team and Taylor within 48 hours so that it could be reviewed in time to prepare for the waste collection phase of the audit.Exhibit 1: innovation works’ monthly Energy and water CONSUMPTION 2017Note: m3 = cubic metres; kWh = kilowatt hours; n.a. = not applicableSource: Innovation Works files.Exhibit 2: innovation works’ monthly Waste collection by number of bins used 2017Note: All streams were picked up on a weekly basis.

(Twenty One Toys) a Toronto-based designer and manufacturer of wooden toys that taught key skills such as empathy creative communication and collaboration. On July 20 2017 Ben-Ari was speaking with her team in their open-concept office at the Centre for Social Innovation on Bathurst Street a space Twenty One Toys shared with more than a dozen other social enterprise start-ups. “We’ve got a great network of customers around the world and facilitators who use our toys. What should our goals look like for the next year?” Ben-Ari asked. She had three full-time and one part-time staff and the Empathy Toy Twenty One Toys’ first product was now sold in 45 countries and was in over 1000 schools and over 100 companies around the world. Now Ben-Ari and the team were thinking of ways to build upon the momentum of the first product. Their key concern was how to operate a growing firm on a shoestring budget. In a recent post on the blogging platform Medium Ben-Ari who had been growing her toy start-up for years with limited capital offered her thoughts on the challenge of managing a start-up’s finances:There are a lot of secrets when it comes to starting a business. The first secret I discovered when I started my own business designing toys that teach empathy and failure was that entrepreneurs barely pay themselves for at least the first few years. That’s because we are merely vessels dare I say train stations for money. As sales increase more money comes through your station but it’s not stopping. It has places to go people to see talks to give. You are merely waving to it on its way through your station. Wishing it luck and hoping it comes back. Maybe it even brings a few friends with it when it returns. Making the train stop when you’re just beginning means it won’t go towards other things. Things that are far away and hard to get to otherwise. So you keep waving at your money saying hello and goodbye and working until one day hopefully the train makes a stop at your station.In July 2017 with sales from the Empathy Toy growing Ben-Ari and her team were determined to craft a plan to set Twenty One Toys on a path to take it to the next level. In particular Ben-Ari wanted to examine her company’s marketing plan for corporate training and the high-school market and the financial plan that would support that plan.Twenty One Toys Inc.Twenty One Toys had come a long way since its early beginnings in 2010 in an old theatre space in Montreal that Ben-Ari had shared with circus performers. She had been inspired by the originator of Kindergarten Friedrich Froebel who had designed 20 educational toys for children in the 19th century. “I named my firm Twenty One Toys in recognition of Froebel’s contribution to learning and development and because we were now living in the 21st century” she recalled. Ben-Ari was an industrial designer with a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Design (with distinction) from Carleton University. Her thesis had explored the development of a navigational aid for people who were visually impaired for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. In the process of designing her product she noticed that there was a large social and emotional gap between people who were sighted and the visually impaired community. Her prototype designed to teach navigational skills turned into a product with applications for sighted students. She stated:My product won “Best in Show” at a design competition. But I was a lighting designer and one of my first thoughts was that while the reaction was great what could I do with it? I tried to sell the idea to a company but no one was buying toy ideas. I had student loans to pay off so I shelved the idea for a few years. Then in 2010 she left her lighting design job and moved to Montreal armed with a CA$1200 artist’s grant. “I had no idea what I was doing but I was determined” she continued. “I decided I could make it happen as long as I told every person I met what my plan was: I was going to change education with toys.” She used $400 of the artist’s grant to create a website another portion to create prototypes at a friend’s jewellery studio and the remaining funds to purchase tickets to two design conferences: Bitnorth in Northern Quebec and The Feast in New York. “Both conferences not only opened my eyes to the incredible work engineers designers and entrepreneurs were doing to make the world a better place —  [they were also] the beginning of my acceptance that I wasn’t just a designer I was a design-entrepreneur” she noted. Ben-Ari needed to develop a presentation as part of meeting the requirements of attending Bitnorth. Owing to the presentation she gave at the conference Ben-Ari was invited to given the opening speech at the TEDx conference in Montreal in 2011. In March 2012 Ben-Ari started an internship at Design Against Crime a “socially motivated design consultancy” based at Central Saint Martins College of the University of the Arts in London England. There she learned more about what it meant to make social concerns a part of the design process. Her next step was to move to a start-up accelerator Startup Sauna in Finland which was offering grants of €15000–€25000 to entrepreneurs without prior funding. While Ben-Ari was able to win one of the grants she was unable to take advantage of it as she had to return to Canada because of an unforeseen family issue. She recounted what happened next in fall of 2012:I came back to Canada defeated and broke. I’d spent the last of my savings working to win that grant and now I had nothing. One of my best friends convinced me to move in with her in Toronto. She said I could sleep on her couch borrow her clothes and sneak into her workplace at the Centre for Social Innovation until I got back on my feet. So I slept on her couch for months sneaking into every education conference I could bouncing around between Montreal and Toronto. I gatecrashed more events kept writing in my blog and started getting requests to use the toys in youth programs in Uganda and Trinidad. I went back to my friend Harvey’s [jewellery] studio in Montreal made eight more prototypes. Sanded them in another best friend’s lab and sent them on their way.Then just a month after publicly announcing the name Twenty One Toys I made my first official toy sale to a school board in Toronto. Thanks to a consultant I met at one of those conferences a school board found my TEDx talk on Twitter and put in a pre-order for 30 toy sets. I nervously asked: “Great! Can you pay in full and wait five months for me to manufacture?” They agreed. The following week we won three awards — The Centre for Social Innovation’s Youth Agents of Change Award (free rent and mentorship!) the Youth Social Innovation Capital Fund (a 2-year 10k [$10000] loan) and the Spin Master Innovation Award (a 4-year 50k [$50000] loan with mentorship).After her first sale Ben-Ari began thinking about other channels through which she could sell her product. She focused on the corporate training market noting that it was a large market and that empathy training was becoming more recognized and accepted. The dual focus of selling directly to schools and selling to corporate consultants who offered empathy training meant that she needed to develop two different go-to-market strategies. Yet the two market segments had commonalities meaning the majority of the training materials that Ben-Air needed to develop including facilitator instruction plans could be shared.The First Product“My instinct is that we are creating a new category here using toys to teach specific skills” remarked Ben-Ari. “At the beginning it’ll take more work and time to acquire customers. But by setting ourselves as the thought leaders in the market we can lead the industry in this niche. We will look to partner with others as we grow.”The Empathy Toy (see Exhibit 1) sold for $149 for the At-Home Set $299 for the Teacher’s Kit or the Facilitator’s Kit and $799 for a bundle of three Teacher’s Kits or three Facilitator’s Kits including 90 minutes of online training and a professional development workshop. Each Empathy Toy set included combinations of walnut and maple puzzle pieces that participants had to replicate while blindfolded. An Empathy Toy session took between 30 minutes and an hour and began with a briefing of the task—one partner would be blindfolded and the other would provide instructions. A number of puzzle pieces were to be put together in a complex shape with each piece attaching to the others at odd angles. The goal of the task was for the instructor to provide clear direction to the blindfolded participant to enable that participant to build a replica of the complex shape. The learning point occurred during the game when it became evident that issuing instructions that can be grasped by someone without the benefit of sight was a lot tougher than it seemed. The real value in the toy was in the conversation it could start; this was why the toy sets came with guidebooks offering over 50 ways to adapt the game for lessons in the classroom or on a staff retreat.“Our top priority was to get a strong handle [on] manufacturing” said Ben-Ari. Twenty One Toys reviewed and rejected three manufacturers before finding a firm in China to build its toys. Thanks to its being awarded the Spin Master Innovation Fund the company was introduced to ethical manufacturers known to Spin Master Toys. Ben-Ari insisted that a toy about empathy needed to be produced and sold ethically. “The Chinese manufacturer we use can mass-produce ethically” said Ben-Ari. “The owners of Spin Master Toys made the introduction for us and I have since gotten to know the ethical manufacturer’s owner and his family. As quality is of the highest importance to us I am on site for weeks every time we go into production.”One of the most important lessons Ben-Ari learned as she placed her first product orders was to conserve the cash she had. “Between trying to coordinate our production runs with pre-orders and developing support materials for our toys we’re tapped out for cash” she noted. Production runs were generally scheduled three to six months in advance.The Market for Educational Toys—Training and RetailTwenty One Toys’ products appealed to at least three different market segments: educational toys for consumers training tools in educational settings and training tools aimed at the corporate training market. Ben-Ari reviewed information from the three markets in an effort to understand the size and dynamics of each segment.Educational ToysThe global toy market was worth US$87.4 billion in 2015 (the U.S. market was worth US$20.4 billion) and revenues from games and puzzles were US$1.95 billion in 2016 up from US$1.64 billion in 2015. Several categories of toys could be combined under what could be considered educational toys: games and puzzles construction sets and technology-enabled toys. Leaders in the toy market included Lego A/S Mattel and Hasbro with sales of US$5.38 billion US$5.46 billion and US$5.02 billion respectively. Lego had about a 6 per cent share of the global market in its segment. An increasingly popular segment of the toy market was educational toys powered by software such as LeapFrog’s LeapPad devices which delivered educational content to children. However the growth in online and smartphone-based applications had started encroaching on the market for technology-powered educational toys and even industry-leading firms such as LeapFrog were struggling as competitors proliferated.Educational toys were purchased by consumers through traditional retail channels such as Toys “R” Us and Walmart and purchased online through websites such as Amazon.com. Manufacturers tended to have dozens if not hundreds of different products available for sale. Lego for example launched on average 130 new Lego sets per year. Retail stores tended to stock product that consumers would find appealing devoting shelf space to product categories such as construction sets puzzles and games. Within each category of toys a category manager selected what was believed to be the bestsellers for the upcoming year and placed monthly orders to restock the shelves. For new manufacturers such as Twenty One Toys it was typical to work through distributors who presented new items to these category managers. Distributors tended to earn a 5–10 per cent margin on sales and retailers required a margin of between 30 and 50 per cent of the selling price. The key sales period for retailers was the November to December holiday period. Unsold merchandise was generally discounted for sale in January when the process of selecting the following year’s potential bestsellers began anew.Corporate TrainingIn 2016 around 126000 U.S. firms—each with an employee base of more than 100—spent a total of US$70.7 billion on corporate training expenditures. The bulk of these expenditures was on payroll for training staff at US$37 billion; training expenditures such as travel facilities and equipment at US$26.1 billion; and spending on outside products and services at US$7.5 billion. According to Statista there were 637690 management consultants in the United States in 2016 up from 614110 in 2015 and the management consulting industry was estimated to be worth US$251 billion up from US$240 billion in 2015. Consultants offering corporate training including empathy training tended to cultivate relationships with key players at corporate clients’ firms including the human resources team and the leadership team. Demand for corporate training could stem from firms asking for specific training programs or from consultants successfully selling new programs to corporate leaders. Consultants for hire could differentiate themselves from their competitors through a combination of innovative programming strong delivery and relationships with key decision makers.About 20 per cent of U.S. employers offered empathy training as part of their corporate training according to Richard S. Wellins a senior vice-president with Development Dimensions International. In 2016 Development Dimensions International summarized an analysis of 15000 leaders in 18 countries over 10 years by stating that empathy was the “number one leadership skill for overall success.” The average U.S. corporate training budget by organization type can be found in Exhibit 2.Twenty One Toys held professional development workshops which attracted 20 to 200 people per workshop. Ben-Ari and her team targeted larger corporations that could afford these training sessions. The workshops were intended to generate awareness of the importance of empathy to develop empathy skills among these corporations’ employees and to earn consulting revenue for Twenty One Toys.Twenty One Toys provided two types of training workshops: in-person and online. Individual facilitators and teachers could choose from a full-day training workshop at Twenty One Toys’ head office discounted to $499 to $999 per person or they could have a customized program delivered on-site which included consultation with Twenty One Toys pre- and post-training. The customized program’s cost was comparable with typical on-site programs. As an example an on-site program held by a typical human resources consultancy ranged from $5000 to $15000.Online training was targeted at internal facilitators and external consultants—perhaps a manager of human resources the CEO of a start-up or an educational consultant looking to book business with clients. These 90-minute online sessions involved a Twenty One Toys representative providing the leader an overview of the Empathy Toy a list of the resources available on its site and feedback and recommendations to help prepare for leading a training session. Online sessions were priced competitively—at less than $1000—and were designed to generate interest from self-directed workshop leaders. An agenda for a typical in-person training session can be found in Exhibit 3.After these training workshops corporate employees who were passionate about using the Empathy Toy could reach out to Twenty One Toys for further help and support in using it within their corporations. Those who wanted to use it more broadly—for example within a large firm—could seek certification under Twenty One Toys’ Enterprise Partner Certification (EPC) program. The EPC program provided training and licensing to run large group workshops and provided impact measurement and access to Twenty One Toys’ toy library. This approach supported Twenty One Toys’ larger goal—to support play-based learning to teach skills such as empathy in business and to track long-term impact. In general licensing would include multi-day training to certify facilitators listing the corporation as an approved partner of Twenty One Toys. Ben-Ari said “If we run a workshop and then train one facilitator this person has deep impact because he or she can carry out workshops with multiple groups.”Ben-Ari believed that there was a big opportunity for consultants to add empathy training to their lineup and that the Empathy Toy could facilitate these training sessions. Some educational consultants learned about the Empathy Toy through Ben-Ari’s online presentations and media articles. These warm leads could be easily closed as the potential customers were already well aware of the benefits the Empathy Toy could bring to their training sessions. Selling sets of Empathy Toys to new consultants meant reaching out to consulting teams and providing information about the Empathy Toy and its reviews then following-up to ascertain interest and to answer any questions they might have.Education Segment—Universities Colleges High SchoolsFor the education segment the selection of customized programs such as empathy training tended to lie with each individual school’s leadership team including program managers and at high schools the principal and vice-principal. Ben-Ari noted that a personal approach was necessary to convince individual schools to adopt innovations such as the Empathy Toy. Twenty One Toys could consider part of this market segment to include approximately 16000 educational institutions in Canada from elementary to postgraduate schools (see Exhibit 4).In total approximately five million students attended public elementary and secondary schools in Canada and two million students attended Canadian universities and colleges. Elementary and secondary schools were grouped and managed under school boards. For example Ontario had 31 English public school boards 29 English Catholic school boards four French public school boards and eight French Catholic school boards. In total the Ontario government spent $22.6 billion on education funding employing 123577 full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers of whom 42338 were secondary school teachers. Ontario had approximately 635759 high-school students.Ben-Ari and her team had been able to hold workshops at schools interested in learning more about the Empathy Toy. Twenty One Toys’ website had generated many of these enquiries from guidance counsellors teachers professors and principals who contacted the firm asking for more information on how to arrange for sessions. The decision to host a workshop depended on the commitment of the individual at the school. This leader—the internal champion—would seek approval for the workshop from “management” or the principal’s office find a source for funds and arrange for groups of students to attend.Many high schools set aside enrichment funds that they could tap into to pay for Twenty One Toys’ workshops at a 30 per cent discount compared with the typical corporate on-site training price. It was possible to arrange for multiple workshops at different schools in a city. To do this Ben-Ari and her team would ask a potential customer for contacts in other schools then follow-up with warm or cold calls. A typical school-based session would be run the same as would a corporate training session. The key difference was that school audiences were typically larger—perhaps 50 teachers—and required Twenty One Toys to have more than one facilitator on site. The fee included a day-long session at the school facilitated by Ben-Ari and another Twenty One Toys facilitator. The facilitators would arrive with as many toy kits as were necessary in the session. Schools could also purchase kits after the session if they wished.While Twenty One Toys could see enormous potential in the education segment Ben-Ari wanted to think more about how best to tackle this market. For example as large as the Canadian market seemed the U.S. market was about 10 times the size and Twenty One Toys had received inquiries from institutions in such distant countries as Switzerland and Hong Kong. Taking a facilitator team beyond Toronto would involve travelling time and expenses such as lodging and meals. There was one big advantage of hosting these workshops. Going directly to both the corporate training and educational market meant that the toys could be sold at full price thereby earning a typical 50 per cent gross margin.Marketing and PromotionTwenty One Toys sold its kits directly to consumers schools businesses and workshop facilitators. Currently about 20 per cent were sold to consumers 46 per cent to schools and 34 per cent to businesses and workshop facilitators. Twenty One Toys had distributors in the United States Europe and Australia. “Half of our sales are outside Canada: we’ve got strong support in the U.S. and distributors on the ground in Switzerland Denmark and Australia” Ben-Ari said. The company’s distributors were sales representatives who had connections with key retailers in each country. These distributors had built up relationships with retailers over decades by bringing to them innovative products that sold well. Many of Ben-Ari’s distributors took the initiative to introduce themselves to Twenty One Toys because they felt that the Empathy Toy was a compelling product. And despite not having a team in either the corporate market or the educational market sales were still rising rapidly. Ben-Ari had purposefully kept her burn rate as low as possible thus far as the company had only 2.5 FTE contractors. Guidebooks and training resources were made available to purchase online and Ben-Ari’s team continually added new material to Twenty One Toys’ website. “All of our growth has been achieved through just word of mouth and without spending anything on traditional marketing. We can continue on this path but I’d like to know if we will need a more substantial online marketing push and if our in-person training will be enough to enter new markets.”As more people learned about the Empathy Toy they would be inclined to visit the site and place orders for more toy sets. Twenty One Toys had considered launching a global online community as an extension of its training and certification programs. Ben-Ari wondered what the commitment to building this community would cost above dedicating an employee to be an online community manager. “Would it be worth our effort to focus on creating online resources first before travelling to provide onsite support?” she wondered.On the other hand Ben-Ari could continue developing the business one school at a time spending days at high school and working with school educators to hold workshops on-site. It was Ben-Ari’s experience that the schools could commit to buying 20 sets per school. One of Ben-Ari’s plans was to develop a schedule to visit 10 schools per district per trip. A related strategy was to meet school district educators in charge of developing curriculum for that region encouraging district educators to buy multiple sets for each of their schools in their area. For example in May 2016 Ben-Ari travelled to train groups of teachers from different schools: 100 teachers from schools in Winnipeg and on another occasion 40 teachers from schools in Geneva Switzerland. Pictures from a facilitation session can be found in Exhibit 5.Looking Forward to the Launch of the Failure ToyBen-Ari was aware that she would be in charge of an increasingly more complex operation. “I didn’t go to business school; when I went to design school I thought I was just learning to become a good employee” she said. “The idea of calling myself an ‘entrepreneur’ didn’t even cross my mind until about two years into it.” One of Ben-Ari’s business mentors who had observed the company since its founding estimated that Twenty One Toys could achieve revenues of perhaps $12 million with a broad suite of toys within three years or $1 million per toy. The revenues would not come from sales of the toys alone: they would include other consulting training and certification services that Twenty One Toys could provide. “Is this estimate realistic and if so how can we get to that level of revenues?” asked Ben-Ari. She also wondered how they could develop brand ambassadors in the community.At present Ben-Ari wanted to make it easier for potential customers to find Twenty One Toys. “People may encounter our toys in a session and come away with a great experience” she said. “But it takes three to five steps for them to find us: they have to go online and search for us then navigate to our website and contact us. Instead we are thinking of offering an app that can be downloaded onto their smartphone during the training session. Is this a good idea?”The concept of making it easier for customers to connect with Twenty One Toys could also be extended to its distributor partners. Ben-Air met quarterly with her distributors in the United States Europe and Australia. “We’d like to streamline the way we deal with our distributors” she stated. “We are making available more online resources and building our Facilitator community so that we can spark demand for them. Currently we have three internal facilitators including me and we hope to grow this number to up to six by the end of 2017.” Ben-Ari noted that the number of facilitators that her company could hire depended on the number of schools that signed on for sessions. “How do we streamline this process so that we have schools and organizations coming to us for sessions?” she wondered. Twenty One Toys had recently uploaded an article onto its website—“21 Leaders”—about how a school was transformed by a year-long empathy-based leadership program that used the Empathy Toy. “There was an 85 per cent reduction in conflict based office referrals following the program” Ben-Ari said. “What more can we do to get the word out? And should we continue to charge a per-school facilitation fee or should we move to a per-classroom fee?” She thought about offering multi-day training sessions and about how best to license Twenty One Toys’ products and facilitation sessions. “Am I missing any opportunities to grow the business?” she asked her colleagues. Customer feedback on the Empathy Toy can be found in Exhibit 6.In 2016 Twenty One Toys had doubled its revenues each year for the past two years. “And that’s just with one toy” noted Ben-Ari. “What should our growth strategy look like with our Failure Toy and with our pipeline of new products?”Exhibit 1: The Empathy ToySource: Company documents.Exhibit 2: Average U.S. Corporate Training Budget 2016 (in US$)Source: “2016 Training Industry Report” (November/December 2016): 29 Training accessed January 23 2017 https://trainingmag.com/sites/default/files/images/Training_Industry_Report_2016.pdf.Exhibit 3: Twenty one toys’ In-Person Training Session AgendaSource: Company documents.Exhibit 4: educational institutions in CanadaSource: Council of Ministers of Education Canada “Some Facts About Canada’s Population” accessed April 23 2017 https://www.cmec.ca/299/Education-in-Canada-An-Overview/index.html.Exhibit 5: Twenty One Toys—Facilitation SessionsSource: Company documents.Exhibit 6: Twenty One Toys—Customer FeedbackThe Empathy Toy for Job InterviewsMaRS Discovery District Toronto ON Julia Scott—Human Resources Managers MaRS Discovery District: People in job interviews tend to say things like “I’m a great communicator” or “I really love collaboration” but it can be difficult to test for that in an interview format.We spend about 30 minutes of the second interview using the Empathy Toy. We play the game twice. During the first game the hiring manager provides instruction to the candidate. It’s interesting to see how the candidate receives instruction from their potential manager. For example do they wait and listen first before they start to move the pieces or do they just launch right into it and start shoving things together? Are they asking for clarification?After the first game the candidate has an opportunity to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Then they play one more game. This time the candidate provides the instructions to the hiring manager.In that second game we are looking to see if the candidate can identify the key lessons that will help them improve. In one case the first game was very challenging for the candidate as a result of vague descriptions. [The candidate] kept saying that the pieces “fit together” without exploring or attempting to explain more specifically how they fit together. After removing the blindfolds they saw that the pieces slide together in a groove on the pieces. However this insight did not get applied in the next game. This was really telling for me—[the candidate] had the opportunity to learn from something that went badly but didn’t take it.The game actually led to insights not just about the candidate but about the people doing the hiring as well. It was fascinating watching my colleagues deal with the challenges of the game. It revealed that there could be opportunities to try some communication and collaboration exercises with our own staff. In fact I plan on using it for a team building activity for our HR team in the fall.Empathy-Based Leadership Program to Reduce BullyingSt John's High School Winnipeg MBVice Principal Cree Crowchild—“How an Empathy-Based Leadership Program Changed a School:While we were playing with [The Empathy Toy] one family was speaking in Tagalog [a language native to the Philippines] to start which was fine with me—whatever you’re comfortable with. Then they started having problems so they went to English and were still having problems. Then they went to a combination of English and Tagalog to the point where they finally figured it out. That’s what the game does—you do what you need to do until you figure it out. And to me that was like wow! Kids and parents are working together. That’s the purpose of the game to find a common language—whatever that may look like. Finding a common ground where you can build an understanding. For me it doesn’t matter where you come from you can still get along.[Mayor Bowman] played the game with a student and said “Wow this is so great! It’s such a simple idea!” I could tell he was interested in exploring it further. So when he [hosted the Mayor’s National Summit on Racial Inclusion in response to the Maclean’s article] we were asked to meet with him in his chambers. When we arrived he had the toy set up to play with. Other politicians were there to see the game. That told me that he bel",,,,,
eves [The Empathy Toy] isn’t just a one-and-done type of thing. He’s supporting the spread of knowledge and sees the impact and potential [The Empathy Toy] can have. When he spoke he mentioned multiple times the great things we’re doing at the school in regards to the empathy project. He even posted it on his social media.Exhibit 6: continued21st Century Learning Powered by STEAMRoyal Ontario Museum Toronto ONJamea Zuberi—Classroom Teacher & Club Team Leader “How a Museum Created an Empathy Zone to Inspire Future Innovators”:What we’ve created is an Empathy Zone where we use the toy as a tool to inform thinking and actions of young people in the program. We start every session with 15–20 minutes of Empathy Toy game play. When we have a problem we can’t solve or we’re having difficulty figuring out where we’re going to go with the team we use the whole concept of empathy. We always come back to the toy and playing the game as a frame of reference.The last session really brought it home for me. We gave the children options of activities including working with the 3-D printer working with the computer building art pieces putting things together with their hands and the Empathy Toy. I thought that not many of them would be interested in the Empathy Toy. But there was a large group [that gravitated to] it. We seem to think that our children are just interested in computer games and that moment was proof that that’s not true. If we give them alternatives they surprise us.The Empathy Toy has become such an essential and engaging part of the program. I think that the idea that there [are] no losers helps. It’s a competition where everyone must win.My moment with the kids was when some conflict was happening and I heard one of the kids say “Hey! That’s not very empathetic!.” And I thought woah—they’re actually using the vocabulary.Source: Company documents.,1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,WOMAN,,

He is very careful very deliberate. He prefers for a child to develop step by step: first to sit up then stand then learn to walk. But no I don’t like that. I want the child to “go go go!”—even though it may fall down a lot along the way . . . and need to figure out how to stand up again. Nguyen Duc Tai co-founder of Mobile WorldIn the beginning we had our differences but the challenge was so big so we made things work. But as our business grew the contradictions began to grow as well . . . I wanted to go slowly Tai wanted to attack the market because—if we didn’t—someone else would and we would lose the opportunity. Tran Le Quan co-founder of Mobile WorldThe two largest of the five co-founders each brought something different to the table. They did not always agree but they pushed each other to achieve through their competitive tension like John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles.Chris Freund founding partner of Mekong CapitalIn June 2009 the co-owners of Vietnamese mobile phone retailer Mobile World Joint Stock Company (Mobile World) were in heated discussions. Mobile World chief executive officer (CEO) Nguyen Duc Tai was making an impassioned point to Chris Freund the founding partner of the Vietnam-focused private equity (PE) firm Mekong Capital (Mekong). “There was a lot of yelling which was not normal” said Freund. “It was the only board meeting I’ve ever had in Vietnam like that.” Freund had pushed back against an aggressive new human resources incentive initiative proposed by Tai. Freund feared the plan would give away too much of the owners’ future earnings to store managers and middle managers. This resistance was frustrating to Tai who had spent the previous months carefully working through the logic of his vision with Mekong’s board representative Mai Hoang Phuong. However tensions did not just exist between the Vietnamese founders and foreign PE investors. In fact when Mobile World’s chair of the board Tran Le Quan (Quan) stood with Tai on the incentives plan it represented a rare moment of unity between the two. The brothers-in-law who were Mobile World’s primary two co-founders had differing views about how aggressively to expand the business. For example Tai preferred to use Mekong’s May 2007 injection of US$3.5 million—for a minority stake of 35 per cent—to finance a rollout of new stores that took the company from seven stores to 32 in just over a year. The new store openings were abruptly halted at the end of 2008 amid a brutal combination of difficult domestic economic conditions and the natural trials of a fast-changing hyper-competitive industry (see Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2). At the same time Mobile World’s management was struggling to keep pace with Mobile World’s own rapid growth while still experimenting with its core business model. Consequently 2008 was the first year the company ended up “in the red.” To his chagrin Tai had to shut down seven stores and just before the 2009 Lunar New Year ordered his deputies to carry out across-the-board layoffs. In Vietnam this action was akin to a round of firings at Christmas in the West.A silver lining to the dissention between Mobile World’s owners was that it was borne from a shared belief in the company’s enormous potential. Freund was confident in the core team and in the exciting commercial opportunity (see Exhibit 3). However what could he and his team do to add value in the face of these internal and external challenges?the Vietnamese Economy in 2009In the 1980s Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in the world. Its military forces occupied Cambodia to the west and were engaged in hostilities with China its giant neighbour to the north. As a remnant of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnamese civil war which ended in 1975 Vietnam was still under a trade embargo with most advanced countries in the world. In 1988–89 widespread famine led tens of thousands of “boat people” to escape to camps in other Southeast Asian countries. Many who left represented the country’s scarce remaining educated and entrepreneurial elite. At the same time the beginning of the end of the Soviet bloc meant dwindling support from old political friends. The events in Tiananmen Square further compounded stress in Hanoi. In response the country’s leadership initiated its Doi Moi transition from Marxist-Leninist central planning to a market economy. Although still governed by the same authoritarian and nominally communist government Vietnam had become a middle-income country by 2009. A significant marker of economic progress was the country’s January 2007 ascension to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Joining the WTO underscored Vietnam’s potential to follow the path of other export-oriented East Asian Tigers such as Singapore Hong Kong Taiwan and South Korea and thereby improve both domestic and foreign investor sentiment. Even before this move Vietnam’s stable environment and youthful and educated demographics had made it a leading global source for labour-intensive manufactured goods like shoes and garments as well as key agricultural commodities like rice coffee and rubber. The country was emerging as a core production hub for major brands such as Nike Levis and IKEA. A new law implemented in 2000 drastically reduced the costs of setting up a company. The law resulted in a quarter million new domestic firms.These factors contributed to the rapid growth of Vietnam’s stock market. Formed in 2002 the stock market’s valuation grew from less than one per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005 to a peak of 30 per cent of GDP in May 2007. This strong performance facilitated a long-awaited first round sell-off by the government of its shares in state-owned enterprises to private investors. Vietnam’s banking sector was also experiencing unprecedented economic development. It was characterized by rising foreign direct investment the emergence of privately owned domestic banks like Asia Commercial Bank (ACB) and Sacombank and rapid growth of bank lending to the domestic private sector.However as with the financial crisis that had hit Thailand a decade earlier cracks began to emerge. There were concerns about government controls on the currency a ballooning trade deficit massive investments in real estate and a spike in inflation. Inflation especially on food prices put pressure on wages that led to worker strife and strikes even though strikes were still illegal. These social and economic pressures caused major concerns for the government. To ease growth pressures Vietnam’s central bank sent out strict instructions in early 2008 for all banks to significantly curtail their lending especially to the domestic private sector. At the same time even with the global financial crisis not yet at full strength the stock market rapidly lost value. By mid-2008 stock market capitalization had fallen back down to less than 10 per cent of GDP.FOREIGN PRIVATE EQUITY PERSPECTIVEVietnam’s Private Equity Industry in 2009In late July 2008 after months of negotiations Vietnam-based Indochina Capital was stripped of control over its PE fund due to poor performance. With the global economy now in a full crisis of its own the favourable view investors had of Vietnam was clearly fading. They now recognized what had been true all along: Vietnam was a tumultuous emerging market. It had an authoritarian and corrupt government unpredictable property rights a lack of contract enforcement and an abundance of culturally justified non-transparent and short-sighted business practices in its leading local companies many of which were family owned.None of this was news to Freund who was a grizzled veteran of Vietnam’s business environment. For him these market flaws had always been central to the core value proposition of emerging market PE and the Vietnam opportunity. PE firms in emerging markets added value to their investees through their superior abilities to overcome inefficient local markets for resources such as investment capital for growth working capital and niche technical expertise. Based on this rationale PE investment in emerging markets had grown to over $60 billion in 2007 (see Exhibit 4). Still there were many skeptics about emerging market PE. To them the overlapping global and domestic market crashes spelled doom for PE firms like Mekong and its investments in companies like Mobile World. The cynic’s ideal model for emerging market PE was a Vietnamese deal signed in October 2006. PE giants Texas Pacific Group and Intel Capital made a global splash with their $36 million co-investment in Vietnam’s partially state-owned telecommunications company (telecom) Corporation for Financing and Promoting of Technology more commonly known as FPT. After listing FPT on the local stock market in August 2007 they rushed to cash in on a terrific four times return on their investment. Thus they avoided the crash that began at year’s end. Local critics lamented that these strategic investors had simply cashed in on their global reputations with over-exuberant investors while doing nothing to fundamentally improve FPT’s strategy or its operations.Mekong CapitalMekong Capital was headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Its strategy was to grow with the fast- growing Vietnamese economy by investing in companies that were committed to developing strong management teams founded on best practices. These companies needed clear plans to expand quickly. Most Vietnamese industries were characterized by considerable fragmentation offering opportunities for growth by becoming a market leader that consolidated markets. Mekong sought to facilitate the expansion of its investees by building the strength of the management team introducing best practices using outside experts to introduce best practices and improving competitiveness through improvements in operational efficiency.Mekong’s sole founding partner was Freund. He first came to Vietnam in 1994. In February 1994 the United States ended its trade embargo with Vietnam which had run since the end of the war in April 1975. Freund arrived as the first employee of Templeton Asset Management Ltd. (Templeton) in Vietnam working under the famous emerging markets investments guru Mark Mobius. His work with Templeton ultimately covered Vietnam South Korea Taiwan and Israel. In 1999 Freund started co-operating with a World Bank Group program called the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility and the Asian Development Bank. Together they worked on a study of the feasibility of a PE fund aimed at providing growth capital to high-potential firms in Vietnam and neighbouring countries. Freund incorporated Mekong Capital in March 2001. Its first fund was the Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF) which was launched in April 2002 at a value of $18.5 million. MEF made 10 investments in the 2003–2005 period. The investments targeted export-oriented manufacturers founded by first generation entrepreneurs and run as family businesses. Examples included furniture and garments exporters such as AA Corporation and Minh Hoang as well as Saigon Gas Holdings Corp. which provided liquefied petroleum gas to commercial and residential users. A major challenge for Mekong with its investees was that the family managers in investees often made key decisions based on short-term considerations without consulting Freund and his team. Even agreed-on changes were implemented slowly with key management positions being reserved for trusted family members. These aspects of company management stemmed from their reluctance to fully share internal information with non-family shareholders. The problems persisted for long-term planning for growth. Investees resisted pressure to formalize a strategy process aimed at setting ambitious annual and long-term targets. This environment did not bode well for the standard PE goal of making returns though an exit on the stock market or a trade sale. However it was fine for most founders who still had visions of keeping the company within the family. As a result of these challenges and the difficult global conditions it was not until December 2008 that Mekong exited its first investment selling its shares in Saigon Gas to Total Group the French oil and gas giant.Mekong raised two additional funds during this period. The first was the Mekong Enterprise Fund II a $50 million fund launched in 2006. It was through this fund that Mekong invested in Mobile World alongside its investments in nine other Vietnamese firms. The idea behind the fund was a strategic shift toward domestically-oriented consumer-driven businesses. This shift involved consciously turning to the young generation of local entrepreneurs who had grown up under Vietnam’s market reforms. This new generation had a modern and transparent perspective on business management and strategy. In mid-2007 with the stock market at its apex Mekong launched a $64 million fund—the Vietnam Azalea Fund. This fund targeted firms with plans for a public listing within the next two years. The fund comprised 10 deals including a May 2009 investment in Masan Food Corporation a leading domestic producer of sauces seasonings and instant noodles.With these three funds Mekong became a larger and more complex organization. Problems soon arose with an organizational structure that relied on Freund as the sole partner to micro-manage everything in a top-down manner. After taking leadership courses in 2007 Freund enacted a major organizational restructuring in 2008. He brought in additional management-level talent and used training to cultivate leadership capabilities in key employees. In Freund’s own words: “It’s like executive coaching. You don’t tell people what to do you want them to set their own goals. You want them to generate what actions they’re going to take. But you want to choose coachable clients.”The goal was to better manage Mekong’s rapid growth by ensuring that its representatives were competent and empowered to work directly with portfolio companies to make and take personal responsibility for key strategic decisions. This process was far from easy with multiple managers deciding to leave Mekong amid the changes. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITYMobile Phones in VietnamMobile phones were as popular in Vietnam as in other major Southeast Asian economies Year-on-year growth was strong (see Exhibit 2). Much of this growth was in rural areas where traditional telephone infrastructure was poor. A surprising number of Vietnamese owned multiple mobile phones. That said the 33 per cent growth in 2008 represented a fourth consecutive year of slowing growth in mobile phone sales. Furthermore per unit prices were sliding having fallen 32 per cent since 2004. The market leader was Nokia which had approximately two thirds of the market at that time. Nokia used its market power to distribute benefits across the value chain. After paying intermediaries only 7–8 per cent of the price of a phone went to retailers like Mobile World. However Nokia was coming under pressure from new competitors and innovation. There was a relentless flow of new models even as customers were slowing the speed with which they replaced their old phones. These new models did not yet include smartphones as the Vietnamese government had announced in early 2008 that it would be granting a license for the country’s first 3G service sometime in 2009. Furthermore smartphones were expensive. Due to limited supply the typical retail price in Vietnam for Apple’s first iPhone approximated the country’s average annual per capita income. Demand for mobile phones was primarily met by a retail network of small local stores commonly referred to as mom-and-pop shops run out of the sidewalk-facing fronts of people’s homes. HCMC had 10000 such shops in 2004 or one shop for every thousand residents. Mom-and-pop shops accounted for essentially all the demand in Vietnam’s expansive countryside. This system emphasized convenience but competition was intense. The shops ran on low margins and service was secondary to price leadership. The typical shop was a small family business led by a stay-at-home parent. Fake products especially for batteries proliferated in this market. Mobile World was one of four mobile phone retail chains in the country. One of the others was the more experienced and family-owned Vien Thong A Import Export Trading Production Corporation which had approximately 50 stores in 2009. The remaining two competitors were both affiliated with the state. One was the deep-pocketed partially state-owned and highly diversified FPT. The other was Viettel owned by the Ministry of Defence. Their political connections gave them a major advantage in Vietnam’s murky real estate market which enabled them to take the lead in the number of mobile phone stores. Viettel had its own chain of shops but was notorious for under-management of these shops. The chain had proprietary rights for Apple in Vietnam but rarely if ever had any Apple products on display. The stores often had their lights out presumably to save electricity costs. Customers would be greeted by brand-specific promotional girls rather than sales staff from the store who could give objective advice. Decision making was slow in these types of government-owned companies. Management set low growth targets with a stronger focus on job security and personal gain than on corporate gain. Mobile WorldMobile World was founded in March 2004 as Mobi World. The core business concept was developed in a series of discussions between Quan and Tai in a central upscale coffee shop beside HCMC’s famous opera house. According to Quan the original idea was to build an e-commerce business financed by the sale of mobile phones. The two brothers-in-law had both worked with foreign multinationals in HCMC. Characterizing the partnership Tai said Quan was the one who kept the customers happy. Thinking about how to stop their anger. You know you buy a phone for $1000 and something goes wrong. . . . to take that kind of customer and turn them from angry to a happy customer this is a difficult thing. He’s the one who did this. . . . I was the finance sales and marketing guy paying attention to buying and selling.Dinh Anh Huan (Huan) was brought in to help with technology issues. “He was very high energy willing to do whatever you want him to do” said Tai describing Huan in the early days. “I considered him a bit of a deputy for me.” Like Tai Huan proved to be most interested in the business side so the team next added Dieu Chinh Hai Trieu another young acquaintance who had recently graduated from college with an information technology degree. The final founder was Tai’s old classmate Tran Huy Tung (Tung) who was brought in toward the end of 2004 to straighten out the firm’s finances. Tai had wanted to bring Tung in earlier but the latter was hesitant to give up the nearly $700 per month he received in his director position with Japanese multinational Mabuchi for the approximately $150 per month Tai was offering him for an executive position with his start-up. The firm’s operations began in June 2004. The initial start involved three modestly sized (20 square metre) stores. They were situated on small side streets in equal distance from one another in a triangle meant to strategically optimize proximity for relatively well-to-do downtown HCMC consumers. The firm also had an advertising website (www.thegioimobi.com). As Tai described it “online was the cheapest way for us to reach our customer. . . . We didn’t have the money to put advertisements in the newspaper.” The website reported up-to-date prices so that consumers knew the price they would encounter when they went to any of the three stores. The website also provided substantial information about products to help consumers make more informed decisions about their purchases. These features were popular leading to significant online traffic even in these relatively early days of Vietnam’s Internet.However website traffic did not convert to brick-and-mortar sales. Tai remembers seeing people pull up on motorcycles eye the store and then ride off. The founders soon figured out that customers drawn in by their website came with an expectation of a unique retail experience but were disappointed to encounter stores that looked too similar to the mom-and-pop shops they could find on any street in the city. “On the website you look so professional!” Tai remembers a man telling him outside one of the first stores.In response the founders closed the three stores down forfeiting their initial investment capital of $13000. A month later in October 2004 they pooled their remaining savings of nearly $50000 to open a single modern-looking store on a major shopping street in downtown HCMC. To be able to afford this price they situated the store on the cheaper left side of the street which required motorcycles to squeeze past cars and trucks to park on their sidewalk. The new store was 15 times the size of the original three stores at nearly 300 square metres. To further differentiate from mom-and-pop shops the founders engaged in a variety of ostentatious but inexpensive marketing campaigns including lotteries and free flowers on Women’s Day.In late 2006 the business was renamed Mobile World. By 2007 on the eve of Mekong’s investment the firm had grown to become a seven-store chain operating in HCMC and Hanoi the country’s capital. Some of the stores had diversified into selling laptops MP3 players and other related consumer electronics. After a half year of negotiations and due diligence the founders and Mekong agreed on a generous post-investment valuation of $10 million (pre-investment valuation was $6.5 million) for the company. With the rapid expansion to nearly 40 stories that followed total revenue reached $92 million in 2008 having tripled in 2006 and doubled in 2007 and 2008 (see Exhibits 6 and 7). Tai described how a crucial factor in his original decision to select Mekong from the multiple PE firms looking to invest back in 2007 was Freund’s commitment that it would not seek to usurp his leadership: Other people said “Okay I’m going to put my guy in and they are going to work with you.” But I feel like what do they know about how to open a new store in Vietnam? How can we work together? With Mekong I got that they were willing to help in whatever way we needed; otherwise they would not interfere.This perception of Mekong’s contribution aligned with Freund’s evolving perspective on how PE firms could aid their investee firms to grow. Freund commented:When we first worked with investee companies we gave explicit advice which the founders seldom followed. By 2007 we had learned how to do this better. We adopted the tactic of asking the founders questions that led them to the solution which we could have provided to them directly. For Mekong one example was to have them create a five-year vision. Instead of giving them our own ideas of what is possible for their future and trying to persuade them we encouraged them to spend a lot of thought and effort to develop a five-year vision that they truly owned and were aligned around delivering. This helped to give the founders a sense of there they needed to go with a shared idea of their long-term goals. We weren’t interfering directly in the process; rather we created a structure and coaching that enabled them to do this themselves.Under Tai’s leadership and Mekong’s guidance Mobile World made good progress on the key components Mekong had identified for determining its portfolio companies’ ability to achieve their long-term goals (see Exhibits 5 6 and 7). Its founders accepted Mekong’s assistance in identifying three new managers. These managers helped the firm professionalize its handling of sales marketing and human resources and thereby contributed fundamentally to the company’s development. Two of the managers progressed to the most senior leadership positions in the company and eventually joined the board of directors. The third served as the marketing director. Most important to Freund was the degree to which the Mobile World entrepreneurial team led by Tai showed ambition. Mekong was pushing each of its portfolio companies to think big. Tai had announced “the 10000–500 dream”—a commitment to become a company of VND10000 billion in revenue and VND500 billion in profit within five years (i.e. by 2014).Nevertheless in reality times were tough for Mobile World in 2009. Tai believed this was largely due to the broad economic slowdown. According to Tai “the whole market was affected. In the bad times customers keep their phones for a longer time.” Freund disagreed that this should influence company plans saying “I mean sure asset valuations go up and down like the stock market and real estate but consumer spending never had a bad year since I’ve been here. It’s always grown every year.” Ultimately Freund went along with the founders’ plan to retrench. All parties agreed that Mobile World’s struggles were also due to company-specific factors. “Frankly speaking” admitted Tai “managing 30 plus stores was much more challenging than managing just several especially since some were now far away no longer in the same city. So these were new problems that we had to build solutions for.” Although the firm had invested early in terms of time money and effort in the development of an enterprise resource planning system there was a need to strengthen the company’s backend technology solutions.Furthermore even as it grew the firm’s margins remained extremely tight. These tight margins were the result not only of the earlier-mentioned distribution of margins to intermediaries across the distribution chain but also the constant inflow of new models which led to rapid depreciation of the value consumers put on in-stock models. A natural consequence of tight margins was that Mobile World under Tai’s continued leadership moved toward increased hard selling to consumers of products that were over-represented in the firm’s inventory. These products included higher margin but lower quality Chinese phones. Quan the former customer service manager saw this practice as a dangerous threat to the firm’s reputation: “Whenever there was a new product our salespeople had targets to meet. That led to hard selling customers to buy particular types of products and as competition grew we started to lose customers. . . . This was part of what forced us to suspend our expansion toward the end of 2008.”Losses and layoffs added to ownership tensions but differing opinions had existed nearly from the start. An early conflict occurred around the legality of the firm’s human resource policies. Tai had realized that the norm of allowing sales employees to close shop when they went out to lunch for an hour or when they returned home for dinner with their family meant that the shops were closed at prime shopping times for their target market of young professionals. In response he mandated that all stores would stay open over lunch and stay open until 8:00 p.m. There were no shifts. Tai noted: “I was requiring our workers to work longer than the law allowed. Quan was not happy with these decisions and as CEO at the time he was the one who was legally most exposed. As the sales and marketing guy I made so many decisions so that we would grow the business in the right way.”Finally there was the conflict between the co-founders and Freund over Tai’s plan for incentivizing middle managers including individual store managers. According to Tai:I struggled to understand why do only a few people at the top work very hard to make this company very big in the future? For us the company is the future but for many managers it was just a job. There is a very big difference between a future and a job. So I asked myself how can I change things in this company? If only the other owners and I are really trying to grow the company it’s not as powerful as a few hundred people working together to grow the company. We needed to do something I needed to change myself and the way the company was operating.Freund was also looking farther ahead. He was bullish about Mobile World’s potential despite its rough patch. As a result he worried about introducing a profit-sharing scheme that shareholders might regret as being too generous once profits returned.DecisionAs 2009 passed its midpoint Mobile World and Mekong were both struggling to manage the challenges of rapid internal growth amid difficult external headwinds. Tensions were boiling over around how to manage the firm’s growth. Furthermore nearly two years into the Mobile World deal the clock was ticking on taking further action to maximize the company’s value before Mekong exited and returned money to the fund’s investors. Could Mekong a foreign PE firm find a way to smooth relations between the feuding Mobile World founders and mobilize them behind a common focus on company goals? What advantages would Mobile World need to develop to be able to grow successfully and match its vision to become the country’s largest chain retailer of mobile phones and consumer electronics? What competitive advantages beyond the capital it had already supplied could Mekong help grow in Mobile World to reignite rapid growth? Alternatively was it time for Freund to quietly shift his attention to maximizing returns on the investments that Mekong had made after Vietnam’s market collapse?Exhibit 1: Vietnam’s Economy (1999–2008)Note: GDP = gross domestic productSource: “World Development Indicators” The World Bank accessed September 6 2016 http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators.Exhibit 2: Mobile Phones and Consumer Electronics in Vietnam (2002–2008)Note: VND = Vietnamese dong; VND1.00 = US$0.0001 on January 1 2008.Source: “World Development Indicators” The World Bank accessed September 6 2016 http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators; “Mobile Phones in Vietnam” Passport accessed September 6 2016.Exhibit 3: Biographies of Mobile World’s Core five FoundersNguyen Duc TaiTai was born in 1969. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in finance and accounting from the University of Economics in Ho Chi Minh City and in 1995 his Master of Business Administration degree from the Centre Franco-Vietnamien de Formation à la Gestion—CFVG (the French-Vietnamese Center for Management Education). After a number of entrepreneurial ventures including in Ho Chi Minh City’s booming real estate industry Tai spent the two years before Mobile World as head of the strategy department at S-Fone a joint-venture between Saigon Postel Corp. and South Korea’s SK Telecom Co. Ltd. which became Vietnam’s third mobile network in 2003. He has held key positions in Mobile World in finance and accounting marketing logistics store network development and executive management. He took over as chief executive officer in 2007 shortly after Mekong Capital invested in Mobile World.Tran Le QuanQuan was born in 1960. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in telecommunications engineering. Before Mobile World he spent almost eight years with Sony Ericsson rising to head of customer service for Ho Chi Minh City. This background in the mobile phone retailing business and working to maintain the satisfaction of mobile phone customers was crucial for the design of the Mobile World store concept and layout.

Ramani the founder and director of Savourites Hospitality Private Limited (Savourites) and his associate Aninda Palit were in London on an autumn day in 2016 to discuss future plans for 6 Ballygunge Place (6BP) the company’s flagship Bengali restaurant in Kolkata. The pair had been in London six years earlier when they attended Ananda Utsav a fair for members of the Indian diaspora in London. Ramani and Palit had been enthusiastic about the assignment which gave them an opportunity to showcase 6BP on a global platform and their earnestness had paid off: 6BP became one of the market leaders of Bengali cuisine restaurants in Kolkata. Now if 6BP was to move to the next level Ramani and Palit faced some serious questions. To exploit the exposure they had gained they wanted to go global starting with London; but before that they needed to figure out whether Bengali cuisine was amenable to foreign palates. Alternately they could expand by giving up 6BP’s location-specific advantage as a regional cuisine restaurant and repackaging it to suit local tastes. THE 6BP STORY6BP was the first of its kind: a fine-dining restaurant (FDR) serving authentic Bengali cuisine. Other players had made sporadic forays into this space but most of them had remained stand-alone outlets. The other major player was Aaheli an in-house restaurant in the Peerless Inn a four-star hotel in Kolkata run by the diversified Peerless Group. Aaheli had been operating since 1993 but it had not grabbed the attention of tourists and locals to the desired extent. Oh! Calcutta was another Kolkata restaurant which had actually started operations before Aaheli in 1992. However its focus was more on Kolkata food rather than Bengali food. Over the years it had seen better brand growth than Aaheli owing in large part to the financial and marketing might of Anjan Chatterjee the restaurateur and owner of Speciality Restaurants Limited which also owned successful brands like Mainland China Only Fish and Flame & Grill. Savourites founded by Palit Ramani and Sushanta Sengupta had started as a catering service provider to offices in Kolkata. After a fruitless venture called Raga a new-age offering for South Indian vegetarian food the Savourites team began planning 6BP. The Raga experiment had been a non-starter because according to Kanchan Datta chief executive officer (CEO) of Savourites’ advertising agency Inner Circle Advertising India Private Limited (Inner Circle) the restaurant had a bad location and was not serving food that customers wanted:It was a fusion restaurant with mini dosas fried idlis and stuff. It was on the second floor and we all know restaurants don’t survive even on the first floor unless you are a Michelin star restaurant. On top of that it was located at the rear of the building without a parking area in an unfriendly lobby. Somehow I had a bad feeling for the restaurant . . . they then tried to change it into Chinese which obviously did not work.After two years of trying with Raga Savourites decided to close it down and start a new venture. The 6BP TeamAccording to Dibyajyoti Chaudhuri the head of Corporate Communications for 6BP “the three pillars on which 6BP had been built were Palit Ramani and of course Chef Sengupta.” Chef Sengupta a master chef was an expert in Southeast Asian cuisine. He had curated cookery shows abroad and had been the head of an Oriental restaurant at The Park in Kolkata called Zen when Savourites was being conceived. Chaudhuri described him as “the most passionate person about food and cooking that I have ever seen.” Sengupta was the driving force behind the cuisine of 6BP and Palit was the person who brought in the management skills to run an FDR. Palit had made a career in the food and beverage industry and had managed restaurants including managing their infrastructure ambience and personnel. Trained in advanced food and beverage management in the Netherlands Palit ensured that the 6BP machine ran smoothly. The catalyst for smooth operations was Ramani the only one among the three who had also worked outside the food service and restaurant industry. A hotel management graduate Ramani had almost nine years of experience in sales and marketing in the automotive sector. As a result said Chaudhuri he brought “street-smartness and convincing skills to the arsenal which come in handy for dealing [with] external people and as the public face of 6BP.” Ramani was a visionary in bringing out new offerings and he was well respected in the industry for his insights. Birth of 6BPThe new venture Savourites was contemplating happened to be a Bengali restaurant. By the time 6BP was born Savourites found success in catering Bengali food across Kolkata. Sengupta reminisced about this success:[It] was not that 6BP happened to us in day one. Our business started in ’98 and there was a four-year lapse and then we started off again. The entire idea of 6BP was [Palit’s]. I did not have that much confidence. Aninda was absolutely sure that a Bengali restaurant would do well and we believed him because he had an understanding of the market.Although conventional wisdom in the food service industry in Kolkata suggested that one could not sell Bengali food to Bengalis Ramani and his associates decided to go for it. One strong driver behind the outlet was not food: “That we had an old ancestral house right in the heart of South Kolkata which amalgamated the idiosyncrasies of Indo-British architecture was a revelation” admitted Palit. The southern part of Kolkata was relatively modern and upmarket hence stumbling upon a house with authentic old-world charm was “an act of providence” according to Ramani. He insisted that the myths about the Bengalis of Kolkata being fussy eaters who were not comfortable having Bengali food outside their homes needed to be exploded. So the team went ahead with 6BP. Ramani and Sengupta wanted the place to be steeped in Bangaliana (“Bengaliness” or everything Bengali culture and tradition stood for)—in terms of not only the food but also its décor marketing collaterals and overall character. The restaurant was named after its address in part because a Bengali name might be difficult to pronounce. The name would roll nicely off non-Bengali tongues more so since Ramani intended to target the so far alienated yet highly affluent segment of the population. That the ploy worked was evident in one consumer’s remark: Mr. Bose an entrepreneur who frequented 6BP said “My business guests visiting Kolkata often requested to be taken to 6BP because they had heard from their relatives or associates that 6BP stood for Bengali cuisine in a fine-dining atmosphere.”FINE DINING IN INDIAIndia was as diverse in its cuisine as it was in its geography and demography. The varied climate topography flora and fauna culture society and religion were factors that had influenced the country’s diverse gastronomy. Food was an integral part of Indian life but to gain an understanding of fine dining in India one needed to go back a few hundred years. Until the early 1900s Indians were not used to eating out because restaurants were few and far between. When the clubs of the British Raj started allowing Indians inside they provided Indians with their first taste of dining out of home. The growth of restaurants all over India was fuelled by another decision of the British rulers: the Partition of India in 1947. The uprooted and pauperized Punjabis from west of the border streamed into North India including Delhi during this time. In order to sustain themselves many ventured into the food business. Two other migration streams also added to this trend. Chinese migrants fanned out from Kolkata (then Calcutta) to all over the country and South Indians moved into Mumbai (then Bombay). These two communities started setting up traditional eating places the former to earn a living and the latter to alleviate their longing for home food. Consequently when it came to dining out Indians were conventional and generally veered towards their own cuisine. People—especially those who had relocated to other cities due to professional reasons—chose the food of their own provinces or the fare they had been brought up with; they craved the fare that they were missing. While this trend continued in most parts of the country Punjabi and South Indian snacks and Chinese food remained universal favourites all over the country. With the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 followed by the spurt in the Indian information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) industry more Indians started travelling abroad. Along with this came social media food blogging food channels on YouTube and the popularity of television series such as MasterChef. The influx of foreign tourists also increased. These factors led to changes in the Indian food service industry: (1) consumers were introduced to cuisines from different parts of the world; (2) leading multinational quick-service restaurant brands like McDonalds KFC Pizza Hut and Starbucks set up operations in India and expanded quickly; and (3) Indian entrepreneurs gradually joined the fray with newer concepts in food cuisine and dining. These trends combined to make Indians go out be more adventurous and try out new types of food more frequently. In general FDRs were “typically higher end and fancier restaurants. . . . [F]ine dining caters to an upscale clientele and provides the highest quality of food. A fine-dining restaurant has a formal atmosphere is almost always a sit-down restaurant and has a fancier menu than most restaurants.” From the consumer’s perspective there was a distinction between “eating” and “dining” that led consumers to have different desires and expectations from an FDR. The sensory pleasure that a consumer attained from dining in an FDR could not be gleaned from a routine eating encounter. This pleasure could be attributed to a host of restaurant-related factors such as food ambience quality of service and price but there were other more critical factors associated with consumer psychology. These included the goals of the consumer—having good food or having a good time—which in turn affected the core desire of the person—to have an experience that bordered on entertainment. The food and beverages served in an FDR were seen as incidental to the overall experience. The value of the food service market in India was estimated at ₹3090 billion (US$46.8 billion) for the year 2016. The FDR segment including organized and unorganized players represented just about 10 per cent of this. The value of this relatively newly organized sector was estimated at ₹722 billion (US$10.9 billion). This segment was growing at around 14 per cent per year. Casual dining restaurants and quick-service restaurants formed the major chunk of the Indian food industry with an almost 79-per-cent share of the market. Cafés had garnered another 10 per cent of the market (see Exhibits 1 2 and 3). The FDR sector thus had a long way to go before it could make a significant mark in the Indian market. At the same time it was acknowledged that the FDR segment had come a long way from the early 1990s when it was largely dominated by unorganized players. Atul Singh president and CEO of Coca-Cola (India and South West Asia) and president of the National Restaurant Association of India explained:The good news is that the fine dining industry in India is set to grow for many years to come given the rising disposable incomes a greater population of younger people the growth of consumers in smaller towns and the widening exposure to new cultures and cuisines besides an increased propensity [for] eating outside the home.Fine Dining in KolkataThe dining-out boom had also engulfed Kolkata which to a lot of people was the food destination of the country. Although Mumbai and Delhi-NCR were the major markets for food services in terms of business volume the other metropolitan areas were catching up fast with a diversity in offerings as wide as that of Mumbai and Delhi. These two mega-metros contributed a total of 22 per cent (11 per cent each) to the food services market. The biggest eight cities in India had been the centres of development especially for organized food services catering to 42 per cent of the nation-wide market and the next categories (mini-metros and the rest of India) had a lot of catching up to do. The residents of Kolkata had witnessed the establishment of restaurants offering varied fare long before food businesses took shape in other major cities. The people of Kolkata had patronized Chinese restaurants for a long time and the demonstrated success of these restaurants led entrepreneurs to launch new food ideas in Kolkata. As the millennial generation joined the paying population outlets offering experimental and exotic cuisine started cropping up all over the city. The Savourites top brass estimated that street food and unorganized eateries which occupied 49 per cent of the market were more popular among the Kolkata population with quick-service restaurants next. FDRs being niche outlets took up 11 per cent of the market.The people of Kolkata were open to all types of cuisine: from the basic street-corner Chinese to the high-street Continental; from the snacks of South India (dosa meduvada and idli) to the esoteric biriyani of Oudh (today’s Lucknow). Even so the affinity for local cuisine was striking and Chinese food was the next most-favoured choice followed by food of other Indian provinces and snacks. Almost all of the new restaurants appearing in the city emphasized ambience and décor along with their food with some projecting specific themes. Consumers in Kolkata were made to look beyond just food and a fine-dining revolution took place in the city as consumers sought enriching eating-out experiences.As themed restaurants kept appearing restaurateurs and entrepreneurs also started to think about Bengali-themed restaurants. The prevailing sentiment in Kolkata was that Bengalis were too choosy and condescending towards restaurants serving Bengali food. Being very fastidious about their own cuisine as well as reluctant to pay high prices for food that they had at home Bengali consumers were accepted as a challenging segment. Bengali dishes also varied in taste and style; each household had its own version of a dish. However a few brave souls decided to set up shop peddling Bengali cuisine to the people of Kolkata. The evolution of fine-dining Bengali restaurants was the backdrop against which 6BP decided to make its appearance. Since then more people had joined the Bengali cuisine bandwagon (e.g. Bohemian and Saptapadi) and they had managed to pull off the unthinkable: they persuaded Bengalis to “pay good money for food that they could just as easily make at home.”BUILDING THE 6BP BRANDWhat set Savourites and 6BP apart from most other start-ups and FDRs was that both Ramani and Datta had taken brand building seriously from the very outset. Ramani was very clear about spreading the brand through the offering of the combined package of product and services itself and through all possible communication channels. He said “We introduced certain distinguishing features that people loved to remember. Like our kosha mangsho. As Soumitra Bhattacharya of Saatchi and Saatchi had told me—create a benchmark of your product. Or even the use of different metals (utensils) for different dishes.” Similarly Datta as the agent handling the brand from its infancy was trying to carve a niche for 6BP through his endeavours. Datta and his team at Inner Circle went full steam with the Bangaliana plank. As Datta reminisced “The logo was very simple. We chose vermilion as the colour for the logo which epitomizes Bangaliana by representing sindoor and alta.” In respect of the shape it was inspired by the Bengali woman’s sindoor bindi—an oval one to merge with the 6 in the name (see Exhibit 4). For the menu Datta added short poems which took a fun view of the food to different pages (see Exhibit 5).The Core OfferingThe initial attention towards the core product (the food) was never negotiable in the minds of the 6BP top brass. Chef Sengupta insisted from day one that all ingredients had to be fresh just like in any Bengali household. Bengalis preferred to shop daily and were generally averse to having the previous day’s fare. 6BP began with that philosophy and had stuck to that practice. The team took care of all aspects of the overall offering including maintaining the feel of British-era Kolkata in the décor the way the guests were greeted by the doormen the attentions of the waiting staff while taking orders and suggesting dishes the presentation of the dishes and the outfits of the hosts and the servers. As 6BP was being commended for its food by conventional Bengali consumers the non-Bengali clientele also gradually warmed up to the restaurant much to the satisfaction of Ramani. The staff who were in direct contact with the diners were well trained not only with regard to overall demeanor and communication but also regarding the combinations of dishes they could suggest to the patrons especially those who were not very familiar with Bengali cuisine. The deference of the staff towards the patrons emanated out of the fundamental Indian philosophy of hospitality wherein each guest is believed to be God and served accordingly. In the initial months like all strong brands 6BP ensured the strength of its product offering through meticulous attention to the quality of the food. The brand took off smoothly. A sizeable proportion of the restaurant’s customers were non-resident Indians and Bengalis staying outside West Bengal. “The place evoked a sense of nostalgia among customers as they got a slice of old Bengali recipes which are no longer prepared in Bengali households” commented Sengupta. Among its loyal customers 6BP counted Bollywood singers and actors namely Asha Bhosle and Rishi Kapoor and others from among the who’s who of Kolkata.In the next stage Inner Circle played a crucial role in providing substance to the core of the 6BP brand. Datta talked about the “sensory brand which brought in a sense of drama in the whole package. The people of Kolkata had not seen anything as aristocratic before in the realm of FDRs. The respect for the brand started to transform into love as the physical newness of the venue was not awe-inspiring but welcoming.” Datta brought celebrities from the Kolkata film television art and business circuits to 6BP for informal adda (“chat sessions”). These sessions being good photo opportunities gave 6BP a great deal of free publicity and added to the aura of the brand. Gradually other events were held at the restaurant including book launches; poetry sessions; and music CD launches including one for Bollywood singer Babul Supriyo’s CD of Tagore songs. The 6BP logo was ubiquitous during these events and kept the brand invigorated. An in-house team headed by Chaudhuri maintained the brand conversation through consistent experiential programs at all the outlets.Role of the AgencyAccording to Datta the agency had played a bigger role in building the brand than Ramani and his team. The comment could be construed as boastful but that was not what Datta intended as 6BP had been nurtured from day one by Inner Circle and Inner Circle was an integral part of 6BP. Datta stressed unequivocally “They did not even give us the brief . . . they did not have money to pay us nor to advertise . . . we had and still do have all the liberty to do what we want.” As a result the young creative boutique became a full-service agency for the young restaurant taking care of public relations advertising out of home (OOH) and events. Inner Circle created cultural touchpoints recognizing culture as a crucial force that drove most initiatives in Kolkata. The idea of getting celebrities for adda sessions had come out of this strategy. Datta said “We regularly got our friends who were cultural leaders also great foodies. It made us happy to be a part of the 6BP dream and its subsequent journey.” Inner Circle organized and hosted several events for 6BP. Some of these had participation from the city’s opinion leaders and the press—personal contacts of Datta and his team. Most of the celebrities did not charge appearance fees as they were getting into a gastronomic event where food remained the prime focus. Datta talked about a brand on three levels: physical sensory and emotional. He believed that the association of the brand with someone respectable and trustworthy had a positive effect on the brand even without explicit endorsements from those people. People who were recognized as celebrities or stalwarts in the fields of language culture and heritage lent their personal brand equity to the fledgling brand. Their sheer presence created emotional connections beyond the physical and the sensory with the 6BP brand and lent it permanence. EMERGENCE OF THE 6BP DESTINATION BRANDAs 6BP continued its brand-building efforts among Kolkata’s fine-dining cognoscenti it gradually became one of the most sought-after places to go in the city. The food was of course the main draw but the experience created by 6BP was also attracting people steadily. Savourites had achieved ₹500 million (US$7.7 million) in revenue in 2016 (see Exhibit 6) and it was evident that the destination brand 6BP had strongly established itself as it outperformed the average growth rate of around 13 per cent in the Kolkata food services industry. Most destination brands suffered because of an absence of a clear point of differentiation so it became interesting if an FDR transformed itself into a destination. Coming up with an original brand story in a crowded restaurant market was difficult at that time so the branding strategies pursued had to be imaginative single minded and consistent. Chaudhuri said “We are trying our best to create an interesting story for our very choosy patrons so that we can move beyond the realm of just Bengali food.” Ramani concurred saying “Creating a consistent story is about feeling the excitement of the Bengali foodie. It did not need a lot of money. We spent no more than 2 per cent of our turnover on creating and growing the brand.” In a bid to give a concrete shape to a destination brand 6BP managed to trademark the South Kolkata address which was a first in India. Intellectual property rights attorney Biswajit Sarkar who successfully secured the registration cited the restaurant as a case study in his class lectures. As the patrons of an FDR became urbane so did their expectations and for a brand like 6BP which was trying to challenge the conventions of the eating-out industry in Kolkata delivering on all such expectations was crucial as the quality of service food and ambience all combined to form a destination brand. A restaurant was elevated to destination status when it reached a point where it was consumed simultaneously at both symbolic and experiential levels. The 6BP address itself had an aura of being contemporary but with a legacy as it was that particular part of the city that was inhabited by modern elite and liberal Bengalis. The building a quaint one bore the heritage of Indo-British architecture. It was a house with a past of its own: it had vaulted ceilings doors opening into archways and windows with wooden panes and wooden slatted shutters typical of a 19th-century Bengali house. Given the way 6BP positioned itself in a staid Bengali market it showed the characteristics of a challenger brand. As Datta pointed out “Challenger brands are built around an idea rather than consumers.” However 6BP was not detached from the consumers and it constantly threw out fresh ideas to refresh its consumer relationships. It had started branding itself through the gastronomic aspects of numerous Indian Bengali and foreign festivals (see Exhibit 4). It also took marketing to a new level when domestic airline IndiGo started mentioning 6BP to its passengers arriving at Kolkata just before the aircraft doors opened. This way 6BP would anchor itself into the “potential consumer’s mental shopping list.” Then Ananda Utsav took place. According to Ramani this was when 6BP matured into a destination brand.EXTENDING THE BRANDWith the 6BP brand established in the minds of Kolkata food lovers Ramani and his team started thinking about growth. They contemplated growth along two avenues: new markets and new products. New MarketsA business could think of untapped segments as new markets to capture. It could also move to completely new geographical locations. For 6BP both options seemed feasible. For newer segments Savourites came up with the idea of the thali (“plate”) a word that in most Indian languages connoted a full meal consisting of various dishes and served on a plate. Ramani thought the team could offer authentic Bengali meals with a fixed menu in the form of a thali at a price that would be lower than the regular 6BP fare. This would extend the 6BP brand and bring in customers from segments lying outside the core segment. The company launched two outlets in Kolkata in 2013 under the brand extension 6BP Thali (Thali). One of these outlets was in the city’s IT hub; here working professionals could grab a relatively quick Bengali lunch without foregoing authenticity quality or taste. In the meantime another 6BP restaurant in the original FDR format had already opened in Salt Lake in 2008 to cater to consumers in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Overall 6BP was moving into new markets it had not previously served. The launch of the Bengal Lounge at the prestigious Bengal Chamber of Commerce (BCC) building in the heart of Kolkata’s business district indicated that 6BP had arrived. BCC was one of the oldest chambers of commerce in Kolkata and it still carried a colonial legacy with membership restricted to the who’s who of Kolkata. The BCC management wanted the building to be more lively and contemporary so they allotted one of their lounges to 6BP. This meant that 6BP was competing directly with the other banquet and lounge rooms in the building. As the lounge housed a bar and faced the prospect of becoming merely a watering hole for office goers 6BP took up the challenge with customary seriousness and created a campaign based on the traditional Bengali penchant for tiffin the elaborate lunch in a carry box eaten by the Bengali babus (clerks who worked under the British Raj). The campaign created nostalgia and a series of celebrity lunches at the venue made Bengal Lounge the talk of the town.While 6BP grew the holding company Savourites was also growing its catering division. Taking advantage of the 6BP brand the catering business had over 100 bookings a month and did not require much marketing. Having 6BP provide the catering services at a wedding signified that the wedding was “quite elite” as one customer pointed out and therefore often ensured repeat business from a discerning set of customers.In the meantime 6BP had added floor space by taking over the entire building adding the first floor to the original ground floor as well as a banquet area on the rooftop. The rooftop banquet area was used for both small parties of 50–60 guests and wedding ceremonies. The ethnic décor and the quintessential Bengali ambience made it an ideal venue for Bengali functions.New ProductsKeeping in mind the perennial favourite cuisine of local gastronomes Ramani decided to further emphasize Chinese cooking under the leadership of Chef Sengupta. However instead of adding yet another Chinese restaurant to the crowd the company launched a pan-Asian restaurant where diners could get authentic tastefully presented Japanese Thai and other meals. The Wall was in an upmarket section of the city making its presence felt in elite Bengali circles and among food connoisseurs. This attempt to diversify was made in 2007 and a decade later The Wall was maintaining its niche in a city crazy about Chinese food in any variant. Just like 6BP The Wall attracted consumers during all the major festivals. The essential elements of the 6BP brand had been successfully transferred to The Wall (see Exhibit 7).With these actions for establishing paths of potential growth Ramani and his team had moved into uncharted territory and had so far been successful. These actions had extended the 6BP brand into unserved and underserved segments thus strengthening the brand’s equity. On the other hand there was always the possibility that an outlet like The Wall might detract from the company’s core focus on providing the finest Bengali food which in turn would affect customers’ delight. The concept of thali had the potential to dilute the brand’s personality. On the geographical front taking 6BP to other parts of Kolkata had worked well. Patrons were flocking to the new fine-dining outlet in the newly developed part of the city Rajarhat New Town. Another in Guwahati in the state of Assam was also doing very well. However in Kolkata statistics suggested that the bulk of the consumers were not Bengalis. This segment was affluent and needed to be involved in the 6BP growth story. On the other hand wooing Bengalis would require 6BP to be more authentic in Bangalore or in Boston as going beyond Kolkata meant that the destination brand needed to offer more than the destination alone. As Ramani and Palit paced up and down the streets of London they wondered how to create a global 6BP brand.EXHIBIT 1: INDIAN FOOD SERVICE MARKET SIZE(in ₹ Billions)Source: Adapted from Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Technopak Advisors Indian Food Services Industry: Engine for Economic Growth & Employment—A Roadmap for Unlocking Growth Opportunities 10 2017 accessed December 21 2018 http://ficci.in/spdocument/20969/foodzania-2017-report.pdf.EXHIBIT 2: ORGANIZED STAND-ALONE RESTAURANT MARKET SIZE(in ₹ Billions)Source: Adapted from Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Technopak Advisors Indian Food Services Industry: Engine for Economic Growth & Employment—A Roadmap for Unlocking Growth Opportunities 11 2017 accessed December 21 2018 http://ficci.in/spdocument/20969/foodzania-2017-report.pdf.EXHIBIT 3: ORGANIzED STAND-ALONE MARKET SHARESource: Adapted from Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Technopak Advisors Indian Food Services Industry: Engine for Economic Growth & Employment—A Roadmap for Unlocking Growth Opportunities 11 2017 accessed December 21 2018 http://ficci.in/spdocument/20969/foodzania-2017-report.pdf.EXHIBIT 4: 6BP BRAND COMMUNICATIONNote: A 6 Ballygunge Place poster for Valentine’s Day with a cut piece of fish used as a heart-shaped motif Source: Company documents.EXHIBIT 5: 6BP MENUNote: A page from the 6BP menu: the top half of the page is a poem in the Bangla language describing in a humorous way the dish mentioned below.Source: Savourites.EXHIBIT 6: savourites REVENUE 2016Source: Company data and author estimates.EXHIBIT 7: SISTER BRAND THE WALL—COLLATERALSNote: An advertisement for The Wall created specifically for the Durga Puja days: the creative supposedly shows one of the 10 hands of the goddess Durga.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca.Copyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-10-29On July 26 2018 Ulf Mark Schneider was the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Switzerland-based Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé). For the first time in his 18-month tenure as the head of the global consumer-packaged goods company Nestlé’s results indicated the positive effects of the many strategic changes he had spearheaded. Organic growth had shown a period-to-period increase of 2.6 per cent (versus 2.4 per cent for 2017) and operating margin had risen to 16.1 per cent (versus 15.9 per cent in 2017). The company was midway through its US$20 billion share buyback and in March 2018 had signed a $7 billion contract to sell Starbucks-branded coffee and tea in retail stores globally. Schneider had divested the company’s US confectionary business and made several key acquisitions in its branded foods business. However Nestlé had not publicly responded to a hedge fund’s insistence that the company sell its nearly $32 billion stake in the French cosmetics company L’Oréal S.A. (L’Oréal). In a June 2017 communication and later in a July 1 2018 public letter to Nestlé’s shareholders Third Point LLC (Third Point) a hedge fund based in New York City made the L’Oréal divestment a core piece of its rationale for strategic change at the company. Arguing that it was a passive investment that confused the identity of Nestlé and affected its stock price Third Point indicated that the right strategic path for Nestlé was to use the proceeds from divesting the L’Oréal stake to buy back stock make key acquisitions in its current food and nutrition businesses and fund operational improvements. Third Point’s call on the L’Oréal investment was only one of two related issues that Schneider and Nestlé’s board of directors faced. The other matter involved a six-month moratorium on any actions by Nestlé regarding its stake in L’Oréal which had been enacted after the death of Lillian Bettencourt in September 2017. Before her death Bettencourt had been one of the principal shareholders in L’Oréal. However the moratorium ended on March 21 2018. Therefore L’Oréal had publicly requested clarity from Nestlé on its intentions regarding the French cosmetic company. So Schneider and his team needed to address Third Point’s call and respond to L’Oréal’s request. ABOUT NESTLÉIn 1867 Henri Nestlé founded a company in Vevey Switzerland to develop and sell his infant formula. He ran it independently until merging it in 1905 with the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company to form the modern-day food and nutrition multinational. Over the years Nestlé grew both organically and via acquisitions. At the end of fiscal 2017 Nestlé had $90.28 billion in revenues sold its products in 189 countries produced its goods in 413 factories that were located in 85 countries employed 323000 people and owned over 2000 brands. CEO Schneider reported to a board of directors that was led by chairman Paul Bulcke who took office in fiscal 2018. In a presentation to investors Schneider underscored Nestlé’s presence as a key global competitor in the nutrition health and wellness (NHW) market. In this market Nestlé’s strengths included a strong portfolio with a presence in the market’s growth segments brands names that global consumers trusted and a track record of successfully adapting to marketplace changes. Schneider indicated that food and beverage would be Nestlé’s core focus for the future with a 27 per cent global market share in coffee a 27 per cent global market share in infant nutrition and a 10 per cent global market share in bottled water (Nestlé Pure Life was the number one bottled-water brand worldwide). The consumer health-care segment was also Nestlé’s growth platform (see Exhibit 1). Given its broad portfolio of products Nestlé competed globally with a variety of major companies. The Hoover’s Company Records market research service identified 43 Nestlé competitors ranging from Abbott Laboratories and Procter & Gamble Company in the health category to Danone S.A.; The Coca-Cola Company; Mondelēz International Inc.; General Mills Inc.; and Kraft Heinz Company in the packaged foods market. Nestlé encountered competition in multiple markets from major multinationals competitors to local companies in each product category where Nestlé was active. Nestlé’s largest market was North and South America accounting for over 30 per cent of 2017 revenues. Coffee accounted for CHF17 billion in 2017 revenues with Nescafé and Nespresso as its two leading brands. In its financial statements Nestlé classified its stake in L’Oréal as an investment in “Associates and Joint Ventures.” Because of its 23.2 per cent stake the L’Oréal investment was accounted for using the equity method. With this method Nestlé initially recorded its investment at cost. Each year it adjusted for its share of L’Oréal’s total profits and then deducted the dividends received. At the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2017 the L’Oréal stake was valued at $7.493 billion; at the end of FY 2017 the value was $8.228 billion (see Exhibit 2). In a statement to analysts Schneider pointed out that Nestlé’s stake in L’Oréal had a 42-year annual return on investment of 12 per cent. For the period 2007–2017 the annual return on investment was 14 per cent. In addition Schneider indicated that L’Oréal dividends had accounted for 9 per cent of Nestlé’s earnings per share between 2007 and 2017. BRIEF HISTORY OF NESTLÉ’S INVESTMENT IN L’ORÉALOn April 2 1974 France’s president Georges Pompidou died in office. French voters were thus called upon to elect his successor. A coalition of left-wing and left-leaning parties led by François Mitterand appeared to be in position to come into power over the right-leaning group led by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Over a decade earlier in 1963 L’Oréal had gone public and Bettencourt the founder’s daughter had retained a majority share of the company. Bettencourt had inherited the company upon her father’s death in 1957. Both Bettencourt’s father and her husband had been strong supporters of the French far right. Therefore in 1974 Bettencourt feared that if left-leaning Mitterand came into power her company (along with others) would be nationalized. As a pre-emptive move Bettencourt decided to sell 30 per cent of L’Oréal to the Swiss multinational corporation Nestlé in return for a small stake in that company. Bettencourt’s rationale was that Mitterand’s government would be less likely to nationalize L’Oréal if it was partly owned by a Swiss company. However in the 1974 elections prompted by Pompidou’s death French voters elected right-leaning d’Estaing—not Mitterand. Nevertheless Nestlé continued to own its stake in L’Oréal. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe who was Nestlé’s CEO until 2008 and chairman of the board until 2017 suggested that Nestlé was in fact seeking to increase its stake in L’Oréal.In 2014 buoyed by support from the French government which regarded leading French companies such as L’Oréal as national treasures the L’Oréal board of directors sought and obtained an agreement with Nestlé that forbade it from attempting to increase its stake in L’Oréal until at least six months after the death of Bettencourt. In addition as part of the agreement L’Oréal bought back a part of Nestlé stake which dropped Nestlé’s ownership in L’Oréal to 23.29 per cent. On September 21 2017 Bettencourt died which prompted the start of Nestlé six-month moratorium on L’Oréal shares. THIRD POINTFounded by Daniel S. Loeb in 1995 Third Point was an “event-driven value-oriented” hedge fund from New York City that had approximately $17 billion in assets under management at the end of 2016.  In the past Third Point had mounted activist campaigns against companies such as Yahoo! in 2012 (when Loeb was instrumental in hiring Marissa Mayer as CEO) Sony Corporation in 2013 and Sotheby’s in 2013 (when Third Point succeeded in getting three board appointees). On June 25 2017 Third Point communicated publicly about its $3.5 billion investment in Nestlé. In an eight-page letter to Nestlé’s investors Loeb called for various changes at the Swiss company. In putting forth the rationale for the changes that he sought Loeb made the following arguments:Despite having arguably the best positioned portfolio in the consumer packaged goods industry Nestlé shares have significantly underperformed most of their US and European consumer staples peers on a three year five year and ten year total shareholder return basis. One year returns have been driven largely by the market’s anticipation that with a newly appointed CEO Nestlé will improve.In addition to urging Nestlé to publicly set a more ambitious productivity goal the Third Point letter talked specifically about both reshaping the portfolio and monetizing the L’Oréal stake. Third Point pointed out that Nestlé owned over 2000 brands in the food and beverage and in the health sciences categories and that managing a large number of brands could lead to suboptimal capital allocation. The letter called for a review and eventual sale of underperforming brands and a simultaneous augmentation of the portfolio via “accretive bolt-on acquisitions in high growth and advantaged categories.” While acknowledging the contribution of the L’Oréal stake over the years Third Point was emphatic in demanding that Nestlé sell its stake. The firm’s rationale was that “having L’Oréal in the portfolio is not strategic and shareholders should be free to choose whether they want to invest in Nestlé or some combination of Nestlé and L’Oréal.” Third Point reiterated this stand in its July 2018 letter: It is clear that the Company’s non-core financial stake in L’Oréal should be sold since the Board remains unable to articulate a compelling long-term strategic rationale for its continued ownership. Nestlé should use the proceeds from these [L’Oréal and other suggested divestments] sales to do more M&A [mergers and acquisitions] in key areas or engage in expedited share buybacks. Third Point also provided a comparison of Nestlé with its peers (see Exhibit 3).THE “ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM”In September 2017 shortly after being appointed as the company’s CEO Schneider laid out Nestlé’s strategy in an investor conference in London. In his presentation Schneider stressed Nestlé’s identity as a global NHW company and indicated that portfolio management and capital allocation would be among his key priorities for the future. He indicated that his team would use four criteria for future acquisitions and divestments: fit with NHW strategy attractive categories in terms of growth and margin ability to win and resource intensity (required capital and human resource investment). Schneider had already spearheaded two major portfolio moves. In December 2017 he had led the acquisition of Atrium Innovations Inc. a global leader in nutritional health products for $2.3 billion in cash. The company had sales of around $700 million and boasted double-digit cumulative annual sales growth in the period 2015–2017. The second move was the January 2018 divestment of Nestlé’s US confectionery business for $2.8 billion in cash. The business had sales of approximately $900 million and had suffered negative cumulative annual growth for the period 2015–2017.In 2007 Nestlé acquired Gerber Products Company (Gerber) from Novartis International AG for $5.5 billion in cash and folded it in its infant nutrition business. As part of the acquisition Nestlé acquired the Gerber Life Insurance Company (Gerber Life) business. Gerber Life sought to parlay the Gerber brand name among young parents to sell both term and whole life insurance policies. In FY 2017 Gerber Life accounted for CHF850 million in revenues. In an effort to stem declining sales growth Nestlé repositioned the Gerber baby foods brand as an organic option and supported the relaunch with a major marketing campaign. As part of the review of the Gerber acquisition Schneider’s team decided that Gerber Life was a non-strategic business for Nestlé and indicated in mid-2018 that it was looking at all possible alternatives including an outright sale.In an interview following the release of the financial results for the first half of 2018 Schneider defended the company’s strategic direction:Let me underscore my strong working relationship with our chairman. [The two of us are in] full agreement [on Nestlé’s current direction and are] unanimous in our commitment to analyze all aspects of our strategy. . . . As CEO I have full authority to undertake this [strategic] analysis and implement the right actions to meet our objectives.However Schneider and his team had yet to address Nestlé’s 23.2 per cent stake in L’Oréal which an analyst referred to as the “elephant in the room.”Exhibit 1: Nestlé S.A.

Nothing works just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump.”US President Donald Trump on the Iowa CaucusOn February 3 2020 the 2020 Iowa caucus occurred. This was the first nominating contest that took place in the primaries of the Democratic Party for the 2020 presidential election. The use of a vote-counting application (app) which originally seemed like a good idea had resulted in a catastrophe and political ridicule for the Democratic Party. The new 2020 Iowa caucus was meant to increase voter transparency as well as credibility for and confidence in the Democratic Party but it had done the opposite. Following the night’s events Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders said “All I can say about Iowa is it was an embarrassment. It was a disgrace to the good people of Iowa who take their responsibilities in the caucuses very seriously. They screwed it up badly that is what the Iowa Democratic Party did.”Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) officials needed to ensure that this type of mishap would be avoided going forward. How exactly had the catastrophe come to be? What should IDP officials do to ensure a more successful information technology (IT) implementation process in the future?The US Presidential Election ProcessThe first US presidential election took place on January 7 1789 when George Washington was elected as the first president of the United States of America. As it did in 1789 the United States continued to use the Electoral College system which gave citizens above the age of 18 the right to vote for electors who in turn voted for the president. The Electoral College comprised a group of individuals selected by each state who elected the vice president and the president. Each of the 50 states received a predefined number of electors based on the state’s population size to put toward the Electoral College. In essence voters were not directly voting to elect the president; rather they voted for electors/delegates who in turn voted to elect the president. The election process began with primary elections and caucuses with the goal of selecting party leaders both Democrat and Republican.Primaries and caucuses were the two ways in which the Democratic and Republican parties chose the delegates who would attend the parties’ national conventions where the delegates officially chose each party’s nominee for the presidential race. A primary was an election at the state level where the members of a particular party voted to choose a candidate for their political party. The selected members from these primaries then ran against each other in a general election. Some of the most drastic changes to the US election process occurred in the 1960s. During this decade most states did not hold primaries or caucuses. Instead at the national convention the presidential nominee was picked by the respective party leaders. A critical reason for this was that voter engagement in the voting process at that time was much lower than it is today. Before the 1960s the people in charge were picking the people to stay in charge. This was mostly undisrupted until 1968 when in the few primaries across a subset of all 50 states young Democrats voted in great numbers against the candidates who were in favour of the Vietnam War. However at the national convention presidential and vice-presidential nominees who were pro-war were chosen by the party delegate. This was not well received by voters and protests erupted across the country. These protests were incredibly effective ultimately serving as a catalyst for changing the way elections were being held. The Democratic Party soon allowed the voters pick the nominee through delegates with voters in each state and Republicans eventually adopted the same solution. Today the delegates from each state were still the ones officially voting at the national convention for the nomineebut they had to vote according to the how the candidates had fared in their state elections.Thirty-four US states conducted primary elections. A caucus was a local meeting where the members registered to a political party in a city town or county came together and voted for their preferred party candidate. Caucuses were often used in combination with a state convention as a way to elect delegates to the national convention for the purpose of selecting the president. While primaries and caucuses were executed in different ways they had the same function: they let the states choose the nominees for the major political parties with the purpose of attending the general election. To win the nomination candidates needed a majority of the total delegates and the states that had larger populations (as calculated by the census every 10 years) had more delegates; these delegates were selected within the primaries and caucuses across the country. A state such as Iowa for example had only 41 delegates compared to a state such as Florida which had 219. Nonetheless Iowa played an important role in the election process as did other small states that voted early in the process.The US election process was far from perfect with one major complaint being the length of the process. Whether you measured it from the first candidate’s entry or the first caucus the US campaign season was significantly longer than that of many other countries (see Exhibit 1). There had also been reform requests surrounding the role money played in politics. The US system essentially required candidates to raise millions of dollars to even mount a serious run and often the capital raised came from wealthy individuals who donated to the candidates whose beliefs coincided with their own. The Iowa CaucusThe Iowa caucus represented the first chance for American citizens from both major political parties to show support for a presidential candidate. The national press coverage of the caucus captured every minute of excitement as hopeful presidential candidates spread out across all 99 Iowa counties in an attempt to win over American citizens at local dinners and in elementary school gyms. The Iowa caucus was the first event in the election season acting as a bellwether of national sentiment. It was a source of significant momentum that could propel a candidate into the public eye. Following violence over the Vietnam War and combined with racial tensions following the 1968 Democratic National Convention the Democratic Party along with the State of Iowa decided to become more involved in the nomination process. They planned to distribute the presidential nominating schedule to each of the states such that there were multiple election days across the country. Iowa had a more complex process compared to other states involving precinct caucuses county and district conventions and finally a state convention; this process took longer to complete in Iowa than it did in other states so it had to start early. Political columnist Kathy O’Bradovich remarked “The really important thing to remember about Iowa is not that it’s first because it’s important. Iowa is important because it’s first.” The current vote collection system employed manual counting. This method synonymous with hand-counting required a physical ballot that represented voter intent. Following their collection the physical ballots were taken out of the ballot boxes or envelopes read and interpreted; the results were then tallied and finally reported.Technology to the rescue! In 2016 both Democrats and Republicans faced contested caucuses with the memory of the botched 2012 Republican Iowa caucus still lingering. Mitt Romney had been incorrectly declared the winner of the 2012 Republican Iowa caucus surpassing Rick Santorum the Republican runner-up by eight votes. However upon official counting Santorum was found to have obtained 34 more votes than Romney; consequently Santorum was declared the official winner after problems with conflicting reports were resolved.Moving forward the IDP wanted to deploy a mobile app that could be used by precinct chairs (elected local officials in the American political party system) to calculate and report results—presumably faster and more accurately—and that could present a way to avoid repeating past mistakes. From this desire rose the decision for the IDP to partner with Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) which contracted a company called InterKnowlogy to build the app and other digital caucus infrastructure using Microsoft’s technology. In 2016 Microsoft partnered with InterKnowlogy for the development of the technology used to power the Iowa caucuses. Together and with oversight from members of the Iowa Caucus committee Microsoft and InterKnowlogy built an app that recorded results securely and accurately. The app had a dual authentication process which ensured that precinct chairs were approved to submit results from precincts across the state. InterKnowlogy supported the building and development of the app’s features and Microsoft was responsible for supporting the build and testing the app to ensure the whole process would be smooth and error-free.However following the 2016 caucus not everyone was content. While the app had worked as intended members wanted more transparency moving forward for the 2020 Iowa caucuses with the purpose of removing a supposed veil of secrecy following claims of wrongdoing in the 2016 election in which Bernie Sanders narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton when both Democratic candidates were competing at the 2016 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Believing he should have won Sanders called for a recount but in 2016 there was no mechanism by which Iowa Democrats could recount caucus results because the state party did not maintain paper records of the results. For 2020 the Democratic National Committee (DNC) implemented a new set of reporting requirements that insisted that the IDP publish the raw vote totals.Changing VendorsIn the two months leading up to the 2020 Iowa caucuses the Democratic Party decided to switch technology vendors for its app from the Microsoft/InterKnowlogy pairing to Shadow Inc. (Shadow). It was unclear why the IDP did not keep the same appone created by an established companyand instead pursued that of an untested start-up. Microsoft clarified that it did not make the app for the 2020 Iowa caucuses when a company spokesperson tweeted “We had a great partnership with the Iowa political parties in 2016 but we are not part of the caucuses this year and have not been involved in building or supporting their app.” The decision to switch technology vendors (and apps) was likely attractive to the IDP for many reasons. For one thing the IDP paid relatively littleUS$63000 as recorded by the Federal Election Commissionfor customized technology services. Moreover the 2016 app and the 2020 app had similar requirements and while their functions were not complicated there had to be several versions of the same app for different operating systems and devices. The first use of the app would be when the app’s proper functioning mattered most. There would be no time to roll out updates and improvements. IDP had to get it right the first time and if it did not the consequences would be very public. The fact that the 2016 and 2020 apps were fairly similar from a technical standpoint and the low cost that Shadow had agreed to made the deal attractive for the IDP. However political affiliations might have played a role in the decision.What is Shadow?During a lacklustre lead up to the caucuses what had seemed like an easy process for InterKnowlogy and Microsoft seemed to present misgivings at every turn for Shadow. Why had the DNC along with members of the IDP selected Shadowan untested company whose ability to carry the heavy responsibility of providing technology was unknownfor a caucus? The answer possibly lay in Shadow’s extensive ties to high-profile and influential democrats of executives from Acronym. Shadow was highly connected to and a subsidiary of Acronym a “values-driven” non-profit organization aiming to “educate inspire register and mobilize voters” that was contracted by the DNC for the caucus. Shadow’s chief executive officer (CEO) Gerard Niemira stated on his LinkedIn page that he had “[led a] small but mighty team” for Hillary Clinton’s “Hillary for America” campaign in 2016. Shadow’s chief operating officer (COO) James Hickey had also worked for the Clinton campaign as an engineering manager. Acronym’s COO Kim Peyser was a former Obama administration official and its training manager Andrea Ramos had been the digital organizing director for the 2020 campaign of Elizabeth Warren a 2020 Democratic candidate. Tara McGowan a Democratic-affiliated political strategist and the CEO of Acronym was married to a senior aide in the campaign of Pete Buttigieg another 2020 Democratic candidate—a connection that had attracted widespread attention on social media. Certain Democratic campaigns—such as those of Buttigieg and of the former vice president and current American president Joe Bidenhad used an app built by Shadow to solicit donations and communicate with supporters via text according to people familiar with the matter and expense records from their federal campaigns.Whether Shadow had been chosen only because of its political affiliations with the Democratic Party or whether it was a matter of simple technological oversight it was clear that Shadow was not ready to be the technology provider for the election and the Iowa caucusalong with the democratic processsuffered as a result.Leading into the CaucusThe developers at Shadow of the 2020 app had fewer resources than the 2016 developers from InterKnowlogy. Rodney Guzman CEO of InterKnowlogy said that the company had had about a year of lead time where the first three months were spent on product design meetings usability studies and user testing. Because of the delays in planning the Iowa caucus Shadow personnel did not enter into a contract for the 2020 Iowa app until the fall of 2019 compressing an already tight timeline. InterKnowlogy’s lead time of three months was a longer amount of time than Shadow had in total to develop its app—Shadow’s developers had only two months. The extra months InterKnowlogy had given its engineers allowed them time to properly build and test the app. It had also given time to the precinct chairs who would be using the app to test and become familiar with the product. Given this shortened timeline aspects of the IT implementation process had been overlooked the second time around essentially taking for granted what had been done in the past. One thing that had shocked Guzman was that Shadow had not been uploaded to the app stores of Apple Inc. (Apple) or Google LLC the two most popular app marketplaces. Instead users were forced to “sideload” it—basically to download the app through a different channel. This was a difficult process for experienced smartphone users let alone those who had hardly ever used a smartphone. The Shadow app was distributed through TestFairy Ltd. (TestFairy) a mobile app testing platform rather than the official app stores on Android and iOS devices. Two Acronym sources when speaking anonymously to The New York Times said that the reason Shadow had released the app through TestFairy was that it had run out of time for the app stores to approve it. Uploading to these app stores specifically those of Android and iOS required a more stringent and detailed app review in order to ensure safety for users downloading developers’ apps. As pointed out in Apple’s app security overview “Apps are among the most critical elements of a modern security architecture. While apps provide amazing productivity benefits for users they also have the potential to negatively impact system security stability and user data if they’re not handled properly.”Leading up to the 2020 caucus security experts warned the IDP that the app had not been stress tested and was not prepared for state-wide use. Iowa was urged by Bob Lord the DNC’s cybersecurity chief to drop its plans to use the app. This request was ignored according to people familiar with the matter. In November Iowa officials gathered in Des Moines with the purpose of testing the processes involved in the caucuses. However the app was not included as part of the test.During the CaucusProblems with the app arose on the Monday before voting even started. Certain precinct chairs mentioned they were having trouble downloading or logging on to the app. The IDP said these issues were arising because of poor cell service in certain areas along with certain minor bugs that were being resolved. Moreover certain precinct officials in rural areas had only recently become aware that there even was a mobile app. Many others had received no training on how to use the app and subsequently decided not to use it.When the time finally came to hopefully rise above the troubles of the past couple months and collect the votes for the 600000 eligible Iowa Democratic voters everything fell apart.There were warning signs of problems as soon as the first results came in from the new app. While the raw data seemed fine there was a high error rate. There were issues with the process of transmitting the results for display and no one could figure out why this problem was occurring.As voters came together in groups to demonstrate their support for their candidate the precinct chairs filled out worksheets with the results. There were two ways the results could be reported. The main way was via the mobile phone app. However because many of the precinct chairs were having problems either downloading the app or using it this option was ineffective and unreliable. Reporting results via a phone hotline was meant to be the backup option but because the app was not working as intended many precinct chairs had to call the hotline overloading the phone lines. Additionally unlike in previous years three sets of numbers had to be reported instead of just one number. Of her experience with the app Worth County Party Chair Jane Podgorniak said “I couldn’t get it to work” adding “I tried and tried.”Sean Bagniewski Polk County chairman said “When you have an app that you’re sending out to 1700 people and many of them might be newer to apps and that kind of stuff it might have been worth doing a couple months’ worth of testing to make sure it is working correctly.”Not only was the app not working as intended but as a consequence of the problems the backup phone system was overwhelmed. Shawn Sebastian a precinct secretary told CNN (Cable News Network) at about 11:00 p.m. “The hotline has not been responsive”; he had been left on hold for over an hour when attempting to report his results.Post-CaucusShadow put out the following apology on Twitter Tuesday afternoon: “We sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night’s Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates their campaigns and Democratic caucus-goers.” More importantly an analysis by The New York Times revealed inconsistencies in the reported data for several hundred of the state’s precincts: “Those errors occurred at every stage of the tabulation process: in recording votes in calculating and awarding delegates and in entering the data into the state party’s database.”In The New York Times’ review of the data 10 per cent of precincts at a minimum seemed to have allocated their delegates improperly. In certain cases precincts awarded fewer delegates than they had; in others they awarded more. The party was still releasing results up to Wednesday night even though the caucus had been held on Monday bringing the total of statewide precincts reporting to 97 per cent.The effects of this technology mishap could not be understated. What had begun as a way to increase transparency ultimately resulted in a mockery and in the unreliability of the caucus results. Moreover an event that had been meant to market and raise excitement about a competitor to Donald Trump ended up worsening the Democratic Party’s chances of winning the upcoming 2020 general election. President Trump thus found himself in a strikingly strong position as his re-election campaign got underway in earnest.ConclusionOne thing about the app fiasco was certain: this would be one of the largest Democratic failures since the Obamacare website crash and it would continue to be a talking point for years to come. The 2020 Iowa Democratic caucus had jeopardized the bedrock of democracy. Technology had been brought in to add transparency to the election process but had clouded it instead. Buttigieg the winner of the Iowa caucus had his victory questioned and undermined all because of one app. What seemed like a bargain for the IDP had turned into a national fiasco.Who had failed: the people or the technology? Who was responsible: the Democratic Party the IDP the DNC Shadow or Acronym?Had outsourcing the creation of the app been the right call? Should the IDP have looked to build the app themselves with in-house talent? Had it been a high-risk implementation? How could the risks have been mitigated? Going forward how could organizers avoid a similar situation?Exhibit 1: NATIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN LENGTHNote: UK = United Kingdom; US = United States; cand. = candidate.Source: Danielle Kurtzleben ""Why Are US Elections So Much Longer Than Other Countries’?""

The ever-increasing competition in the fast food industry was taking its toll on his business a fact that was reflected in falling sales figures over the past couple of months. As in the past few years Rao worried that this year his business would again be affected by upcoming summer vacations in Manipal. He was constantly thinking about opening a full-service economical restaurant and taking Apoorva closer to his customers. He had six potential locations in mind and he had even visited them along with Apoorva’s manager Avinash Poojari. However he had not been able to pinpoint the final location. He now had less than 48 hours to finalize the location as he had to inform investors of his decision during the much-awaited investor meeting scheduled for April 18. Rao wanted an in-depth evaluation of these potential locations before the meeting.backgroundApoorva started operations in early 1993 with a single outlet near Tiger Circle Manipal. Rao partnered with one of his friends to set up a food business catering to the students of T. A. Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). Apoorva’s focus on hygiene and food quality won over the students and soon the business took off. Rao took care to provide personalized services a fact that was well appreciated by his customers. Within a short period Apoorva’s customer base rose to 900. Soon Rao was able to set up two more cafés near the Manipal Institute of Technology campus. Apoorva experienced a steady growth in revenue (see Exhibit 1). In 2009 TAPMI relocated to a spacious lush and green 40-acre campus 5 kilometres from Manipal. By then Rao had increased his customer base to 1800 on the Manipal Institute of Technology campus and added another 300 customers from the new TAPMI campus. Poojari a young dynamic management graduate joined him to look after the three facilities at the two different locations. Unfortunately in 2010 Rao suffered a road accident and was confined to bed for almost a year. The business began to suffer a dip in sales. To make matters worse the contracts with both the Manipal Institute of Technology women’s and men’s hostels were not renewed. Poojari was asked to run Rao’s business at Manipal. Poojari was a conscientious worker and was admired by both employees and customers. To improve sales he experimented with different flavours and dishes on the menu. He ushered in some tactical changes all of which translated into a steady growth in revenue. He introduced innovations such as sponsoring food and beverages for participants in social events which further increased Apoorva’s visibility and brought in more customers. He went the extra mile to please customers and often interacted with them to understand their requirements even customizing some dishes to their tastes. This led to the creation of one of Apoorva’s signature dishes the Bombay Tawa Sandwich which was popular with customers. Ninety per cent of Apoorva’s customers were undergraduate and postgraduate students of Manipal. The average ticket price for registered members at Apoorva was ₹135 whereas for others it was ₹170. Most of the un-registered members were medical patients labourers and friends of members from around the Manipal–Udupi region. While they enjoyed the food and services of the mess they often complained that the distance from the town was a major factor that dissuaded them from visiting more frequently. Some of them even requested that Rao bring Apoorva closer to their locations. About ManipalManipal was a small suburb in the district of Udupi Karnataka with an area of 26 square kilometres and a population of just over 37000 (see Exhibit 2). Known as the “university town” Manipal housed some of the leading educational institutes in the country including the Manipal Institute of Technology Kasturba Medical College and TAPMI. The student community constituted over 75 per cent of the town’s population with around 7000 international students from 60 different countries (see Exhibit 3). The average student age was 22 and most students belonged to the upper middle class of society. Besides their diverse student population Manipal and Udupi (3.5 kilometres from Manipal) had witnessed a surge in medical tourism as both of these towns attracted many patients from India and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries who came for allopathic and alternative medicine treatments. In addition the government and corporate businesses invested in infrastructure projects in this region which brought a huge migratory labour force to the region mostly from the northern and eastern states of the country. The ancient Udupi Krishna temple and other spiritual places also brought in their share of domestic and international tourists. Since Manipal was located near the Western Ghats and the western coast it witnessed tropical weather conditions with a hot and humid summer and heavy rainfall from June to September. The rainy season generally affected the public transport system resulting in the closure of schools and colleges.CompetitionIn the past few decades Apoorva had enjoyed a distinct advantage in catering to the Manipal Institute of Technology students and a monopoly with respect to TAPMI. However in recent years many domestic and international fast-food restaurant chains such as Mavalli Tiffin Room Sagar Ratna Kentucky Fried Chicken Subway Pizza Hut Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Café Coffee Day had opened outlets in the region causing a temporary dip in business for Apoorva. After each such dip Apoorva had managed to bounce back. Yet the pressure was beginning to grow especially considering that these established brands had better logistics including home delivery that were denting Apoorva’s business. Online food aggregators too had entered into the arena further harming Apoorva. With a change in TAPMI leadership in January 2016 the institution insisted on giving more options to its 900+ students and allowed three more vendors to cater to the same set of customers. In February 2016 the monthly subscription plan also underwent a change. It was replaced by a daily plan that gave students the power to choose from one of the four vendors for a day. Though Rao kept the day’s price reasonable (₹140) compared to Madhuvan Serai (₹180) and the other two vendors (₹200) the daily plan affected Apoorva’s revenue in these two months.selecting a Facility location Rao had always wanted to open a full-service economical restaurant in the Manipal–Udupi region but was unable to give shape to his dream as he was bed-ridden from the accident. Over the years Rao had served the students of Manipal; however he had always wanted to cater to the needs of the lower middle class by providing them with hygienic food at affordable rates. For these people—daily wage workers patients and budget tourists—high-priced domestic and international food venues were out of their budgets; also roadside food stalls offered unhygienic food that could have adversely affected their health. Now that Poojari was successfully taking care of his existing business Rao turned his attention to fulfilling his dream. With the price of land in Manipal reaching a very high level he felt that places around Udupi or Parkala–Hiriadka would be more reasonable and that the competition would be more manageable. Also apart from fulfilling the demands of his existing customers in this region he would be able to fulfill his dream of serving quality food to a lower demographic. Over the past year he had contacted several property dealers and shortlisted six potential locations around the area. In January 2016 he visited all six locations to identify the one that would be best for his new restaurant (see Exhibit 4).Based on his 20 years of experience running the mess and café Rao knew that the three most important criteria for setting up a restaurant were space within the facility parking space outside the facility and the ability to serve hot and fresh food to customers not only in the restaurant but also through home delivery. He believed that a good facility should have around 1000 square feet of carpeted area and a parking lot one and a half times the size of the facility. He also believed the average time required for home delivery should not be long. However he still felt unsure because all of his experience was based on running a mess for students at a university. Would it be sufficient to launch a successful business with a different clientele and a different location? He knew his strength was not in the local cuisine so he would have to focus more on tourists patients students and migratory labourers from other states rather than on locals. In February he approached a market research agency in Manipal BrandScan to help him identify the best location. He knew that the cost of land across these six potential locations might vary a little. However he believed that a prominent location was the key to success for this type of business and asked that the agency not focus on the land cost.After conducting a two-phase survey—one with restaurant owners in Manipal–Udupi and nearby regions and the other with the customers in these locations—the BrandScan team submitted a report to Rao in the first week of April. The report detailed the customer segments (see Exhibit 5A) and the set of criteria for evaluation along with their importance in selecting the restaurant location (see Exhibit 5B). Rao wanted a thorough assessment of these six potential locations before making the final decision understanding fully that the wrong choice would spell disaster for his business in the long run. He asked Poojari to gather the details of the locations corresponding to the criteria recommended by the survey report and submit it to him by April 16 2016. Rao was apprehensive about giving equal weight to the criteria in evaluating these locations. However the research report recommended differential weights to be given to the criteria in selecting the best location. With only one day to evaluate and pinpoint the final location before the investor meeting he knew he would have to work late. Rao’s chain of thoughts was broken by the sudden entry of Poojari carrying the assessment report (see Exhibit 6). Looking anxious he told Rao “Sir we have to decide fast. I just heard that a couple of restaurants are opening up by the end of this monsoon season.” Exhibit 1: apoorva Sales figures 2004–2016 (In ₹ million)Source: Company documents.

The bank had achieved its size through several acquisitions in various locations across Africa. In 2011 ETI acquired the Trust Bank Ghana Limited (TTB) as part of its growth strategy and planned to merge it with Ecobank Ghana Limited (Ecobank) an affiliate of ETI over the next year.The acquisition brought together two banks with different organizational cultures customer bases operational technologies and regulatory reporting requirements. Ecobank was part of a multinational bank with branches around the African continent; decisions were made centrally by ETI for consistency and standardization in all branches. Also while Ecobank was a full-service bank it was perceived primarily as a corporate bank. TTB on the other hand was a medium-sized financial service provider that focused on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It operated typically as a local bank with each branch making decisions to reflect its locality.Raymond Fordwuo an employee with ETI was selected as the integration manager to oversee the merger. He anticipated that the differences were going to lead to challenges with integrating the two banks under the umbrella of Ecobank. He needed a plan to manage the merger of the two banks—a plan that would successfully bring together two different types of clientele two operational systems two brands and organizational cultures and two staff groups who had been promised that no jobs would be lost. How should Fordwuo manage the merger between the two banks to manage costs and information flow? What changes would Fordwuo need to prioritize and what challenges should he anticipate in the merger?Banking in GhanaHistorically the banks in Ghana had all been foreign owned until 1953 when the Ghana Commercial Bank was established. With independence in 1957 Ghana established the Bank of Ghana as the central bank that would regulate the financial institutions and banks in Ghana oversee the country’s monetary policies and advise the government on implementing those policies. To supplement the largely commercial focus of the expatriate banks the government established state-owned banks and development financial institutions. Banks in independent Ghana were largely state-owned until 1992 when the government introduced a law that allowed state banks to privatize. The law also increased the number of foreign and domestic banks that could be established in Ghana. With increased competition banking services improved. Ghanaian banks fell into four main categories: commercial banks development banks merchant banks and rural unit banks. In 2004 the government increased the minimum capital requirement for banks and introduced a universal banking licence which allowed qualified banks to expand the range of services they offered to include both commercial and investment services.Ghana’s banking sector was well developed but fragmented. The increased minimum capital requirement forced a number of mergers but even with those there were 26 universal banks operating in the country in 2011. Yet despite the number of banks only a small percentage of the population—about 10 per cent—had banking accounts. And despite an improving economy with record high gross domestic product and decreasing inflation borrowing interest rates remained high: the Bank of Ghana set the prime rate at 13.0 per cent—however this was a significant decrease from the 18.0 per cent established in November 2009 and a further decrease from the 13.5 per cent established in 2010. Ecobank Transnational IncorporatedETI usually referred to as Ecobank Group was incorporated in 1985 in Lomé Togo and had locations in more countries in Africa than any other bank in the world (see Exhibit 1). In 2011 ETI operated in 32 countries across western central eastern and southern Africa. The bank also had a licensed operation in Paris and representative offices in Dubai and London. ETI was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange the Ghana Stock Exchange and the Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières—the regional stock market for the eight member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. ETI had a dual focus: “to build a world-class pan-African bank and to contribute to the economic and financial integration and the development of the African continent.” With more than 23000 employees ETI was the largest employer in the financial sector in central Africa. The bank offered full-service banking providing wholesale retail investment and transactional banking services to governments financial institutions multinational organizations local companies SMEs and individuals. At the end of 2011 ETI was in third place in the Ghanaian financial market.Ecobank Ghana LimitedEcobank was licensed as a corporate bank in 1989 began business in 1990 and quickly established four additional branches in Ghana. The bank provided a wide range of wholesale financial products and customized solutions to multinationals regional corporate organizations government parastatals international organizations and financial institutions; these products and solutions included pan-African credit trade and commodity financing cash management and payment solutions. In 2003 the bank obtained a licence from the Bank of Ghana to move from being predominantly a wholesale bank to become a universal bank. The move into universal banking permitted the bank to provide convenient accessible financial products and services to individuals corporate bodies and public sector and SME customers by leveraging the bank’s extensive network of branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) as well as Internet and remittance banking platforms. The bank was listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange in July 2006 and within five years of its shift to universal banking it had become a key competitor in the industry experiencing tremendous growth and reporting a 50 per cent increase in profit after taxes. The bank’s major corporate competitors were First Atlantic Bank CalBank Ghana Commercial Bank Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd. (Standard Chartered) the Universal Merchant Bank (formerly Merchant Bank Ghana Limited) and Barclays Bank of Ghana Ltd. (Barclays) a subsidiary of Barclays plc. Ecobank’s competitive edge over the local banks was its affiliation with ETI the first pan-African bank. Local banks dealt only with customers who traded within Ghana but ETI’s regional trading gave Ecobank network advantages. As a result ETI’s major corporate clients were able to do business in Ghana and other African countries within the ETI network. Even though Barclays and Standard Chartered were international banks with affiliates in other countries they were not present in many African countries. Additionally ETI’s rules credit policies and general policies were tailored to African customers whereas those at Barclays and Standard Chartered were mainly foreign. As Fordwuo put it “We act globally but think locally.”Ecobank had steadily increased its number of branches from five branches in 2001 to nine branches and five agencies in 2006 then 44 branches in 2008; by 2011 it had 53 branches spanning every region in Ghana. The bank had a strong performance record and ETI was keen to further enhance shareholder value. The path to further growth was acquisition. The AcquisitionETI announced its acquisition of TTB in January 2012. In a presentation to the shareholders of Ecobank (see Exhibit 2) ETI identified growth as the primary reason for pursuing the acquisition: the enlarged Ecobank was expected to become first in terms of both assets and profitability out of the 26 banks that were operating in Ghana as of June 30 2011. The merged companies would be able to finance large transactions (particularly in oil and gas) and would be able to lend larger amounts to individual borrowers: from approximately GH¢62 million to over GH¢90 million.With a wider geographical presence and a stronger branch network the new Ecobank would also be able to offer a harmonized service combining strong corporate retail SME and local corporate banking—an advantage for customers. Cost and revenue synergies and the ability to realize value from redundant property plant and equipment would improve the bank’s financial position allowing it to use an increased capital base to trade in foreign exchange fixed incomes and high-volume transactions. The improved financial performance would enhance value to shareholders maximizing their earnings potential in one of the countries that accounted for the large banking revenue pools in Africa.TTB’s motivations for merging were more pragmatic: the bank needed to survive in an increasingly competitive banking environment. TTB was founded in 1996 and while it was licensed as a universal bank it had carved a niche for itself by meeting the banking needs of SMEs and its presence was limited to Ghana. In 2008 when the Bank of Ghana changed regulations to increase banks’ minimal capital requirement the smallest banks in the country were acquired by larger banks. Banks that were unable to meet the central bank’s requirement had merged with other banks increasing the size of the banks and the strength of competition. Another increase which would double the minimal capital requirement was expected in 2013; this would make it even more difficult for smaller banks like TTB to survive.TTB’s majority shareholder was the Ghana Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) a government trust that also had shares in Ecobank Universal Merchant Bank and several other banks and companies in Ghana. Wanting to realign its portfolio of investments and improve returns for its shareholders SSNIT decided to sell its majority interest in TTB to ETI in exchange for a stake in Ecobank. The deal was strategically advantageous for SSNIT for several reasons: Ecobank was part of ETI it paid good dividends and its future strategic direction was sustainable. Moreover the deal would consolidate SSNIT’s investment in Ghana’s banking sector increasing SSNIT’s interest in Ecobank from a small minority to 16 per cent. Ecobank would gain all of TTB’s branches which were located in places where Ecobank did not have a presence. Therefore both TTB’s majority shareholder and Ecobank were motivated to merge.The acquisition involved a share swap that would transfer ETI’s newly acquired 100 per cent stake in TTB to Ecobank in exchange for additional shares in Ecobank. TTB would be merged with Ecobank making the new combined company the largest bank in Ghana in terms assets with the largest ATM network and over 70 branches. The merged entity would be able to harmonize corporate and retail businesses and finance large ventures especially in the oil and gas sector and it would benefit from a stronger position when bargaining for rates. Economies of scale synergies and improved financial performance were expected to enhance shareholder value.At the time of the acquisition Ecobank held assets worth GH¢2.2 billion and a market share of 9.7 per cent—the second-largest in Ghana. TTB held assets worth GH¢533 million and a market share of 2.7 per cent—the 15th-largest in Ghana. The total asset valuation of TTB for acquisition was GH¢220 million. Ecobank and TTB were particularly mindful of financial and legal consequences and therefore put in place the necessary structures to ensure legal compliance and value for money. Ecobank Development Corporation the investment banking and securities trading subsidiary of ETI performed the financial diligence for Ecobank; PricewaterhouseCoopers performed the due diligence for TTB. The law firm of Bentsi-Enchill Letsa and Ankomah undertook the legal due diligence. PricewaterhouseCoopers was also retained to do a post-merger review. The process of obtaining approval from the Bank of Ghana which came after the certificate of acquisition was issued was a prominent part of the whole procedure.Before integrationAcquisitions always carried uncertainties so it was not a surprise to Ecobank that concerns emerged even before the integration process began. In this case TTB’s shareholders asked questions about the future of the new business venture. This caused delays in obtaining approval from TTB’s board to commence the acquisition process.EmployeesTo minimize discontent among employees at Ecobank and TTB employees at both banks were assured that the merger would not lead to job losses. Unemployment would tarnish Ecobank’s image and without buy-in from employees from both banks the integration would not be successful. Using long-term rather than short-term thinking Ecobank reasoned that an emphasis on profits at the early stage would not be prudent; instead it could assess the staff complement and adjust later. Despite assurances from Ecobank that no one would lose their jobs employees at both TTB and Ecobank were generally concerned about how the new merged working environment would affect them. While the human resource structures in the two banks were similar in function TTB’s staff complement was smaller than Ecobank’s and had fewer hierarchical levels. Also Ecobank’s employees were better compensated—an issue that would have to be addressed in the merger and that was expected to be advantageous for TTB’s employees. Ecobank as the larger company would continue as Ecobank through and after the merger. TTB however would be subsumed and would no longer exist. All heads of departments at TTB had to be absorbed by Ecobank and work under Ecobank’s heads. The exception was the head of the TTB human resources department who was more experienced and due to retire in about two years. TTB’s human resources manager would be responsible for the human resources of the newly merged bank and Ecobank’s head of human resources would take over after the TTB manager retired. Still some of TTB’s key management staff were skeptical and some chose to not be part of the merger. The managing director at TTB and all but one general manager negotiated severance packages and left due to uncertainty regarding their new positions dissatisfaction with the new management grading system at Ecobank or a desire not to work under Ecobank’s management. However most of TTB’s heads of departments stayed on even though they were not happy to report to Ecobank’s department heads. Customers and Organizational CultureEcobank was a large organization with a pan-African presence and international affiliations. The bank’s primary target was the global market; therefore its employees had developed a global mindset. Employees were held to high levels of accountability that would meet the expectations of global competitors and customers. The bank had high brand recognition and prestige. Ecobank was a preferred place of employment for those working in Ghana’s banking sector and its employees enjoyed a sense of superiority because they were part of ETI’s vast structure. In comparison TTB was focused solely on local clientele. Its visibility was lower than Ecobank’s and its presence was limited to Ghana and a largely local competitive landscape. Employment at TTB was indistinguishable from employment with any of the other local banks. TTB’s customers were small local clients who enjoyed banking with an organization that understood their needs. Smaller local businesses often did not separate their business from personal financial affairs. TTB was familiar with those practices and was often informal in adhering to business standards. The bank’s relationships with its customers depended on its flexibility and willingness to sometimes compromise. Thus the merger was going to be a significant challenge for TTB’s customers who were accustomed to locally managed arrangements that were more flexible than those the larger Ecobank could or would accommodate. A customer service challenge surfaced before the merger and trickled through the integration process: some senior TTB staff attempted to use customers as tools in their resistance to change by implying to TTB’s customers that Ecobank was a typical corporate bank that would not have time for its new customers. Compounding this smear campaign some TTB customers who were not accustomed to the greater accountability and scrutiny that came with a pan-African bank began to complain to the newspapers. Because SSNIT a government trust was a significant shareholder in Ecobank the issue made its way to the Bank of Ghana and resulted in a series of meetings with the central bank to assure the regulator that customers would not be adversely affected by the merger.OperationsBoth banks had online services and ATMs: Ecobank had 53 branches throughout the country while TTB had 25 branches mostly located in Accra and the surrounding area. In cases where both banks had branches in the same area the TTB branches would eventually be closed. The long-term plan was to consolidate all physical buildings and for efficiency to divest the TTB office locations that were in close proximity to Ecobank locations.Although each bank had its own board of directors their different perspectives (i.e. international versus local) also determined the regulatory requirements each bank adhered to. Both were required to adhere to the standards of the Central Bank of Ghana the regulations of the Ghana Stock Exchange and the laws of Ghana. ETI and its affiliate banks however had a global presence which meant that they also had to follow international regulations and the laws of the various countries in which the affiliate banks operated. The banks were also subject to the regulations of three stock exchanges. With the merger TTB would become subject to these extended obligations as well. Each bank used a different operational technology. Ecobank used the Oracle FLEXCUBE interface a real-time online comprehensive banking system used around the world. The system was meant to be universal embracing all of a bank’s transactions including its ATMs. TTB ran on a system designed by InfoPro the eICBA platform. While eICBA was also capable of being a universal interface for a bank the system’s strength was its modularity. Banks could adopt some or all of the systems as needed; further the modules were designed to be adaptable within local banking customs—a feature that made the eICBA platform a favourite for Islamic banking systems.Branding was yet another consideration for the merger. All bank employees wore bank uniforms but each bank had distinctive branding and design for its uniforms. Similarly all employees had official bank email addresses; however each bank used a different domain and structure for its email system.Appointment of Raymond FordwuoWith vast experience in the acquisition of several companies in the African sub-region ETI was confident that its latest acquisition could be smoothly integrated. It appointed Fordwuo as integration manager to oversee the project and ensure that the transition went well. Fordwuo had joined ETI in 2008 as the head of retail banking. In 2010 when ETI began expanding into eastern and southern Africa it put together a team from all specialized banking areas to set up the new affiliates. Fordwuo joined the team in Kenya as the retail banking expert responsible for recruiting and training all retail banking employees. Once all the affiliates had been established Fordwuo returned to Ghana.When ETI decided on the merger between Ecobank and TTB ETI was convinced that Fordwuo was the right person to spearhead the integration. Fordwuo was initially uncertain about taking on the task. However with his employer’s support he completed an executive training program in mergers and acquisitions strategy at London Business School which was insightful and proved to him that he had the required skills. Fordwuo also consulted with colleagues who were experienced with mergers to solicit their suggestions for leading change in the upcoming merger. He was buoyed by a comment from a human resources colleague who pointed out that one of Fordwuo’s strengths was his people skills—exactly what he would need to lead the organizational change at Ecobank and TTB. To ensure successful acquisition processes and outcomes Fordwuo went to Lagos Nigeria for a week in December 2011 to learn from the experiences of integration manager Dele Osgushola and Ronaldo Alfonso a consultant from McKinsey & Company who had together managed the major integration of Oceanic Bank International plc with Ecobank Nigeria after ETI acquired Oceanic in October 2011. ETI had not secured the services of a consultant to oversee the merger in Ghana so Fordwuo was keen to interact with the team in Nigeria to assess the viability of his plans for the Ecobank integration. With the information he had gleaned Fordwuo returned to Accra and began to work on integrating TTB with Ecobank. The bank wanted the integration to happen as quickly and comprehensively as possible and Fordwuo needed a plan to manage that process.Process of INTEGRATionFordwuo had much to accomplish in the next six months. The operational changes were significant ranging from the larger problem of integrating two different computerized banking programs to smaller considerations such as standardizing the branding across the new merged organization. The changes within human resources were equally daunting; two organizational systems needed to merge and assimilate a full complement of staff without eliminating any jobs. Managing the expectations of customers and helping them navigate a new way of banking would also be key to a successful integration. Fordwuo was scheduled to make a presentation to the transitional board of directors. He had a governance structure he wanted to use to oversee the integration of the two banks (see Exhibit 3). The structure would include a steering committee made up of senior executives from both banks who would oversee the integration process. The steering committee would be responsible for determining the strategy and the end state or goal for every business of the bank.Fordwuo thought he would manage the integration with the support of an administrative assistant and two project managers—one from each bank. In his proposal four implementation teams or working committees would implement key initiatives manage costs manage information flow and identify the risks to achieving expected goals. There would be one team for each major area of change—business operations and technology human resources and brand and communications—and these teams would be responsible for driving the deliverables and troubleshooting during the change. Fordwuo needed to prioritize the changes he foresaw explain his rationale for his plan and identify the challenges he should anticipate as he established the priorities for the mergers and considered how the changes might be made.Exhibit 1: Ecobank Transnational Inc.

The autumn sky was grey and gloomy but inside the room the team was enthusiastic and full of energy. Revenues had doubled in the past two years profits were up and several bright young graduates had joined the team. The company specialized in research and development (R&D) product development and innovation and had a stable clientele. However Dipinder Sekhon the chief executive officer (CEO) was not satisfied. “Most of our customers have found us. We are selling because of word-of-mouth. We are also able to support our large clients well. While that is a good situation should we not be able to reach out to a larger number of clients—to organizations who have not heard of us but may have a need for our services and products?” His colleagues were in agreement. In the information technology (IT) sector time was a critical resource. With several company products stabilizing and creating a name in the market now was the time to acquire new clients and plan for doubling revenues each year or growing even faster. The team was sure it could increase capacity on the delivery front but it would have to ramp up on the sales front. A stronger sales force could result in a larger and more diverse clientele. Sekhon believed KritiKal could grow 10 times bigger in three years. With its unique innovation ecosystem research-to-market capabilities and niche products and client relationships this was the time to take a big leap. But how were he and his team to prioritize their actions and make it all happen?Indian IT business environmentThe Indian IT industry had a market size of US$146 billion in the financial year (FY) ending 2015 with a contribution of 9.5 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product (see Exhibit 1). The country provided a healthy ecosystem for start-ups and innovations. With 3100 start-ups in 2015 alone India was the fourth largest start-up hub in the world. The industry employed a 10-million strong work force and was made up of four main segments: IT services business process management software products and engineering services and hardware. These segments had a considerable ripple effect on technology-enabled applications in other industries such as education health care finance defence electronics manufacturing governance and online information and commerce services. In FY 2016–17 the industry was expected to continue growing at a rate of 12–14 per cent with digitization disruptive technologies and innovation possibly fuelling higher rates of growth and return. While this pace of growth in the IT industry had changed lives and the way the country worked and communicated there were not many companies selling software products. Most IT companies that were commercially successful had built their empires almost entirely on service-based cost advantage models. There were some innovative product-based software companies but none of them was a leader on the global stage like their software service counterparts.Indian IT product industryFrom 1999–2010 there were few IT product start-ups in India. However in the years afterward there was a steep rise in product companies fuelled by a maturation of ecosystems in the country easier access to talent and investments and a knowledge spillover from the R&D labs of larger companies (see Exhibit 2). The companies were generally clustered around Delhi and the national capital region the Pune-Mumbai region and the cities of Bangalore Chennai and Trivandrum. Most companies said their top challenges were finding hiring and retaining talent and financing at the right time and with the right terms. As the product companies evolved there was accelerated growth of 28 per cent in their valuation between October 2014 and June 2015. It was expected that the IT product industry would be able to deliver a disruptive value to customers around the world grow to provide thousands of jobs drive foreign exchange earnings and create billions of dollars of value for founders investors and employees.birth of KritikalKritiKal’s founders had all attended the same graduate school in India. In their final year they attended an entrepreneurship talk on campus that was given by the director of the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer who helped incubate novel technology ideas into viable commercial products and services and facilitated the creation of business ventures around these ideas. As the students and some faculty members discussed the prospects they became more and more enraptured by the idea of creating a venture focused on technology and innovation and creating value for themselves and the world. In April 2002 seven of the students all from the computer science stream and five of their professors decided to get together and start working in the campus incubation facility provided by the foundation. The name “KritiKal” was chosen for the venture after discussions about the work the team would do: “creations” (kriti in the Hindi language) that would be “critical” to customer needs in the world of the future or “tomorrow” (kal in Hindi). Dr. B. N. Jain an eminent faculty member in the computer science department was the first chairperson of the company and continued to guide it as it developed.The company was registered as KritiKal Solutions Private Limited in August 2002. The foundation helped by providing the initial machines and servers and a small stipend for the founding students. All founding members—students faculty and the foundation—contributed to the small seed capital amount. Sekhon was chosen as the CEO. The initial period was one of hard work intense discussions and uncertainty. The company acquired some projects from large companies and government research which engaged them and got them their initial cheques. The team discussed future plans. One founder asked “Which technologies should we focus on? What products should we make? How long should we stay in the incubator? By staying on campus we had had easy access to student interns faculty guidance and some shared logistics support. By staying away we would be forced to manage on our own and plunge deeper into the game.” Another founder noted “What we were sure of was that we enjoyed working together and we liked working in the areas of computer vision and embedded systems.” The team members knew they wanted to make amazing products.Early achievementsIn August 2003 KritiKal received an important project opportunity from the Indian government. The company delivered on the design and development of a product to scan the underside of vehicles and also on a vehicle authentication system. The team learned several lessons from these initial projects. A founding team member stated We realized one could know more about the customer and market needs by working on such R&D projects. And this knowledge would guide us for own product development as well. We decided we should maintain a mix of products and services in our portfolio for this purpose. We realized we needed to develop our own intellectual property rights and protect them for commercialization in future.Another founder stated “Currently about 75 per cent of our valuation is from products. However about 75 per cent of our revenue is from services. So both have their advantages.”In 2005 the vehicle underside scanner was spun off into a separate business entity called KritiKal SecureScan. KritiKal not only further developed the vehicle scanning system but also built and launched a suite of other products for traffic monitoring surveillance and security. Anoop Prabhu a KritiKal founding team member together with Kapil Bardeja who had joined the leadership team at KritiKal in 2003 became the founders and promoters of KritiKal SecureScan. In 2005 this venture—which was renamed Vehant Technologies Private Limited (Vehant) in 2016—was registered as a subsidiary of KritiKal. Bardeja became the CEO of Vehant and Prabhu became the chief technology officer. Vehant had a suite of products as follows.Premises security solutions consisted of a range of under-vehicle scanning systems (UVSS) and x-ray baggage scanners. The UVSS used a combination of high-end electro-mechanical assemblies cameras illuminators sensors and image-processing software to enable an efficient viewing of a vehicle. It detected any potentially harmful object that might be attached to the underbelly of a vehicle. The baggage scanning business line included a range of x-ray scanners to handle baggage of various sizes and types at airports government offices and mass transit systems.City/border surveillance solutions were based on an automatic number plate recognition system to identify and track vehicles. The processed data could be stored and verified against any user-specified criteria for security purposes.Traffic enforcement solutions included tracking traffic signal violations and speed-limit violations. A hand-held device for penalty imposition and collection of fines was also developed. The device could verify vehicle ownership against stored data for the purposes of security and control.The turnover of Vehant was ₹230 million in FY 2015–16 and was expected to be about ₹350 million in FY 2016–17. The nurturing of Vehant and successful spin-off was a source of pride for KritiKal and inspired confidence among the team to develop more of such product incubations and ventures.ChallengesIn August 2006 KritiKal moved out of the incubation facility. The team members faced their first major crisis midway through refurbishing a new facility when they realized they had been tricked into an illegal lease. The person dealing with the KritiKal team was not the owner of the property and had duped them. The team came face to face with challenges not foreseen during the campus period. They pitched in and managed to pull through emerging stronger. The members renegotiated with the owner of the property got the office ready managed the cash flows and started working with full enthusiasm. They were also able to attract an angel investor—a technology entrepreneur—in this period. He helped the company with guidance and mentoring as well as with a network and new opportunities.Solving the early issues of logistics administration team problems payment delays and client ambiguities the team learned how to manage all aspects of the organization. The team members distributed the functional areas among themselves. They managed the responsibilities of finance human resources and technology support until the size of operations grew and each function required a dedicated team. They also worked hard on acquiring skills for managing a growing venture: managing the business life cycle managing and developing team members delegating effectively managing clients monitoring projects and cash flows and creating ideas for future products and business. Of the initial team of seven founding members one member had left after the first year to pursue further studies related to his own personal vision. There were periods when other founders took short or long sabbaticals from day-to-day operations. The organizational structure was fluid and flexible and team members took on additional responsibilities as required apart from their core functions of business acquisition and delivery. The leadership team drew compensation that was far less than market norms wanting to invest as much cash back into the company as possible. During 2012–14 the company went through a challenging period when it was in the red (see Exhibit 3). The top line was relatively stagnant the future looked uncertain and there was a lot of pressure on the leadership team. Amid discussions on how to cope with the situation two more members of the founding team left wanting to pursue alternate options and their own personal visions. Through all of these challenges the KritiKal team members enjoyed working in their areas of competence and passion: computer vision and image processing embedded systems and the Internet of things and software applications using web and mobile platforms. The core founding team members driving KritiKal were Sekhon Nishant Sharma and Ashwani Gautam. They decided to stick it out and put in another marathon effort in 2014 which was a turning point for the company. Revenues doubled between the financial years ending 2014 and 2016 and the company posted healthy profits. The positive financials were a result of some large successful accounts new clients and control over cash flow and expenses. InnovationKritiKal’s vision was to create technologies and products that were critical for applications and services of the future. Its core values were innovation growth customer focus integrity and quality. The company launched several innovative products. One of the first was a global mobile communication-based vehicle-tracking device. The device delivered location-based updates to the registered owner’s mobile number. It could be easily fitted into vehicles of all types. Once installed the device would send information about the vehicle’s current location speed readings and route taken. In 2007 the product got visibility through a lucky turn of events when the local police used it to locate a stolen car that had recently been fitted with the device. The car was recovered within a day and the entire process was covered in the national newspapers. The product was commercialized by Amsaki Homsafe Limited.A safety and load indicator device that KritiKal made for leading crane manufacturers could be used for a variety of cranes providing load monitoring data and a graphical display of the required parameters and current status. This device helped prevent accidents at industrial and construction sites. The environment at such sites was quite demanding; hence the team came up with several innovations to cater to the required rugged design. KritiKal’s Cash-Hawk system could be used by banks and financial institutions to track counterfeit currency. Cash-Hawk integrated with existing note-counting machines and used high-speed digital image acquisition and processing technologies to give exact details about the currency and the currency depositor. It also gave the location and identification details for the transaction.KritiKal successfully delivered several challenging projects in the defence sector. It developed an application software for a day and night surveillance camera that would detect any unauthorized movement over a range of several kilometres. The software provided enhanced quality images and raised appropriate alarms. It helped in surveillance over large territories with difficult terrain and rough weather conditions. KritiKal also delivered a system to transform input video from drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) and flight data into high-quality wide-angle “panoramic mosaic” output. This system was again developed for the defence sector.CustomersBy mid-2016 KritiKal had worked with over 150 customers in India North America Europe and Southeast Asia. The most profitable and value-generating streams of activity for these projects were developing product and intellectual property that went on to successful entrepreneurial commercialization and offering product-engineering services to clients in the United States and Europe.Several of KritiKal’s clients had their own internal R&D teams. The advantage KritiKal brought to these clients was that as a company focused on product design it had expertise across domains technologies and businesses. It was able to assimilate and transfer this competence across domains. Also the strong links with academia helped KritiKal stay up-to-date with current research. KritiKal had advantages in working in a service mode with customers: (1) the team acquired learning that could be exploited for product development; (2) the cash flows helped in acquiring critical resources or infrastructure; (3) the company was able to expand its network for future alliances or sales; and (4) larger client processes often drove process improvements within the team. There were some disadvantages too in working in a service mode: (1) as a small organization KritiKal often had limited control over the use of its scarce resources so managing changing client requirements or adhering to project timelines was difficult; (2) the company’s strategic plans including new product development or product improvements often went awry which caused some damage in the high-technology dynamic and competitive space; and (3) KritiKal resources who were on site with the client sometimes became frustrated with unplanned work and conflicting demands of the parent organization and clients and were wooed away by competitors.Customers were happy with KritiKal’s demonstrated expertise across technologies and businesses and its ability to support clients from the conceptual and architectural design stage to delivering prototypes and market-ready solutions. A customer said “They have a dedicated team focused on R&D striving to excel in the area of image and video processing. We look forward to working with them in future in product development.” Another client working in the embedded systems industry had this has to say about KritiKal: “Not only is their technical work of top quality but the team displays a real understanding of issues and comes to the table with suggestions and ideas that are very impressive. This has led to a better overall product.” By this time several clients had been working with KritiKal for several years and had developed long-term strategic relationships with the firm. KritiKal continued to accept work in project/service modes as well as in developing and supporting its own products. The company had a challenging business mix of developing and selling product versions conceptualizing and delivering client products delivering services and managing R&D alliances. Moving aheadThe financial turnaround after 2015 had driven a special enthusiasm in the company. KritiKal employees were always a close-knit lot. They were happy about the work mix as well. Comments on the employee feedback site Glassdoor about KritiKal included the following: “Very good workplace—for engineering innovation good work-life balance positive work environment” “Growing company with Startup like atmosphere allows personal creativity and innovation to be constantly engaged” and “Hierarchy is very non-bureaucratic and even the top leadership is very approachable.” By mid-2016 KritiKal had grown to about 70 people and Vehant to about 100 people. Business and operational processes were fairly well documented. The structure and roles were defined. Sharma who was one of the founding team members summed things up as follows: It felt good when three years back we got a large overseas client and the tide got turned. Last 1–2 years we have grown well. I think we can now grow faster . . . we had two main issues: we did not have a financial cushion. So we did not feel confident taking on slack resources. Without resources we were not able to pitch for large projects. We ourselves were all engaged in delivery. We helped in pre-sales. . . . We need to be a good sales person. . . . The second thing we required was to standardize our processes delegate . . . otherwise we could not focus on the big picture. Gautam Sharma and Sekhon members of the founding team all shared business responsibilities. The organizational structure was well defined with business enabler functions in place (see Exhibit 4). There were still debates among the leadership team about prioritizing products or projects but there were proven KritiKal products in the market and large projects to deliver; hence the debates were more about the product mix and delivery priorities rather than an either/or discussion. “We have more than 50 products across 150 clients. Some of these clients and the industries they are in are doing really well and our technologies are in great demand” said the CEO (see Exhibit 5). Revenues from embedded systems in India across industry verticals were estimated at US$4.97 billion units (see Exhibit 6). Globally huge growth was expected in the installed base of interconnected devices known as the Internet of things. From a base of 15.41 billion in 2015 devices were expected to almost double to 30.73 billion by 2020 and further increase to about 75.44 billion by 2025. The global video analytics market was US$2.3 billion in 2015. It was estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25.3 per cent reaching a size of US$11.2 billion by 2022. taking the big leapIt had been a fabulous journey thought Sekhon as he looked at his colleagues. He outlined his thoughts to them for the way ahead: (1) The company would continue to focus on R&D and innovation. It would continue to build and grow an innovation ecosystem (see Exhibit 7). (2) It would maintain its strong product focus. (3) To support both of these areas the team would develop an “incubator accelerator” function. All employees who had great product ideas could be encouraged. The company and clients could co-invest. (4) Time was of the essence and the company needed to create an innovation fund. The members in charge of the fund could create value for company products attract investments manage the fund receive proposals decide on investment decisions and provide support and funding to the ventures that they would incubate. “Now is the time to take a big leap and we would like to increase our revenues 10 times within three years” he said.The leadership team knew innovation—sales and R&D were going to be their main engines. But how would they really go about taking the big leap? What should be the next priority? Who would fund their expansion plans and how would they ensure sufficient cash flows? Should they diversify now or focus on the current business and grow it further before taking the big leap? What should they do with the offering mix i.e. how much product and how much service? These were some of the questions for which Sekhon was seeking answers.

A few days earlier she had sat in the boardroom with Neil Johnson chief executive officer (CEO) of Duke Royalty (Duke) and J. David Campbell a founding partner of OW’s Life Sciences practice. Prominently displayed on the boardroom table at that time was the pitch book for Temarca Group (Temarca)—the first potential investment of the newly-formed partnership. The previous week the European riverboat company had approached Duke seeking €9.0 million to expand its riverboat fleet. If a financing decision was made Temarca would be one of the first investments in Duke’s portfolio. Ensuring that this investment was aligned with Duke’s investment mandate met the financial criteria and delivered the targeted returns would be essential to please keystone investors. Similarly Horrocks knew this deal would be highly scrutinized by the OW partners because Temarca would be OW’s first fully-financed deal with Duke. With all this in mind Horrocks’ task was to make a preliminary recommendation to Johnson and Campbell about the soundness of this opportunity.ROYALTY FINANCINGRoyalty financing was a sizeable well-established and successful segment of the financial markets in North America and had delivered excellent returns for investors. Under the terms of this type of financing capital was provided to an investee company in return for a royalty stream (i.e. percentage of revenues) over a long-term period (i.e. 15 to 30 years). The investee company received the capital immediately while the investor earned a pre-tax return (typically 12–15 per cent per year) from the royalty stream paid out of the company’s free cash flow.. For growth-oriented private companies with predictable cash flows royalty financing represented an excellent alternative non-dilutive financing solution in comparison to either bank debt or private equity.Royalty investing was considered a passive investment where investors would have little to no management control and no equity stake. In addition to preserving the equity ownership for existing investors and company founders this structure also allowed well-performing companies and their management teams to continue to make autonomous decisions given their experience and expertise. As a result an investor such as Duke was exposed to the risk that over the 15- to 30-year investment period management teams would be replaced and new teams might make decisions that were not in the best interests of the investor.Royalty capital represented an intermediate risk–reward structure as compared to traditional debt and equity financing. Unlike fixed debt payments which required principal and interest payments royalty payments were structured to fluctuate proportionally with revenues. As a result variable royalty payments were typically higher risk than fixed debt payments with no guarantees of payback. Private equity and venture capital investors typically invested in a company’s future potential by taking an equity stake in an organization in return for capital. Royalty investors on the other hand recouped their investment over time and did not need to rely on exit opportunities (such as a sale of shares) to generate returns. Royalty investors usually held long-term assets as security against their debt.OLIVER WYMAN & DUKE ROYALTYDuke and OW had recently entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement to source provide due diligence and finance royalty investments. This unique partnership between a consulting firm and fund was the first of its kind and both parties were eager to make an initial investment. Duke was the first listed diversified royalty company in the U.K. market with the objective of building a diversified portfolio of royalty partners across various economic sectors. Duke’s CEO Johnson had spent a decade on Bay Street and in London and had seen the potential in the U.K. royalties market. Using his industry experience he created a tax-advantaged investment structure providing his fund with a lower cost of capital and a competitive advantage. Further the U.K. domicile gave Europeans their first chance to participate in this lower risk higher yield financing model. Johnson had set Duke’s target pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) benchmark at 15 per cent.OW was a leading global management consulting firm with offices in over 50 cities across 26 countries and 35 years of consulting experience. The firm’s management committee had begun to seek new high- value business models in an attempt to diversify its revenue stream. With OW’s growing global footprint and deep industry knowledge the potential business of deal sourcing and diligence offered the firm the opportunity to diversify its revenues as well as earn higher returns. Partnering with Duke had the added benefit to OW of benefiting from Duke’s expertise in raising capital and negotiations.Within the framework of the collaboration OW assisted Duke in identifying and performing due diligence on potential investments. The blended investment committee then played the integral role of advising Duke in making the final investment decision using specific investment criteria developed jointly by Duke and OW (see Exhibit 1). Horrocks understood that each of these criteria would be critical to consider in making her recommendation to Johnson and Campbell. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK Economic OverviewFollowing the meeting Horrocks researched and accumulated information on the European economy the travel and tourism sector and the cruise industry. The European economy had entered its fifth year of financial recovery and was expected to continue growing at a steady pace for the next couple of years. The European Commission expected European Union (EU) gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.8 per cent in 2018; however these figures lagged behind global growth rates of 3.7 per cent and 3.9 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively.Over the past six decades tourism had grown and diversified to become one of the largest and fastest growing economic sectors in the world. This trend was expected to continue as the sector’s direct contribution to the European GDP was expected to grow at an average of 3.9 per cent annually over the next 10 years. By 2027 travel and tourism was expected to account for 11.4 per cent of global GDP and to outperform the global economy over the next 10 years. Within the EU the direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP in 2015 was €629.8 billion (3.5 per cent of GDP). This was forecasted to rise by 2.9 per cent to €647.8 billion in 2016.A rise in terrorist attacks across Europe over the past few years had had an impact on well-known travel destinations including cities in France the United Kingdom Germany and Turkey. The impacts of terrorist attacks were predominantly regional but were significantly damaging to local businesses (e.g. occupancy rates at Paris hotels fell by 25 per cent immediately following the Paris attacks in 2016). The economic impact of terrorism on this sector was shown to sometimes be significant and immediate but it was typically not permanent. It took on average about 13 months for tourism to recover from a terrorist attack. Nevertheless Horrocks was concerned that a potential attack would have a severe impact on a family business like Temarca and on its ability to pay royalties to Duke. Global Cruise Industry The cruise industry was currently one of the fastest-growing categories in the leisure travel market. Since 1980 the industry had experienced an average annual passenger growth rate of approximately 7 per cent. The global cruise industry had grown significantly over the past 10 years and consisted of approximately 300 ships. Worldwide the international cruise industry had an annual passenger compound growth rate of 4.8 per cent from 2005−2015. To meet demand between 2015 and 2020 55 new ships (22 river cruisers) would join the global fleet—an investment in new vessels of more than US$25 billion.River cruises offered an experience completely unlike ocean cruises. Ocean cruises promoted glitz glam and onboard amenities whereas river cruises were focused on helping passengers slow down enjoy the scenery and learn about the local history culture and cuisine (see Exhibit 2). Unsurprisingly Europe was the most popular destination for river cruises given the location of the Rhine the Danube and the Seine. Those waterways which bustled with commercial and leisure traffic were the arteries that connected clusters of countries offering a variety of experiences to river cruisers. Cruise passengers were typically about 50 years old with river-cruise passengers being more than 10 years older than ocean cruise passengers. The river-cruise passenger demographics looked promising considering the aging of the baby boom cohort as 42 per cent of the U.S. population and 51 per cent of the EU population were expected to be over 4+ by 2030.Over the past decade river cruising had transformed itself from a mass of small family-run businesses with ageing vessels into a collection of professionally operated enterprises whose managers often had years of experience in the ocean-cruise industry. From 2009–2013 river cruising in Europe had grown at an annual rate of 11–14 per cent versus 4–5 per cent for ocean cruising. This growth was attributed to a greater awareness of river cruises’ unique experiences a growing retired demographic with higher disposable incomes and an increased quality of service and onboard amenities that could compete with those of traditional ocean cruises. These companies had invested in new ships and modernized existing fleets. Luxury riverboats although much smaller than ocean cruisers were now fitted with some of the same amenities—luxurious accommodations a choice of several dining rooms swimming pools exercise areas cinemas and balconies. TEMARCA SIJFA CRUISESMilan Visser and Lotte Visser established Temarca in 1997 with the purchase of their first vessel Calypso offering river cruises along the Rhine and Danube rivers under the brand name SijFa Cruises. The company remained a small family-owned organization operating in the Netherlands and the couple maintained full control of their business. In recent years the Vissers had relinquished their on-boat responsibilities to other managers in the organization and spent most of their time in the head office in Nijmegen Netherlands. Operating under its trade name SijFa Cruises Temarca offered multi-day riverboat cruises on Europe’s most popular rivers including the Rhine and the Danube (see Exhibit 3). The company employed a unique business strategy purchasing second-hand boats and refurbishing them at a fraction of the cost of a new boat (approximately an 80- to 90-per-cent saving). Late in 2016 Temarca contracted to sell one vessel and purchase two second-hand vessels—the MS Neptune and the MS Bellefleur. These vessels required substantial renovations to be ready for the sailing season. Both of these ships were 114 metres long with a capacity of 115 passengers each. Including the Rigoletto the purchase brought Temarca’s total fleet up to three ships which were valued together at €14 million once the two new vessels were fully refurbished.Temarca also had a unique selling process. Instead of focusing on a direct-to-consumer model Temarca sold its cruises through 27 international travel agencies with the three largest agencies representing almost 60 per cent of 2016’s capacity. The responsibility for finding end consumers was outsourced to the tour operators through which Temarca also outsourced sales and marketing. As was typical in the industry travel agencies tended to buy capacity one year in advance so sales of the year ahead were known on January 1 of that year. Travel agencies paid Temarca 20 per cent of the revenue within one month of booking and the balance one month prior to sailing. Temarca’s 2016 season was fully booked and the company was actively selling out 2017 and 2018 capacity. Horrocks noticed that Temarca relied heavily on these tour operators and knew that losing a key client could severely impact its ability to sail its vessels at full capacity.Temarca’s travel operators and agency partners sold SijFa Cruises to European couples aged 50 and over and most of the passengers and crew were Dutch or German. SijFa Cruises operated in a niche space of the cruise industry; the 4-out-of-5 star service offering at an average cost of €250 per night was still a crowded space (see Exhibit 4). As she studied Temarca’s business model Horrocks wondered if the company had a differentiated enough service offering to continue to thrive in a seemingly competitive market. Each boat was operated by four key employees: a hotel manager a captain a head chef and a maître-d’ who were all responsible for ensuring the guests had a great on-boat experience. At head office the Vissers were supported by a team of seven part-time employees who were all responsible for key aspects of the business. The Vissers were childless but had a niece Anna whom they had appointed the sole beneficiary of the business. Anna was in her late 20s and completing a masters in Renaissance literature. She had started to become more involved in the business and envisioned eventually taking over the business. Temarca had shown strong consistent financials over the past five years (see Exhibit 5). It had grown revenues with new ship acquisitions but had kept selling general and administrative costs low at about 1 per cent of revenue. Both Campbell and Johnson however had indicated their concern to Horrocks regarding the high levels of debt on Temarca’s balance sheet. Though they knew the cruise industry was a high fixed-asset business they wondered if the levels of debt were justified or if this company was too highly leveraged for Duke. Horrocks knew she would need to consider the financial health of the business both pre- and post-capital investment given Temarca’s expected use of proceeds. PROJECTING NEEDSThe Vissers had a three-pronged plan for the €9-million investment from Duke. First they planned to use €3.6 million to repay part of the company’s long- and short-term debt including all of the secured loans as well as the bank overdraft and accounts payable. Temarca still planned to maintain €1 million of unsecured debt from one of its largest customers. The company also planned to use the capital to finance the purchase agreement for the new Neptune boat for a total of €3.7 million. In addition to the Neptune purchase Temarca needed to significantly refurbish the boat which was quoted at €880000. The company had also entered into a rent-to-own purchase agreement for the Bellefleur with the Bellefleur requiring the same amount of refurbishment. Temarca planned to pay for the Bellefleur’s renovation from its cash flow from operations. Finally the remaining €820000 in cash from Duke’s investment would be maintained for working capital needs. Expansion Plans Temarca’s sole revenue stream was the income generated from each passenger per sailing day. Given the seasonality of the waterways Temarca estimated that it would have 165 sailing days per year. The company assumed its capacity would be sold through travel agents or operators and that the agents would take a 30-per-cent commission. The Neptune was estimated to sail at 75-per-cent capacity in 2017; 85 per cent in 2018; and maximum capacity at 90 per cent in 2019. The Bellefleur was estimated to generate 80 per cent of revenue generated by the Neptune. Rigoletto already at maximum capacity was estimated to generate sales of €2.2 million net of commission in 2017. The revenue generated by the three ships was forecasted to grow at 3 per cent per year from 2020 until maximum capacity was reached in 2025 and then grow at 2 per cent per year until the end of the investment period. Unlike a hotel where labour was the largest variable expense and entire floors could be taken out of service when demand was low a cruise ship had little ability to reduce variable costs. Before a ship sailed almost all ship-related costs were fixed (fuel staffing and docking fees). Passenger-related costs (food and excursion fees) could potentially vary with the number of passengers sailing; however the cruise industry was known for last-minute sailors and thus the Vissers’ strategy was to plan for the cost of full occupancy on each of the company’s vessels. Temarca classified these two types of costs as their cost of sales. Shipping costs were estimated to be €120 per sailing day per ship. Passenger costs were estimated on a per passenger per-sailing-day basis and varied by ship. By 2017 these costs were expected to be €60 for the Neptune €55 for the Bellefleur and €50 for the Rigoletto. Both passenger and shipping costs were projected to increase by 1.3 per cent per year. All other operating costs were estimated to be €1.2 million in 2017 and to grow at 1.5 per cent per year. To forecast the difference between earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and free cash flow Horrocks estimated that the expected increase in working capital requirements as well as the maintenance capital expenditures required for each vessel annually would be proportionate to the year-over-year revenue growth. Each vessel’s annual maintenance costs to replace items such as damaged furniture or purchase new engine parts were typically 3 per cent of sales growth net of travel agency commission. General working capital requirements had also historically been proportional to sales typically representing 5 per cent of total revenue growth net of travel agency commission. Duke’s proposed financing conditions required Temarca to pay an initial royalty of €110000 monthly in 2017. Future royalty payments in 2018 and beyond would then increase or decrease in proportion to the percentage change in total revenue compared to the prior year. That is if total revenues increased by 5 per cent the royalty payment would also increase by 5 per cent of the previous year’s amount. However Duke also agreed it would not increase the total royalty payment by more than 6 per cent a year. Horrocks knew that Duke liked to assess management’s capabilities by reviewing past decisions. She realized that she had the revenues and cost estimates related to the purchase of the Neptune so she could double-check the logic behind this investment. Her tax colleague told her that the new vessel qualified for a capital cost allowance rate of 15 per cent. Her own review of the income statement indicated a 25 per cent tax rate for the company. She assumed a modest 14 per cent rate of return would be used by Temarca for assessing long term investments. She also assumed that the purchase of one additional vessel would not significantly impact other operating costs.DECISIONHorrocks knew that Duke was considering a €9-million investment on January 1 2017 with an expected investment term of 15 years and a targeted IRR of 15 per cent. She also knew that Duke would hold Temarca’s three vessels as security but it was well documented within the ocean-liner cruise segment that it was extremely difficult to sell ships second-hand—especially within a consolidated market. Ships often sat for more than two years in a weak market with no interest before being sold. On the other hand she also knew that there was a growing river-cruise market in Asia and Africa; however shipping vessels to different locations was extremely costly.The investment committee was looking not only to hit financial targets but also to ensure it would be a strong qualitative fit with the committee’s mandate and criteria. Therefore Horrocks knew it was critical to consider the mechanics of the industry and the important levers of Temarca’s business. Given the strong growth in this sector the number of river-cruise vessels on the riverways was also growing. Securing docking ports was becoming increasingly competitive. In addition certain European countries were petitioning to regulate the number of boats allowed on the waterways at one time. Given that Temarca was one of the smaller players in the industry it was not unforeseeable to imagine that these new regulations could result in losing 30 days of sailing per year. Horrocks was also somewhat concerned about the 15-year investment horizon. Because Duke had little control over the daily business circumstances could result in Duke having only a 10-year horizon.Horrocks knew that the management committee would make a decision based on its strict investment criteria and in particular focus on ensuring that the investee’s free cash flow was at least two times greater than the royalty payment. In addition the committee wanted to evaluate the risks of the business and how Duke could structure the deal to mitigate any of the aforementioned risks. Horrocks needed to lay out these risks and mitigations in her recommendation and be able to defend her answers. She had to decide at least in the first round of discussions whether Duke should invest in Temarca or let this opportunity sink.Exhibit 1: Duke Royalty’s Investment CriteriaNote: *Duke based the company’s ability to meet its royalty obligations on this ratio; that ratio was a critical element in evaluating an investment opportunity.Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: Comparison between Ocean Liners and River CruisesSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Rhine and Danube DestinationsSource: Company files.Exhibit 4: Competitive Landscape Price versus Star RankingExhibit 5: temarca Financial Statements (Year ended December 31)Income StatementNote: € = EUR = euro; € .906 = US$1 on November 1 2016Source: Company files.Exhibit 5 (Continued)Balance SheetNote: € = EUR = euro; € .906 = US$1 on November 1 2016Source: Company files.",1,WHITE,,WOMAN,

Chloe had joined Sorel in May 2017 after graduating with an MBA degree and was starting to wonder if she should have taken a position with a different company. The email from Rodrigo contained the following:The results for the second quarter just came in and the performance of the underwriting group has continued to decline. Compared to Q3 [third quarter] last year our market share has dropped 15 per cent policy completion time has increased by seven days and we processed about 2500 fewer applications. We are getting complaints from agents about our poor turnaround time. Something has to be done about this situation; otherwise some of us will be looking for a new job.Ever since we installed the new system last year you have been concerned about our staffing levels in the underwriting department but when I look at the numbers we have more than enough people. If anything you might be overstaffed in some areas. I want to meet on Friday at 9:00 am to discuss the situation. We need a solution so come to the meeting with specific suggestions.After reading Rodrigo’s email Chloe reviewed the operating results for the second quarter of 2018 (see Exhibit 1) wondering what recommendations she could provide in the meeting at the end of the week.CANADIAN LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRYMore than 22 million Canadians owned some form of life insurance in 2017 paying approximately $21.4 billion in premiums. Although most people purchased life insurance to provide financial protection for their family in the event of premature death life insurance was also used as an investment vehicle for estate and retirement planning purposes among others. A wide variety of life insurance products was available to meet the needs of all consumers. Generally however life insurance fell under three broad categories: term permanent and whole life insurance.Life insurance was usually bought on an individual basis through an agent or advisor who helped clients select the appropriate product based on their needs and financial circumstances. Agents and advisors typically had a relationship with several insurance companies which helped them compare coverage and premium options for clients. Insurance companies paid a commission to the agent or advisor when a client purchased a life insurance policy.Sorel was a mid-sized insurance company headquartered in Montreal Quebec. Its main product was universal life policies a form of whole life insurance where the customer selected investment options and the insurer assumed risk related to death. Sorel relied on a network of more than 10000 independent insurance agents and advisors across the country for sales.The company categorized applications as simple or complex. Generally simple policies provided basic coverage with a total value of $500000 or less. In contrast complex policies had a value greater than $500000 with an average of approximately $10 million. Clients who purchased complex policies were usually high-net-worth individuals who used these products as part of a strategy for estate and retirement planning. The features of complex policies were customized to the individual needs of the client. Although complex policies represented less than 10 per cent of total volume they accounted for more than 40 per cent of total revenues.UNDERWRITING PROCESSThe process of insuring a risk which included assessment and pricing was the responsibility of the underwriting department. Applications were received either through an online submission or on paper. Paper submissions accounted for approximately 60 per cent of all applications. They were usually scanned and sent via email by the insurance agent or advisor to Sorel where the information was manually entered into the system. Conversely the information submitted through online applications did not require data entry.Rule engine software screened all applications before they were sent to the initial review stage. Generally 5 per cent of simple applications were declined by the rule engine software whereas complex applications were almost always sent for an initial review. At the initial review stage an assessment was made for medical tests required to underwrite the policy which could include blood urine vitals or electrocardiography tests. In some situations statements from the client’s physician could also be requested. Collection of the data was outsourced to a national health care services firm who provided a turnaround time of 15 working days. In some cases clients did not make arrangements for medical tests and these applications were withdrawn from the process. Approximately 90 per cent of clients submitted medical tests for simple policy applications compared to 95 per cent for complex policy applications.Underwriters were responsible for evaluating and pricing the risk using the information provided by the client on the application and the results from the medical tests. In early 2017 Sorel installed a new information system to improve the speed and quality of the underwriting process. The new system used artificial intelligence technology to automate the process and standardize the decision-making process. Ultimately underwriters decided whether to accept the risk and how it should be priced. Applications that were deemed too risky were declined whereas accepted applications proceeded to be printed and mailed to the insurance agent or advisor. About 80 per cent of simple applications were accepted by the underwriting department and were then printed and mailed compared to 50 per cent of complex applications. The company tracked three factors to measure the performance of the underwriting process. The first factor was average number of business days for completion. This measurement tracked the average amount of time required from receipt of an application to mailing out to the agent. The second factor was the placement ratio. This measurement tracked the number of policies accepted by clients as a percentage of the total number of policies printed and mailed. The third factor was overall market share for new policies. This measurement represented sales in dollars of Sorel’s new policies as a percentage of total industry sales of new policies in the universal life segment. Completion time placement ratio and market share data were compiled by quarter (see Exhibit 1).EVALUATING RECENT PERFORMANCEThe underwriting department’s total number of staff positions was 33.5. The department’s employees worked from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute breaks (see Exhibit 2). Employees were categorized as either junior or senior. Junior staff had less than five years of total experience in the underwriting department and were usually responsible for clerical tasks such as data entry and printing and mailing or for initial review and underwriting of simple applications. Senior staff were responsible for handling initial review and underwriting for complex applications. Not including benefits junior staff in data entry and printing and mailing were paid $45000 per year. Junior staff in the initial review area received an annual salary of $50000 and senior staff were paid $55000. Junior underwriters were paid a salary of $60000 while senior underwriters were paid $70000.After the new information system was added in 2017 Rodrigo implemented a strategic plan to reduce the total number of staff positions in the underwriting department by approximately 20 per cent. The strategic plan affected mainly senior employees who were offered early retirement packages. To evaluate the productivity benefits of the new system Chloe had recently completed a study of average processing times for each activity in the underwriting department (see Exhibit 3). Her conclusion from the study was that gains in productivity were close to the expectations when the system was implemented.However despite the apparent improvements in productivity the performance of the underwriting department was declining. The backlog of applications had grown average processing times had increased and both placement ratio and market share were in steady decline. As Chloe looked at the information at departmental performance for the last four quarters she wondered what if anything she could recommend to Rodrigo in Friday’s meeting to help improve the situation.Exhibit 1: Quarterly Data for Applications Volumes Completion Times Placement Ratio and Market ShareNote: Q = quarter; each quarter had 13 weeksSource: Company files.Exhibit 2: Staffing Levels for the Underwriting DepartmentSource: Company files.Exhibit 3: Average Processing rates for the Underwriting Department* Number of applications per hour per personSource: Company files.",1,ASIAN,NORTH AMERICA,WOMAN,

Glassdoor was a crowdsourced-based online review platform where current and previous employees anonymously reviewed companies and their management. The analysis was based on over 100 reviews posted by current and previous employees of CRISIL in the previous year. The reviews reported that CRISIL was a respected brand name in the business of ratings research analytics and infrastructure advisory in India. Most reviews seemed to indicate that CRISIL provided enriching job content immense growth opportunities an excellent work culture and good work–life balance. However many reviews painted a grim picture of the employment experience at CRISIL; for instance some employees perceived CRISIL’s compensation structure as relatively low compared to other entities in the finance and banking sector. A few segments of employees perceived poor work–life balance; some had concerns about the lack of meritocracy in the organization. While CRISIL maintained its top position in the overall Glassdoor ratings its competitors were ahead in areas such as work–life balance and career opportunities (see Exhibit 1). Further middle-level talent would acquire relevant work experience and then leave CRISIL for employment with financial institutions banks and start-ups.CRISIL commenced its operations in 1987 and had the advantage of being the first player in the ratings business in India but with new ratings agencies entering the industry it had started to face competition. Over the last two decades CRISIL had diversified into several other businesses (see Exhibits 2 and 3) and by 2016 it was a global analytical company with US$241.41 million income from operations (see Exhibit 4). Kaura had joined CRISIL in February 2017 after nearly two decades of experience at leading banks and consulting organizations. He wondered how to distinctly and effectively position CRISIL in a dynamic talent market: should CRISIL be competing for talent within the ratings analytics consulting and infrastructure advisory space or should it position itself as a preferred employer among organizations across the banking financial services and insurance sector? Having been assigned the key strategic task of designing a compelling employee value proposition (EVP) for CRISIL Kaura also had to consider what the relevant and unique key facets of the EVP could be that would appeal to current and potential employees.EMPLOYEE VALUE PROPOSITION DEVELOPMENT AT CRISILThe NeedIn mid-2013 CRISIL developed its first EVP and communicated it to various stakeholders. There were three reasons for doing this exercise. First the company had grown exponentially by diversifying its customer base entering new locations adding new offerings and increasing the employee count; it was perceived to be a great employer brand in the ratings business. However it lacked a well-articulated EVP. The objective of CRISIL’s EVP initiative was to identify a holistic employment package for CRISIL’s existing and potential employees. Second although CRISIL was considered a great employer—one providing enriching job content and immense growth opportunities—its pay levels were perceived as below industry standards for medium- and higher-level managers. Employees compared CRISIL’s compensation to not only its peers in the ratings research and analytics business but also investment banks financial institutions and start-ups where they could seek employment at a higher compensation based on the skills and exposure they had acquired at CRISIL. CRISIL’s attrition rate was about 15–18 per cent which was within industry norms (see Exhibit 5). Therefore the purpose of the EVP was to build awareness among existing employees about CRISIL’s strengths thereby emphasizing its brand job content and the work–life balance it offered rather than its compensation. Third mid-level employees believed that CRISIL offered limited growth opportunities within a few domains; for instance if employees wanted to gain experience in the derivatives business they did not have the opportunity at CRISIL to do so and instead had to seek employment with companies such as investment banks which offered exposure in that area. Consequently the intent was to position CRISIL as an umbrella brand that offered a variety of growth opportunities. An eight-member team was set up to develop a strong EVP which could be communicated internally to improve employee engagement and externally to promote CRISIL as a strong employer brand.EVP Themes Emerging from the ResearchThe EVP development team collected data from three main sources—employee engagement surveys exit interviews and focus group discussions—to determine the major facets of the EVP. The team compiled employee engagement survey data for the last five years (see Exhibit 6). The data were analyzed to identify the top employee engagement factors. In addition the EVP team did qualitative analysis of exit interviews and focus group discussions covering more than 400 employees. The focus group discussions involved people from all levels and across functions. The idea was to develop common themes that motivated and engaged all employees. Data analysis generated the following EVP themes: job content work environment CRISIL as a strong brand great leadership team and growth and development opportunities.  Communication of EVP Themes Beginning in June 2013 cascade sessions were organized to communicate the five elements of the EVP. In the cascade sessions each EVP dimension was run for about 30 to 45 days. The cascade sessions covered the EVP development process introduced the EVP themes and organized activity-based learning around each theme. CRISIL Connect CRISIL’s intranet platform was used for all communication related to the cascade sessions. A dedicated segment CRISIL “EDGE” was created to publish employee interviews and share stories leadership views and factoids supporting the various EVP dimensions. For instance in the cascade session promoting the EVP dimension of growth and development the team shared the president’s message leadership highlights employee stories with pictures question-and-answer sessions with employees and a list of all employees promoted in 2012 and 2013. Growth stories of approximately 90 employees were shared in the cascade month. A career fair was organized in the CRISIL cafeteria and all employees were invited. The fair had stalls for each business with senior business leaders and an HR business partner present. These leaders shared information about available opportunities and the relevant skills required for a specific role. The career fair created a unique environment where every business leader was approachable. The intranet was used to post vacancies giving employees the opportunity to find out about various roles available within the company. Similar cascade sessions were organized for other dimensions of the EVP and the activities covered in each were aligned with the relevant EVP element. ResultsThe EVP development team recorded an elevated level of employee involvement in the communication exercise. Out of 3000 employees nearly 1300 participated in the cascade sessions and all business leaders participated in the career fairs. The cascade sessions created awareness about job opportunities available within CRISIL’s divisions and the skills required for various roles. As a result applications to internal job postings increased by 35 per cent in 2015 from previous years. Inter-departmental transfers increased from 7 per cent in 2015 to 15 per cent 2016. The attrition rate decreased from 27 per cent in 2015 to 22 per cent in 2016 and the employee engagement score was at an all-time high over the last 11 years. The entire EVP exercise ended in 2014 and had not been revisited since then. While the effectiveness of the identified EVP drivers and their implementation approach was yet to be established from a long-term perspective Kaura was keen to have a finer understanding of CRISIL’s EVP from the employees’ perspective to enable him to re-imagine the EVP.EMPLOYEE PERCEPTION of RETENTION DRIVERS Employees perceived CRISIL’s major retention drivers to be job profile strong client focus quality of work opportunity to work with talented people work culture supportive team members training opportunities a great deal of flexibility and freedom at work CRISIL as an established brand work environment enormous responsibility in the initial years of one’s career and preferred employment location. Ample and Diverse Opportunities CRISIL provided ample learning opportunities in diverse businesses to employees. A senior manager of Global Research and Analytics Chennai who had been working for CRISIL for the past 10 years highlighted this and shared the following:One reason for stickiness is the kind of opportunities that you get at CRISIL. I feel connected with the growth of the organization even though I may not be part of each business. CRISIL’s diverse businesses provide confidence that you will always have the scope to learn and explore. Once you have spent a reasonable amount of time at a position there is always a scope to learn; it holds me to this organization. The fact that I will always have a chance to learn and do new things is important and I am excited about being part of CRISIL. Another senior manager recollected the initial learning opportunities she was given at CRISIL: I was given the opportunity to lead a team at a very early stint in my career; this has boosted my confidence to a considerable extent. The opportunities which CRISIL has given me at every stage of my career and the trust placed in my capabilities have been the greatest drivers for me as an individual and as a professional.Challenging Work The job profiles at CRISIL provided valuable learning opportunities to its employees irrespective of their level within the organization. A manager who had joined CRISIL in November 2011 recalled “The best thing about this profile [analyst] is that you can talk to the main promoters of the company which you are going to rate. Talking to directors and CEOs [chief executive officers] is a unique experience and you get first-hand information from them. You are not restricted to one industry; you deal with different people across different industries in India.”An employee who joined CRISIL about four years ago also shared his experience: “Work is challenging and it’s a front-end role in which I have to continuously engage with clients. I have a portfolio and a set of clients with whom I repeatedly engage; it has its own set of challenges. It’s about managing expectations of clients and internal expectations here [at CRISIL] also. That is a challenge which keeps me driven.”He added “I like the quality of the work here in terms of the actual work and the work culture. The people who work with me are of high quality which compels me to continuously improve.” Training Opportunities CRISIL provided several training opportunities to newcomers to hone their skills. Employees placed great value on the training opportunities provided by CRISIL; for instance an employee who had joined the company after about four years of experience at a competing organization saidOne thing that stood out was the training I was given at CRISIL. The comprehensive training made it easier for me to fit into the company. My previous employer did not have a formal training program; it was on-the-job training. Here at CRISIL the training program covered all the processes and made me comfortable. For the first one and half months it was mainly about getting to know your work which helped me understand about the company and the work.Rewarding High PerformersCRISIL recognized its employees for their outstanding performance. A senior manager of Rating Large Corporate Group who had about seven years of experience stated “If you do good things you get noticed at [the] higher level and achieve early recognition; that is the uniqueness of CRISIL.” Another employee confirmed the provision of several rewards in CRISIL saying “We have a number of rewards such as monthly rewards quarterly rewards etc. I received a CLAP award in April 2017. If your team or manager or higher authority feels that you did excellent work in a quarter or month you get rewarded.”EMPLOYEE PERCEPTION of ATTRACTION DRIVERS Several drivers made CRISIL attractive in the employment market (see Exhibit 7). According to current employees the major attraction drivers were the strong brand name in the ratings and analytics business exposure to diverse clients and client-facing roles opportunity to work with a diverse range of businesses providing different assignments prospects to work with high quality talent challenging work environment friendly work culture meritocracy and access to senior management. CRISIL believed in “snapping up the good people even if there was no role for them.” In one of his pre-placement talks at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad in 1992 CRISIL’s managing director saidJoin us if you want to learn something. Join us if you want to answer some challenging questions and ask some more of your own. Don’t join us as a stepping stone because you didn’t get a job elsewhere. That way you won’t last long at CRISIL. We will pay a tenth of what the biggies will pay you. Join us with an open mind; this is where you will get a chance to shape the future of India’s financial markets. This is where you will stamp your name in the annals of India’s corporate history. Else don’t join us. CRISIL as a BrandCRISIL had an excellent reputation in the ratings business and was perceived as a strong employer brand by job seekers. An employee recollectedI could see the difference in professionalism at CRISIL [compared to my previous employer]. In my previous company I had no defined role and was given any job which was available. I never liked that. I have an MBA so I expected something better which I never got. Since CRISIL is a brand everyone wants to be here. When I was making a presentation on ratings companies during my MBA I knew that CRISIL was one of the best ratings companies. Since then I felt . . . if I get an opportunity to work here I would be privileged so I joined here. It was a dream job for me.Another employee explained his reasons for joining CRISIL as follows: “I worked for a competing company for four years which gave me a good background of the kind of work at CRISIL. In this industry CRISIL is the best brand name. The processes are much more streamlined and defined here.”Job ProfileCRISIL promised fresh recruits work profiles that would give them diverse exposure and an opportunity to grow quickly in the initial stages of their career. An employee who had a four-year stint at Irevna a subsidiary of CRISIL in Hangzhou China shared the experience of hiring a Chinese graduate:I interviewed a young lady for a health care research role. She had another offer and asked me why she should choose CRISIL. I told her to work with us for a week and if she did not like us she could leave; I would not question her. She joined [and stayed with CRISIL] and said that it was unfortunate that she did not know a company like CRISIL . . . in China.Another employee reflected “CRISIL does not restrict you to just your job. It gives you the freedom to be a part of many other activities along with your job. Every day with new team members you learn new things. I am here for that.”Work CultureEmployees felt that in addition to other things CRISIL’s culture was an important attraction driver. An employee who returned to CRISIL’s Chennai office after a four-year stint at Irevna recollected his rejoining experience: “Overall [the] work environment is friendly and helpful. I just moved back to India after four years. I did not have to take up a formal route and check with HR on every little thing. They are more than willing to help.” He added “I have not been here for long and when I came back I felt as if I am back home. This defines the overall culture in terms of relationships with colleagues which is very friendly and open—not only with people at the same level but also across levels. The management is quite accessible.” Another employee compared CRISIL’s culture with his previous employer by saying “There [at the previous employer] were multiple levels and it was very autocratic. CRISIL is a sea change in terms of culture; you can walk into any senior’s office and have a discussion. This is the major difference that I have found here.” going BEYOND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN EMPLOYEREmployees believed CRISIL went beyond its basic responsibilities as an employer in considering employees’ personal and family needs. An employee emphasized this by recalling an example of a colleague on her team:My colleague’s father suffered a heart attack; he resided in another city. We have a certain limit for our medical insurance and my colleague had exhausted that amount. The HR team extended support by offering funds and arranging for resources at the city where my colleague’s father resided. Not all organizations would go out of the way to do things like this for their employees.A senior manager highlighted the way CRISIL tried to go out of its way for employees: When employees want a location change we have always tried our best to facilitate that. A person may have to wait for some time for this to materialize but as an organization we are always open to facilitating that. In fact when my wife was pregnant I was based in Chennai and I requested for a transfer to the Mumbai office for four months so that I could make frequent trips to my hometown [Indore] to take care of her. CRISIL facilitated that promptly.AREAS OF CONCERNCompensationEmployees perceived that CRISIL’s compensation was below industry standards which could have been one of the reasons for employee attrition. In July 2017 the average age of employees at CRISIL was 30.6 years. Young people comprised a sizable chunk of the total employee strength of about 4000 employees and their expectations were diverse. One employee sharedI feel that opportunities have opened up in the last couple of years. The mindset of [the] new generation is different. After a year or two if employees feel that their compensation is not at par with their peers they do not think twice about quitting their job. This generation does not think too much about career; compensation is an important driver. We should have a system where we consider the current generation’s expectations. I believe that perhaps CRISIL is not the highest pay master; if the pay is an important criterion for youngsters to stay then something needs to be done about this. While employees were not actively looking for opportunities outside CRISIL some employees were tempted to accept any offer with higher pay from other organizations (see Exhibit 8). In a few divisions the attrition rate ranged between 20 and 24 per cent which was considered high. CRISIL’s initial philosophy about compensation was best captured in the following statement from pre-placement talks at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad:Our philosophy is that if the employer gives you one cup of tea you should generate four cups of tea for the employer. One cup of tea is paid as tax. The second cup of tea is given to the promoters or shareholders as dividend. The third cup of tea is reserves. The fourth cup is given back to you as reward. If you generate five cups of tea you will get that fifth cup as extra reward. As long as you can produce four cups of tea for your employer you will never find it difficult to maintain your job. That’s CRISIL. That’s our philosophy. Performance AppraisalsCRISIL took the appraisal process seriously and established an appraisal system it deemed to be rigorous fair objective and transparent. However employees had mixed opinions about it. For example one employee said Appraisal is always tricky. You cannot rate everyone at the same level. You will always have some people who feel they are underrated. I think that it is natural during the appraisal process. But over the years we have tried to make it as transparent and mathematical as possible. It’s very structured. For example X percentage of weight is assigned to client feedback Y percentage of weight is assigned to managerial feedback and Z percentage to self-assessment. And if someone has gone beyond what was expected of him that also gets rewarded.A senior manager explained the appraisal system as follows: We have a bell curve and we try to fit employees on the rating scale of 1 to 4 [4 being the highest]. Most employees fall into a medium category [i.e. 2] and the differentiation between categories 2 and 3 is extremely high. There are lots of employees in category 2 who are closer to category 3 but end up being in category 2 because they need to be fitted into the distribution curve which is demotivating to employees. The difference between somebody who does . . . average work and somebody who does more than what is expected is very minimal.Uniformity in Employment Experience across Locations CRISIL strived to achieve consistency in its operating style in different locations. However the employment experience varied across various locations as pointed out by one employee: Here [in Chennai] we do not have a dedicated HR. The onboarding experience which is carried out by junior executives does not provide the needed connect with [the] HR team as they are not physically present here. Newcomers do not feel welcome. The onboarding experience is more like a form filling exercise. A wider HR connect on the day of onboarding is required especially because the kind of people we get are changing these days. Our recruits are very young and fresh out of college and have a lot of expectations seeing onboarding at IT [information technology] companies such as TCS [Tata Consultancy Services Limited] and Infosys [Infosys Limited]. But this problem may be Chennai centre-specific.THE PRESENTWith a view to ensure the needed impetus on the people agenda Kaura and his team along with business heads had embarked on specific talent and people initiatives. These included a stepped-up focus on ongoing employee engagement and communication initiatives by leaders and middle managers; HR business partners with key talent and high performers; focused leadership development for emerging leaders (about 350 middle to senior managers); rolling out boot camps for specific skill-building in multiple businesses and other training programs for employees in international locations; and a stepped-up focus on campus engagement and the selection process with emphasis on pre-placement offers and on leveraging digital (mobile application (app)) channels for junior hires—an engaging employee well-being app and an online marketplace app hosting exciting deals and discounts. Both apps had high usage and served as good engagement levers. The company had recently switched to a simpler and scalable employee engagement survey tool that supported sharper analytics and decision-making capabilities. The company was also evaluating the implementation over the next few months of a more intuitive modern interactive intranet. Initiatives to promote instant recognition and grant quarterly awards were being steered with greater precision. In 2017 CRISIL was shortlisted by an external body as one of the top 20 employers for female employees an improvement from its 68th position the previous year in the same study. Gender statistics at the middle levels had seen a healthy uptick over the past two years. Also in early 2017 the company rolled out a few employee policies such as sabbaticals flexible working hours and paternity leave.THE WAY AHEADTwo important questions required immediate attention by Kaura and his HR team. The first was how to position CRISIL as an employer in the competitive talent market—should it be competing for talent within the ratings analytics consulting and advisory industry or should it position itself as a preferred employer competing with organizations across industries? A bigger challenge was addressing the competition posed by employers outside the ratings and analytics business such as banking and financial institutions and modern start-ups. Second what could be a compelling EVP for CRISIL that would resonate with both current employees and prospective employees? Sub-questions followed from this question including whether the themes that had emerged from the earlier EVP development exercise truly represented the current EVP and whether they were sufficiently compelling in the current challenging environment and for diverse employee segments. Further how could the company provide a uniform employment experience across different locations? How relevant was the initial compensation philosophy in a war-for-talent scenario not only within the industry but also across industries? Should compensation be a part of the EVP or could some other stronger aspects of CRISIL’s employment experience act as a substitute for compensation? If so what could those aspects be? Lastly what changes would have made earlier EVP communication to current and prospective employees more effective? Such insights would help Kaura in designing a new plan for EVP communication. The above questions needed to be answered before the pre-placement season began in September 2017. Further answering those questions would help Kaura and his team reimagine CRISIL’s employer brand and communicate the same to current and potential employees. With these thoughts in mind Kaura closed the Glassdoor analysis summary report and proceeded to another meeting.EXHIBIT 1: GLASSDOOR RATINGS OF CRISIL AND OTHER AGENCIESNote: The number values in parentheses represent the number of Glassdoor reviews; ratings: 1 = very poor; 5 = very good; ICRA = Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited; SMERA = SMERA Ratings Ltd; CARE = Credit Analysis and Research Ltd; ONICRA = Onida Individual Credit Rating Agency of India	Source: Created by the case authors based on Glassdoor ratings: “Company Reviews: CRISIL” glassdoor accessed August 25 2017 https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/CRISIL-Reviews-E325773.htm#trends-overallRating.EXHIBIT 2: ABOUT CRISILCRISIL India’s first credit rating agency was incorporated on January 29 1987 promoted at that time by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Unit Trust of India Housing Development Finance Corporation and other financial institutions. In 1990 the CRISILCARD Service—providing comprehensive information and analytical opinion on India’s corporate entities—was launched. Despite initial market resistance to the acceptance of credit ratings in 1991 CRISIL began to acquire brand identity with a reputation for analytical rigour and independence. In 1993 CRISIL launched its initial public offering with 2000000 shares sold at a premium of US$0.62 per share which was oversubscribed 2.47 times. In 1996 CRISIL forged a strategic business alliance with global ratings group Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P). Initially S&P had a 9.68 per cent stake in CRISIL; later in 2005 S&P acquired majority control of CRISIL. The alliance with S&P added to CRISIL’s expertise in methodologies and provided exposure to the international rating markets. CRISIL made three main acquisitions to diversify its offerings. In 2000 CRISIL acquired Information Products and Research Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. which strengthened its research business and made it India’s leading provider of integrated research. In 2005 CRISIL acquired Irevna a leading global equity research and analytics company which added equity research to its offerings and in 2012 acquired U.K.-based Coalition Development Ltd. a company providing high-end analytics to global investment banks. In 2011 CRISIL had revenue of US$124.84 million growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 32 per cent over the preceding 10 years. By 2016 CRISIL was a global analytical company providing ratings research risk and policy advisory services with US$241.41 million income from operations a compound annual growth rate of 16 per cent and profit after tax of US$50.87 million.Source: Compiled by case authors based on Hemanth Gorur and Sumit Chowdhury Doing What is Right: The CRISIL Story (Chennai India: Westland Books Ltd 2012): xix; “Our History” CRISIL: An S&P Global Company accessed August 18 2017 https://www.crisil.com/en/home/about-us/our-history.html; “Analytics of Conviction: CRISIL Limited Annual Report 2016” CRISIL: An S&P Global Company accessed August 18 2017 https://www.crisil.com/content/dam/crisil/investors/annual-reports/2016/crisil-ar-2016-interactive.pdf.EXHIBIT 3: CRISIL’S BUSINESSESCRISIL Ratings CRISIL provided services in the range of debt instruments: bank loans certificates of deposit commercial paper non-convertible debentures bank hybrid capital instruments asset and mortgage-backed securities perpetual bonds and partial guarantees.

The company’s performance in the last quarter had been disappointing at best; food sales had grown modestly (2 per cent) but net income was down 14.6 per cent from 2015. In a Toronto Star article headlined “Can Weston Get the Blah out of Loblaw?” the weak results were attributed to Loblaw’s “antique-like” business model. Bay Street (the centre of Toronto’s financial district; also used to refer to Canada’s financial industry) was more forgiving as analysts’ consensus was to designate a “neutral” rating for Loblaw’s stock. However the direction of the company’s future remained unclear and competition in the grocery market was heating up. What should Galen Weston Jr. chairman of Loblaw do to prepare Loblaw for a potential price war in the months ahead? About Loblaw (see Exhibit 1)Loblaw was a subsidiary of George Weston Limited the owner of such food and retail brands as Wonder Bread and Holt Renfrew. Based in Brampton Ontario Loblaw was Canada’s largest food retailer with annual revenues of CA$45 billion in 591 corporate stores and 525 franchised stores across Canada (see Exhibit 2). Apart from its flagship Loblaws Great Foods stores Loblaw managed the Real Canadian Superstore (large format supermarket) No Frills (discount supermarket) and T & T Supermarket (ethnic supermarket) among other banners. Further in 2013 the company acquired Shoppers Drug Mart’s (Shoppers) 1242 drugstores for $12.4 billion beginning Loblaw’s foray into the pharmaceutical industry. Humble beginningsTheodore Loblaw opened the first Loblaw groceterias (self-serve grocery store) in Toronto in 1919. Predicated on a “cash-and-carry” concept Loblaw was a venue for buying quality products in bulk at low prices. Shortly after the company expanded to 70 stores in Ontario and ventured south of the border to New York and Illinois. Loblaw’s fast-paced growth encouraged W. Garfield Weston president of George Weston Limited to invest heavily in the company during its early years. By the 1950s the Weston family held a controlling stake in Loblaw.After decades of prosperity a turn of events left the company nearly bankrupt in 1971. Galen Weston Sr. the grandson of George Weston founder of George Weston Limited scaled back Loblaw’s growth and streamlined operations through a multi-tiered strategy that involved (1) cutting 100 underperforming stores (out of 200 total stores); (2) hiring marketing expert Dave Nichol as president; (3) divesting non-core assets; (4) remodelling storefronts; (5) investing aggressively in advertising (Star Trek actor William Shatner appeared in the 1978 advertisements); and (6) diverting the company’s focus away from the U.S. market. Another key initiative was the introduction in March 1978 of the “no name” brand a line of basic household products that were steeply discounted by 10 to 40 per cent relative to market prices and that quickly became popular among price-sensitive consumers. Months later No Frills Loblaw’s deep discount outlet was born. By 1980 Loblaw had returned to profitability and five years later it stood as Canada’s grocery market leader. In the following decade Loblaw’s private label President’s Choice (PC) was available in 1200 stores in 34 U.S. states. Loblaw even supplied products for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (Walmart) under the name Sam’s Choice before the latter grew its Canadian presence and the relationship deteriorated as the two became competitors. In 2006 Loblaw faced yet another storm when its Loblaws stores posted a $219 million loss. The Weston family’s leadership was instrumental in remedying the company’s ills. The family overhauled Loblaws’ organizational structure and distribution systems and the stores quickly recovered. On September 14 2016 Weston Jr. ascended to the role of Loblaw’s president marking the fourth generation of Weston leadership at the company.“Dear please pick up some milk and a mortgage”The development of PC formed a key advantage for Loblaw in that PC allowed the company to diversify its offerings and therefore its user base. While the no name brand spoke to price-sensitive consumers PC was designed for Canadians at the upper echelons of the income spectrum. The private label first emerged in 1984 after Nichol then president introduced “President’s Blend Gourmet Coffee” to Loblaw’s shelves and was inspired to start a control label following the coffee’s unexpected success. Nichol leveraged his marketing background to showcase PC products through a magazine called the Insider’s Report in which he shared his personal experiences with and endorsements for PC products. The Insider’s Report was widely purchased among Loblaw’s customers likely because its informal anecdotal advertising format made the PC brand relatable and desirable in the eyes of consumers. Long after Nichol’s departure in 1990 PC managed to retain its reputation for being a relatable and down-to-earth brand. Weston Jr. himself regularly made appearances in its commercials to promote PC’s products; the best known was The Decadent a chocolate cookie that outsold all Canadian rivals within three years of its 1988 release.The PC name was eventually tied to Loblaw’s attempts to penetrate new niche markets including but not limited to organic products baby food and banking/insurance services. These diverse services sought to serve the vibrant Canadian population which was characterized by rising household incomes. In 2006 Loblaw distinguished itself by unveiling a feature on the PC website (presidentschoice.ca) that allowed consumers to rate and review products enabling feedback generation for both improving existing products and developing new ones. This move established the company as one of the first major grocery brands to integrate consumer-generated content into its website and signified Loblaw’s continued commitment to adopting a consumer-centric orientation.As part of its later ventures into the digital arena Loblaw decided to leverage the popularity of its PC brand to launch the PC Plus loyalty program in 44 stores in May 2013. At its core PC Plus was a mobile rewards system that offered customized deals to shoppers on a weekly basis by analyzing patterns in their buying habits. The year also marked the announcement of the Shoppers acquisition through which Loblaw inherited the Shoppers Optimum loyalty program which had managed to reach one in every three Canadians since its debut in 2000. By November 2013 the PC Plus program was rolled out nationwide. Within nine months of its introduction PC Plus had recorded a total of 6 million members and several hundred million dollars of revenue.Trouble at the top of the food chain Although Loblaw’s 30.1 per cent market share in mid-2016 was a comfortable four points higher than the market share of the next leading competitor food retailer Sobeys Inc. (Sobeys) recent market trends were not promising. In the 18 months leading up to May 2016 food inflation was above 3 per cent and the adverse effects of this on fresh produce were particularly strong. Retailers’ efforts to protect margins contributed to astronomical price increases on the shelf (notably a price of $10 per head for cauliflower). Weston Jr. assured consumers that inflationary pressures would soon desist yet market researchers claimed otherwise. Although July 2016 saw inflation soften to 1.3 per cent IBISWorld’s predictions set 2017 inflation to exceed 1.9 per cent 30 basis points higher than the projected increase in total grocery revenue in Canada. In comparison the country’s gross domestic product was expected to increase at 1.1 per cent with 85 per cent of growth attributable to the provinces of Ontario Québec British Columbia and Alberta. Although the public sector was often the beneficiary of support from Canada’s Liberal government in such circumstances the same could not be said of the private retail sector. Growing consumer frustration eventually prompted Weston Jr. to announce on July 6 2016 that Loblaw would “reject any future cost increases from suppliers” except those related to higher input costs and would apply a 1.45 per cent cost decrease to shipments from September onward. A spokesperson mentioned that the move was not meant to be adversarial but rather was intended to encourage suppliers to share the inflationary burden. Other parties begged to differ pointing to 2014 when Loblaw was under investigation by the Competition Bureau for 12 files related to its treatment of suppliers. Loblaw’s troubles revealed the complex realities of the grocery business. On the one hand supermarkets knew that fresh produce household products and other related items fulfilled fundamental consumer needs thereby ensuring a steady stream of customers independent of economic conditions. On the other hand Loblaw recognized that Canadians would only buy so many vegetables or paper towels. Further Loblaw was hard-pressed to convince a consumer that its standard berries or apples were any sweeter or fresher than those of a low-cost competitor.The Superpowers of the Supermarket INDUSTRYTraditionally the Canadian grocery market was dominated by Loblaw (30.1 per cent) alongside key rivals Sobeys (26.1 per cent) and Metro Inc. (Metro) (10.6 per cent). Sobeys (see Exhibit 3)A subsidiary of Empire Company Limited—which also owned Foodland FreshCo and IGA—Sobeys was a Nova Scotia-based grocer with 125000 employees 1500 corporate/franchise-owned stores and approximately $22 billion in annual revenues. Pharmacies liquor stores and gas stations also belonged to Sobeys’ broader offering although in its earliest years Sobeys operated solely as a meat delivery business serving the approximately 1750 residents of Stellarton Nova Scotia. In fact it was not until 1947 that the company made its formal entry into food distribution with the opening of its first branded supermarket. Forty years later in 1987 Sobeys claimed $1 billion in sales and established its first location outside of Atlantic Canada in Guelph Ontario.In 2013 Sobeys announced its intention to acquire the 223 stores of its competitor Safeway Inc. (Safeway) which left Sobeys poised to become the market leader in Alberta—one of the largest markets outside of Ontario or Québec. Upon this announcement the Competition Bureau demanded that Sobeys divest 23 of its stores; otherwise the transaction could have been barred for being anti-competitive. Widely criticized as a move that damaged the brands of both parties Sobeys’ takeover caused a substantial disruption to Safeway’s supply chain which remained largely uncorrected even in 2016 three years after the transaction. In a detailed review of the acquisition published in July 2016 the Calgary Herald emphasized disgruntled customers’ experiences with advertised but out-of-stock items and consistently higher prices at several Safeway locations. The former pain point may have been tied to Sobeys’ decision to shift Safeway toward Sobeys’ own inventory policy which involved stocking items merely three products deep—a stark contrast to Safeway’s pre-existing policy that heavily emphasized inventory replenishment to assure product availability. Also rumoured to have been linked to the takeover was the disbandment of Safeway’s Club Card loyalty initiative allegedly done to align the acquired company with Sobeys’ Air Miles program. Additionally Sobeys replaced Safeway-branded products with those of its own private label to the chagrin of many western Canadian shoppers. At the height of its ensuing financial losses Sobeys reported a shortfall of $2.1 billion as well as write-downs in excess of $2.9 billion which prompted the departure of then chief executive officer Marc Poulin in July 2016. It was uncertain whether Empire Company Limited’s subsequent announcement that it would cut 1300 Sobeys jobs in 2016 and 2017 was driven by the disappointing financial performance. Another possible explanation was that the restructuring would make room for new automated distribution centres in Calgary Alberta and Vaughan Ontario planned for mid-2017. Sobeys’ other maneuvers in the marketplace had arguably met with greater success. For instance the extensive renovations aimed at rebranding its Price Chopper stores which operated under the name FreshCo beginning in 2010; a partnership with renowned chef and healthy eating advocate Jamie Oliver; and the introduction of luxury-format stores in 2013 had all been applauded in the marketplace. Metro (see Exhibit 4)Headquartered in Montreal Québec Metro owned and operated 338 supermarkets and 218 discount retailers in Québec and Ontario under the banners Metro Food Basics Super C and Metro Plus. An estimated 258 drugstores also operated under Metro’s ownership. Prior to becoming a food retailer in its own right Metro was a member of a group of independent retailers that emerged in 1947 to use their collective buying power to compete with major grocery chains. As the youngest of the top three Canadian grocers Metro’s focus was on expanding its fleet of supermarkets. Notably Metro’s discount stores—despite having performed strongly—took a back seat in the grocer’s expansion strategy. Instead Metro’s stores increasingly garnered a reputation for their value-added services including the My Metro mobile application (similar to Loblaw’s PC Plus application) beef aging rooms fish smokers and in-store bistros among other “premium” features. In October 2016 Metro planned to begin testing “My Online Grocery” in Québec which would allow customers to have Metro’s fresh produce meat/poultry prepared meals and other grocery items delivered to their homes or made available for pick-up in-store at a time of their convenience. The service’s key elements arguably mirrored those of Loblaw’s “Click & Collect” program introduced in October 2014 which had been rolled out at approximately 100 locations. The online grocery segment represented less than 1 per cent of sales in the Canadian grocery sector a figure that was expected to rise to 3 per cent by 2018. Although pick-up services had been found to reap higher margins (13.8 per cent) than home deliveries (10.7 per cent) Metro and Loblaw offered both.Metro’s pattern of acquisitions emphasized high-quality premium segments. A primary illustration of such was its acquisition of a majority stake of the bakery chain Première Moisson in 2014 through which Metro expanded its selection of higher-end baked goods. Earlier in 2009 Loblaw had purchased ethnic player T & T Supermarket; two years after Metro followed suit when it bought a 55 per cent position in Québec-based Mediterranean retailer Marché Adonis. The “Big Box” Players Historically the high capital requirements of the supermarket sector deterred prospective competitors even though those who chose to enter the market benefitted from substantial scale economies. In recent years however Loblaw had seen unconventional competitors emerge—namely warehouse clubs such as Costco Wholesale Canada (Costco) and Walmart Canada (Walmart) that competed on price. Marketline for example cited Costco as Loblaw’s primary competitor. Non-traditional players posed a serious threat to Loblaw’s core business not only because competing against them necessitated lowering margins but also because Walmart and Costco had extensive offerings of non-perishable items (e.g. pet products and fixtures). By tapping into the food retail space these players effectively became one-stop shops for consumers who valued convenience and price. Costco and Walmart’s 10 per cent and 7 per cent shares of food sales in the grocery market while small in comparison to Loblaw were concerning. While Loblaw was putting pressure on suppliers to absorb cost increases Walmart and Costco through favourable contracts with suppliers such as General Mills and Kellogg which had been negotiated owing to the retailers’ size and scope had managed to continue to pass down lower prices to consumers. Revenue growth was expected to increase at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent largely owing to the lower prices these warehouse players were able to offer their customers. In response to these competitive pressures Loblaw announced its intention to allocate $1 billion to opening 50 new stores and renovating 150 existing locations in 2016. $1.2 billion was spent toward the same end in 2015. This investment was partially devoted to expanding “Inspire” stores—deluxe Loblaw locations in cosmopolitan hubs that featured premium merchandise. Loblaw alongside Sobeys and Metro also participated in a string of acquisitions. For instance Loblaw acquired QHR Technologies a medical records start-up supposedly as part of a potential plan to distribute medical marijuana through its network of Shoppers stores.Costco Wholesale Canada Founded in 1976 Costco was the leading operator in the Canadian wholesale club industry with a formidable 48.5 per cent share. Beyond providing low prices on consumables health and beauty products apparel and other merchandise through selective product sourcing (a typical Costco warehouse carried only 4000 stock-keeping units compared to the 30000 typical of supermarket peers) Costco also managed a faithful customer base. Having pioneered the retail “membership” concept whereby customers paid an annual fee to shop at any of its 98 Canadian locations Costco attracted over 10 million customers who renewed their membership at a 91 per cent rate. Purportedly in reaction to Walmart’s expansion of its fresh produce lines Costco had grown its grocery selection substantially over the previous five years. The warehouse club’s private label Kirkland Signature offered consumable products such as extra virgin olive oil organic chicken broth and quinoa broadening Costco’s appeal to include health-conscious shoppers.Walmart CanadaHeadquartered in Mississauga Ontario the Canadian division of Walmart emerged in 1994 with the acquisition of the Woolco retail chain providing the company with an initial 122 locations. By September 2016 Walmart claimed a 45.5 per cent market share in the industry second only to Costco. The parent company’s long-standing commitment since being founded by Sam Walton as a small discount retailer in Rogers Arkansas was to supply quality goods at discounted prices which Walmart Canada maintained. Pledging to provide Canadians with the “quality products they need at everyday low prices in the ways they want to shop for them” Walmart expanded its vision in Canada to include a significant online retail presence through its online retail store Walmart.ca. Walmart also aimed to compete in the online grocery segment launching an online grocery pick-up service in 11 Ottawa locations in 2015 complementing their “Grab & Go” locker service which allowed customers to order goods online and have them shipped at no cost to a nearby store. These investments in online retail were intended to appeal to busy consumers aiming to privilege the convenience of the shopping experience without sacrificing the low prices Walmart had historically provided. Keeping up with the CanadiansStaying abreast of the changing tastes and preferences of Canadian consumers proved to be yet another challenge for Loblaw. Recent research had revealed that Canadians were increasingly health-conscious which directly affected consumption trends. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s report on Canada for example determined that the sales volume of kale “the queen of greens” had risen by 77 per cent in 2014 alone while hummus organic frozen pizza single-serve coffee and drinkable yogurt also witnessed double-digit sales growth. Revenue from organic products had risen astronomically between 2011 and 2016 with 45 per cent of organic food or beverage sales occurring in grocery stores. PC introduced its Organics line in 2001 and it had since expanded to include organic products for babies and toddlers. The popularity of single-serving beverages and yogurt was also telling; indeed it suggested that higher-income consumers were flexible with price because of the value they placed on convenience. This prompted Loblaw’s experimentation in the summer of 2016 with selling fresh produce in 29 Shoppers locations—19 in Toronto Ontario; two in Hamilton Ontario; and eight in Regina Saskatchewan. The initiative was well received in spite of the relatively high prices of all products tested. However management was aware that its more expensive products and services were targeted mostly to individuals belonging to the highest income quartile (28.4 per cent of the market); much of the remaining market was known to be price-sensitive. Weston Jr. needed to consider if Loblaw’s investment would be best directed at initiatives designed to improve operational efficiency or customer experience whether these initiatives called for investing in automated distribution centres as Sobeys had done in 2013 or expanding self-checkout systems and the capabilities of the mobile application for the PC Plus loyalty program to win tech-savvy consumers. Exhibit 1: SWOT Analysis of LoblawAs the figure above illustrates Loblaw faced a number of challenges in the changing competitive landscape. Specifically Loblaw needed to decide whether to absorb input price increases (e.g. those resulting from the inflation of fresh produce prices) and sacrifice margins or to pass along costs to consumers. At the same time warehouse clubs particularly Costco and Walmart threatened to further depress retailer margins with their food offerings which were priced at steep discounts relative to what consumers would find at Loblaws Sobeys or Metro. Despite the obstacles mentioned above Loblaw assumed an advantageous position owing to its stability and size. Loblaw had tremendous brand equity in the Canadian marketplace earned over the course of its nearly century-long exploits in Canada. This was especially true of its well-known private label brand President’s Choice. There was an opportunity to increase penetration of the high-growth high-margin organic and ethnic food segments through potential product line extensions executed under the President’s Choice name. Moreover Loblaw focused on winning in the premium segment through an aggressive rollout of high-priced produce at Shoppers locations across Canada which attracted consumers who valued convenience over price. Further continuing to tap into diverse markets (food pharmaceuticals financial services etc.) served to diversify Loblaw’s risk.Note: SWOT = strengths weaknesses opportunities threats Source: Created by the authors using MarketLine Loblaw Companies Limited—Strategy and SWOT Report December 7 2016 accessed February 28 2017 http://advantage.marketline.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/Product?pid=D8D0B7F3-D096-423F-845B-2EB571C6948C&view=SWOTAnalysis.EXHIBIT 2: COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (Loblaw)Source: Created by the authors using Loblaw Companies Limited Second Quarter Report to Shareholders July 27 2016 accessed June 1 2017 http://s1.q4cdn.com/326961052/files/doc_financials/2016/Q2_RTS_SEDAR_26-Jul-16.pdf.Exhibit 3: Comparison of Financial Performance (Sobeys)Source: Created by the authors using Empire Company Limited Empire Company Reports Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results June 28 2016 accessed June 1 2017 http://corporate.sobeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Empire-Company-Reports-Fiscal-2016-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results.pdf.Exhibit 4: Comparison of Financial Performance (Metro)Source: Created by the authors using Metro Inc.

The occasion had finally arrived yet he sought greater clarity. Since taking charge of Ramco a product company in the information technology (IT) domain he had harnessed the organization’s capacity for innovation and this had had an effect on the company’s top line or gross revenues and its bottom line or net earnings. As of March 31 2016 revenues were estimated to be US$69 million which indicated a year-over-year growth of 16 per cent and Ramco had declared a profit of US$15.57 millon for the fiscal year 2014–2015. The revenues and number of new clients had grown across all three of the company’s product lines (see Exhibit 1). Clients from several new geographic locations had been added and the growth curve was steep and healthy.However the company faced challenges mainly related to its three products all of which involved peculiar demands. Aggarwal needed to decide on appropriate purposes and effective processes to strengthen these product portfolios. To do so he needed to consider the time required for each product to stabilize before introducing new features and he needed to create an organizational culture that would facilitate innovation across the board (see Exhibit 2). He was also concerned about competition from new e-commerce start-ups in other countries whose disruptive revenue and business models were attracting valuations in billions of dollars despite the losses showing on their balance sheets. By contrast Ramco was not only profitable but also showed increased profitability and revenues. However Ramco had to fight the market perception that India was predominantly a provider of IT services and show that an Indian company could also build enterprise-class products.Ramco was founded in 1992 and offered three main products: cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems aviation software and human capital management (HCM) systems and software. It was one of the few product companies that had continued to grow within India’s IT sector. Most other similar companies had either folded or been acquired by global giants. A product company typically thrived on innovation because this conferred a continuous competitive edge. Aggarwal understood that in order to drive innovation across the organization the company would have to address issues related to work culture. Ramco was known for its conventional style of functioning and this image needed to be shaken and reinvented to better fit the prevailing industry and social context. The advent of social media had redefined the way people worked and played and this posed additional challenges.As soon as Aggarwal was seated at the round-table meeting the head of strategy began to speak: The changes in the way work is done are deep and sublime and to understand their ramifications in operational terms we need radically different means of approaching existing problems and solutions. It is imperative to have talented personnel in the system who are bred on mobility as a way of life and can create user interface (UI) solutions that are both in tune with the changing trends and reflect the futuristic vision for the product. The strategy head was certain that he spoke for all strategic business unit (SBU) heads when he saidPeople want every application to be available on their mobile; however do they really use so many features on the go? Accordingly should we follow a mobile-only or a mobile-also strategy while developing products? Similar to our phones products may have thousands of applications yet we end up using only a minuscule few. Therefore how many resources do we commit to mobility as a product feature? [Mobility] may be a buzzword but most often [it] remains just that.The chief marketing officer chipped in: “Today almost everyone is on Facebook and Google all the time particularly through their mobiles. When the same people are at work they expect a similar ease with applications. Can we afford not to follow the mobile-first strategy?”The strategy head continued discussing the ramifications of another product Ramco’s ERP business:The ERP business has become complex after the introduction of the software as a service (SaaS) concept. Decision making for any of these matters without considering the revenue possibility and consequent expenditure is challenging. The trend of “everything on the Web” has helped us reach out to smaller businesses with low cost yet [excellent] solutions through SaaS. It has also considerably reduced the commitment of the client both in terms of finances and duration of the contract to one software provider. On-premise deployment remains an attractive strategy and brings in higher revenues but involves a longer and deeper commitment to the service provider. The ratio between license fees and annual maintenance contract fees must be analyzed in detail before taking . . . decisions that require substantial capital expenditure.As he listened to these arguments Aggarwal could not help but reminisce about how it all began. Ramco was conceptualized as a product company in a software space that was already crowded with players that primarily offered IT services. Ramco only offered services related to its products and these services typically included product implementation product customization and integration of the product with other products already in use.Ramco started its journey by developing ERP solutions mainly for the manufacturing industry at a time when ERP was still a relatively unknown term not only in India but also in the Asia Pacific region. It soon expanded ERP solutions to cover all business processes across industries. Ramco then entered the aviation field in 2000 when it partnered with Boeing which had observed Ramco’s strengths in asset maintenance solutions application development and HCM which had previously been part of ERP solutions. Ramco initially offered products according to client/server architecture and subsequently restructured the architecture of its solutions for the web. It anticipated the emergence of cloud computing and SaaS which particularly benefitted businesses that did not want to own IT assets but still wanted the best enterprise applications.Ramco distinguished itself from other large IT organizations such as Microsoft and SAP by identifying a niche area that larger corporations were unable to cater to and by focusing on an area that required rapid innovation. It developed a mixture of tools platforms appropriate processes and the required organizational culture that facilitated quick responses to unique application design and development challenges; it developed and launched products that larger corporations were either too slow to develop or too broadly focused to care for. It began developing standardized offerings and products and made these available off the shelf with minimal need for customization. Ramco also created structures and processes related to these products for maximum leverage. Its aim was to sit comfortably somewhere between NetSuite and SAP by targeting companies that spent over US$5 million on ERP solutions the middle ground where a company with sufficient complexity was looking for robust solutions without being tied down by the prospect of a major build and long implementation time. BUSINESS STRUCTURE: CURATED AROUND THREE PRODUCTSRamco had created its organizational structure around three products—Ramco ERP on Cloud Ramco Aviation and Ramco HCM on Cloud—and it treated these as separate SBUs. This meant that each SBU was responsible for the profit and loss within its line of business and had to consolidate its operations to become self-sufficient and accountable. This structure also encouraged healthy competition among the SBUs. Ramco ERP on CloudA typical ERP assumed both a need for infinite capacity from machine involved in manufacturing and maintenance work orders and existence of finite capacity in man. While ERP had earlier been considered useful mainly for manufacturing industries Ramco realized that this would change and announced the launch of ERP for companies in the services industry. This product was initially introduced as Ramco Marshall and later renamed Ramco ERP to fit the overall brand architecture.Ramco ERP integrated processes across the functions of human resources (HR) finance project management and customer-relationship management. It enabled both forward and backward integration with dealers and subcontractors. It could function independently at users’ locations via connections to the principal site (on-premise deployment) and it was available on the cloud (via SaaS).The ERP business was in a transition phase worldwide. Companies that had installed ERP between 2001 and 2005 were considering updates or replacement options because their existing ERP solutions had run their course. Ramco considered this an opportunity to recommend its product which could be integrated with other systems.Innovations in Ramco ERPRamco ERP developed product applications that reduced clutter and were more decision oriented. Its product features (for example single-screen operations for quick processing an in-line query option and highlighted to-do lists) promised easier and faster navigation and minimized scrolling and clicking for key functions in receivables/payables and procurement. Hub-centric features identified and integrated all relevant screens into one screen so the ERP user could perform multiple actions such as authorization printing release and reversing and even initiate discussions. Other innovations included global tax solutions for clients residing in Malaysia Thailand and Australia.In 2015–2016 Ramco ERP launched Ramco Logistics software to address third-party logistics freight forwarding and network service providers. Although the market was flooded with supply-chain software providers who targeted shippers and manufacturers Ramco Logistics targeted the service providers’ market which had witnessed a surge in demand and growth resulting from the growth in e-commerce and the need for better last-mile access. Some organizations that had recently been successful in this segment were GMK Logistics based in Australia; AAI Worldwide Logistics Inc. based in the Philippines; and RSA Logistics based in the United Arab Emirates. By developing an integrated system that could connect transportation warehouse fleet and hub with finance and HR in the cloud and could combine these with a command centre memory-based planning and an optimization engine Ramco was able to offer a value proposition in the market.Ramco also identified enterprise asset management (EAM) for asset-intensive industries as another niche area it could cater to. Accordingly the company developed Ramco EAM as a cloud-based mobile-ready product with predictive and preventive maintenance modules. It integrated this product with the finance and HCM applications of asset-centric organizations in industries such as power generation manufacturing and fleet management.Ramco AviationRamco leaped onto the world aviation stage when Airbus Helicopters a global leader in civilian government and military helicopters identified Ramco Aviation as a source for cloud-based maintenance information systems. The two companies signed a contract during the Paris Air Show in 2013. Under this agreement Ramco offered functionalities for collecting and manipulating data relating to maintenance repair and operations (MRO) which enabled Airbus to reduce its fleet management costs through increased efficiency.Ramco Aviation developed cloud-based aviation software for a next-generation mobile-application series it called Fly Anywhere Mechanic Anywhere Warehouse Anywhere Customer Anywhere and Approval Anywhere. It also offered a planning and optimization feature called flyMORE for long-term capacity planning; this was powered by Ramco iPO the company’s in-memory planning and optimization engine. These features generated considerable interest among operators with fewer helicopters small-aircraft operators and low-cost carriers. Innovations in Ramco AviationRamco’s development of aviation-maintenance-related applications such as Approve Anywhere Mechanic Anywhere Customer Anywhere Warehouse Anywhere Route Anywhere and Fly Anywhere incorporated several innovations to improve ease of use particularly related to mobility. The introduction of a wearable device offering hands-free computing and straight-through processing substantially reduced the time aircraft had to remain on the ground and improved the turn-around time of critical business functions. The electronic flight bag solution which helped crew to perform flight-management tasks more efficiently with less paperwork was offered as an offline tablet-based solution for pilots to use before during and after flights. Ramco iPO was used for conducting large-line maintenance inventory forecasting and optimization and hangar capacity planning.Ramco forged a tie-in with Aeroxchange a leading electronic business network that supported all MRO business processes for buyers and sellers in the aviation industry. This was similar to partnering with an aviation MRO marketplace and this partnership provided the customers of Ramco Aviation with access to components and repair services on Aeroxchange. It also facilitated product integration and gave both companies access to the other’s networks in the aviation MRO market thereby achieving a substantial impact.Ramco Aviation’s customers were mainly helicopter operators airlines MRO businesses and continuing airworthiness management organizations. The company continued to add more aviation-specific manufacturing companies as customers in 2015 and 2016 to become a comprehensive player in the aviation sector. These new customers included Able Aerospace Services Inc. Dynamic Aviation Group Inc. Southern Vietnam Helicopter Company Falcon Aviation and Sundance Helicopters Inc. Ramco Aviation had a total of 80 customers during this period—its highest total so far—and the market research company Frost & Sullivan rated this product as a “champion” on its technology innovation matrix. The Aeronautical Repair Station Association declared that Ramco Systems was its preferred next-generation MRO IT vendor.The year 2016 was particularly eventful for Ramco Aviation: It added the largest business-jet operator to its growing list of marquee clients and entered the market in China. It expanded into Scandinavia by signing its largest cloud deal thus far with Patria Helicopters an MRO based in Sweden that specialized in maintaining Bell AgustaWestland and Airbus helicopters used for military and civil operations. It also signed a multimillion dollar technology transformation deal with Cobham aviation a global aerospace and defense company based in Australia.The MRO LabRamco and Air France Industries (AFI) launched an engineering laboratory in Singapore with KLM Engineering and Maintenance (KLM E&M) as their first anchor partner. This lab was the first of its kind in Asia and was supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board. It combined engineering and innovative research talent from Ramco and its partner now known as AFI KLM E&M. The lab was an essential platform for software development in the aviation industry; employees worked on next-generation applications and developed solutions to major problems in back-end aviation. The lab focused on creating disruptive solutions (that is solutions that created new markets) for resource optimization wearable and smart devices—also referred to as connected devices or the Internet of things—advanced analytics and mobility. In addition the lab possessed design and development capabilities in areas such as additive manufacturing three-dimensional printing unmanned aerial vehicles augmented reality and virtual reality which aided mechanics and technicians.Ramco In-Memory Planning and OptimizationRamco’s iPO engine was a horizontal platform that powered all of the company’s SBUs by addressing a limitation of typical ERP systems. A typical ERP assumed both a need for infinite capacity and a finite capacity for each person and machine involved in manufacturing and maintenance work orders. The multiple constraints involved in processing this voluminous data slowed down the process flow so companies historically preferred to use human intelligence for some types of scheduling leaving human users in control of operations in a model that was both human-centric and time-consuming.As a smart planning and optimization engine Ramco iPO was equipped with the necessary algorithms to perform planning scheduling and optimization to honour all orders while ensuring that capacity constraints were not violated and order due dates were met. Ramco iPO operated by using all memory data ensuring that the process was lightning fast. Such an operation was useful when real-time disruptions to original plans required organizations to replan or reschedule on the fly. The iPO engine ran an electronic agent to solve each problem and the agent evolved to communicate and collaborate with all parties to solve the business problems across areas. Disruption in one area could result in one agent having to redo its work but it could also lead to collaboration with other agents triggering their respective and relevant functionalities.Ramco HCM on CloudRamco HCM on Cloud launched in 2013–2014 quickly became popular based on features such as built-in analytics insightful dashboards multicountry and multicurrency payroll functions and an ability to integrate with any standard ERP product. This newest product in the portfolio quickly became the company’s fastest engine of growth. Global conglomerates like Dabur Bureau Veritas and Kerzner International adopted this product. With the launch of an HCM system enabled for payrolls in China Ramco HCM offered a single integrated platform that could address close to 88 per cent of the world’s working population. This product helped clients adhere to local statutory obligations and leverage global best practices. Ramco HCM acquired one new customer every week and grew by 115 per cent year-over-year in 2014–2015.In 2015–2016 Ramco HCM entered the United States and added more than 100 new clients at the global rate of two new customers every week. Its footprint in the Southeast Asian Middle Eastern and North African markets was steadily growing and it was gaining increasing traction in Australia. One of its prestigious clients was the Valiram Group of Malaysia which owned more than 300 stores in Asia and Australia and represented over 150 luxury and lifestyle brands including Victoria’s Secret Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.Ramco HCM enhanced its offerings by forming strategic partnerships with APS Global Ltd. TRAXPayroll and PayMaster Inc. to extend its payroll reach across Europe the United States and the rest of Africa. An independent global research firm NelsonHall evaluated the leading global payroll vendors offering outsourcing services and ranked Ramco Global Payroll as a “leader” according to its matrix and parameters including overall capability and the ability to offer multi-country payroll. Ramco HCM beat major global HR software companies to win six awards for best HR management software talent management software and payroll software at the Human Resources Vendors of the Year 2015 event organized by human resource agencies in Singapore Malaysia and Hong Kong. In India it won an Honour and Recognition award from CIO Choice in the human resources and global payroll software category.Innovations in Ramco HCMSeveral innovative features were developed and incorporated into Ramco HCM. It condensed users’ actions into one screen by anticipating likely transactions based on their past actions and it provided drop-down menus that eliminated the need for typing; these features made payroll processing and time and attendance management more efficient. Innovations such as talent tagging messaging intelligence and a performance journal were also integrated into the product’s standard format.Product Development at RamcoAggarwal admired the capability and robustness of Ramco’s product development process. It added product features that capitalized on market trends while keeping a close eye on the needs of the customers. He believed that this success was not accidental but the result of appropriate structures and relevant processes for product management which were now delivering results. The structures provided philosophy and direction while guiding actions that enabled decision making even at the tactical level.Product PhilosophyInnovation was the pivot around which Ramco Systems articulated its product philosophy. The company focused on moving forward using cognitive and robotic ERP as tools to drive efficiency. The innovations in the product were woven around four simple actions that could be performed by the user: Hub It Mail It Thumb It and Prompt It. Hub It was designed as a single-screen hub through which users could perform all transactions based on clearly defined user roles. Mail It enabled users to send mail to the system which was intelligent enough to decipher and perform the necessary actions. The Thumb It feature enabled users to accomplish their tasks by swiping their thumbs on the mobile screen. This feature could sense the context and default the probable transactions that would be thumbed again. The Prompt It feature analyzed past data to pre-empt requirements and ready the relevant documents for action. Ramco Genie which was created to support this feature improved as it became familiar with users and their organizational context. These features enabled users to devote more time to growing the business rather than to running it.Product PlanningThe product planning process at Ramco involved preparing a 12–18 month product road map for all three products and then further dividing it into three-month periods for specific budgeted activities. The product planning process incorporated inputs from all key stakeholders such as business heads presales teams senior professionals from the implementation teams product development teams and customers. This planning process began once the relevant inputs were obtained from the business plan for the next financial year; preparation for the business plan began approximately three months before the end of the ongoing financial year.Structure of the Product Management FunctionThe structure of the product management team enabled the product roadmap to be executed within the specified time and cost limits. The team was divided into three key functions: Every product had a dedicated product development team of 100–175 people and its structure mirrored the structure of the SBU. The task of this team was to prepare an overall product roadmap for the SBU. A horizontals team concentrated on developing generic applications that could be incorporated into all three products across SBUs. This team developed near field communication NFC short-range high-frequency wireless communication technology machine-driven wearable Internet of things and user interface and user experience applications. Finally a market intelligence team continually scanned the competitive environment for inspiration and to ensure the company stayed ahead. Product-specific teams relied on multiple channels to gain inputs for preparing the product roadmap. These were the product support channel which highlighted defects improvement requests and new requirements; the prospects channel which mapped the existing product features against the requirements; the customer acquisition channel which monitored the relevance of product features uniquely designed for a customer to the overall product roadmap; and the customer advisory council which enlisted customers to interact with the product management team.Stages of the Product Development ProcessA typical software development life cycle consisted of a blueprint stage detailed requirement stage technical design stage construction stage unit testing stage system testing stage and packaging stage. The skills required for each stage were often specific to that stage. For example the blueprint stage required domain expertise the construction stage required employees with adequate programming skills and the packaging stage required employees who were good at the release function.Aggarwal marvelled at the attention that Ramco had paid to the innovation process. The institutionalization of the product development process had been achieved across all levels of the organizational and technical structures. He was particularly impressed by the innovations made at the level of technology enterprise application assembly and delivery platforms including Ramco VirtualWorks and Ramco DecisionWorks which catered to transaction functions and analytics and reporting functions respectively. The segregation at the platform level helped ensure innovative product development across both domains.Ramco VirtualWorks was an application assembly and delivery platform that was created by combining a model-driven product development environment business services repository and enterprise solution architecture based on service-oriented architecture with an enterprise event bus and enterprise information management platform. This complex platform ensured that any application development was cognitive memory based and equipped with a partner development kit and extension development kit to help customers create extensions in the cloud. Ramco DecisionWorks was a product suite targeted to perform complex reporting functions such as business analytics planning and budgeting. It was designed around web-based applications for usability performance and functionality.These two platforms enabled all three products to address complex business requirements in real time. The level of complexity that could be handled was evident in features such as multitenant cloud architecture device-specific rendering and an in-memory engine which made the products adaptive and intelligent.Ramco also launched initiatives to improve digital product design for user interface and user experience applications. Project Chrysalis launched in 2013 and the Ramco Hub launched in 2015 were both intended to reduce clutter simplify navigation and make applications intelligent and context-sensitive. Hub provided a unique user experience premised on the philosophy of doing more by doing less. It provided the user with a unified view of all related functions on one screen to facilitate quick decision making. Available features included a personalized user profile that displayed only relevant information intuitive icon-based actions easy links for performing the next set of actions and standardized design elements such as colour buttons names and fonts.As Aggarwal reminisced about the story of the company he recalled the issue at hand. Ramco Systems was not listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ but was listed on the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange. Although Ramco’s products shared features with new social media products such as Facebook Google+ and Foursquare they did not have the advantages of the ecosystem that created them. Ramco’s products were for organizations that required long detailed and painstaking work from their employees and Ramco’s job was to help them do more by enabling them to do less.Everyone in the meeting room was looking expectantly to him for an answer. He walked around the table returned to his chair and began his address: Innovation cannot be performed for the sake of innovation alone; it needs to help achieve business goals on a daily basis. In addition innovation should create new opportunities that may define the pace and direction of growth. Ultimately the question that we must ask ourselves is “Do we run the business or do we change the business?” Although we run the business we cannot afford to ignore technological and other developments in the field and we have to keep an eye on the competitors who think differently and may offer cheaper faster or game-changing solutions. Moreover we have to run the business smoothly and continue to satisfy the customer every day and at every instance. A universal truth is applicable here: striking the golden mean. The processes we put in place need to help us attain that mean. Even in the case of product portfolios this balance is relevant. The strengthening of product portfolios can be achieved through appropriate processes and an organizational culture that thrives on innovation.Exhibit 1: Snapshot of the PERFORMANCE OF Ramco Systems ON MARCH 31 2016(US$ Millions)Source: Company documents. Exhibit 2: Life at RamcoTo drive innovation in the workplace there was a need to disrupt Ramco’s conventional company culture and create an environment where the best talent would want to work and thrive. With this objective in mind Ramco embarked on a cultural transformation. We envisioned a work environment that would bring the best talent encourage their growth and allow work to be centred on life rather than letting life revolve around work. We envisioned that this work environment would naturally prompt an employee to say “Thank God It’s Monday!”Refreshed WorkspaceThe new look which was funky and colourful involved the demolition of cubicles to create an open office.Healthy WorkplaceFIKA cafe was built so that employees could get their daily dose of caffeine but was also stocked with healthy bites. At the state-of-the-art cafeteria Thank-God-it’s-Monday calorie-measured food in the form of subsidized lunches and healthy snacks was served around the clock to employees. Yoga and Zumba classes were introduced to provide healthy avenues for taking breaks from work and a corporate tie-in program was initiated to provide subsidized and easy access to day-to-day services such as laundry and dry cleaning.Confident and Fearless WorkforceThis was cultivated on an ongoing basis through a variety of initiatives:Coffee with the CEO: This was a unique idea to break the hierarchy and maintain an open culture with the CEO leading from the front. The employees’ interaction with the CEO was informal in nature and created an opportunity to discuss a wide range of topics. A direct hotline to the CEO was established from every corner of the office.A truly global workforce: Being recognized as a global company meant that we needed to embrace a diverse workforce. Ramco employs people from Indonesia Vietnam the Philippines and China in its workforce. In 2016 8 per cent of its workforce was found to be from the Southeast Asia region (Singapore/Malaysia/Australia) and 26 per cent was from other regions.Self-Regulating and Self-Correcting OrganizationRevenue per employee was introduced at the start of the transformation phase and it later evolved into revenue per employee cost (RUC) as a measure. An RUC of three was the benchmark and the SBUs were given the freedom to run their business considering the benchmark.All managers and above were included in the quarterly business performance-linked pay. Measurable targets and simplified key performance indicators were followed at Ramco. On-target earning as variable pay was introduced and constituted 10–35 per cent of the total cost to the company.Accelerated Growth ProgramsThe Elevator program was commissioned to create mould and groom a pool of young talent into the leaders of tomorrow. A Culture that Rewards and Recognizes“Pat on",,,,,
"the Back"""" quarterly awards and STAR awards appreciated and recognized individual performers in the SBU for each quarter. A focused award (for deal clinchers green horn and Pegasus types) was given according to the function/role played by employees providing a feel-good factor.We Truly Appreciate cards were given anytime and anywhere. On-the-spot recognition was intended to drive long-term employee motivation and engagement.Source: Company documents.""",1,BROWN,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,,

(DTBC) the Chinese heavy-duty segment of multinational automobile manufacturer Daimler AG (Daimler) found himself sitting in a police station in Beijing China. The police officers had taken him in for questioning after a heated quarrel in a parking lot where he allegedly lost his temper over a parking space. Gärtner and a Chinese driver were both trying to park their cars at the same time in the same space. This resulted in Gärtner screaming racially loaded insults. Onlookers tried to intervene and Gärtner used pepper spray. One bystander got injured and had to be treated in the hospital for eye injuries. How did it all happen? How did a seemingly small frustration get out of control and turn into such an ugly story? What on earth had happened to Gärtner? Chinese social media soon connected this incident with Daimler’s corporate culture and asked people to boycott Mercedes cars. The story went viral and was picked up by mainstream news outlets around the world. Against general upward market trends Daimler’s share price weakened. What options did Daimler have to remedy the situation?Gärtner’s BackgroundUntil that Sunday morning in November 2016 everything was going perfectly fine for Gärtner. His career was on a smooth and rather steep trajectory; his life was full of achievements. He received his Master of Business Administration degree with a focus on exports sales and marketing from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich (Germany) followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree in economics from the same university in 1997. Besides his native German he spoke English Spanish and Turkish. Gärtner’s employer Daimler’s business unit Mercedes-Benz Cars in Germany entrusted him with increasing responsibilities. From 2004 to 2010 he was a senior manager with the Mercedes-Benz Guard division. In this role he was responsible for product management and worldwide sales marketing and service operations for armoured cars at headquarters in Stuttgart Germany. In 2010 Gärtner was sent on an expatriate assignment to South Korea. Daimler was paying great attention to the fast-growing Korean market which reached a whopping growth in new imported car registrations of 25.5 per cent over the previous year. Moreover 71 per cent of foreign cars sold in South Korea that year came from Germany. Gärtner’s initial position in South Korea was head of sales and marketing Daimler Trucks Korea Ltd. from which he soon made it to vice-president of commercial vehicle sales. In 2013 he was invited into a high-potential program with sessions on leadership and self-development at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). The next promotion came in December 2013 all the way up to the position of CEO of Daimler Trucks Korea Ltd. In this role he had full profit and loss responsibility for new vehicle sales (trucks buses and vans) and after-sales (parts and accessories). He was further responsible for managing the supply chain production network of local and regional suppliers. Move to ChinaIn July 2015 another move was waiting for Gärtner then age 49 both geographically from South Korea to China as well as once more up the corporate ladder. Gärtner was to succeed Robert Veit as CEO of DTBC. Veit at age 47 was returning to Stuttgart headquarters in Germany to take the position of director of Mercedes-Benz Truck Overseas.This latest promotion clearly underscored Daimler’s confidence in Gärtner. China was the largest vehicle market in the world. And for Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz trucks China was already the fifth-largest market in 2012 with a market share of more than 50 per cent in the premium segment. In the heavy-duty segment Daimler solidified its position as the leader in the market. As of 2013 the trucks and buses division of DTBC pursued a two-pronged strategy. For the division’s premium segment the legally independent company DTBC imported and sold Mercedes-Benz trucks. For the volume segment Daimler and Beiqi-Foton Motor Co. Ltd. (Foton) a Chinese truck manufacturer entered in a 50/50 joint venture as part of the Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co. Ltd. Since July 2012 they had been collaborating to manufacture and distribute the medium- and heavy-duty trucks of the Auman brand primarily for the domestic Chinese market. The joint venture was intended to bring a stronger presence for the company by combining Daimler’s leading truck manufacturing expertise with Foton’s understanding of the domestic market. Gärtner had full profit and loss responsibility for DTBC including new vehicle sales (trucks special trucks and buses) powertrain components after-sales (genuine parts lubricants and accessories) and telematics solutions for bus-specific fleet management.The disputeLife in China was not bad for Gärtner. He stayed in a gated community in the up-and-coming district of Shunyi a popular residential suburb in Northeast Beijing among other overseas executives. Gärtner had a nice house with a little garden and fence around it and a showy black Mercedes car in his driveway. However something inexplicable happened on Sunday morning November 20 2016. Gärtner was trying to park his car in a parking lot inside his residential compound and a Chinese driver was trying to do the same thing at the same time and in the same space. Apparently one of the two “stole” the parking space from the other starting a frustrated dispute that quickly heated up. Gärtner allegedly yelled “I’ve been in China for a year and the first thing that I learned was that all Chinese are bastards” and defended his parking space with pepper spray. One onlooker was injured and had to be treated in the hospital for eye injuries. This incident landed Gärtner in a Chinese police station.In the end Gärtner was able to settle the dispute with the Chinese driver in a private manner and the official police investigation was quickly closed. However one of the driver’s friends who was around when it all happened posted on social media his recollection of how Gärtner had screamed racial slurs to the Chinese passersby and how he unleashed pepper spray on them. The story soon went viral on Chinese media. The South China Morning Post quoted a social media post: “This kind of foreigner is making money from Chinese people on one hand while insulting them at the same time. They hate China from the bottom of their hearts.”Bloggers on Weibo (pronounced ‘way-bore’) a popular social media microblogging website in China with a market penetration similar to Twitter in the United States flooded the Daimler Group profile page calling for boycotts and demanding action. One blogger stated: “I was originally thinking about buying a Mercedes-Benz S-Class and was also planning to buy my wife a Mercedes-Benz GLC but this incident about the senior executive has made me deeply disappointed towards the brand. Mercedes-Benz get out of China!”In yet another post a friend of the passerby who was treated in the hospital mournfully commented on the incident as an example of obnoxious foreigners: “These kinds of foreigners take money from the Chinese people with one hand while also abusing them. They must hate China from the depths of their hearts.”Further comments flooded into the original Weibo post that reported on the parking space dispute: “Get out of China! China doesn’t welcome you.” “Gärtner should be deported and never allowed to enter China again.” “I’ll never buy Benz even if I can afford it. The corporate culture is ugly.”Global Times a popular Chinese newspaper regretfully commented on the incident: “But no matter how filthy the words hearts should not be filthy. . . . There’s no explaining away an argument that escalates to using ‘You Chinese. . . .’”The Southern Daily an official Chinese newspaper for the southern province of Guangdong was one of the few that featured a moderate editorial saying that “some people think this was making a mountain out of a molehill.” However it also added that foreign expatriates in China easily become arrogant about China and “often use racially prejudiced words and actions about Chinese consumers even Chinese employees.” The news about the Gärtner incident did not stay in China for long. It quickly spread across the world. International media such as Reuters took notice of the mounting tension regarding the incident carefully observing Daimler’s next move: “The media reports prompted a spike in online chatter with the outburst in the top 10 discussed topics on popular microblog Sina Weibo on Monday morning. Many users posted comments saying they would avoid buying Daimler cars.”Others such as the New York Times took a more reprimanding tone toward the German expatriate by commenting: “the Chinese news media and many internet users seized on Mr. Gärtner as an example of arrogant Western bigotry and demanded that he and Daimler apologize. He became the latest example of the power of the Chinese internet to humble governments companies and people accused of wounding national pride.”This was all very bad timing. The controversy over Gärtner came hard on the heels of another volatile episode involving 63-year-old Günther H. Oettinger the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society from Germany. Oettinger had to apologize after referring to Chinese people as “slit-eyes” and “sly dogs” in a speech to business leaders in Hamburg. An amateur video was uploaded to YouTube capturing Oettinger’s controversial speech in which he caricatured a delegation of Chinese officials he had met. During the first few days of criticism Oettinger refused to apologize causing China’s Foreign Ministry to condemn Oettinger for showing a “baffling feeling of superiority” that is common among many Western politicians. A spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry stated: “We hope that they will learn to observe themselves and others objectively and to respect others and treat them as equals.” As the storm of criticism mounted Oettinger finally decided to apologize in a statement released by the European Commission. Oettinger acknowledged that he now realized his remarks to a German business forum last week had “hurt” people. Relations between China and Germany were further affected when Germany withdrew approval for a Chinese investor group’s proposed takeover of German semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron citing concerns over national security. The withdrawal resulted in diplomatic tension between the two countries.moving forward Gärtner’s parking space quarrel in the suburb of Beijing not only resulted in outrage on Chinese social media. On the day of the incident Daimler’s share price started a downhill dive from €65.69 that 10 days later reached a low of €61.90. During the same time period the DAX remained steady and the Dow Jones Industrial Average even showed an upward movement (see Exhibit 1). What actions options did Daimler have to restore its brand image?Exhibit 1: Daimler share price compared to the Dow Jones Industrial averageNote: € = EUR = euro; €1 = US$1.05 as of November 20 2016.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-10On April 1 2017 Ye Ji founded a self-service retail platform for fresh meals called Flashfood.Shop in Dalian Liaoning province China. Flashfood.Shop used intelligent self-catering machines (ISM) as its physical sales terminals and an intelligent self-catering system (ISS) as its online service interface. Relying on fresh meals from catering suppliers Flashfood.Shop provided office workers with quick and affordable 24-hour catering services. After more than a year in development the platform was finally ready for normal operation.By the end of June 2018 Flashfood.Shop had launched 51 ISMs where customers could buy fresh meals from a vending machine. The company had 14 catering suppliers 135 different types of catering products and over 500000 customers. The average sales volume from a single ISM had increased from 8.43 to 30.25 servings per day which was a growth in average revenue turnover from ¥121.51 to ¥410.81 per day. The wastage rate of catering products had also dropped from the initial 27.97 per cent to 9.05 per cent. However behind the rapid development of Flashfood.Shop was a loss incurred in five consecutive quarters. After its establishment in April 2017 the company’s only income source was the sale of its catering products. At the same time its operating costs were high due to the instability of the ISMs and ISSs low operating efficiency and other factors. Faced with these issues Ji the founder and general manager of Flashfood.Shop was wondering how to resolve his company’s difficulties.backgroundWith the swift development of China’s economy and the improvement of people’s per capita income level the population of China’s middle class reached 204 million in 2017.  These factors contributed to the rise of China’s catering market which reached nearly ¥4 trillion (see Exhibit 1). Alternative business models to restaurant meals achieved explosive growth in China including fresh meals available via online food delivery in convenience stores and in self-service outlets. These three business models primarily targeted middle-class office workers and subsequently became the main source of meals for this segment. Generally office workers were urban people with high academic qualifications and a steady income and engaged in intellectual work.Online Food DeliveryOnline food delivery was an Internet-based business model where consumers could place an order online pay through a mobile payment application (app) such as WeChat Pay or Alipay and then wait for the fresh meal to be delivered to their doorstep. In 2011 with the establishment of domestic food-delivery companies such as Meituan Ele.me and Baidu Waimai the online food delivery industry was booming in China. In the growing stage of this industry these companies attracted more than ¥70 billion in financing. As of June 2018 Meituan had successfully accumulated more than ¥40 billion in multiple-round financing while Ele.me had raised over ¥20 billion from investors. These funds effectively promoted the development of China’s online food-delivery market (see Exhibit 2). After nearly seven years of fierce competition Baidu Waimai was taken over by Ele.me in 2017 which shifted the landscape of China’s online food delivery market from a tripartite confrontation to a rivalry between Meituan and Ele.me.The main customers of online food-delivery retailing were office workers whose mealtimes were generally short because of high work intensity. Online food delivery allowed office workers to enjoy catering services in the office which greatly saved time. Gradually online food delivery also became a popular dining option for this group. According to a report by the think tank Analysis the sales volume of online food delivery for office workers reached ¥38.13 billion accounting for 83 per cent of the overall online food delivery market. It was clear that online food delivery had become the most popular quick meal choice for Chinese office workers.Fresh Meals in Convenience StoresFresh meals in convenience stores provided customers with rice noodles wonton and other cooked meals in addition to traditional convenience store products such as basic necessities snacks and beverages. Because of the numerous convenience stores in business districts where office workers spent their day fresh meals in these stores gradually became an important option for quick meals for this group. In China the earliest companies to provide fresh meals in convenience stores were Lawson 7-Eleven and Family Mart. The stores provided bento boxed lunches vegetable salads fruits ice cream and other meal categories. The sales of fresh meals in convenience stores accounted for 30–40 per cent of total sales generally accounting for 40–70 per cent of gross margins. Therefore fresh meal retailing was the most important source of profit for these convenience stores. In recent years some convenience stores increased the proportion of fresh meal sales in their overall sales from an initial amount of 10 per cent up to 30–50 per cent.A report jointly released by the China Chain-Store & Franchise Association and the Boston Consulting Group noted that in 2016 the number of convenience stores in China reached nearly 100000 with a growth rate of 13 per cent and a market size exceeding ¥130 billion.Self-Service Machines for Fresh MealsDespite the rapid expansion of the online food-delivery market and the increasing number of convenience stores in China there were drawbacks to both of these options. However self-service catering machines offering fresh meals seemed to be able to avoid the disadvantages of the other two types of retailers.Although the online food-delivery market was still expanding its growth rate had slowed significantly (see Exhibit 2) which highlighted problems with this option. The cost of delivery was too high an expense for companies providing online fresh meal services. In some Tier 2 cities such as Dalian delivery could cost ¥10 per serving while in Tier 1 cities such as Beijing the cost was up to ¥15 per serving for these companies which meant that online food delivery services were not profitable for fresh meal orders below ¥30. In addition customers often complained about long waiting times during peak hours. Customers normally waited 40 minutes for their meals from the time the online order was placed to the time of delivery at their doorstep. During peak hours that time could reach more than one hour which was unacceptable for office workers who normally had only 60–90 minutes for their lunch break. There was also great demand for breakfast and midnight snacks but these companies were rarely able to provide delivery services at these times.The sale of fresh meals in convenience stores was also plagued with high rent and labour costs which led to high meal prices. Convenience stores were mainly located near office workplaces in business districts where rent costs were generally higher. For example in 2011 the monthly rent charge at a Beijing CBD office was ¥300 per square metre; by 2014 it had reached ¥1000 per square metre. Convenience stores also required at least two workers which had become more of an expense with increasing urban labour costs. For example China’s average employee salary had risen five times from 2008 to 2017. And although convenience stores were located near office areas workers were still required to walk approximately 300–1000 metres. Office workers who had become accustomed to eating meals without stepping outside their office found fresh meals from convenience stores a less appealing option.Self-service catering machines offering fresh meals seemed to resolve the problems incurred by both online and convenience stores. The self-service fresh meals option was a new business model that made use of intelligent technologies such as mobile payment face recognition and Radio Frequency Identification without requiring servers or cashiers. Compared to online food delivery self-service fresh meals could greatly reduce delivery costs through centralized distribution and could achieve high gross profit margins even with unit prices of ¥30 or less. ISMs could provide 24-hour catering services covering breakfast lunch dinner afternoon tea and midnight snacks. Customers could receive their meal within 100 seconds of making their payment which greatly reduced waiting times. Compared to fresh meals sold in convenience stores the self-service business model enjoyed the advantages of low rent costs (for only 1 square metre) and no labour costs and provided office workers with shorter walking distances (usually within 100 metres) and less time wasted.According to an Ai Media Consulting report the market size of self-service retailing in China was ¥38.94 billion in 2017. In the next five years China’s self-service retailing was expected to go through a high development period and the market was expected to see a growth rate of 281.30 per cent until 2020 to exceed ¥1.8 trillion by 2022. The sale of self-service fresh meals was expected to reach a market size of ¥24.1 billion in 2018 achieving a 50 per cent growth rate. The online catering market had developed rapidly in recent years but it was only able to capture a 4–6 per cent share of the overall catering market to date. Clearly the development of the online catering market was far from its saturation point; however the potential market space in this field was also an opportunity for self-service retail of fresh meals.founding of flashfood.shopOn April 1 2017 Ji founded Flashfood.Shop and established the self-service catering platform to provide fresh meals through the use of both ISMs and ISS platforms using both physical and online service interfaces. With fresh meals provided by catering suppliers the platform offered office workers affordable and convenient 24-hour catering services.Ji and His TeamJi had worked as a senior engineer for IBM in the past in information technology research and development. He had extensive experience in e-commerce multimedia information data management data retrieval and data mining. In 2010 Ji left IBM and formed a team of nearly 100 people to provide research and development services in software and e-commerce. He had also worked on the development of e-commerce system projects for Haier Group China Minsheng Bank and other companies.In 2014 Ji was hired by Baidu Waimai in Dalian where he worked for three years. The company was responsible for online and traditional food delivery promotion distribution operation maintenance and other services. During that time Ji accumulated a wealth of experience and insight into the development of the catering industry and e-commerce technology. That experience helped him discover and learn to resolve various problems inherent in two major markets—online and convenience store fresh food retailing. His solution was self-service catering of fresh meals. As a native of Dalian Ji had always hoped to build a Dalian-based unicorn enterprise. The opportunity that self-service catering of fresh meals promised made him see his vision more clearly and ignited his fighting spirit.At the beginning of 2017 Ji and his team began working on the development of Flashfood.Shop a self-service retailing platform of fresh meals. His entrepreneurial team consisted mainly of three groups of people. The first group was the information technology staff working on the software system development e-commerce data mining and other areas. The staff in the second group who had come from Baidu Waimai accumulated rich experience in the catering field. The third group consisted of Ji’s friends whom he had invited to supplement the team and address any weaknesses. This group included Bin Zhang who was once Neusoft’s senior business manager; Jingyi Han who had rich experience in restaurant brand design and had created more than 10 successful catering brands; Xiaopeng Yang who had been a senior marketing manager at Lawson convenience stores; and Yuanyuan Song who was once a senior leader of human resources in Tencent’s head office. The above three groups together formed the entrepreneurial team of Flashfood.Shop (see Exhibit 3).The ISM and the ISSHardware: The ISMFlashfood.Shop’s ISMs were physical hardware terminals for use by retail customers. They were composed of four main partition modules—refrigeration (for storing the products) heating transmission and display (for the purchase of fresh meals). To ensure the proper function and high quality of the ISM hardware Flashfood.Shop collaborated with Dalian Fushibingshan Vending Machine Co. Ltd. (Fushibingshan). Founded in 2003 Fushibingshan had grown to become China’s vending machine industry leader with total sales to date of 120000 vending machines.Flashfood.Shop and Fushibingshan workers focused their efforts on ensuring the proper function and stability of the hardware through iterative experiments. Fushibingshan was so convinced of Flashfood.Shop’s prospects that it offered ¥40 million in lease funding which greatly alleviated the new business’s financial pressure. After the successful development of the ISMs Fushibingshan trained engineering staff at Flashfood.Shop and then authorized and assisted staff members to carry out daily operations and maintenance work such as installation maintenance and repair.Software: The ISSFlashfood.Shop’s ISS was the key to ensure proper operation of the company’s online platform. The system featured online display ordering and payment processes. The software enabled Flashfood.Shop’s real-time monitoring of the quality and quantity of meals. As well the software enabled the company to conduct data statistics and other operational duties. The software system was developed strictly by Flashfood.Shop’s team.Flashfood.Shop’s ISS operated online via a built-in WeChat app without the need for downloading and installation. Customers could simply search for Flashfood.Shop on their WeChat apps to access the system. Based on their current location customers could choose the nearest machine and select their meal. After ordering and paying for the meal they would receive a code to retrieve their meal from the chosen catering machine. Customers could also purchase fresh meals directly from the ISM by selecting their desired meal on the machine’s display clicking the corresponding picture and paying by scanning a code generated by the machine. The complete process could take only 20–100 seconds depending on whether the meal required heating. The operator interface of the ISM allowed Flashfood.Shop to perform a series of operations including machine monitoring meal monitoring shelf management and operation analysis.Suppliers and Customers of Flashfood.ShopEssentially Flashfood.Shop operated as a middleman platform that connected catering suppliers with customers thereby achieving supply and demand docking (see Exhibit 4).Catering SuppliersFlashfood.Shop had to attract suppliers to provide catering products for its ISM and customers to purchase the products. However the company was newly established and lacked brand recognition. Therefore it decided to use well-known food brands and high-quality catering products to attract customers. To ensure high-quality products the catering suppliers had to meet various standards. First their brand had to be well known to consumers. Second they had to have a central kitchen in Dalian to guarantee the quality of the food. Third the products provided by the supplier had to retain their colour and form after refrigeration or heating (if required). Fourth the products had to pass a series of Flashfood.Shop’s quality and safety standards regarding production transportation and storage of the foods. Collaborating with suppliers Flashfood.Shop was able to provide 24-hour uninterrupted catering services with meals for breakfast lunch dinner afternoon tea and midnight snacks. By the end of 2018 Flashfood.Shop was providing 135 different types of catering products including Crispy Pork Chop Rice Orlean Roast Chicken Leg Rice and Black Pepper Beef Rice.CustomersFlashfood.Shop targeted mainly office workers so accurate placement of the ISMs near office workplaces was essential. To develop the perfect plan for site selection of the ISMs Ji invited professionals from Lawson to join the team and provide their expertise with the convenience store location model. After considering many site selection models Flashfood.Shop developed a standard process to evaluate potential sites based on user profiles strategic planning field research and standard models.operations of flashfood.shopDelivery SystemFlashfood.Shop’s products had to be transported from the various catering suppliers to the ISMs before customers could make a purchase. Working with third-party logistics enterprises Flashfood.Shop developed a delivery system that used both four-wheeled vehicles and two-wheeled electric bicycles to transport the products (see Exhibit 5). Generally the four-wheeled vehicles would deliver all catering products to ISMs at 10 o’clock every night. When a specific machine ran out of a product the two-wheeled electric bicycle would replenish the machine. The average delivery cost was reduced to about ¥1.5 per serving through a centralized distribution system using the two types of vehicles. With more ISMs and with the optimization and upgrading of the delivery system that cost could be further reduced to an average of ¥0.8 per serving. Delivery costs remained a major concern of online food delivery businesses with much higher rates of up to ¥10 per serving in Tier 2 cities and ¥15 per serving in Tier 1 cities. Rising rental and labour costs also resulted in high operating costs for convenience stores. However Flashfood.Shop was able to take advantage of centralized distribution of its catering products to reduce its delivery costs.Marketing and PromotionWith rich experience in catering promotion the Flashfood.Shop team had built a complete marketing and promotion process in four stages: customer research customer development continuous optimization and viscosity maintenance. For the first stage conducting customer research the marketing team prepared a questionnaire to gain basic information about potential customers within each ISM’s radius. The information collected included consumption patterns consumption amounts meal preferences age distribution and male-to-female ratio. For the second stage to develop a customer base the marketing team promoted its catering products using flyers and posters and by directly inviting customers to participate in the product experience by establishing specific WeChat groups. For the third stage continuous optimization the team cultivated customer consumption behaviours through promotional activities. The marketing team also worked to increase the frequency of customer consumption levels and developed new customers by offering discounts for best selling items providing incentives for inviting friends to try the service giving one free item with the purchase of three meals and providing coupons for free meals. For the fourth stage viscosity maintenance the team continuously tracked and summarized customer behaviour and dynamically adjusted its sales strategy. The marketing team made adjustments to types of catered products and to promotion strategies based on background data aggregation and analysis and on customer feedback. The idea was to continuously enhance the customer’s experience.Establishment of Standards for Self-Service Retail of Fresh MealsSelf-service retail standards were crucial for the operation’s security and the company’s prominence in the industry for the future. As a leading company in the self-service retail of fresh meals Flashfood.Shop jointly formulated the industry standards in China with field experts including Wanchun Guo of the Dalian Food and Drug Administration Fushibingshan Dalian Acasia Food Co. Ltd. (Acasia) and Dalian Gongqingyuan Food Co. Ltd. (Gongqingyuan). The partners set standards for the complete process of food traceability packaging transportation and storage. They used various established industry standards as their source including the Hygienic Standard of Self-service Food Retailing and the National Food Safety Standard of the People’s Republic of China.In regard to the standards for food traceability Flashfood.Shop collaborated with well-known catering brands such as Acasia and Gongqingyuan to provide each product with a unique identifier for ease of tracking. For the food packaging standards Flashfood.Shop set up specifications for appropriate grade and materials of paper towels spoons forks and meal boxes. When setting the food transportation standards cold chain equipment had to be provided during the transportation process so that the products could be kept at an appropriate temperature of 4 degrees Celsius or less. In reference to the food storage standards both the supplier and the operator were required to meet appropriate fresh-keeping conditions. For example catering suppliers had to guarantee that the products could be quickly cooled to below 10 degrees Celsius within 30 minutes after cooking to eliminate bacteria and lock in nutrient moisture. Catering operators like Flashfood.Shop also had to guarantee that the products were always kept at 0–4 degrees Celsius before purchase. For each product the catering operator was required to monitor the temperature and storage period in real time through the system’s back end. If a product’s temperature or storage period exceeded the pre-set value an alarm would be immediately triggered.flashfood.shop’s DilemmaFlashfood.Shop successfully built a self-service retail platform to connect catering suppliers of fresh meals with the targeted office worker consumers using ISM sales terminals and an ISS online service interface. It also kept the platform running while constructing a delivery system a marketing and promotion system and a set of standards for self-service retailing of fresh meals. By the end of June 2018 Flashfood.Shop had installed 51 ISMs in Zhongshan District Xigang District Shahekou District and Ganjingzi District in Dalian City with 14 catering suppliers and 135 different catered products. The number of customers exceeded the 500000 mark. Meanwhile the average sales volume of a single ISM increased from 8.43 servings per day to 30.25 servings per day with an average financial turnover increase from ¥121.51 to ¥410.81 per day. Also the rate of wastage of catering products dropped from the initial 27.97 per cent to 9.05 per cent.Ji was very happy to see such rapid development of Flashfood.Shop in just over one year. However behind the rapid development Flashfood.Shop was facing a loss in five consecutive quarters (see Exhibit 6). Although it was normal for start-ups to incur losses in their early stages Ji worried about his business. Flashfood.Shop’s only current source of income was the sale of its catering products which was not enough to support the operation. Current delivery costs were ¥1.5 per serving far from the optimal level of ¥0.8 per serving. Moreover operating costs were too high because of the instability of the ISMs and the ISS and because of low operating efficiency. Faced with this situation Ji was wondering how to resolve the problem of ongoing losses in consecutive quarters.EXHIBIT 1: MARKET SIZE and growth rate of china’s catering market

(SpruceLand) faced a difficult decision. Since SpruceLand’s inception in 1969 in the northern Alberta town of Slave Lake the company had a two-fold purpose: to earn a financial return and to engage in socially beneficial projects. SpruceLand was a community development company owned by individual members of the community. It had started through the sale of shares at CA$1 per share plus small investments from oil and gas companies entering the northern Alberta region as Alberta’s energy sector was starting to take off.A critical need for infrastructure and real estate development in the region combined with the opportunities associated with the increasing presence of oil and gas companies meant that SpruceLand had grown steadily from the 1970s through to 2009. The expansion was impressive but the company had not been structured to grow as large as it had become. Shares would occasionally trade hands privately mostly between existing shareholders; by 2016 shares were trading at about $22 per share. This price was approximately half the net value per share of SpruceLand’s properties themselves minus debt. The oil- and gas-fuelled Alberta economy had started to collapse in 2014 and now the board needed to make a difficult decision: Should it continue to operate as a profitable company with shares that were undervalued restructure or dissolve?NORTHERN ALBERTA REGIONThe northern Alberta region (the North) comprised 60 per cent of Alberta’s land area (see Exhibit 1) but in 2011 it was home to less than 11 per cent of Alberta’s population. The region was sparsely populated with a population density of just 0.97 persons per square kilometre compared with 5.7 persons per square kilometre for the rest of Alberta. With vast remote lands and awe-inspiring nature the North was often considered a “last frontier” that held immense opportunity for those who could stand the challenging weather and relative solitude.The 2011 National Household Survey revealed that the North had a relatively young population compared with the rest of Alberta and a 5.6 per cent unemployment rate with approximately 15 per cent of the population working in “mining quarrying and oil and gas extraction.” The survey also showed educational attainment levels largely similar to the rest of Alberta with two notable exceptions: the region had a higher proportion of both people with apprentice and trade credentials and people who lacked educational credentials. The region also had huge disparities with respect to where these two distinct groups were located: those people with the highest educational attainment levels tended to reside close to oil extraction activities.The region’s economic activity had steadily increased since the 1960s due to the discovery and subsequent extraction of oil and gas most notably in the Alberta oil sands. In 2011 workers in the Wood Buffalo region (Fort McMurray and area) earned nearly 90 per cent more than the median income in Alberta while other areas in the region generally fell below the median income for the province. The region was home to a relatively large Indigenous population comprising 18.4 per cent of the region’s total population compared with comprising 7.4 per cent of the overall population of Alberta. Almost 40 per cent of the population in the town of Slave Lake was Indigenous. The region was home to 28 First Nations and eight Metis settlements; however more than half of the Indigenous population lived off reserves or settlements. The former chief of the Sawridge First Nation Walter Twinn was one of the founding members of SpruceLand and had strongly advocated for more economic opportunities in the area.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN ALBERTAAlthough the energy industry had contributed to the growth and development of the North the northern and southern parts of Alberta had historically experienced and continued to experience similarity in terms of people’s standard of living opportunities for training and education and wages. The cost of living however was much higher in the North. In 2015 the North was still as a 1981 report suggested a resource of wealth for the South especially Calgary where most head offices for the energy industry and supporting services were located.The business of resource extraction had faced considerable booms and busts which had an immense impact on the North. Obtaining steady economic growth had been an ongoing concern. In addition to economic growth considerations for the future included social educational and cultural wealth. Commercial success did not guarantee social success and vice versa. Steady growth needed to be “sustainable social and economic development in the region in order to realize economic prosperity and a healthy society.” It had always been essential to find a way to ensure maximum positive social impact for residents of the area. When SpruceLand was first founded government reports described the North as “underdeveloped” (compared with the rest of Alberta) and the Alberta government had committed to community development efforts. The government recognized that the North had many strengths in terms of resources and opportunities but inherent in these strengths were also potential weaknesses: high costs the need for infrastructure and a small market. Transportation was listed as both a strength and a weakness. The government being the primary landowner in the North recommended interventions in terms of four development tools: (1) technical support (2) research and development (3) infrastructure and (4) financial incentives. The report however also came with the caveat that people needed to express “real needs in a coordinative fashion while at the same time not making endless demands on the public purse.”BACKGROUND of SPRUCELAND properties Inc. The town of Slave Lake was located in north-central Alberta roughly 260 kilometres north of Alberta’s provincial capital Edmonton. When SpruceLand was founded its former president and chief executive officer (CEO) Preston Manning recalled Slave Lake as being in “rough shape.” The town did not have paved streets had virtually no rental accommodation or commercial space and the population was in decline. Prior to Manning’s involvement and with the encouragement of a local civil servant Neil Gilliat five Slave Lake community members and local entrepreneurs—William Thomas Melvin Zachary Gordon Cook Joseph Mouallem and Walter Twinn—had incorporated Slave Lake Developments Ltd. a “community development company” with a two-fold purpose. They established that the company was to “earn profits for shareholders through the development of the physical resources of the Lesser Slave Lake region of Alberta” and it was “to overcome the problems of social and economic underdevelopment in the region through the exercise of private enterprise and initiative” with the goal of attracting further investment and opportunities to engage in profitable business partnerships.Shortly after incorporation the founders approached Manning and his father Ernest Manning to ask for their assistance in developing the initial projects. The founders argued that Slave Lake had potential to become an oil field service town but a lot of work was needed to make that happen. The founders did not want to stand idly while the government awarded contracts to outsiders or while large companies moved in. Instead the founders wanted the community to actively participate and create opportunities for development. The Mannings agreed to be involved. Manning believed that the key to achieving SpruceLand’s dual purpose was to obtain critical infrastructure and housing for Slave Lake and more economic opportunities for area residents. As a staunch conservative he argued that the solution was to gain access to the “tools of wealth creation” and specifically access to markets. With the aim of providing shareholder opportunities to as many community members as possible Manning suggested reincorporating the company as a public unlisted company which would enable both a larger number of local shareholders and the possibility of pursuing joint ventures with incoming oil companies thereby ultimately creating wealth for stakeholders in a way that government transfers never could. In 1970 Manning became SpruceLand’s inaugural president and CEO.A SOCIAL ENTERPRISESpruceLand was a rare example of an unlisted public corporation. It was “public” because the corporation was registered (with the Alberta Securities Commission) as a reporting issuer. This registration required the regular public dissemination of the company’s annual and interim financial reports management discussion and analysis and several other reports. Early on the company requested relief from some regulatory costs and received an exemption to file semi-annually instead of quarterly. The company was “unlisted” because the shares did not trade on a stock exchange such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or the TSX Venture Exchange. An exchange listing required additional disclosures and costs and requirements related to governance size and liquidity. SpruceLand succeeded in attracting more than 300 community-based shareholders which required it to choose a public structure. SpruceLand championed a “community focus” which meant seeking local solutions to local problems rather than turning to external governments and companies. It was not a non-profit; instead as an early example of “a social enterprise” SpruceLand focused on both social objectives and modest returns. Manning argued that the best way to involve the community was to give people direct access to participate in the venture. Accordingly 65000 shares were sold at $1 per share and no shareholder was permitted to own more than 10 per cent of all shares available. It took 18 months to sell all the shares because few community members had been exposed to investment opportunities so many assumed it was a scam. Manning and his successors therefore placed a great emphasis on establishing rapport and trust with the local communities. The advantage of a social enterprise went beyond giving people access to investment opportunities. The investors were not speculators and the local focus of the company made it possible to invest in their own community. Other investors had overlooked the region because capital was difficult to access for projects; returns were not as high as most developers would want. In other words investors required a higher rate of return before investing illiquid assets in projects located in uncertain locations. In 1970 the available housing in the town of Slave Lake was largely either temporary or substandard. The Alberta government had labelled housing as a critical need for the region. Slave Lake needed housing for both its current population and to attract new skilled workers to the oil fields. To meet this need SpruceLand’s first venture in Slave Lake was a 90-unit apartment and townhouse rental complex called Woodland Place. The mandate of the organization matched the project: to provide much-needed housing and to generate returns. The project cost $1 million and was funded partially with shareholder dollars combined with joint venture partners from the oil and gas industry: Imperial Oil Limited Exxon Mobil Corporation and Rainbow Pipe Line Company Limited. This initial capital enabled SpruceLand to take out a mortgage with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Woodland Place brought the much-needed workforce housing to the town and the project was an instant success. Within three years SpruceLand bought out its joint venture partners.GEOGRAPHICal EXPANSION AND REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO GROWTH In the years that followed SpruceLand turned a relatively small initial investment into a multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio—but not without difficulty. Despite the success of Woodland Place Manning still needed to approach 35 mortgage companies in an attempt to secure a mortgage for SpruceLand’s first commercial project in 1972: a 20000 square foot office building called Slave Lake Place. The mortgage lender which was also the area’s premier insurance company agreed to lend the funds only after Manning secured the Government of Alberta as the primary tenant. The Government would lease the space for offices and services rather than build its own facility thereby providing SpruceLand with market access that was otherwise out of reach. Three other projects followed: an office building an apartment building and a townhouse development all completed in the 1980s. SpruceLand started paying common share dividends in 1987. Manning resigned in 1987 to pursue a career in politics and Doug Victoor took over the reins of SpruceLand as president and CEO. Even through difficult economic times in the 1980s where prime rates were at more than 20 per cent Manning had paved the way for success with good initial investments collaborations with solid industry partners and a low debt to equity ratio. He had created a proven track record for SpruceLand which allowed Victoor to sell additional shares obtain financing for new projects and grow joint venture partnerships many of which were ongoing.With the help of trusted joint venture partners such as general contractors engineers and regulatory authorities Victoor skilfully and rapidly expanded SpruceLand with more residential and commercial/retail offerings within the Slave Lake region and beyond to other towns in the area. He also expanded outside the region entirely. SpruceLand bought apartment buildings in the towns of Athabasca St. Paul and Lac La Biche; several industrial properties in Nisku and Edmonton; and a mobile home park in Leduc. SpruceLand also invested in commercial space which it leased to retailers moving into the northern market. This expansion necessitated the name change from Slave Lake Developments Ltd. to SpruceLand Properties Inc.; Victoor realized that gaining shareholders’ trust in these new communities meant that the name of the company needed to reflect the broader regional focus. Victoor faced some backlash from shareholders who wanted the community development company to stay focused on the community of Slave Lake but he argued that the economic reality of working with increasingly bigger lenders necessitated diversification. The dividends during this time showed that Spruceland was successful. When Victoor’s health started to decline in 2005 Steve Cribb was brought in as a consultant and in 2006 he became president and CEO. Cribb took over a growing company and capitalized on lower interest rates by refinancing properties selling older properties and buying newer ones. Where Victoor had first faced some resistance in expanding outside of Slave Lake and the region the economic case for expansion now resonated with shareholders and Cribb was able to continue in this direction. Cribb led SpruceLand through a period of intense growth by constantly evaluating the company’s diversification. He described the company’s growth as a natural evolution helped along by the improvement of processes and investments. The regulatory system had also changed since SpruceLand’s inception and required an increasing degree of sophistication in business dealings. Shareholders were receiving annual dividends but if they wanted to sell their shares they needed to do so privately and were unable to achieve a price that reflected the value of the underlying assets. In 2015 SpruceLand had $120 million in assets (see Exhibit 2) which was likely too small for a public listing and too big for the original community-ownership model. In the meantime while the Board was considering current and developing market conditions and other related factors in September 2014 the Corporation received an unsolicited expression of interest from a western-based publicly traded entity (the “Initial Offeror”) regarding the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets. The Board determined that such an opportunity could be in the best interests of the Corporation and its Shareholders and consequently that it should consider the option.In the first quarter of 2015 oil prices had fallen from more than US$100 a barrel to less than US$50 (see Exhibit 3); however SpruceLand was conservatively positioned. The board knew that the extremely good conditions that SpruceLand had enjoyed for many years would not continue forever so it had been pursuing a strategic position that involved building up a significant (for the size of SpruceLand) cash reserve (see Exhibit 2). The cash reserve gave SpruceLand flexibility and protection in the event of a market event such as oil prices plummeting and an opportunity to take advantage of good buys when others needed to sell. The board was confident that SpruceLand was very well positioned.WINDING UP?The company was in good shape but the gap between asset value and market value was a problem especially as more of the original investors were starting to focus on estate planning. Why were investors trading the shares at such a low price relative to the property values? Meanwhile each year the company issued shares at the low valuation as part of a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) (see Exhibit 4). Cribb and the board disliked that long-time shareholders who wanted to sell their holdings had to accept less than full value for their shares. Victoor who was still on the board described a market that was favourable for action: interest rates were dropping capitalization rates were down and appraisals were up. Financially winding up the company by selling the properties seemed to be a straightforward way to realize the full value per share provided the company could pull it off. However emotionally it was more complicated. SpruceLand had succeeded by keeping shareholders largely local with 75 per cent of roughly 300 shareholders located in the Slave Lake region. Over the company’s almost 50 years in the Slave Lake community it had made a positive impact throughout the region: $11 million had been distributed to shareholders as dividends and economic activity had been created through employee payrolls and company purchases made in the community. SpruceLand had enabled locals to participate in a venture and to be a part of the development of the region. Victoor recalled a deeply invested working board and employees who could buy shares and feel like they were working for themselves. The company had progressed from a single project to having a $120-million diversified real estate portfolio and in doing so the company had enriched people’s lives both financially and socially. With the Alberta economy reeling from the freefall of oil prices the clock was ticking. Cribb and the board knew they needed to act to get surface value for shareholders. Should they dismantle Slave Lake’s innovative social enterprise success story use the company’s conservative positioning to take advantage of a market opportunity or restructure completely? What should the board do?EXHIBIT 1: MAP OF NORTHERN ALBERTANote: km = kilometres.Source: Created by the authors with assistance from Dr. Kwangyul Choi University of Calgary.

(Uber)’s chief product officer on April 25 2017 at the Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas Texas. “Flying cars have been promised for decades but are actually arriving now” said Holden. The self-proclaimed “Chief Not-Satisfied Officer” was excited to announce the launch of Uber Elevate Uber’s latest venture that aimed to cut two-hour commutes to 15-minute rides in the sky by 2020. “If you’re not planting the seeds for five to ten years out you’ll have no company in five to ten years” said Holden. “In that context it’s very natural for Uber to turn its eyes to the air.” Holden and his team at Uber started Uber Elevate with the intent to revolutionize the transportation industry and position the company as the world’s first “urban air transport” service. Flying cars would fundamentally change the way people were transported and would complement Uber’s staple services on the ground setting the company up for future success—so long as the company had a future. . . . On the same day it was estimated that Uber’s private stock price was reduced by 15 per cent and its overall value by US$10 billion following a string of scandals that included sexual harassment claims intellectual property theft upper-management resignations and illegal software-related activity.On June 20 2017 Uber investors demanded that Uber’s co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Travis Kalanick step down from his position leaving Jeff Holden and 13 other executives in charge of the company until a new CEO could be hired. Headlines read: “Uber Appears to Be in Self Destruct Mode” “Can Uber Be Saved from Itself?” and “Uber Has a Leadership Void at a Time of Crisis.” With no CEO chief operating officer chief financial officer or chief marketing officer launching Uber Elevate became a Herculean task for Holden and his team. On August 28 2017 Uber had finally found its new CEO in Dara Khosrowshahi former CEO of the travel-booking behemoth Expedia. In his initial meeting with staff Khosrowshahi quickly noted that “This company has to change.” He also emphasized his desire to take “big shots” and possibly conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in the next 18–36 months. Could Uber Elevate be the company’s next “big shot”? If so Holden would need to highlight the merits of flying cars to the new CEO. More importantly he and his team would need to articulate a strategy to get what would be named “UberAir” into the marketplace. Otherwise Uber Elevate risked being shelved indefinitely. COMPANY BACKGROUND Founded in March 2009 by Travis Kalanick of Los Angeles California and Garrett Camp of Calgary Alberta Uber started as a taxi-like ridesharing service that secured patrons using a cellphone application (app) and GPS (Global Positioning System) technology. Less than two years later the company was valued at $60 million. At Uber’s core customers were able to book a ride from an everyday driver at the press of a button. If you had a smartphone a licence a car car insurance and a clean driving record you qualified as an Uber driver. It was that easy. Kalanick and Camp chose a dynamic pricing model for Uber that charged riders in accordance with supply and demand. If there were few drivers and many customers Uber prices were high; if there were many drivers and few customers Uber prices were low. As the company grew it added to its taxi-like service by offering food delivery services (UberEats) business transportation services (Uber for Business) and freight services (Uber Freight). Ultimately Uber’s vision was “to make transportation as reliable as running water.” By 2014 the company’s offering consisted of four ridesharing services: Economy Premium Accessibility and UberPool. UberPool was Jeff Holden’s brainchild and the ridesharing equivalent to carpooling. In May 2016 Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group launched a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania as a pilot project for what the company hoped would be the future of autonomous taxi service and freight delivery. By January 2 2017 Uber was hailed as the world’s most valuable start-up with a valuation of nearly $70 billion. By this point the company had serviced more than one billion rides in more than 600 cities. Proposed benefits of Uber included the following: (1) Uber led to fewer cars on the road which led to less traffic congestion and less pollution; (2) Uber reduced the need for parking spaces which took up one-fifth of the land mass in major cities; (3) Uber reduced the need for people to buy and service a vehicle of their own; (4) Uber had statistically demonstrated that it reduced driving-under-the-influence offences and alcohol-related deaths; and (5) Uber was a quick reliable and safe 24-hour ridesharing service.RECENT EVENTS AT UBERAfter surging from a $60 million valuation to a $70 billion valuation in less than six years Uber seemed unstoppable—until June 2017 when Travis Kalanick was forced to step down as CEO following a seven-month snowball of scandals that included significant fines lawsuits federal investigations customer boycotts. and more as detailed below: December 2016: Uber employees admitted to regularly spying on high-profile individuals including politicians and celebrities. Without permits Uber tested an autonomous vehicle on the streets of San Francisco. The vehicle failed to stop at multiple red lights and put cyclists in danger. January 2017: Uber was fined $20 million for duping drivers. The company had falsely advertised earnings leaving drivers with far less money than promised. During a travel ban protest by the New York City Taxi Drivers Association Uber lifted “surge pricing” at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in an attempt to capitalize on the demand leading to a #DeleteUber campaign. February 2017: Travis Kalanick was forced to resign from Donald Trump's advisory council after users threatened to boycott the company. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler went public about Uber’s sexist and discriminatory culture which led to an investigation. Google filed a lawsuit against Uber claiming that the company had stolen autonomous transportation technology trade secrets. March 2017: Uber was caught using “Greyball” technology that allowed drivers to evade law enforcement which led to a federal investigation. Travis Kalanick was caught on camera yelling at an Uber driver after the driver complained about “declining rates” and “how hard it was to make a living off Uber.” Travis Kalanick and other senior employees visited an escort bar in Seoul Korea during a business trip leading to a human resources complaint from other employees on the trip. April 2017: Uber was caught using illegal software hacks and complicit drivers to spy on its major competitor Lyft. May 2017: Uber agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars to Uber drivers in New York City after the company kept a larger cut of the drivers’ profits than it was entitled to. June 2017: More than 20 Uber employees were fired following an investigation into sexual harassment claims and poor workplace culture. Uber executive Eric Alexander obtained the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver because he questioned the validity of her claim. Travis Kalanick took a leave of absence after an internal report was released regarding Uber’s horrendous corporate culture. In an all-staff meeting to combat Uber’s toxic work environment board member David Bonderman made a sexist joke forcing him to resign from his position hours later. Uber’s largest investor hand-delivered a letter to Travis Kalanick demanding he step down as CEO. As a result of these blunders by June 22 2017 (two days after Kalanick’s departure) Uber’s valuation plummeted by nearly $20 billion. Since launching in 2009 the company was facing its first real hardship which had led to 12 upper management departures and voids in critical executive positions.JEFF HOLDENOn February 14 2014 Travis Kalanick was “super-pumped” to announce the hiring of Jeff Holden as Uber’s new chief product officer (CPO). Holden former vice-president of product development at Groupon was hired to “solve Uber’s hardest problems and invent [the company’s] future.” Kalanick had been drawn to Holden because of his previous experience at Amazon where he had been described as “the ‘mercury’ planet orbiting closest to Jeff Bezos’ Sun.” It was an impressive post given that Bezos was at the time the richest man in the world. Holden’s tenure at Amazon prepared him for the turbulence that came with working for a “hyper-growth” firm giving him the experience and poise needed to scale Uber and take the company to the next level. His experience proved to be of benefit during Holden’s first major project “UberPool” which was a smashing success that accounted for 20 per cent of all Uber drives by April 2017. Given Holden’s achievements the CPO was given full authority to lead Uber into the future resulting in Uber Elevate or what had been named “UberAir.” In a 100-page white paper elaborating on the who what when where and why of flying cars Holden and his team believed that the future of commuting lay in Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) transportation: On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility giving people back time lost in their daily commutes. . . . Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground. A network of small electric aircraft that take off and land vertically (called Vertical Take-off and Landing or VTOL and pronounced vee-tol) will enable rapid reliable transportation between suburbs and cities and ultimately within cities. ELECTRIC VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING“The Elevate white paper articulated our thought process; why not urban aviation? Why can’t we do this?” asked Holden at the Uber Elevate Summit. “I hate the term flying cars but we’re going to have to live with it” he said. To the audience it may have seemed that electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft served the same purpose as cars (i.e. getting people from point A to point B) but in Holden’s eyes they were considerably different. However powering the eVTOL aircraft used an amount of electricity comparable to that of a small grocery store causing Holden and his team to admit that their energy consumption posed a feasibility barrier in terms of latent battery technology. Other barriers to eVTOL included the certification process vehicle efficiency vehicle performance and reliability air traffic control cost and affordability safety aircraft noise emissions city infrastructure and pilot training. Uber would have much to overcome if the company wanted to see UberAir come to life. After releasing the white paper critics of Uber Elevate believed that Uber needed a reality check that the company’s flying car plans were a fantasy and as Tesla visionary Elon Musk put it: “it’s difficult to imagine the flying car becoming a scalable solution.”Holden responded in his closing remarks at the Uber Elevate Summit on April 26 2017 stating “There have been hundreds of articles written very favorable and very excited . . . and very much about the clear transition from skepticism into ‘Hey I think this is actually going to happen’ and that’s incredibly exciting.” Holden proclaimed that he and his team had partnered with leading eVTOL manufacturers high-profile investors air traffic control executives influential politicians and policy makers NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) scientists elite engineers and other eVTOL specialists who shared the belief that Uber Elevate could and would be successful. “Everyone has as much passion as the Elevate team to bring this future to fruition” said Holden. “In order to hit these ambitious goals . . . we’re going to need to put the pedal down.” Continuing with his speech Holden stated that Uber’s eVTOL aircraft could be expected to launch in two cities—Dallas Texas and Dubai United Arab Emirates—by 2020. The initial UberAir service in the United States would travel from Frisco Station Texas to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (a drive that normally took 70 minutes) in an estimated eight minutes (see Exhibit 1). Similarly the United Arab Emirates route travelling from Jumeirah Beach to the Dubai International Airport would turn a 45-minute automobile commute into an estimated seven-minute eVTOL flight (see Exhibit 2) thereby solidifying Holden’s claim that on-demand aviation would be an incredibly time-saving and efficient mode of transportation (see Exhibits 3 and 4). VEHICLE PERFORMANCEBy April 2017 Uber had partnered with industry-leading manufacturers such as Bell Helicopter Aurora Flight Sciences Pipistrel Mooney and Embraer. This ecosystem along with Uber’s other various partners had been assembled to design eVTOL aircraft that most notably would be able to accomplish the following goals: (1) vertically take off and land in 30 seconds and hover for up to one minute; (2) reach cruising speeds between 150 and 230 miles (240 to 370 kilometres) per hour; (3) carry a minimum of two to a maximum of four people (including a pilot); (4) travel a minimum 50-mile (80-kilometre) round trip at maximum speed; and (5) have fully autonomous capabilities. RIDER EXPERIENCEJeff Holden credited Uber’s previous success to the company’s “magical ride experience” and ensured customers that UberAir would deliver just that. In the Uber Elevate white paper Holden noted that UberAir would complement traditional transportation methods. In a best-case scenario UberAir would take riders directly to their destination. In a worst-case scenario UberAir combined with Uber’s ground services and/or public transportation would transport customers from point to point. Similar to Uber’s traditional ridesharing services selecting UberAir on the company’s app would provide riders with an itinerary including sequenced walking or driving directions on either end of a trip making any commute easy to navigate (see Exhibit 5). According to Holden and his team boarding an eVTOL aircraft would require minimal assistance. Most aircraft would have direct access by elevator (if on top of a building) or by an automobile drop-off entrance (if on the ground). The white paper stated that Uber planned on building sheltered waiting portals that also provided customers with washrooms refreshments instructional information and signage on what to expect. Before boarding riders would be directed to their eVTOL aircraft where they’d be allowed to stow bags or luggage. Once boarded and ready for departure the eVTOL aircraft would take approximately 30 seconds to propel upward in its vertical takeoff. Once in the air Holden noted that passengers could expect the same noise level as a commercial aircraft flight. Unlike a helicopter ride riders would not need to wear noise-cancelling headphones. Within the cabin passengers would be able to access real-time trip information including location and remaining time. Finally upon arrival riders would have the option to take Uber ground transportation service to a second destination if needed. SAFETY CONCERNSSafety concerns for Uber Elevate included severe weather pilot error loss of situational awareness engine failure battery failure injury due to turbulence landing errors birds and other aerial hazards. Despite these concerns Uber vowed to make eVTOL aircrafts twice as safe as cars; however doing so might prove challenging. Historically per 100000 driving miles (160000 kilometres) fatality rates in the United States were two times greater in air taxis than in cars. However the company understood that a high level of perceived safety was critical for early adoption and that this safety goal needed to be achieved for UberAir to be a success. URBAN INFRASTRUCTUREUber planned on taking advantage of already established infrastructure in major cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. For example downtown Los Angeles had 40 high-rise helipads that the company wished to convert into “vertiports” and “vertistops.” Vertiports (see Exhibit 6) were designed to be eVTOL hubs with multiple takeoff and landing sites along with charging stations and small maintenance spaces. Vertistops (see Exhibit 7) were designed to be single pads for drop-off and pickup. Although new infrastructure would be needed Uber was primarily focused on repurposing existing assets which it believed would be the most cost-effective and efficient way forward. For Uber repurposing a highway cloverleaf was one type of infrastructure thought to offer several advantages as a vertistop site including less stringent noise standards over highways clear paths of transport and less conflict with private property. Other areas that UberAir desired to utilize included roofs of parking garages office towers harbour-side barrages and existing spaces such as parking lots. ECONOMICS AND FEASIBILITYInitial costs were estimated to be significant; near-term costs expensive; and long-term costs advantageous. In launching UberAir economy-of-scale forces were significant and represented a material input for the costs associated with the service over time.It was estimated that the eVTOL aircraft would be utilized 50 per cent of the time (between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. each weekday) for 260 days per year. Maintaining such rates of utilization was thought to be critical for UberAir’s business model to succeed. It was believed that eVTOL aircraft would have a useful life of 13 years and a salvage value of 30 per cent of production costs which equated to approximately 400000 miles (640 kilometres) per year and 5 million miles (8 million kilometres) per aircraft. Meanwhile battery power costs were pegged at $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh) while the successful eVTOL prototype was expected to achieve 2 miles/kWh (3 kilometres/kWh) or better. During the initial stage and the near-term stage piloting needs were assumed to be 1.5 pilots per aircraft at $50000 per salary. Pilots would need a sport aircraft licence to operate an eVTOL aircraft. In the long term a $60000 improvement to avionics was assumed which would drop the cost of piloting. When artificial intelligence (AI) was employed to pilot eVTOL aircrafts in the future the need for pilots would decrease to one-eighth as a virtual flight deck would be available in case emergency human intervention was needed. The total cost per eVTOL aircraft in the initial stage had been estimated to be approximately $1.2 million with 100 units manufactured. Near-term costs were estimated at $600000 with 500 units manufactured. In the long term costs were estimated at $200000 with 5000 units manufactured. Travel distances needed to be sufficient to gain efficiency over current transportation options. At slow speeds automobiles provided a more efficient form of transport but as speeds increased automobile efficiency decreased. Unlike automobiles eVTOL efficiency had been proven to increase with speed to a point of maximum efficiency before declining. The eVTOL aircraft’s efficiency would be maximized at approximately 125 miles (200 kilometres) per hour (see Exhibit 8). COMPETITIONUber intended to be an intermediary between passengers and eVTOL aircraft. As a result competition in this space was relatively narrow. Uber’s main competitor in the “push a button get a flight” sector was the same as its primary competitor on land—Lyft. Although Lyft had yet to take a stance on entering the flying car market the company had the rider base and technology needed to challenge Uber in this domain. Several other competitors were looking to make flying cars a reality by 2020. For example eVolo the German eVTOL manufacturer was on the verge of piloting an air-taxi service. The Volocopter 2X could fit two people and fly for up to 17 minutes on a 40-minute charge. Another company A3 was developing a single-passenger eVTOL aircraft that was expected to pilot by the end of 2017. The company planned on making trips on the aircraft as affordable as a taxi by 2020. Airbus was working on CityAirbus an UberPool-style flying drone that could be booked by multiple patrons via an app. The Chinese drone company EHang launched its flying-taxi prototype in July 2017 in the city of Dubai. It was able to carry 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and cruise at more than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometres per hour). Another company Terrafugia was building an eVTOL hybrid that could take off fly and land autonomously. Drivers needed a sport pilot licence to operate the vehicle. Yet another company Kitty Hawk was working on a Google-associated single-passenger eVTOL aircraft which was expected to launch by 2020. It could only be flown over water however.More broadly UberAir was competing against alternative modes of futuristic transportation such as Hyperloop. The American bullet-through-a-chamber-like transportation company which had top speeds as high as 700 miles per hour (1100 kilometres per hour) claimed it would be able to transport people and/or things from Los Angeles California to Las Vegas Nevada in 30 minutes or less (a drive that normally took 4.5 hours) for as little as $20. LOOKING FORWARDIn his closing remarks at the Uber Elevate Summit Holden told the audience and those watching around the world that “his hope and dream is to be at scale with Elevate as part of our daily lives in 10 years.” He believed however that “we’ll be seeing it around everywhere well before that.” With the hiring of Dara Khosrowshahi Holden understood the importance to the new CEO of solidifying Uber Elevate’s worth both strategically and financially. With so many challenges facing Uber’s business model and threatening the company’s future was it the right time to proceed with Uber Elevate? How could Holden be sure that UberAir could and would be the success that he and his partners believed it would be? What steps were needed to ensure such success? These were only a few of the questions that Holden had to ask himself before pitching Uber Elevate as the company’s next “big shot” to both Dara Khosrowshahi and the board of directors. Not lacking faith in the project Holden wrapped up his speech at the Uber Elevate Summit by stating “I can say with great confidence every rider everywhere is going to be excited about this and want to take advantage of the UberAir service. . . . Together we’re inventing the future of transportation.”Exhibit 1: UberAIR’s Estimated Travel Time from Dallas to Frisco Station TexasSource: Jeff Holden “Uber Elevate & The Future of Urban Mobility” April 25 2017 accessed September 1 2017https://uber.app.box.com/s/jv1p4nwt4ijo67f3fss1098d9wog7bmd.

(Eco Tasar) was not his usual cheerful self. He seemed rather annoyed. Pandya was feeling frustrated that in spite of his best efforts to help all employees understand accept and value the business of the organization he was struggling with his sales team. How could he find an employee who was a good fit for his sales team?Pandya A Social Entrepreneur in the MakingPandya had graduated from a premier business school in India in 1990. In a campus selection at his college he was the first in his class to be hired by a prestigious public sector undertaking (PSU) a government-owned company. Six months into his job Pandya was unhappy as he did not find the work to be sufficiently challenging. With his strong entrepreneurial bent Pandya harboured a strong desire to create a business of his own. Although he was newly married Pandya quit his easy job in the PSU after just over a year. Over the next eight years he worked on several different assignments which led to hardships but also satisfied his hunger for challenges. In 2000 he joined the Professional Assistance for Development Action (PRADAN) a national non-governmental organization (NGO) in India that worked for the economic betterment of tribal communities in the villages of the Indian state of Jharkhand. PRADAN helped the traditional Tasar silk cocoon rearers by providing techno-managerial support to increase their incomes from cocoon rearing. PRADAN also organized women from poor households to take up an income-generating activity such as yarn making from the silk cocoons that were available locally. Pandya was hired to help the organization set up the market linkage for the yarn made by the women in the villages. Subsequently in 2004 PRADAN facilitated the setting up of Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. a company owned by the yarn makers themselves. The company was staffed with professionals who helped manage the centralized purchase of raw material. The professionals also helped in the marketing of the yarn directly to the weaving communities through value addition—that is by making the yarn into fabric and other woven items.Pandya who was looking after the marketing of yarn and also the fabric division at PRADAN decided to strike out on his own. He and Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. agreed to set up the fabric division as a separate joint venture (JV) wherein Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. provided the initial capital and Pandya managed this company as a co-owner.PRADAN too realized that it would be better for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. to remain focused on the activity of yarn production and to create a separate entity to undertake the activity of adding value to the yarn by converting it into such products as sarees stoles dupattas and bedcovers and then selling these products in the market. Pandya succeeded in convincing the top management of PRADAN that such an action would be a prudent business decision and in the best interests of the community. In 2007 PRADAN promoted Eco Tasar Silk Private Limited a JV company formed between Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. and Khitish Pandya the social entrepreneur. The JV served three purposes: first it helped to expand the demand for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd.’s yarn by using it in its own production; second its activities generated income for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. which helped Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. to stabilize its otherwise commodity-based business; third it served as an outlet for introducing to the market designs made using Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. yarn. the Handloom Industry in India: A Peek into the Business DynamicsThe Indian handloom industry operated by weavers who had a deep sense of art and culture was a true reflection on the diversity and richness of Indian culture. Indian handloom products had always been known for their unique designs and finesse. Handloom products were exceptional by the virtue of the handloom’s flexibility and versatility which encouraged experimentation. Handlooms were superior to power looms because of their ability to introduce innovative designs which the power loom could not replicate. The handloom industry engaged nearly six million workers making it the second-largest employment provider for the rural population in India after agriculture. This sector contributed nearly 19 per cent of the total cloth produced in India and added substantially to export earnings.SilkWorldwide India was second only to China in silk production accounting for almost 18 per cent of global raw silk production. India produced more than 28 thousand tons of silk per annum with sericulture activities spread across more than 52000 villages. India enjoyed a unique position in sericulture as it produced all the commercially useful varieties of silk. The Indian silk industry was a major generator of both employment and foreign exchange for the country. Key Markets In the financial year (FY) 2015–16 Indian silk exports stood at US$181.5 million. Most of the export earnings came from ready-made silk garments which accounted for almost 74 per cent of the total silk export earnings. Natural silk yarn and fabrics comprised 24 per cent of silk export earnings. The major export markets of Indian silk goods were the United Arab Emirates and the United States. Western Europe was another major market with the United Kingdom France Italy and Germany being the main importers of silk products. The silk products exported included ready-made garments fabrics carpets and natural silk yarn.Tasar SilkTasar was a copper-coloured coarse silk mainly used for furnishings and interiors. It was less lustrous than mulberry silk but had its own feel and appeal. Tasar silk was produced by a silkworm that mainly thrived on a specific variety of trees found in only certain areas of India. The rearing of the worm was done in a natural way on trees in the open. In India the states of Bihar and Jharkhand were the largest Tasar silk producers and Tasar culture was a mainstay for many of their tribal communities. Tasar silk was also produced in the states of Chhattisgarh Odisha Maharashtra West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. The demand for Indian Tasar silk had witnessed modest growth between 2010 and 2013. Earnings from the export of Tasar silk goods grew from $50 million in FY 2010–11 to $54 million in FY 2012–13. The sector had been growing steadily albeit at a moderate pace.The Ecosystem for handloom silkHandloom weaving was a prevalent economic activity in many rural parts of India. A large section of the rural population was completely dependent on this activity as their only source of livelihood. Despite the various government-launched programs to promote the handloom silk sector it faced numerous challenges. Firstly the sector competed with power looms which benefited from economies of scale leading to a lower production cost compared with the cost of producing similar products using the handloom. Compared with handlooms power looms offered both a more competitive selling price and a profit margin advantage. Secondly compared with power looms handloom production technology because of its dependence on the speed and skill of the weaver required more time to produce a given quantity of product. As a result in the handloom market supply was unable to match demand. Thus managing supply order deadlines was often a challenge for companies offering handloom silk products. This situation led to missed sales opportunities even when the market had the potential to buy more products. The power loom players regularly exploited this situation as they were easily able to fill the demand–supply gap. Thirdly the new generation in the silk weaver community was steadily moving toward adopting other vocations. This trend was a result of traditional weaving being seen as less economically beneficial compared with other vocations. As a result with each passing year fewer skilled weavers were available to drive the handloom industry. Fourthly the silk handloom sector was largely unorganized with a large number of small players who were in most cases sole proprietorships. In such an environment assuring quality and best practices to the customers remained a challenge. Last but not the least customers in the domestic (i.e. Indian) market were price-sensitive. Also most domestic customers did not differentiate between handloom and power loom products which led to adverse conditions for handloom products and favourable conditions for power loom products. In the export market especially in North America and Europe customers valued the exotic and creative qualities of handloom fabrics. However this market was sensitive about product quality conformity to international standards on production processes and prompt delivery of products. For the Indian silk handloom sector these requirements continued to remain a challenge. The buying behaviour of the customers of silk products as explained above distinctly segmented the market into two categories. One market segment was niche catering to select discerning customers mostly in Europe North America and the Middle East. The niche segment had some presence in India; however this customer base constituted a very small fraction of the overall potential customer base. The other market segment comprised solely the customers in India the local market who were very price-sensitive and often did not differentiate between handloom and power loom products. This market segment dictated the need for different products and marketing strategies as per the requirements of a particular market segment. Eco Tasar’s Business PhilosophyPandya’s vision was to create a social enterprise that was not just self-sustaining but also commercially competitive to ensure that it remained capable of effectively supporting the social cause at its core. In line with his vision Pandya incorporated Eco Tasar with the objective of building a business that created wage opportunities for a large number of producers of handmade yarn handloom weavers and other producers in the textiles value chain by promoting a sustainable and fair business model. Guided and supported by eminent individuals from the social work arena including Deep Joshi a Ramon Magsaysay Award winner; Satyabrata Acharya; and Anish Kumar Pandya formulated the mission of the organization as follows: “Creation of wage opportunity for a large number of producers of handmade yarn handloom weavers and other producers in the textiles value chain through a sustainable and fair business model.”Eco Tasar’s Growth Story From humble beginnings Eco Tasar had grown to a strong team of 89 members working full-time for the organization. From only $0.35 million in revenue in FY 2008–09 the company had boosted its revenue to $2.8 million in FY 2015–16. The company had grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past five years (see Exhibit 1).Over time Eco Tasar had specialized in Tasar and Eri silks. Its expertise was in making well-designed handwoven products using hand-spun silk yarn. The company offered a wide range of high-quality Tasar products that included such off-the-loom items as scarves stoles sarees and shawls and fabricated items such as cushion and duvet covers. Eco Tasar’s overall number of stock keeping units ranged between 2000 and 3000 items that were sourced directly from the artisans. Weaving and dyeing was done as close to the artisans as possible. Lastly and most importantly Eco Tasar had chosen the path of using only handmade yarn or fabric and had never been enticed by the lure of power looms. Eco Tasar was focused on design-driven products. The contemporary designs which exuded an aesthetically understated elegance appealed to contemporary working women. The products were positioned in the mid-price bracket making them attractive to those who desired elegance at affordable cost. Eco Tasar was known for providing designs and weaving styles to unserviced and under-serviced markets giving it an edge over local wholesale suppliers which typically did not carry such inventory. Moreover Eco Tasar introduced a large number of designs in quick succession which kept buyers’ interest alive. Eco Tasar invested in a fabrication unit to make and sell cushion covers and other home furnishings. It also expanded its weaving base from Bhagalpur to Fulia in West Bengal a state in northeast India and was also exploring weaving clusters in South India. It supplied stores across India and exported to the United States the United Kingdom Germany Italy France Colombia South Africa Japan Malaysia Australia Spain and Greece. Its clients included Fabindia Tribes Nalli Cinnamon Amethyst Casablanca and Parthas in India; West Elm (sister brand of Pottery Barn Group) John Robshaw Textiles Novica Sevya and Fair Trade Original in the United States and Europe; The White Company in the United Kingdom; and Amor Collections in the Netherlands.Eco Tasar was on an expansion mission to create greater demand for Tasar silk yarn. The company was leveraging its marketing outreach to help women yarn makers in Madhya Pradesh and Assam especially those living in poverty by providing technical training and by sourcing yarn from them. Eco Tasar continued to support Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. by buying more than 30 per cent of the yarn it produced.In the past decade Eco Tasar’s social program in collaboration with PRADAN and other NGOs such as Grameen Sahara had made a definitive impact in the lives of thousands of village men and women the yarn makers and weavers. The enterprise undertook a major scaling-up of its operations from 590 artisans in FY 2011–12 to 1954 artisans by FY 2013–14 disbursing almost $0.73 million in wages.Eco Tasar aspired to emerge as a leading player in the handloom silk market by 2020. It had set high benchmarks in the areas of market and social impact and planned to achieve the set standards by employing best practices and the latest technology in all facets of the value chain. The growth vision and the focus areas of the company are summarized in Exhibit 2.In 2012 Eco Tasar was recognized with a Sankalp-Samridhi Award for creating a business that in addition to being viable and competitive focused on the welfare of artisans living in poverty. Eco Tasar was also recognized as a valued partner in testimonials posted by clients such as West Elm.Challenges along the Growth PathPandya was satisfied with the growth of his business. He enjoyed receiving recognition in the industry and the company had achieved a comfortable market share. His supplier and distribution networks were stable. He had good employees and valued their loyalty. The attrition rate of his employees was lower than that of the industry. However the path of growth had its challenges. In the early days of the organization Pandya had a small team that included designers production personnel and an accountant. In addition to managing the complete administration of the business Pandya also handled the important functions of marketing and sales although his designers sometimes pitched in to also act as marketing professionals. This arrangement continued for some time; however as the company grew Pandya started to feel stressed while also managing other functions. “It’s time to look for a few marketing professionals” Pandya thought. To drive sales he decided to hire young graduates who had qualifications in the domain of design. Pandya assumed that it would be easy to train these young minds. the Decision to Hire Marketing Professionals with ExperienceOne day when Pandya arrived early at the office he was surprised to see the designer Jatin Chandra already at work trying to clear some backlog as he was expecting a new order. Pandya sat down with Chandra and said that he wanted to share some of his concerns with him. Pandya said that the company had hired some talented young employees to handle the marketing tasks but that the required training was draining his energy. He said that despite all his efforts he still received unexpected calls from those employees when they were unable to handle customers’ queries. He noted “It does put me off but then they are not to blame. Maybe they are not experienced enough to handle such queries and maybe they will take some more time to learn.” Chandra advised Pandya that in view of the scale at which the business was growing it was time for the sales responsibility to be handled by people who had experience. The day carried on as usual but Pandya ruminated over Chandra’s suggestion. Finally by the end of the day he concluded that Chandra’s suggestion was a good idea that merited implementation.Pandya arranged for advertisements to be published in the leading daily newspapers seeking suitable candidates for positions of marketing professionals. Response to the advertisement was good. Several candidates from larger export houses responded; in most cases they desired to change jobs mostly for a salary increase and a higher position. After screening the candidates Manish Mathur was selected. Mathur had 11 years’ experience in marketing at a mid-sized textile firm that used power loom technology. Pandya mused “With a 20 per cent hike over his current salary as per his expectations Mathur should be motivated enough to put in his best. His experience will help us boost our sales and I can concentrate on operations.”the Baggage of past work experience On May 1 2008 Mathur joined Eco Tasar and began two weeks of orientation. Pandya had Mathur accompany him to all his meetings and encouraged him to ask as many questions as needed to clarify any uncertainties. In his initial five months Mathur did his best by meeting with clients and trying to convince them of the romance of handwoven textiles. With persistent efforts Mathur was able to secure larger orders from existing clients and he was successful in developing two new clients which marginally increased sales. Mathur was settling in well and he expected to secure larger deals in the near future. This trend was also reflected in his sales results curve in previous companies: gradual at first and increasingly steep thereafter. Mathur set challenging goals and shared them with Pandya. Pandya was happy to see enthusiasm in his new marketing manager but advised him to be realistic and patient in his approach as this market differed from the markets that Mathur had previously dealt with. As time passed Mathur’s body language started to reflect what seemed to be impatience and disappointment. He was planning to achieve sales growth at exponential scales and yet he was struggling to achieve even low linear growth. Sales were not moving as expected but Pandya did not become impatient.One day Pandya saw Mathur in an animated discussion with the finance manager in his cubicle. He went closer and overheard Mathur saying “It is no fun doing business with such small timers. I have never been used to catering to small customers. At bigger companies you get to make bigger sales and accordingly your incentives shoot up.” Initially Mathur had not noticed Pandya approaching. When he did see Pandya Mathur and the manager stood up and greeted him. Pandya greeted them back and sat down with them. Having overheard Mathur’s complaint Pandya addressed him: “I can see that you possibly are a little dissatisfied with the kind of transactions you are handling. You do not seem to be comfortable with having to deal with multiple albeit smaller customers. You are rather more comfortable in working on fewer but larger deals.” Pandya further said “That is the challenge here. Every business encounters different challenges and that is where you get to learn and grow.” “I will be able to make huge sales if it were not just handloom products. There is no point being rigid about this; business needs to make better profits” shot back Mathur. Such conversations would continue endlessly but Mathur made no attempt to try to adapt to the situation. One and one-half years into Mathur’s job Pandya called Mathur and said that Mathur’s discontentment and his continual comparison between big and small companies was not helping him. Pandya asked him to take time develop the right perspective toward the business that he was now in and change his attitude. Later in November 2009 Mathur spoke arrogantly to a customer who had submitted a small order. This incident made Pandya realize that things were likely not working out with Mathur and he asked him to leave Eco Tasar for the best interests of the company and himself. Pandya said “You should not be working for an organization where you look at it as a step down in your career.” Mathur left Eco Tasar in December 2009.Immediately thereafter on December 15 2009 Rahul Rai joined the company. He had previously worked for almost eight years at a mid-sized export house. Rai expressed a desire for more responsibilities and challenging assignments. Pandya saw in Rai a good candidate for the role of marketing. Rai too went through a carefully planned orientation schedule which allowed him time to understand the business and settle into his new position. Pandya familiarized Rai with the business philosophy the supply chain the designing and production processes and the clients in the market both current and prospective.Rai settled into his job and Pandya soon noticed that Rai was putting in long hours as he made concerted efforts to develop new clients and secure larger orders from the current clients. Rai made good progress which Pandya appreciated. However as time passed Rai began to show signs of poor motivation and frustration. He began to struggle to meet his own set marketing targets.One day during an informal gathering in the office Rai walked up to Pandya and shared: Things were so structured in my previous organization. Here one has to do many related tasks. There it was nice having a set job description and working only for a particular vertical. We didn’t have to do other unnecessary tasks. Don’t you think it is a sheer waste of time? In addition it is tough to convince customers. Here in the time that it takes to convince one customer in my previous organization I would have made three sales.Pandya thought that Rai was looking for a support system. It seemed as though Rai had not done any homework before joining Eco Tasar. Although his expectation of a pay increase had been met he never shared that he would be unable to work in a multitasking environment. This attitude was not acceptable to Pandya. Considering the company’s marketing targets and over the past two years Rai’s limitations in achieving those targets Pandya decided to support him with another marketing professional. In February 2012 Ravish Ranjan joined Eco Tasar and was happy after the salary negotiation. He came from a company that was of similar size as Eco Tasar in terms of revenue and had a reasonably large market share in the domestic market. Pandya recalled that Ranjan had told him during the interview that he was stagnating in terms of his learning and development.Ranjan seemed to settle in well. He and Rai appeared to be a compatible and focused team. However seven months into his job Ranjan reflected his concerns: “At other places you made huge sales in one go and earned attractive incentives whereas here you need to cater to individual consumers and end up selling only in small quantities. My patience is running out with such small orders.”Pandya tried to explain the situation to Ranjan: “I think that is where your selling skill comes into the picture. Eco Tasar is thriving on boutique customers. You need to put in some effort to sell artisanal products with a story. It is never the same when you are selling stuff in bulk . . . the dynamics are different.” Ranjan was an entrepreneurial worker. He had no problems multitasking as was typically expected in such a set-up. Over time Ranjan would repeatedly suggest to Pandya that the business would do well to enter into the polyester business. On one occasion Ranjan said “Polyester sells like hot cakes. For polyester items you can sell 5000 pieces for $3 each whereas a similar piece in silk would sell for nothing less than $12.” To this comment Pandya replied “That’s where I differ. My enterprise stands for artisans. Eco Tasar’s mandate was to create work for others through our work. I am quite clear that I would not switch over to any other model even at the cost of forgoing opportunities for huge profits.” Ranjan persisted: “I still suggest you reconsider this sales model. For me it is business first and then society. Sorry to say but Eco Tasar will find it very difficult to survive. You know getting into polyester . . . I will be able to bring in a lot of sales through my contacts from my previous organization.” Pandya tried to explain to Ranjan that he needed to rethink his sales strategy: It doesn’t matter. You do not need to get that many customers. Try to hunt up and cater to the smaller ones who really prize handloom material. That is what Eco Tasar came into existence for. If the artisans put so much of effort into creating finery and magnificence in a piece then I think the salesperson also needs to go that extra mile and convince the customer to buy. However a switch from the current sales model is not remotely possible! A few months dragged on with poor sales; then on December 25 2013 Ranjan walked up to Pandya and said “I have tried my bit. Since I am on an incentive scheme it is difficult. It might be a very respected sales model but it is getting difficult for me to sustain. I can no longer continue unless you rethink the product.” Within a week of this conversation Ranjan left Eco Tasar.Pandya now felt that those who had experience in for-profit organizations were not suitable for working at Eco Tasar. He then considered seeking someone with experience in a not-for-profit organization. In February 2014 Pandya hired Binu Raj who had worked in an NGO that was involved in promoting cottage industries in the undeveloped areas of central India. During the interview Raj had exhibited a strong passion for working for social causes. Like he had for the others Pandya ensured a thorough orientation period for Raj.Raj settled into Eco Tasar well and was comfortable with the work. However over a period of time Pandya realized that sales targets did not seem to be Raj’s primary focus. Although Raj enjoyed his trips to the villages where Eco Tasar sourced its yarn and was often promising the weavers better prospects his enthusiasm in the core production processes was not translating into a drive for sales. This situation however never seemed to perturb Raj. Pandya was happy that Raj had settled into the work and was not complaining about sales issues. However Pandya was also concerned that Raj was not able to drive up sales. Even more disturbing was the fact that Raj did not seem to be troubled by the often moderate-to-weak sales figures quarter after quarter. Pandya’s DilemmaPandya wondered “I have tried people with different backgrounds but all seemed to have failed in letting go of the baggage of their background. They were either unable to adjust to the values of the organization or did not understand the need for being sufficiently competitive to ensure sustainability.” While Pandya knew that demand existed for Eco Tasar’s products he was not able to understand what had gone wrong with the marketing professionals. Pandya wondered whether he would be better off going back to the earlier arrangement wherein he ran the show himself with young graduates and trainees supporting him. Pandya continued to wonder what he should do to address the issue.Exhibit 1: ECo tasar’s Consolidated Statements 2011–2016 (for year ending March 31)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1.00 = ₹50.87 on March 31 2012; US$1.00 = ₹54.30 on March 31 2013; US$1.00 = ₹59.96 on March 31 2014; US$1.00 = ₹62.27 on March 31 2015; US$1.00 = ₹66.25 on March 31 2012.Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: ECO TASAR’S Aspirations 2020—Creating a Social and Market Impact by Leveraging TechnologySocial ImpactTouch at least 20000 producers by 2020.Target 25% of Eco Tasar sales to be allocated to wages.Cycle back profits of Eco Tasar for equitable distribution among all stakeholders.

It was Monday January 7 2019 and LYFEN had celebrated its eighteenth year of operation. A leading snack food chain brand in China LYFEN had achieved steady growth since its inception with record revenues of ¥3.9 billion in 2018. Yu reflected on the current situation:LYFEN’s supplier management capabilities have contributed significantly to the company’s success. We treat suppliers as if they are part of the organization an approach that is unique to our industry. However we have high expectations. LYFEN provides a premium product and our suppliers are required to meet or exceed the current industry standards for quality and food safety without compromising cost or delivery performance. We also expect suppliers to work closely with us in areas such as new product development. LYFEN understands the important role that our suppliers play in supporting company growth going forward.The company’s strategy for 2019 included expansion into new regions and the introduction of new products. Initiatives were also underway to promote the company’s brand and explore new distribution channels such as online sales. During her meeting with Shi the following Wednesday Yu was planning to provide an update on LYFEN’s supplier management activities discuss opportunities for improvements and identify initiatives aimed at supporting the company’s strategic objectives. The Chinese Snack Food IndustrySnack foods offered consumers ready-to-eat small portions outside of regular meals. A shift in modes of food consumption as a result of greater mobility busy consumer life styles; and a desire for greater convenience contributed to the growth of the snack food market segment. Generally snack food products were classified into nine broad categories: nuts meat preserves cakes soy aquatic dried fruit and vegetables chocolate candies and puffed foods.The upstream industries in the supply chain included agriculture and aquaculture and food processing and packaging. Suppliers included large international brands such as General Mills Inc. PepsiCo Inc. and Mondelez International Inc. as well as small regional food processors ingredient manufacturers and distributors. Snack foods were sold to consumers through a variety of sales channels such as food stores supermarkets convenience stores vending machines and online shops.The snack food market in China was approximately ¥485 billion in 2017 up from ¥393 billion in 2013 (see Exhibit 1). Industry forecasts called for similar growth over the next five years. Rising consumer disposable income was cited as one factor contributing to the expansion of the Chinese snack food market. The industry had two notable features: First competition was intense and brand concentration was relatively low. China’s vast geographic territory contributed to a wide range of eating habits and preferences across the country. As a result many snack food companies had a regional presence specializing in a segment (e.g. flavour) within a snack food category (e.g. meat or nuts).  Second as spending on snack foods grew expectations for product quality were increasing. Consumers were looking for healthy alternatives and wanted to understand what was in the food how it came from the farm to the table and whether or not it was produced in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Therefore supply chain transparency and traceability were becoming increasingly important. However few firms were able to adequately address these consumer expectations. For example a survey by the Beijing Bureau of Investigation of the National Bureau of Statistics found that the satisfaction level of urban residents in Beijing on the safety of snack food in 2017 was 70.6 per cent the lowest among all food categories. LYFENEstablished in 2002 LYFEN was one of the largest snack food retailers in China with annual revenues of nearly ¥3.9 billion in 2018. It had nearly 2700 stores located in 19 provinces and employed more than 9000 people. The majority of LYFEN sales were through brick-and-mortar stores (company-owned and franchises) which accounted for approximately 85 per cent of 2018 revenues. In contrast online sales accounted for approximately 9 per cent of revenues. Exhibit 2 provides a summary of LYFEN’s financial results for fiscal years 2014–2018.With more than 1400 active stock keeping units (SKUs) LYFEN products included a wide variety of snack foods including roasted nuts dried meats and preserved fruits. Its brand symbolized snack foods that were “healthy delicious fresh and high quality.” LYFEN snack foods were premium products that were sold at a higher price compared to the competition. LYFEN Initial Public Offering (IPO)In 2012 LYFEN prepared for its IPO on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. However five days after the company released its IPO prospectus China Central Television ran a story about questionable operational practices including unsanitary production operations and excessive food additives at one of LYFEN’s suppliers a firm that produced a preserved plum snack. Although the investigation by the Administration for Industry and Commerce was unable to substantiate the report LYFEN sales were negatively affected. On July 27 2012 the China Securities Regulatory Commission cancelled the LYFEN IPO. Following the incident the company management made significant changes to its supplier management processes placing increasing focus on controlling product quality and ensuring food safety from the origin (e.g. farmers) to the end consumer. LYFEN increased supplier certification and inspection standards; including tracing key raw materials from their origin from 2012. Yu explained:In the past 18 years LYFEN has been engraving “conscience” as emphasized in Chinese culture into corporate value. LYFEN always advocates that the food industry is a conscience business and an ethical industry. The realization of product quality ultimately depends on all the operators and producers. We issued our 3.0 strategy centred on love and happiness to help nearly 10000 employees develop better business ethics in 2018. We also strengthened the concept and value of high standards of business ethics in our supplier training which is an enhancement of artisan spirit. Although the 2012 report was unfounded it drove us to do more to ensure food safety. We paved the way for a “transparent factory” for our consumers and the media. At the same time we introduced new technology from the United States to test the content of food additives. We want to make sure that LYFEN snacks are safe and healthy.LYFEN was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on October 12 2016 and became the first snack food company listed on the A-share main board issuing 60 million shares at an issue price of ¥11.67. Exhibit 3 provides information on LYFEN’s stock prices.LYFEN Supply ChainThe selection and management of suppliers was the combined responsibility of the product development centre the supplier management department and the quality management department. LYFEN had more than 200 suppliers with 15 per cent accounting for about 50 per cent of the total value of purchases and 40 per cent accounting for about 80 per cent of the total value of purchases. Supplier selection was handled by the procurement department which worked with existing and potential suppliers for the development of new products. This group handled the commercial arrangements with suppliers including contracting and pricing. The supplier management department was responsible for the day-to-day supplier relationship management activities.New suppliers were carefully evaluated before being approved. The process began with a preliminary review—with the supplier completing a self-assessment—and testing of product samples. The self-assessment included a review of the company’s quality systems business licenses and production operations. Provided that the self-assessment satisfied LYFEN’s requirements a production site assessment was conducted which involved a thorough evaluation of the supplier’s food safety processes production operations; health and safety practices and inventory management practices. An important part of the supplier selection process included an assessment of the alignment of organization cultures as described by Yu:Alignment of corporate cultures is an essential when choosing a new supplier. We have a great deal of ongoing contact with our suppliers at all levels of the organization including top management managers and cross-functional project teams. A good working relationship anchored in share values is critical. These values include a dedication to food safety and product quality.LYFEN actively managed multiple tiers of the supply chain. Raw material specifications and sources of supply were set by LYFEN for its suppliers and documented in the material control list. The company’s objective was to control product quality from origin to final sale.Supplier Relationship ManagementSupplier relationship management activities involved multiple layers of engagement. First each supplier was audited by LYFEN annually and more than half of the suppliers were audited twice per year. The LYFEN supplier audit was based on the principles of ISO 9001 ISO 22000 and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points food safety management system. These audits focused on quality management systems—including food safety—and also included a comprehensive review of management practices in areas such as supply-chain management production operations and health and safety. Second LYFEN supplemented supplier audits with other methods of supplier monitoring including independent third-party audits real-time video surveillance of supplier facilities and flight inspections. Third an important element of LYFEN’s supplier-relationship management practices was supplier training. ChengPeng Zhao the supplier management department manager explained the company’s approach to supplier training:Most of our key suppliers have been with us for more than 10 years. More than 10 years ago many suppliers started as small companies with only a few employees and have grown considerably as LYFEN expanded. We work closely with suppliers to simultaneously improve quality and food safety reduce costs and increase capacity to keep up with our growth. This involves two levels. First to achieve LYFEN’s objective of world-class quality and food safety standards we benchmark food companies on a global basis. To demonstrate best practices to senior management at our supplier companies we organize plant visits with groups of executives from our supplier community to food manufacturers in locations such as Japan and South Korea to show what is possible to achieve. We organize six or seven such events each year. It is important that our suppliers do not get complacent. For example one of our key suppliers has set a target for this year to increase capacity by 10 per cent while reducing costs by 25 per cent through process improvements and investments in automation and without compromising quality or safety. The second aspect of supplier training is operational. We help suppliers develop programs to improve their quality management and supply chain systems including running workshops to train employees in areas such as quality control and food safety. For suppliers who require working capital to fund improvements in their operations and quality systems we help by providing early payment terms.In the course of our 18 years of development LYFEN has promoted the continuous improvement of the snack food industry by formulating standards that are higher than national standards and establishing a “health industry community.” Mrs. Yu was selected by the China Food Industry Association as a recipient of an entrepreneurship award at a ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up.Quality ManagementIn order to ensure maximum quality LYFEN created 24 measures to ensure food safety. Each incoming shipment to LYFEN distribution centres included supplier quality control reports that were reviewed by the quality management department. Using random sampling two types of inspections were performed: visual and chemical. Visual inspection included examining labelling packaging size and colour and food taste. Chemical inspection tested for potential contaminants to ensure food safety and quality.In 2017 LYFEN started an initiative in which product packaging included a quick response (QR) code that customers could scan with their cell phones in the store to provide access to product information. This information included the name and location of the supplier when the product was produced when it was shipped from the supplier to LYFEN when it was delivered to the store and the expiry date (see Exhibit 4). The QR code also provided the customer with access to a real-time video of the supplier plant operation that allowed the customer to see how the product was manufactured including the working conditions within the plant (see Exhibit 5). Zhao commented on the objectives of this initiative:We want to provide the customer with transparency to our product quality including how and where it was produced. The ability to see the supplier plants allows us to showcase our suppliers’ operations and reinforce to the consumer that LYFEN sells only products of very high quality. I am confident that many of our competitors would not want to share this information about their supply chain. Today this QR code technology is used on about two-thirds of our SKUs and we expect to have it available for 80 per cent of our SKUs by the end of 2019.CompetitionAs the builder of a Chinese snack food chain business model LYFEN had two main competitors—Three Squirrels and Bestore. In recent years the two companies had grown rapidly supported by the development of the Chinese e-commerce market and were accelerating their IPOs. Exhibit 2 provides financial information on these companies and Exhibit 6 shows prices for nine products from LYFEN Three Squirrels and Bestore.Three SquirrelsFounded in 2012 Three Squirrels was an online retailer selling products through a variety of online platforms such as Tmall.com and Alibaba.com that accounted for more than 50 per cent of its total sales. Three Squirrels used a series of supplier-management and quality control measures including assessment of new suppliers and including a preliminary qualification review on-site audit and integrity assessment. Three Squirrels provided training to existing suppliers on delivery processes and the operation of the company’s information platform. The company conducted at least one routine and one unscheduled supplier inspection each year and used real-time video surveillance at key production facilities of major suppliers. Three Squirrels also conducted sample testing for each batch of products wherein unqualified products were returned.BestoreBestore opened its first store in Wuhan Hubei Province on August 28 2006. Its product range included meat products nuts candies instant food and other varieties. The sales channels of Bestore included company-owned stores franchise stores and online shops. In 2018 online revenue accounted for approximately 40 per cent of sales. Bestore developed the “Supplier Introduction Process” which described its supplier screening process. The company’s quality management centre conducted regular and random supplier evaluations including inflight evaluations. The receiving inspection process involved sample testing of the products and unqualified products were returned.Preparing for the MeetingAs Yu prepared for her meeting with Shi she contemplated the opportunities for LYFEN:Most of our competitors focus on brand management. In contrast supply chain management is a core competency at LYFEN that we feel provides a competitive advantage. Our attention to quality and food safety is a key differentiator and we are able to use information technology to help demonstrate the product quality to our customers.We have plans to grow LYFEN to 10000 retail locations over the next five years which will include expanding our number of distribution channels and the geographic footprint to cover the entire country. This will put pressure on our suppliers to maintain quality and delivery performance while simultaneously increasing capacity. This growth should provide greater purchasing power and economies of scale enabling us to reduce costs. Our success has also been our suppliers’ success—it is like a commonwealth where we treat them as part of our organization. During the meeting next week we need to discuss our priorities going forward and opportunities for the supply chain organization to support LYFEN’s strategic objectives.Exhibit 1: Growth in the Chinese Snack Food MarketSource: “Report on the Market Competition Pattern and Future Development trend of China’s Snack Food Industry in 2018–2024” Zhiyan Consulting Group May 2018 accessed January 7 2019 www.chyxx.com/research/201805/641975.html.Exhibit 2: Key Financial Information for LYFEN Three Squirrels and Bestore(In Millions ¥)Sources: Laiyifen Co.

(CEL) had posed this question hoping that Ron Grubb the candidate he was interviewing would give a reasonable number. This was someone he wanted to be able to afford.Grubb was being interviewed for a position as a mechanical engineer—specifically as a pipe stress analyst. This was a line of work that CEL was looking to add to its professional services repertoire. Both Arvidson and engineering manager Bob Davies who was also part of the interviewing team were pretty much convinced—not only that Grubb had the technical skills they needed but also that he would be a good fit for the culture at CEL.After pausing for a moment Grubb looked confidently at both interviewers in turn and answered “Well based on my seven years of engineering experience as well as the unique set of skills that I bring to the table I would expect my salary to be in at least the CA$90000 to $110000 range.”Putting his head down to make a note on Grubb’s resumé Arvidson tried to hide his disappointment. The amount was significantly higher than he had hoped. Uncertain of how to deal with the issue he decided to push it off and he responded “Well that is more than most engineers usually start out at here but let’s put off the compensation discussion until after we finish assessing your fit for this role.” Arvidson then sat back and allowed Davies to lead the remainder of the interview.Arvidson’s mind started to distance itself from the conversation going on in front of him and focussed instead on what it would take to get Grubb or someone like him to accept an offer at CEL. Arvidson felt that as a smaller employer his organization sometimes had difficulty attracting the critical people it needed to continue to grow. He knew that the work environment the people and the interesting projects they worked on were strong selling points—but there was no denying that sometimes the compensation levels lagged behind those at larger firms and money was important to people. After hearing Grubb’s salary expectations he knew that something was going to have to give. He was tempted to simply do whatever it took to convince Grubb to join even if that meant paying him a lot more than most of the other engineers received. However Arvidson knew enough to be mindful of how such a decision could affect the other employees in the company.CEL BackgroundCEL was a Canadian engineering consulting firm located in Waterloo Ontario. It provided customers throughout the world with services related to the manufacturing of pressure equipment. Pressure vessels were containers that held liquids or gases at pressures that differed from regular conditions. Since the material was being held under pressure the containers could potentially explode hurting anyone nearby. Due to this danger each country carefully regulated the manufacturing and operation of pressure vessels. No one in Canada could legally use a pressure vessel unless it had been proven to meet the high standards set by the government. Organizations from other countries that wanted to sell pressure vessels in Canada also had to have an engineering firm certify that the containers met Canadian regulations. This is where CEL came in. The company had the engineering qualifications necessary to provide this certification to customers in a number of industries including oil and gas water filtration food and beverage instrumentation and pharmaceuticals.Founded in 1999 by Cheryl Landsberg CEL had 16 employees in 2018. When Landsberg retired in 2017 she had maintained a 20 per cent share in the company and arranged for employees to take ownership of the rest. This meant that a majority of CEL’s employees had about 5 per cent stakes in their employer. Employees were able to purchase shares at 10 per cent of fair market value. To make it easy for employees to be involved the company had arranged a plan that enabled them to purchase shares over time as dividends accrued. In this way employees were able to become minority owners without much personal cash outlay.To continue to grow the business after it became employee-owned Arvidson and the board of directors had decided to branch out into pipe stress analysis which was related to the work CEL traditionally performed. CEL clients often needed this type of work but since CEL did not have the necessary resources it had always passed this work on to another engineering firm. Arvidson was tired of forgoing the opportunity for increased revenue and he also wanted to better serve the firm’s clients so he knew it was time to hire someone with these skills.Compensation DataAfter the interview was over and Grubb had been shown out Arvidson and Davies remained in the conference room to discuss their impressions. They agreed that Grubb was someone they wanted to add to their team; however they couldn’t ignore the issue of compensation.Davies said I saw the look on your face when he said he wanted 90 to 110 grand. Now Jeff I know that’s more than some of our other engineers make but we really need this guy. Right now we are farming out all of our pipe stress work. If Grubb was on board we could keep it in house. He’ll pay for himself in no time. Plus he will help to strengthen the company by giving us a whole new skill set to offer our customers.Arvidson shrugged and replied “I know what you’re saying Bob. I’d like to have him here too. But we have to be careful. If we pay him more than we pay the other engineers how is that going to make the others feel? We may end up with one happy employee and half a dozen unhappy ones.”Sifting through a folder in front of him Arvidson remarked “I’ve pulled some data.” He handed Davies a sheet of paper (see Exhibit 1). “This is some information on what we pay our engineers currently. If we stayed consistent with this based on Grubb’s experience we would have to offer him a starting salary of about $85000.”As Davies started to review the page Arvidson pulled out another sheet and passed it over (see Exhibit 2) saying I almost forgot I also pulled some salary survey data from a couple of sources. That first sheet will help us figure out how to pay fairly within the company. This second one will tell us how to ensure our employees are being compensated fairly compared with people in other companies who are in mid-level engineering roles.Arvidson added “I think the dividends aspect will end up being a game-changer when it comes to compensation. Our base salaries are not as high as they could be but the dividends could end up being a real windfall at some point.” Davies replied I love that we as employees own the company now and the way you set it up to let everyone be involved was a great idea. I know that we won’t get much in terms of dividends in the first few years because the profits will go to pay for our shares but after that we could get a dividend of between 30 and 40 per cent of our earnings in a good year. That’s a big deal!Arvidson sat back in his chair with a sombre expression; then he continued: Between you and me I’ve heard some grumbling from a couple of employees that they would rather have a higher base salary than live with the uncertainty of dividends that are dependent on firm performance. It is hard for them to see that as owners they have to accept the risk along with the potential for reward. They have to understand that this set-up will make us stronger over the long term because we won’t have super-high compensation costs in the bad years. I’ve seen some companies go under because of that.Davies smiled as he replied: “I guess it’s hard to see the big picture when you are hoping to buy a new big-screen TV right away.” Arvidson shook his head and chuckled. He saidWell you’ve got me there. I just wish they would remember that money isn’t everything. We do well by employees in other ways too. As you know there are lots of other benefits associated with working here. We have good holidays a great environment help with training and the list goes on.Nodding Davies agreed: “That’s for sure. Hey speaking of lists don’t you send employees a sheet reminding them of everything they get?” Pleased at the reminder Arvidson stood up. “You’re right. Good thinking!” he said. “We do send out a total rewards statement every year. That could help this discussion. Let me go and get a copy.” He left the room returning a few minutes later with two printouts. Handing one to Davies he said “Here is a sample statement that was the starting template for the last one. This goes out every April. I printed a copy for each of us” (see Exhibit 3).Perusing the document Davies remarked “There are a lot of different things on here. It really adds up doesn’t it?” Nodding Arvidson replied “It sure does. We started doing this to help employees get an idea of all the things CEL provides. I’m always worried about employees leaving so I thought this would help them to see that we’re doing right by them.”A phone buzzed and both men looked at their screens. Davies said to Arvidson “That’s me. Sorry but I have to go. Can we finish this conversation tomorrow?” Arvidson nodded and collected his papers. As he stood he said “Sure. We don’t have to decide anything today. I’d like to collect some more data anyway.” Together they walked out of the conference room and each headed off in a different direction.The Employee PerspectiveWanting to obtain some employee input Arvidson spent the next couple of hours walking around and chatting informally with his employees about compensation and rewards. Unsurprisingly he found that their opinions were varied. Some thought that money mattered most but many others on the team put more value on the lifestyle aspects of the reward system. The latter group valued flex time the collegial working environment the weekly barbecues and so on. One employee noted that she wanted a higher salary but commented at the same time that another employer “couldn’t offer anything to make me want to leave.” When he asked what stood out to them on their total rewards statement only a few employees could remember the details in the document. Reading between the lines Arvidson realized that they reviewed it when it came in but then mostly forgot about it. He began to worry that while the statement had a lot of good information it might not have enough impact. Decision TimeBack in his office with time to review his thoughts Arvidson sketched out his three main options on a pad of paper and pondered what to do. Should he offer Grubb the job at a lower salary and take the chance of being turned down? Should he give Grubb the salary he wanted and risk upsetting his other employees if they found out? Should he completely revamp his compensation system and increase salary levels for all of the engineers?He wasn’t sure which option was the best choice.Exhibit 1: Average Base Pay for Current Employees at CEL (in $CA)Average base pay for engineers with less than five years’ experience: $78000Average base pay for engineers with between five and 10 years’ experience: $85000Average base pay for engineers with between 10 and 15 years’ experience: $96000Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: 2017 Salary Survey Data from Professional Associations—Intermediate Engineering Position (in $CA)Source: Created by the case authors based on the data for Salary Survey 1 which came from a 2017 report from Randstad and the data for Salary Survey 2 which came from a 2017 report from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OPSE).Exhibit 3: CEL Total Rewards StatementSAMPLE—Communicating the Value of Your Total RewardsYour 2016 Personalized Total Rewards StatementDATE/MONTH/YEARDear (Employee Name)In February you received your 2016 T4 statement which summarized the compensation you earned as a member of the Cisca Engineering team this past calendar year.

There is not enough marginin the payment business for the wallets to have a future.”Aditya Puri managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Bank LimitedAditya Puri’s opinion about the digital wallet (also called “mobile wallet” or “e-wallet”) business model set up an interesting question about the future of Paytm Payments Bank Limited (Paytm) the leader in the e-wallet business in India which had reported a loss of more than ₹15485 million for financial year (FY) 2015–16. The question became even more significant when Paytm started its long-awaited payments bank operation the third of its kind in India on May 23 2017. Interestingly less than two months after its launch Vijay Shekhar Sharma founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Paytm said “In the next three years we’re going to be bigger than the biggest traditional bank in India.” In May 2017 Paytm had been valued at US$7 billion making it the second-most-valuable start-up in India. Despite Sharma’s optimism about the future of Paytm’s new venture India’s central banking institution the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expressed serious concerns about the existing health of the country’s banking system. India had witnessed two major developments that it was still struggling to come to terms with: a demonetization exercise in November 2016 and the introduction of the uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1 2017. Both these efforts were directed toward controlling India’s informal economy (unorganized sectors) and tax evasion. Overall the country’s economy was causing further concerns; its growth rate had slowed to 6.1 per cent in the last quarter of FY 2016–17 (compared to 7 per cent in the preceding quarter). Even though the central government expected a recovered growth rate of 6.75–7.5 per cent for FY 2017–18 the slowdown raised doubts about the viability and sustainability of the online payments industry in which Paytm was a major player. In the highly competitive and crowded banking sector in India could Paytm create a strong position for itself? What were its plans for survival and growth in the future? Had India’s demonetization exercise created short-term temporary gains or long-term sustainable gains for firms like Paytm? Now in 2017 would Sharma be able to steer Paytm toward continued success in India’s complex business landscape? COMPANY OVERVIEWSharma born in 1973 founded Paytm’s parent company—One97 Communications Limited (One97) India’s leading mobile Internet company which owned the flagship brand Paytm—in 2000. In its initial days One97 offered live astrology services for a global system for a mobile operator in Delhi. One97 successively provided many more value-added services to mobile phone subscribers such as SMS-based applications and businesses music messaging voice-based gaming subscription-based content services ringtones recharge services and many more service offerings including the launch of Paytm India’s biggest online mobile recharge portal. Paytm Mobile Solutions Private Limited incorporated in 2009 was primarily engaged in the business of managing a mobile commerce platform. Headquartered in New Delhi One97 had more than 4500 employees; regional offices in Mumbai Bengaluru Pune Chennai and Kolkata; and a global presence in Africa Europe the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The firm was backed by marquee investors like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) Ant Financial Services Group (AliPay) SAIF Partners MediaTek Inc. Sapphire Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. Further in the second quarter of 2017 in an otherwise financially tight market Sharma was able to raise US$1.4 billion as equity infusion from SoftBank Group Corp. However recovering from the ₹15485 million loss posted by Paytm in FY 2015–16 was a daunting challenge for Sharma and his team (see Exhibit 1). Like many value-added service providers Paytm used a simple technology-enabled mobile payment model to earn service charges that were based on a percentage of the value of transactions. Other sources of revenue for the company included commission income from mobile recharges and payments of utility bills and one time set-up fees charged to merchants. This payments business model was volume driven and had narrow margins. One97 operated through the single brand name “Paytm” which was used initially for the company’s e-wallet business. The company next ventured into e-commerce (“marketplace” model) business through the same brand and floated it as Paytm E-Commerce Private Limited in 2016 which ran the “Paytm Mall.” The latest foray had been to enter the payments bank business through its subsidiary Paytm (see Exhibit 2).DEMONETIZATION: a “GAME CHANGER” FOR the INDIAN MOBILE PAYMENTS INDUSTRYThe Indian government’s emphasis on digitization with financial inclusion (in the form of initiatives like the “Prime Minister’s People Money Scheme” and the use of unique identification numbers for every citizen (known as the Aadhar Project)) was a game-changing factor for established players like Paytm. In an emergency address to the nation aired through national television on the evening of November 8 2016 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes would become void from midnight on that date. Modi added that ₹1000 notes would be permanently withdrawn from circulation and ₹500 notes would be replaced in the following few weeks while ₹2000 notes would be introduced shortly. People were given until December 30 2016 to deposit the banned currency notes in their bank and post office accounts. According to expert estimates the November 8th announcement rendered 86 per cent of Indian currency null and void.The Indian government promoted this radical initiative as a major step toward addressing and minimizing corruption and illegal transactions (or “black money”) in the Indian economy. Nearly 98 per cent of all economic transactions in India (by volume) were in cash. The cash in circulation to gross domestic product ratio in India was 11.8 per cent in 2015 compared to 8.7 per cent in Germany 3.8 per cent in Brazil and in Canada and 4 per cent in Australia. The government’s initiative was targeted at increasing India’s progress toward becoming a cashless economy which it saw as a hallmark of more developed countries. In the weeks following November 8th people in every part of India faced significant difficulties in withdrawing their money from banks. Long queues outside automated teller machines (ATMs) were a common sight throughout the country especially in large cities. Because of the severe cash crunch both individuals and businesses had difficulty carrying out transactions even as the government encouraged Indian consumers to move forward with more “cashless” transactions. Paytm Seizes an OpportunityAlthough the push for demonetization brought a general surge in digital modes of payment in India (see Exhibit 3) as a leader in the mobile payments business Paytm was one of the biggest benefactors of this initiative. The company immediately used the opportunity to pursue an extensive advertisement campaign. Small businesses shop owners cab drivers and many other vendors started accepting payments through Paytm’s mobile application (app).Many online payment service providers praised India’s government for its bold move. Among them was Paytm’s chief financial officer Madhur Deora who said “This is the biggest and most ambitious step ever to crack down on black money and fake currency. We stand by the government in its efforts towards taking black money out of the equation and offering a major boost to the Indian economy.” He added “Since Paytm is fast becoming synonymous to all kinds of payments we are happy to announce we have registered a strong surge in volume on our platform.”  Within hours of the demonetization announcement Paytm experienced a 435 per cent increase in its overall traffic a 200 per cent rise in the number of app downloads a 250 per cent increase in the number and value of overall transactions a 400 per cent rise in offline payments based on transaction value a 30 per cent surge in the number of saved cards and a 1000 per cent increase in money added to e-wallets on the company’s platform.Within a week of the demonetization declaration Paytm released another set of promising numbers indicating a massive growth in business: “Paytm has touched a record 5 million transactions a day . . . and is on the way to process over [₹240 billion] (by March 2017) more than any other payment network in the country.” The company reported that its offline payment solutions offering was garnering support from offline merchants and that it had signed up with more than 850000 entities allowing cabs petrol pumps and restaurants (among others across the country) to accept e-wallet-based payments. Further Paytm noted that it had set an aggressive merchant acquisition target of 5 million merchants by the end of FY 2016–17. The firm’s name was fast becoming the new “buzzword” in India.To curb black money and limit cash transactions the Government of India had set an ambitious target of 25 billion digital transactions in FY 2018—up from the 9.1 billion such transactions recorded in FY 2016–2017—and expected all Indian banks to transition to digital payments by 2018. The managing director and CEO of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) remarked “Almost all banks have tied up with NPCI. Our idea is to cover all banks—even the cooperative banks—within a year say by March 2018. All banks in the country will be a part of the digital payments system.”the MOBILE WALLET INDUSTRYThe revolution in the mobile phone industry had yet to occur in India and the country’s mobile communications industry was at a relatively early stage. Mobile wallets (as opposed to traditional banking-based payments) were a recent development in India (see Exhibit 4) but e-wallet transactions in India had grown approximately 20 per cent between FY 2012–13 and FY 2015–16. India’s mobile subscription base had crossed the 1.2 billion mark in January 2017 and was projected to cross 1.4 billion by 2022. Further the country had around 330 million Internet users by the end of 2015 a figure that was expected to experience a 20 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. In this context Sandeep Kataria director–commercial of Vodafone India said “We are democratizing data by making it more affordable and accessible. This is a key to driving usage and encouraging first-time users to come online . . . [facilitating] faster adoption of data and its better usage.” Digital disruptions had seen many Indian e-commerce businesses change their business models or fail quickly and e-wallet businesses in the digital service space had yet to find their feet in India. M-payment services offered a low-cost means to create financial access and use of these services was largely driven by the increase in smartphone users low mobile tariffs affordable handsets and increased Internet penetration. However this space was witnessing severe competition with many players entering the industry (see Exhibit 5).Paytm’s Journey from E-Wallet Services to a Registered Payment BankIn December 2014 for the first time in India’s banking history RBI conceptualized a new discipline of banks with a view to push financial inclusion in the country: payment banks. RBI’s objective was to bring the unbanked population of India to the formal banking channel. Payment banks were expected to leverage the rising use of mobile phone technology to target India’s migrant labourers low-income households and small businesses offering savings accounts and remittance services with low transaction costs. Forty-one applicants scrambled to gain “in-principle” approval licences from RBI. In August 2015 eleven of these eligible applicants were granted appropriate licences (see Exhibit 6).On November 23 2016 fifteen days after demonetization Airtel Payments Bank Limited a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Limited (Airtel) was the first to launch its pilot payment bank in the state of Rajasthan with an ambitious target of a full-scale launch across India in the near future—leaving Paytm to catch up. In addition to competition from established banking and financial players (e.g. scheduled commercial banks small finance banks microfinance banks non-banking finance companies co-operative finance companies and other financial technology firms) Paytm also faced competition from a well-networked India Post and established telecommunications players. The competition was further intensified as Airtel Payments Bank offered interest rates of up to 7.25 per cent on savings accounts to attract customers.Many industry titans believed payment banks represented a new breed of digital transactions that could only survive if low operating cost strategies were pursued. Aman Bhargava director (financial services advisory) at Grant Thornton India LLP stated:This [the use of digital transactions] calls for a new banking paradigm. The basic tenets for a successful payment bank call for high quality low cost of delivery regular education and incentivization of customers to make cashless transactions a part of their daily spending habits and a robust technological framework. Essentially the cost of transactions for a payment bank needs to be significantly lower (1/10th) of a traditional branch-based banking model paradigm. Many of the payment bank licence holders had also tied up with banks as their business correspondents. Business correspondents could carry out a range of services and transactions on behalf of banks for a wider consumer base receiving a commission for these services. Despite the fundamental business analysis three of the 11 payment bank licence holders—Tech Mahindra Limited Cholamandalam Distribution Services Limited and Consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (promoted by Dilip Shanghvi IDFC Bank Limited and Telenor Financial Services)—dropped out of the game in the first half of 2016. Some industry stalwarts like State Bank of India’s CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya felt that the payment bank business model was the core problem:[By] design payment banks don’t have a business model. . . . There is a big challenge on customer acquisition. Why would someone who is using a mobile banking service that is readily available be willing to migrate to a new [payment] bank? This too given that technology such as a unified payments system would enable cheaper transactions through mobile phones. Others argued that this fallout could be attributed to a lack of proper assessment when institutions applied for the banking licences or the fact that RBI’s guidelines were too strict (see Exhibit 7). As one of the 11 payment bank licence holders could Paytm succeed and make money in a rather tight market that already contained established players? What strategy should Paytm pursue in order to build a sustainable business in this market? Challenges and Expectations The main challenge that payment banks faced was the general preference for cash transactions among Indian consumers. The penetration of debit and credit cards was very low in the country with 32.65 million credit cards and 810.87 million debit cards outstanding at the end of August 2017. Debit cards were primarily used to withdraw cash from ATMs—this activity accounted for nearly 87 per cent of the total value of debit card transactions in August 2017—and were seldom used for online transactions. In addition to the strong cash-based culture in India other crucial challenges that payment banks in India faced included (1) acquiring and inducing potential customers with innovative product offerings while competing with the existing business correspondents and other competitors; (2) finding qualified people who could lead and operate payment banks in India (an untested business model so far in the country); (3) finding patient long-term investors; and (4) meeting the strict regulations regarding capital adequacy and risk exposures. An article in the Economic Times reported that Paytm’s payments banking operations had incurred losses of ₹307 million between August 2016 and March 2017. In the same period the company only managed to earn revenues of ₹24.7 million. Yet according to another article in the Business Standard Paytm did not consider the ₹307 million a loss but looked at it as operational costs because the costs had occurred before the payments bank started its “real” operations in May 2017. Paytm began operations with its first payment bank branch in Noida Uttar Pradesh in May 2017. Eventually it planned to expand its footprint beyond metro and urban areas and to reach out to semi-urban as well as rural areas. By the end of its first year of operation Paytm had proposed to establish 31 branches 33 controlling offices and 3000 access points and to engage about 100000 banking correspondents to target 200 million e-wallet current and savings accounts. To support this expansion phase Sharma (along with One97) had invested a further ₹600 million. Their earlier investment in payments bank operations stood at ₹2.2 billion. Sounding optimistic about the firm’s business prospects Renu Satti CEO of Paytm Payments Bank said “Leveraging the power of technology we aim to become the preferred bank for 500 million [customers] by 2020.”PAYTM’S ENTRY INTO THE E-COMMERCE SPACE Even as it attempted to succeed as a payments bank Paytm was also trying to establish itself as one of the major players in the Indian e-commerce market. The majority of this market (in the multi-product category) was occupied by e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon India; another prominent player in the market was Jasper Infotech Private Limited (operating under the name Snapdeal). Although the e-commerce industry had generated significant excitement at one time and was projected to reach US$100 billion in value by 2020 it had witnessed a massive slowdown in growth in 2016 when it grew just 12 per cent (as compared to 180 per cent growth in 2015). One study reported that in order to reach the projected goal for 2020 the industry would need to grow at a 45 per cent CAGR. The sudden slowdown was attributed to various internal and external factors.On March 31 2017 Paytm Mall reported a loss of ₹136.3 million and sales of ₹73.5 million. That arm of the business had been started in August 2016 after raising funds mainly from investor Alibaba. Paytm was relying on its innovative online-to-offline business model to emerge as a strong player in the e-commerce market. This model allowed customers to take advantage of online discounts in offline stores. Orders for the products were serviced from local brands and stores which entered into tie-ups with Paytm Mall offering significant advantages in terms of logistics and warehousing; at the same time the local brands and shops benefited from exposure on Paytm Mall’s platform. This online-to-offline model had shown reasonable traction already as reported by several sources. In the future Paytm Mall planned to focus on the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment where it was hoping to achieve growth of 600 per cent and to invest ₹500 million on sales training marketing campaigns and supply chains. To cash in on the festive season of Diwali in India Paytm Mall offered an estimated ₹5.01 billion in cashback rewards; for example the company offered a discount of ₹15000 on the iPhone8 and the iPhone8 Plus. While these deep discounts would clearly result in losses the company was looking at them from a long-term perspective and hoped to recoup the discounts in increased sales. Amit Sinha chief operating officer at Paytm Mall said “At present less than 1 per cent of total FMCG sales in India take place online . . . which offers [us a] unique opportunity. We want to be the platform our consumers use to shop [for] daily needs.”Stretched too thin?Many observers wondered whether Paytm was simultaneously entering too many businesses and stretching its resources too thin. Even as Sharma exuded confidence about successfully leading the company to its next stage of growth questions remained about whether it was a realistic target to achieve growth in all three of Paytm’s major businesses (e-wallet payments bank and e-commerce). As Paytm planned to expand its customer base fivefold from 120 million (reported in June 2016) and emerge as a serious challenger to Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce business it was working on recruiting top talent from premier engineering and management institutions in India. In an interview with the Economic Times Sharma commented:We plan to invest [₹100 billion] over the next three to five years towards our commitment to promoting financial inclusion and enabling half-a-billion Indians to join the mainstream economy. We have to do a good job of tech and distribution to make it possible. We don’t have to fight with banks to win. We are in nearly a blue ocean when we see our target customers and businesses. Traditional banks and financial institutions are complementary and partners in our business.Further Paytm had made many investments to support early-stage start-up ventures such as auto-rickshaw service aggregators hyperlocal delivery firm Jugnoo Delhi-based consumer behaviour prediction platform Shifu local services start-up Near.in online-to-offline deals start-up Little a consumer lifestyle deals marketplace logistics management company LogiNext and online ticketing and events platform Insider.in among others. Its most recent investment was QorQl an online start-up in the health care segment.Cash transactions dramatically decreased following the demonetization exercise and the digital payments industry saw increased consolidation. The future of the e-wallet and payments bank industry remained unknown and it was unlikely that all the existing players would thrive. Paytm needed to make smart decisions in this rapidly evolving business space. Against strong competitors and an uncertain environment how could Sharma and his team improve Paytm’s performance and maintain its success?Exhibit 1: Financial Information for One97 Communications Limited 2009–2016Note: PAT = profit after tax; sales and profit after tax are shown on the primary axis and total asset balance is shown on the secondary axis.Source: Created by the case authors based on One97 Communications Limited’s financial data for FYs 2009 to 2016 obtained from Prowess Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy accessed November 12 2017 https://www.cmie.com.Exhibit 2: COMPANIES OPERATING UNDER SINGLE BRAND NAME “PAYTM”Source: Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Government of India MCA Services Company name Lookup database Accessed March 02 2018 http://mca.gov.in/mcafoportal/viewCompanyMasterData.doExhibit 3: Post-DemonetiZation Growth in Digital Modes of Payments Note: Volume is in millions of transactions; value is in ₹ billions; *PPI issued by eight non-bank issuers for goods and services transactions only.Source: Created by the case authors based on Reserve Bank of India Macroeconomic Impact of Demonetisation: A Preliminary Assessment (March 10 2017) 40 accessed October 15 2017 https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/MID10031760E85BDAFEFD497193995BB1B6DBE602.PDF.Exhibit 4: Non-Cash Payment Transactions IN INDIA FY 2016–17 (%) Note: RTGS = real-time gross settlement; CCIL = Corporation of India Limited; “Others” includes national electronic funds transfer mobile banking and prepaid instruments.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright © 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-11-21In April 2018 Jessica Taplow head of People and Culture at iQmetrix Software Development Corp. (iQmetrix) was about to unveil the data from a recent employee survey that asked employees about their perceptions of holacracy a new organizational design the company had adopted about one and a half years earlier. Headquartered in Vancouver BC Canada iQmetrix a software development company had grown rapidly since its founding in Regina Saskatchewan in 2001. Founded by brothers Christopher and Greg Krywulak iQmetrix was built on the idea that sharing information and metrics through computer systems would lead to breakthroughs in efficiency productivity and competitive advantage. More importantly to the founders the company was also created to build what they called the “ultimate organization” where creativity and innovation would flourish and people could be their best. Flat decision-making structures where staff were informed and autonomous and had the authority to make decisions would allow solutions and innovations to emerge from anywhere in the organization. The idea of this ultimate organization became a foundation for the evolution of the iQmetrix culture. As a young entrepreneur starting out Christopher Krywulak did not know what the ultimate organization looked like but he did know that he was dissatisfied with what he saw around him in the business world and that he wanted to instead create an organization where people like him could flourish. He believed he would recognize the ultimate organization only after he had created it. This belief turned into the development strategy that iQmetrix returned to time after time. Each time growth put stress on the company the company’s strategy was to decide what it needed to do next to continue creating the ultimate organization. As the company grew from its Regina base and opened satellite offices in Winnipeg; Vancouver; and Charlotte North Carolina—eventually employing over 400 people—it experienced pressure to become more formalized. Searching for a model that resonated and stayed true to the initial founding vision of the ultimate organization iQmetrix adopted holacracy in early 2017.HolacracyHolacracy contrasted starkly with traditional organizational designs. The goal of holacracy was to create an organization based on simple rules for recognizing articulating and creating the tasks that needed to be accomplished and then giving people the authority to adapt their professional roles to these new tasks at their own discretion. Holacracy organized people around common outcomes or projects. In holacracy there were no job titles—only roles. Moreover there were no managers in a holacracy. Instead authority was distributed throughout the organization and work was organized by circles that formed and disbanded as required according to the tasks they needed to accomplish. Circles followed detailed procedures regarding how decisions were made and how meetings were run. Holacracy sought to increase transparency and reduce the time required to make decisions by making three key changes to the organization: (1) it organized the work to be done by roles (2) it associated specific accountabilities to those roles and (3) it gave the person assuming each role complete authority to make the decisions required for that role. This contrasted with traditional hierarchies in which the organizational structure tended to push accountability upward and required people who did the work to continually seek authority to make decisions. This resulted in lost time a lack of ownership and low levels of accountability regarding decisions. Such a system—where the more powerful enjoyed the perks of power and the less powerful had little or no accountability—could encourage bad habits for both managers and employees. To successfully implement holacracy iQmetrix would have to avoid both of these outcomes. Over the course of the first year holacracy was rolled out to the entire organization and people became familiar with their roles circles and accountabilities. The company’s founder and chief executive officer Chris Krywulak anticipated that holacracy would empower individuals to plan monitor and regulate their own work tasks and that leadership would be distributed broadly throughout the organization. Now one and half years later Taplow set out to see whether these expectations had been met. She was especially interested in whether employees perceived holacracy to have improved the company; whether they were happier and more engaged; and whether they were receiving more accurate useful and motivating feedback about their efforts on the job.Taplow had sent the survey to employees in April 2018 and she was pleased to have received a 67 per cent response rate. Now she was excited to have a look at the data. What would employees be saying about their experiences at iQmetrix working under holacracy? Taplow opened the Excel file to see (see Ivey product 7B19C030).",1,,NORTH AMERICA,WOMAN,

It was December 2017 and the recently declared half yearly results of fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 were not encouraging. The bank’s chairman T. S. Anantharaman had said a couple of months earlier that the bank needed a capital infusion of ₹4–6 billion by December 2017 through private placement. The bank would then aim for an initial public offering (IPO) about three years later once the bank had achieved consistent profitability.Less than a year earlier Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) had evinced interest in a stake in the CSB. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) the Indian regulator of banks had given its approval but by June 2017 talks between the parties had fallen through on valuation issues. The business media carried contradicting reports on the offer made by Fairfax. Reports ranged from an equity valuation of ₹60 to ₹100 per share and from an equity valuation of ₹10 billion for the bank to ₹10 billion for a 51 per cent stake in the bank. In any case the offer was deemed inadequate and was rejected by the CSB board and shareholders. Subsequently at the behest of the RBI the CSB made a counter-offer to Fairfax with a view to resolve the stalemate over valuation. The counter-offer was for a 51 per cent stake in the bank valuing the CSB at ₹160 per share (translating to an equity valuation of nearly ₹13 billion) plus a control premium. The richer valuation came on the back of an improved set of annual results for the year ended March 31 2017 (see Exhibits 1 and 2 or the student spreadsheet that accompanies this case Ivey product no. 7B19N005). What had changed in a mere six months to warrant the CSB’s ambitious proposal? Should Fairfax accept the offer?the CATHOLIC SYRIAN BANK LimitedThe CSB was established in 1920 in the Thrissur district in the southern state of Kerala India to serve the region’s Roman Catholic community. The bank maintained its position among the many banks and credit institutions that proliferated and collapsed over the next half century. The CSB played an active part in the consolidation that followed and grew by taking over five such failing banks in Kerala.In 1969 the CSB was included in the RBI’s list of scheduled commercial banks and in 1975 when the bank’s deposits exceeded ₹250 million (US$3.73 million) the CSB was granted the status of an A-class scheduled commercial bank. Largely confining its operations to the state of Kerala the CSB’s clientele was predominantly the small businesses and individuals with small accounts. This was reflected in the bank’s geographical distribution: at the end of 2017 approximately 80 per cent of the CSB’s branches were located in rural and semi-urban areas. Still the CSB boasted a strong deposit book because most of its non-resident customers and expatriates in the Persian Gulf region sent money home through the bank’s network. Over the years the bank grew its offerings in personal banking and insurance and in corporate banking which included working capital finance cash management and corporate lending among other services. As of March 31 2017 the CSB had a deposit base of more than ₹149 billion and a loan book of over ₹81 billion. Foreign entities including institutions corporate bodies and individuals held more than 30 per cent of the bank (see Exhibit 3).FAIRFAX Financial HOldings LImitedFairfax described itself as a “holding company whose corporate objective is to achieve a high rate of return on invested capital and build long-term shareholder value.” Through its subsidiaries the firm engaged in property and casualty insurance and investment management.Fairfax was founded in 1985 in Toronto Canada by Prem Watsa who was chairman and chief executive officer at the time of negotiations with the CSB. Fairfax had grown its revenues from US$12.2 million in 1985 its first year of operations to US$9.3 billion in 2016—a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of close to 24 per cent of its book value. Fairfax’s book value per share and closing share price had also recorded impressive CAGRs with the CAGR for book value per share at 19.4 per cent and for closing share price at 18.6 per cent over the same period.As of December 31 2016 Fairfax had invested over US$1.2 billion in India through Fairfax’s subsidiary Fairfax India.THE BANKING LANDSCAPE IN INDIAAt the end of March 2017 India had 27 government-owned banks 21 private sector banks and 45 foreign banks operating under commercial banking licences in the country. The government-owned banks accounted for close to 70 per cent of the banking sector’s total book value of assets on March 31 2017 and the private sector banks accounted for a little over 25 per cent. However the situation was the reverse with market capitalization.The private sector group of banks in India consisted of two distinct subgroups: the old private sector banks (OPSBs) and the new private sector banks (NPSBs). The OPSBs primarily originated in a community or region and were formed to serve the needs of members and businesses of that community or region. These banks came into existence in the early to mid-twentieth century. The CSB was one of these OPSBs. The NPSBs were promoted by professionals financial institutions and other commercial organizations when in 1994 the RBI issued new licences for the first time for private sector banks. The idea was to bring a competitive spirit and efficiency to the banking sector. Among other features these banks would be spread geographically leverage technology in their operations adhere to prudential norms from the start and have greater autonomy in recruitment and remuneration.Clearly the NPSBs were different from the OPSBs right from their vision and mission to the way they conducted the business of banking. While OPSBs were defined by their need to serve a circumscribed concentrated clientele the NPSBs were more universal in scale scope and diversity. Among private sector banks the OPSBs accounted for about 16 per cent of the total assets. While their small size and regional focus helped them manage credit risk better due to familiarity and greater control of local information their size and focus also led to lesser diversification and economies of scale. The difference in equity beta between the OPSBs (1.29) and NPSBs (1.15) perhaps reflected these conflicting considerations.FY 2015/16 was a turning point in the business trajectory of Indian banks. The RBI denounced the banks for not having provisioned sufficiently for bad loans and in many cases for converting these bad loans to renewed loans or lines of credit to avoid declaring them as non-performing assets (NPA). Over the next two years NPA were stripped of their disguises increasing the gross NPA ratio—the gross amount of loans recognized as NPA divided by the total loans outstanding—to 9.32 per cent for the Indian banking system by March 31 2017.The bulk of the NPA belonged to government-owned banks (also known as public sector banks) because their advances were largely directed toward large corporate and infrastructure borrowings. To a significant extent the NPA problem was caused by the global commodity market meltdown in the early part of the decade. The majority of the Indian firms that were affected and defaulted on their repayments were from the metals and mining industry. The OPSBs remained relatively insulated from this crisis however because they focused on small and medium sector firms and community-based and geographically concentrated lending.Over those two years the RBI announced many restructuring packages for distressed borrowers to help them manage their debt and avoid insolvency while minimizing losses for the lending banks. These measures finally culminated in the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (amended in 2017) under which lenders could take defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal for restructuring. Companies were granted a fixed period of time for resolution failing which the company would be forced into liquidation.In May 2016 in the midst of the NPA crisis the RBI made a radical shift in its policy on ownership of foreign entities in private sector banks. With other limits the change allowed non-promoter foreign entities to acquire more than a 40 per cent stake in Indian banks with RBI approval granted on a case by case basis. All approval for ownership came with the rider that irrespective of shareholding the voting rights of these foreign entities would be capped at 15 per cent. Within one month in June 2016 Fairfax first showed its interest in taking an equity stake in the CSB albeit a minority interest.FAIRFAX’S INTEREST IN the CSBHaving launched an India-dedicated investment company in 2014 Watsa known as “Canada’s Warren Buffet” had already pumped over a billion dollars into India. In November 2016 Fairfax made an offer for a 51 per cent stake in the CSB. This was Watsa’s boldest bet in the country thus far. The CSB’s management was enthusiastic about the prospect of Fairfax’s fund infusion and applied to the RBI for approval.The outgoing chairman of the CSB announced that the funds would be a primary infusion into the bank rather than a sale of a secondary stake. The funds would be used for growth with a focus on the small and medium enterprises gold and retail. Corporate lending was not an area of significant interest. The chairman added that the bank would appoint an independent evaluator for valuation once the RBI approved the transaction.The CSB had been scouting for funds since 2015 when it had plans to raise ₹4 billion through an IPO. However it had deferred that plan due to volatile market conditions and raised approximately ₹1 billion through a privately placed equity issue in September 2016 instead. The deal with Fairfax would help augment these funds and enable the CSB to implement its growth plans.However by the middle of 2017 the anticipated deal with Fairfax had fallen through the parties citing differences in valuation. Fairfax attributed its lower valuation of the CSB to the bank’s poor asset quality evidenced by a steady increase in the gross NPA ratio (see Exhibit 4). The CSB on the other hand set its higher valuation betting on a turnaround under the guardianship of the newly appointed managing director C. V. R. Rajendran. The bank was also buoyed by its 2017 year-end performance: it had successfully converted losses at the operating and net levels from the previous year to profits in FY 2016/17. The bank’s chairman asserted that the bank was doing everything it could to strengthen its financial position. This included strengthening its delivery channels leveraging technology and reducing the cost of funds by focusing on lower-cost demand deposits (current account savings accounts popularly termed CASAs) in addition to increasing capital adequacy by raising capital from multiple sources. The results showed in the lower cost of funds and lower cost-to-income ratio for FY 2016/17 although the results for the half-year ended September 30 2017 showed a slight increase in the cost-to-income ratio (see Exhibit 4). Going forward management was aiming to improve profitability at the operating level without the benefit of treasury gains; the goal was to close FY 2017/18 with net profits higher than in the previous year. Ten-year government yields had been declining since April 2014 reaching a low of 6.24 per cent in December 2016 then slowly increasing likely in tandem with increasing interest rates in the U.S. market. By September 2017 the yields had reached 6.66 per cent. Treasury profits were going to be difficult to achieve with interest rates on the rise.The bank needed capital for growth. With the Fairfax deal gone the bank’s board of directors approved a proposal to raise ₹4 billion by issuing a qualified institutional placement (QIP) before the end of 2017 to fund the bank’s growth for the next 18 months. The managing director set a target of 27 per cent growth in advances during FY 2017/18. The market was ripe for the QIP with more than 18 such issues already floated during the year mostly by financial services companies including banks. The CSB’s managing director declared that the bank would defer an IPO until it saw at least three consecutive years of profitability.As if on cue more than 20 investors including private equity investors such as AION Capital Partners Limited the Everstone Group and InCred Finance and distressed asset investors like SSG Capital Management Limited showed interest in acquiring a stake in the CSB although just a minority interest. The bank’s management decided to seek RBI approval only once the parties agreed on valuations.In the meantime there were reports that the CSB’s shares were trading on the grey market at a premium of approximately 25 per cent ostensibly in response to the increased interest from prospective bidders. This spike in share prices was expected to affect the deal prices that would be negotiated and possibly sealed. Speculation was rife that a large transaction would happen at a discount although at a price significantly higher than the spurned offer from Fairfax. An investment by Vallabh Bhansali chairman of ENAM Group gave some indication of what to expect with the bank’s valuation. Bhansali picked up a 4 per cent stake in the bank on May 23 2017 at ₹160 per share. The price was a 30 per cent premium on CSB’s per share book value of ₹123.5 at the end of March 2017. Bhansali’s investment was at a lower price-to-book value ratio than the average ratio at which OPSBs had been trading since April 2017; however the high variance in the trading multiples across individual banks made it difficult to simply apply the group average to any individual bank (see Exhibit 5).STRATEGIZING FOR THE FUTUREThe CSB’s results for the six months ending September 30 2017 showed improvements in operating profits despite high employee costs; the improvements were without the support of treasury profits which accounted for only ₹20 million as against ₹1959 million for FY 2016/17 (indicated as net profit [loss] on sale of investments in Exhibit 1). However the market was disconcerted by the large net loss posted by the bank for the half-year period. The small net profit of ₹16 million posted for FY 2016/17 had seemed like the bank was finally recovering.The managing director attributed the financial decline to three main problems: high employee costs high provisioning for bad assets and a low credit–deposit ratio resulting in a negative carry for the bank. Management planned to reduce the average cost per employee by making fresh lateral recruitments and moving toward a performance-based pay system. A focus on recoveries and stemming bad loans seemed to be meeting with success; the bank had recovered ₹1.4 billion in bad loans in just the first half of FY 2017/18—more than the recoveries made in the whole of FY 2016/17. The low credit–deposit ratio meant more than ₹25 billion was invested in low-margin short-term treasury assets. Management aimed to move a sizable portion of these funds into highly rated corporate lending while keeping an eye on capital requirements. The bank was going to remain focused on small and medium businesses rather than on large corporations for lending and it was working on making its credit appraisal and rating systems more robust. These plans were expected to reflect in the bank’s vital parameters over the next three to five years (see Exhibit 6).The bank had ambitious growth aspirations and needed funds to execute them. There were enough investors in the market looking to invest in the bank for at least a minority stake and the CSB’s counter-offer to Fairfax was still on the table. Fairfax had had a successful run with investments in India so far and believed the CSB was a good candidate for investment. But at what price could a deal be sealed?EXHIBIT 1: CATHOLIC SYRIAN BANK Profit and Loss Statements (₹ Million)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; FY = fiscal year expressed as fiscal year ending; HY = half year; NPA = non-performing assets; RBI = Reserve Bank of India.Source: Catholic Syrian Bank Limited Unaudited Financial Results for Half Year Ended September 30 2017 accessed March 9 2018 www.csb.co.in/pdf/Financials%2030092017.pdf; Reserve Bank of India “Earnings and Expenses of Scheduled Commercial Banks” Database on Indian Economy accessed March 9 2018 https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications.EXHIBIT 2: CATHOLIC SYRIAN BANK Balance Sheet (₹ million)Note: ₹ = INR = Indian rupees; FY = fiscal year expressed as fiscal year ending; HY = half year.Source: Catholic Syrian Bank Limited Unaudited Financial Results for Half Year Ended September 30 2017 accessed March 9 2018 www.csb.co.in/pdf/Financials%2030092017.pdf; Reserve Bank of India “Liabilities and Assets of Scheduled Commercial Banks” Database on Indian Economy accessed March 9 2018 https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications; Reserve Bank of India “Movement of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of Scheduled Commercial Banks” Database on Indian Economy https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications.EXHIBIT 3: SHAREHOLDING IN CATHOLIC SYRIAN BANKAS Of MARCH 31 2017Source: Catholic Syrian Bank Limited Annual Report 2016–2017 27 accessed March 9 2018 www.csb.co.in/pdf/CSB%20AR%202016-17%20WEB.pdf.EXHIBIT 4: Catholic Syrian Bank and Industry KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS (% unless otherwise specified)Note: CSB = Catholic Syrian Bank; FY = fiscal year expressed as fiscal year ending; HY = half year; NPA = non-performing assets; NPSB = new private sector banks; * Cost-to-income ratio = operating expenses ÷ (net interest income + other income).Source: Created by the case author based on Reserve Bank of India “Ratios and Rates” Database on Indian Economy accessed March 9 2018 https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications.EXHIBIT 5: PRICE-TO-BOOK VALUE RATIOS FOR PEER BANKS AS of MARCH 31 2017Note: OPSB = old private sector banks; NPSB = new private sector banks; *Average price-to-book value ratio for the categories is a simple average of the price-to-book value ratios for the banks listed in that category.Source: Created by the case author based on daily price-to-book value ratios obtained from ACE Analyser corporate database accessed June 10 2018 www.aceanalyser.com.

It was July of 2018 and the managers had reported on the staff vacancies especially at the Front Desk. The hotel regularly lost staff because of the transient nature of employment in the accommodation industry. Consequently the Aspen faced the never-ending cycle of recruiting and hiring individuals who would place as much emphasis on excellent customer service as did the management team. It would be imperative to have the vacancies filled with the right candidates before the ski season began in November—especially given the tight labour market. The question now before Barr was which candidates should be interviewed within the following week to fill two vacancies at the Front Desk.Barr was confident that the Aspen had many good human resource management practices. However he also wondered whether a more systematic long-term approach to human resource planning recruitment and selection would be possible in such a transient labour market. Therefore Barr thought it was time to also review the Aspen’s overall approach to human resource management.STAFFING THE ACCOMMODATION INDUSTRYThe Canadian EnvironmentThe Canadian accommodation industry had grown moderately since 2010 with increases in revenue ranging from 7.8 per cent in 2010 to 4.2 per cent in 2017. In 2017 Canadian hotels reached 65.9 per cent occupancy the highest occupancy rates since 1999. At the same time as demand was increasing in the industry the unemployment rates in Canada had dropped from a high of 8.1 per cent in 2010 to 6.3 per cent in 2017. Canada’s overall job vacancy rate (i.e. the number of vacant positions as a percentage of total labour demand based on three-month moving averages) increased from 2.7 per cent in 2015 (when the average hourly wage was $19.15) to 2.9 per cent in 2017 (when the average hourly wage was $20.10). With the unemployment rate declining and the job vacancy rate rising the labour market became tighter. Young Canadians who wanted to travel and see Canada but who could not afford to do so without working along the way were often able to find jobs in the accommodation and food-service industries. Yet most organizations in the industry were unable to fill all the job vacancies through this method.Key success factors for the accommodation industry included having access to a multi-skilled and flexible workforce being part of a franchised chain and word-of-mouth recommendations. It was important to monitor online travel sites such as TripAdvisor Kayak and Trivago and to move quickly to respond to negative feedback because customers were likely to read the comments posted by other users. It was even more important to ensure that staff provided a high level of customer service to minimize complaints in the first place.The Alberta EnvironmentAlberta’s tourism industry benefited most from US visitors. However in 2015 in addition to Americans Alberta had visitors from the United Kingdom (151600) Germany (117100) Australia (92300) China (85300) Japan (60100) the Netherlands (44500) and other Asian (53400) and European (53300) countries. The fact that visitors came from such a variety of countries highlighted the need for a multi-skilled flexible and multilingual workforce.The Alberta hospitality sector faced significant growth from tourism. In 2017–18 visitors to Banff National Park and Jasper National Park grew by 3.0 per cent over the previous year. Employment in the accommodation and food sectors increased by 2.6 per cent from 144400 in 2016 to 148100 in 2017. Over the same time period Alberta’s average resort occupancy rate grew by 0.2 per cent to 63.9 per cent. Alberta’s job vacancy rate in October 2017 was 2.0 per cent which accounted for 12.6 per cent of all job vacancies in Canada. The accommodation and food service sector in the national park regions had vacancy rates higher than the provincial average at 3.7 per cent. The province’s October 2017 unemployment-to-job-vacancies ratio was 4.8 unemployed individuals for every job vacancy the fourth highest in Canada. The October 2017 job vacancy rate in Alberta’s Banff-Jasper-Rocky Mountain House region matched that of the accommodation and food-service sector at 3.7 per cent. In that same month Alberta’s average offered hourly wage was $22.75. By January 2018 the job vacancy rate had increased to 3.8 per cent but the average offered hourly wage dropped to $21.85.The Banff Aspen LodgeThe Banff Aspen Lodge was a three-storey 89-unit hotel one of 17 hotels located along a five-block section of Banff Avenue the main street of the town of Banff. The Canadian Hotel Guide ranked the Aspen sixth in Banff with an average guest rating of 8.2 out of 10. In an era of consolidation within the hospitality industry the Aspen was one of the few remaining privately owned properties in Banff. Barr general manager of the hotel aimed to position the property as Banff’s number-one mid-scale property. The Aspen’s primary target markets included the United States Calgary and Edmonton. It attracted many repeat customers because of the relationships the staff had built with guests. Barr focused on an exceptional guest experience as being the key to success. He created a culture of friendly and innovative customer service by empowering staff to create that experience. For example when repeat guests checked into the hotel they would find a personalized note in their rooms welcoming them back to the Aspen. If they had requested an extra blanket on a previous stay the blanket would be already waiting on the bed when they arrived. If a guest had mentioned to housekeeping staff that they preferred dark roast coffee the dark coffee pods were ready and waiting by the coffee maker.The Front Desk staff were the first point of contact for guests arriving from a variety of domestic and international locations. Their job was to make guests feel welcome and to attend to their needs—no matter the hour and regardless of whether guests were travelling alone in families or as part of a tour group. Both check-in and check-out were handled quickly and courteously. Check-out began as early as 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. peaking between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. after guests had enjoyed one last breakfast buffet. Check-in began mid-afternoon and ran through the late evening. Both processes involved assisting guests with payments by accepting multiple forms of payment and ensuring accurate completion of the task. At the Aspen check-in also required handing out the appropriate number of breakfast vouchers.  The Front Desk might receive calls at any hour of the day or night with guests requesting extra blankets or encountering trouble with the operation of appliances. Wherever possible Front Desk staff tried to ensure that repeat guests could stay in their favourite rooms. If that was not possible upon arrival they arranged for the guests to be relocated the next day. They provided directions and helpful suggestions about activities in the area. If guests were late returning from a long day of sightseeing only a phone call was needed for the garage to be left open past 11:00 p.m. when the underground parking garage was normally locked. The Front Desk staff also performed general office duties and worked to facilitate interdepartmental communication and co-operation in the interest of better guest satisfaction.The Front Desk agents were the first point of contact for prospective patrons providing courteous and efficient telephone service including answering inquiries regarding rates special packages and general information accurately and in a timely manner. They created reservations via telephone written correspondence and in person. It was also the responsibility of Front Desk staff to ensure the safety and well-being of guests and co-workers by being knowledgeable about crisis and emergency procedures. Should there be any kind of emergency in the property the Front Desk was the first place that guests and staff alike would call.The Aspen’s Human Resource Management PhilosophyBarr’s unswerving focus on achieving the hotel’s mission (to provide every guest with an exceptional experience) and vision (being a leader in the hospitality industry) shaped his perspective on managing the people in his organization. Barr believed that hiring the right people coaching and mentoring for success and letting employees do their jobs resulted in both the excellent corporate culture for which the hotel was known and strong word-of-mouth marketing to the family and friends of the hotel’s guests. He had built on the good culture that already existed when he arrived. He worked to bring people out of their comfort zones so they would feel more confident making decisions that would provide the exceptional service to enhance their guests’ stay. He had an open-door policy and fully supported management and staff decisions with coaching as needed.Barr found it gratifying to know that the staff loved working at the Aspen. Some of the breakfast room employees had been with the Aspen for years and spoke a variety of languages including Japanese and Korean. While their staff turnover rate was below industry standards turnover nevertheless existed because of the transient nature of the industry. In fact Barr identified attracting and retaining staff as being one of the Aspen’s key challenges.The Aspen’s Recruiting ProcessEach morning at 10:30 Barr held a stand-up meeting with his department managers. As needed that meeting dealt with talent management. The hotel was small enough for the managers to know the staff in their departments and to be aware of when contracts and work visas for foreign nationals were coming to an end and therefore when it would be necessary to recruit new staff.The 2016 census indicated that the population of the Town of Banff was only 7851 so employers had a very small talent pool available locally. As well the residents of Banff were well educated. In 2016 73 per cent of the 4125 adults between the ages of 25 and 64 in Banff had completed some form of post-secondary education compared with 64 per cent at the provincial level. Because of the small population of the town the Aspen similar to most Banff hotels relied heavily on recruiting employees from beyond the town and the province. The Aspen recruited through a variety of channels including word of mouth via existing employees the hotel’s website and the Canadian government’s Job Bank. Full-time employees often recommended prospective employees. For example Sam Hong manager of the breakfast room was aware of students who were visiting Canada and who attended his church while visiting Banff; if they were able to acquire the appropriate visas they were encouraged to apply. Other employees had friends and neighbours working at various resorts in the town. Because of its reputation as an employer of choice the Aspen’s employees sometimes referred these individuals to Barr and to the other managers including Anthony Formela the Front Desk manager.The “Careers” page of the Aspen’s website listed reasons why people would want to work at the Aspen. The Aspen had won the Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association’s “Employer of Choice” award four years in a row. It also offered competitive wages employee housing opportunities for further advancement and education a winter incentive a summer canoe pass and a loyalty bonus after one year. The Aspen’s location close to all Banff’s amenities was also a draw. The Amazing Race for the Banff Aspen Lodge was a favourite event that helped to create lifelong friendships among co-workers. Monthly staff events and lunch-and-learn programs helped employees who were new to the country adjust to the culture and supported young adults who were on their own for the first time. The events included such popular activities as hikes to the Tea House at Lake Louise paintball and curling. On a rotating basis the various departments hosted Lunch/Learn/Live events that covered such topics as cooking for yourself what to do if confronted by a bear and where the locals shopped (which was cheaper than the tourist-oriented stores). For some of the younger staff who had never been away from home before speakers from Banff Life offered discussions on such issues as sexually transmitted infections harassment and abuse.Recruitment through the Canadian government’s job bank came from three primary sources. Canadians (particularly young people) from Eastern and Central Canada who were eager to move to Western Canada and in particular to the Canadian Rockies regularly sought employment in the hospitality sector. Canada had exchange programs with several countries including Korea New Zealand and the United Kingdom; individuals who wanted to visit Canada for an extended period of time would often apply for positions through these exchange programs. The Working Holiday program was one of three International Experience Canada (IEC) programs. Its applicants who were between 18 and 35 years old came from more than 30 different countries. As such they had different academic cultural and industry backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Some were fresh out of post-secondary education and desired to travel before settling into careers. Others had already capitalized on the program to visit several provinces and they applied to the Aspen with some experience in the hospitality sector. The Aspen’s Hiring ProcessThe department managers reviewed the job applications and completed the preliminary interviews. The most important quality that the Aspen looked for in prospective employees was attitude. Barr would often sit in on the second interview to assess how comfortable the applicants were in the interview and to assess their fit with the Aspen’s culture of providing exceptional customer service. He said the applicant’s cultural fit became apparent during the first 10 minutes of an interview. He used a structured interview approach that included presenting realistic job scenarios. Questions included how applicants would handle difficult situations such as the following: having to plunge a clogged toilet dealing with guests who complained about air quality and called in the health department and responding to guests who were asking for a refund because they were dissatisfied with the room. Barr looked for creativity in handling such situations especially when no manager was available to whom the situation could be escalated.Onboarding and Training at the AspenTo further ensure that guests were provided with an exceptional experience through outstanding service the Aspen devoted significant time to onboarding—having new employees shadow veterans for several days before working on their own. Training began with Barr conducting a staff orientation. New employees learned about the general history of the hotel its mission and vision its organizational structure the hotel’s expectations of employees and what the employees could expect in return from the hotel. Each department also had its own training with checklists of topics to be covered. Department managers wanted to ensure that their staff were well trained and loved working at the Aspen. The result was employees who cared deeply about providing each guest with an exceptional experience.Compensation at the AspenThe Aspen’s compensation plan was above the industry average in Banff which was a significant attractor to prospective employees. Employees also received a $1800 bonus after one year’s employment in an effort to retain employees longer than the term for employees hired under the Working Holiday program. In addition to attractive rates and bonuses the Aspen offered the best employee accommodation in Banff: four townhouse condos had recently been built across the main street from the hotel property. Two employees shared each bedroom in the townhouse.The DecisionBarr looked at his desk and the pile of applications that Formela had given to him at that morning’s management team meeting (see Exhibit 1). He needed to decide which applicants to interview in the following week and what questions to ask at the interview. Barr’s goal was to extend job offers to the successful applicants in plenty of time for them to make the necessary arrangements to relocate (including obtaining visas where appropriate) before the ski season began in just a few months. Given that Barr viewed recruiting and retaining staff as one of the Aspen’s key challenges he was also eager to identify strengths and areas for improvement in the Aspen’s current approach to human resource management.Exhibit 1: Employment applications received by banff aspen lodge Lhamo SangyamEdmonton ABlhamotsangyam@gmail.com5552129595Profile:-loyal and friendly caring and thoughtful personcurious always eager to develop new skillspunctual personKey Skills:-Patient hardworking energetic and communication skills.Helpful good at interact with other person.Respectful and friendly manner to maintain cooperation with teamwork.Self-motivated and honest person.Successfully scheduled and managed multiple activities.Microsoft office Excel power pointKey compete:Attention to detailCustomer focusListening skillsTeam workHonesty reliabilityHigh energy levelsPlanning and organizing Work experience Chef at pizza pizzaKnowledge of cleaning sensitive materials.Ability to lift push and pull required load.Knowledge of at stampede.5 years experience farmer Hotel Reception in IndiaShellEducation  :-Graduated in India (2014)Languages :-Tibetan English Hindi Reference  :KARMA.

It had taken years for both old and new competitors to build and enhance their business approach to effectively compete with Zara’s model while online shopping for fashion apparel was on the rise. Many recalled the early deference people had had towards Zara and its counter-intuitive business model. Why would anyone invest in a fashion manufacturer and retailer that produced its clothing in the high-cost labour market of Spain (versus Asia); spent very little on advertising; ostensibly overspent on positioning high-end stores in chic retail districts across Europe; carried substantially less inventory than its competitors; manufactured clothes that were arguably of a lesser quality; and finally charged 15 per cent less at the cash register? By all accounts this approach was viewed as a formula for disaster in the highly competitive retail fashion industry.During those early years most observers were just not forward thinking enough to see the value in Zara’s approach—and over time Inditex took great pride in proving them wrong. By 2014 Zara was by far the number-one fashion retailer in the world by many measures and it continued to maintain this leadership position in 2019. Its unique business model had enabled this astounding success. Inditex however could not dwell on past successes as the future was full of significant challenges associated with the many new upstart and copycat competitors that had infiltrated the market. It was highly likely that these new firms would also enjoy a reasonable degree of success. Disruptive innovations such as Zara’s business model inevitably were copied. Examples of companies’ disruptive business models leading to significant change in their industries included Southwest Airlines Co. leading the discount airline industry Walmart Inc. dominating the discount department store industry and perhaps Google’s leadership in its Waymo self-driving technology ride sharing services.Perhaps it was time for Inditex to reinvent the industry business model once again.The Early YearsIn 1963 when Amancio Ortega Gaona started his small dressmaking firm in La Coruña Spain at the tender age of 16 he never dreamed it would lead to the world’s largest retail fashion empire. Nor did he aspire to become the fourth-richest person in the world. What he did come to understand over the next 12 years was that textile manufacturing was a very risky often frustrating business when you were one step removed from your customers. This was especially true in the fast-changing women’s fashion segment of the market. So in 1975 when he opened his first Zara store in the centre of La Coruña a town of 246000 people he was driven by the overriding principle that the key to success as a fashion retailer was to link fashion design to manufacturing and distribution in a way that allowed for rapid responses to the finicky and often changing needs of customers. This was the sole foundation for the creation and growth of Zara and it remained central to its success. This early success spurred the opening of nine new stores in Spain’s largest cities over the next eight years. Ortega also learned that to be successful he would have to take advantage of the intelligence of the employees throughout his company and trust their judgment. In other words a top-down decision-making model as it related to new product design and distribution would be counterproductive to his overriding notion of reacting quickly to customers’ needs. Thus he put decisions related to the critical processes of product design manufacturing and distribution into the hands of his employees across the company.The combined approach of manufacturing new clothing as quickly as possible in response to customers’ needs and desires while adopting a decentralized decision-making process allowed Zara to thrive and grow in the ultra-competitive retail fashion industry. Over the 17 years following the launch of Zara in 1975 Ortega opened more than 1000 new stores culminating in an initial public offering on May 23 2001. The funds raised through this offering provided the fuel for a tremendous evolution that saw Inditex grow to operate 7475 stores in 96 markets across eight brands propelling it to fiscal 2017 revenue of €25.3 billion and industry-leading gross profit margins of 57.4 per cent (see Exhibit 1). This represented an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent over the period 2012–2017. Inditex was by far the world’s largest fashion manufacturing and retail business.the global fashion retail industryThe global retail fashion industry was worth US$2.5 trillion in 2017 employing approximately 75 million people. The industry was expected to grow at a rate of 4–5 per cent from 2018 to 2019.The industry was influenced by a number of factors including changing demographics and the urbanization of the global population. A full 60 per cent of the global population would be living in cities by 2025 up from 45 per cent in 2011. Likewise Europe would see 82.2 per cent of its population living in urban centres while in North America this figure was 88.6 per cent. According to a McKinsey & Company report on succeeding in the future fashion market “By 2020 a quarter of global wealth will be concentrated in just 60 mega-cities some of which will be larger than countries” with 16 of the 20 fastest growing cites for fashion apparel in emerging markets. With the global population predicted to grow to 8.2 billion by 2030 from 7 billion in 2014 it would seem the industry was on a trajectory for continued strong growth. This tied to a growing middle class in developing nations such as China and India could lead to a substantive increase in spending on fashion clothing; in fact China was expected to surpass the United States as the world’s top fashion retail market in 2019. By 2030 East Asia’s middle class was expected to number over 3 billion up from the current 1.5 billion. Spending by the middle class was projected to rise from $21 trillion today to $51 trillion in 2030. This would surely fuel the retail fashion apparel industry for years to come (see Exhibit 2).The global women’s apparel market was predicted to grow by 4.8 per cent annually from 2010 to 2025 outpacing the previous growth of 3.3 per cent for the six years prior. Though as Lu et al. stated “Some 80 per cent of top growth cities for total apparel sales by 2025 will be in emerging markets” leaving growth to lag in developed countries. The authors went on to say that these cities would enlarge the world apparel markets by an additional $100 billion over this period. Emerging markets at that time would represent 55 per cent of mid-market women’s apparel sales (see Exhibit 3).The trends and challenges in this market were many. Responsible sourcing including greater visibility across the entire supply chain topped the list. Tragic events such as the blaze at the Tazreen garment factory in Bangladesh in November 2012 had heightened the need for textile manufacturers and retailers to strengthen their supply chains to ensure fair trade safe work environments living wages social commitment and responsible resource development. Industry growth opportunities specifically in developed countries were being led by the plus-size categories. This was a $17.5 billion market in the 12 months ending April 2014 in the United States up 5 per cent over the previous year and a direct reflection of the obesity epidemic underway in the developed world where seven of 10 Americans were now overweight. The plus-size market opportunity in the United States was estimated at $46 billion. In the United Kingdom the plus-size market was predicted to grow at a CAGR of 7.1 per cent through 2022.Digital adoption by mainstream consumers with online sales of apparel was forecast to grow rapidly outpacing market growth projections. In 2017 McKinsey & Company predicted a 10 per cent CAGR for online apparel and footwear through 2020. In 2017 in the United States alone online sales accounted for 27.4 per cent of overall apparel sales up from 20.7 per cent in 2015 with women’s apparel trailing but still expected to represent 24 per cent of sales by 2021.  Another factor affecting the industry was global transport costs which were linked to the price of oil. It would seem that with oil prices near or below $60 per barrel since 2014 these costs would likely continue on a downward swing. Technological innovation in textile manufacturing was affecting important metrics within the industry beyond cost reduction. Mass customization small-batch manufacturing and time to market were becoming key risk management factors. These drove a deeper focus across the entire supply chain. In 2017 “fast fashion” retailers like Inditex H&M Forever 21 Inc. and Primark Stores Ltd. saw their sales grow by 8.2 per cent in aggregate against an industry growth rate of 3.5 per cent. New fabric innovation was also having a strong positive impact on the growth of the apparel industry specifically in the sportswear market. Commodity prices could significantly impact the industry cost structure specifically the price of cotton which represented 24.5 per cent of the total fibre market in 2016/2017 with production of 23 million metric tons. Global cotton prices hovered around 76 cents per pound and were likely to remain low against a backdrop of demand uncertainty continuing U.S. trade wars and the evolution of synthetics.Additionally the rapidly growing population of consumers over 50 referred to as a “demographic earthquake” in developed countries would become one of the fastest-growing segments to be considered in terms of its expenditures on clothing. By 2020 spending by this group globally was expected to grow to $15 trillion up from $8 trillion in 2010. Customer behavioursPerhaps the most significant factors driving change in the retail apparel industry were associated with shifting customer behaviours. Customer buying patterns and behaviours could directly influence a firm’s ability to succeed and in many cases determined both a firm’s approach and indeed the resulting industry business model. The urban retail fashion market where Zara played was inextricably tied to two key customer behaviours: Unpredictability and InfluenceFashion apparel customers were a fickle group that could be extremely hard to predict and influence. They could be easily swayed by unpredictable factors such as celebrity fashion friends’ fashion choices or the need to differentiate themselves in a crowded urban environment. These variables made it extremely challenging to predict the next fashion hit and contributed to the single largest risk in retail apparel: a “fashion miss.” In turn fashion misses resulted in discounts and markdowns in order to make room for new inventory. For example in its first quarter 2018 report H&M reported $4.3 billion of what Pam Danziger of Unity Marketing called “unexciting uninspired unsold inventory” most of which would have to be discounted. Studies showed that specialty apparel retailers could end up marking down 30–40 per cent of their inventory by up to 60 per cent on average. To mitigate this risk many apparel retailers spent an exorbitant amount of money on advertising with a focus on building brand awareness and loyalty. And it worked—to a degree. For example in 2017 Gap Inc. (Gap) spent $673 million on advertising a 12 per cent year-over-year growth representing 4.2 per cent of sales or 10.6 per cent of gross profit margins. In the highly competitive fashion industry this could be the defining driver of profitability. Frequently Changing Tastes Fashion cycles could also be notoriously short especially in the urban womenswear segment. Trends came and went which drove fashion retailers to introduce new fashions more often and avoid replenishing old items where “old” stock could necessitate a potential discount. At H&M speed to sell-out rates ranged from 12 to 38 days in the first three quarters of 2018. On the surface this looked like a strong metric; however H&M tended to replenish sell-out items versus replacing them with new items. In the world of ever-changing consumer tastes replenishment rates should ideally be low reflecting a strong tie to consumers’ needs. This impacted both retailers’ inventory turnover ratios and ability to sell items at or near full price. Introducing new fashions frequently could have the positive desired effect of enticing customers back to the store more often. An average customer would visit the typical fashion store four times per year while some fashion retailers such as Zara enticed their customers back as many as 17 times per year with fresh fashion choices appearing more often. A fashion retailer’s ability to react quickly to shifting fashion preferences could be a defining success factor.Inditex and zara—A unique approachInditex was the public holding company for Zara and seven other retail brands including Bershka Massimo Dutti Pull&Bear and Stradivarius. After 23 years of diversifying into these new categories Inditex still depended on Zara for the vast majority of its sales and profitability. In 2017 Zara represented €16.62 billion of Inditex’s revenue across 2251 stores in 96 markets (see Exhibit 4) and a full 70.1 per cent of its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Inditex had been moving rapidly for the last decade. It had taken its sales from €5.67 billion in 2004 to €23.34 billion in fiscal 2017. This had been accomplished through a focused geographic expansion effort that had seen the company grow to support 7475 stores by the end of 2017 along with growing online sales in 47 markets. Its recent focus for geographic growth was primarily Asia where it had opened 593 stores in China alone by the end of 2014. The company’s approach was very different from that of its traditional competitors. For instance it was highly vertically integrated and unlike all of its competitors it manufactured the majority of its own clothing. In fact it manufactured over 60 per cent of its own products in what most would consider high-cost labour markets—Spain Portugal or other nearby countries—relying less on third-world and outsourced manufacturing. Its competitors by contrast outsourced the vast majority of their production.Unique CapabilitiesInditex had built a number of defining competencies which its competitors did not possess. The first was associated with time to market. The company could move from a sketch of an idea to a product ready for shipment in as little as 10 to 15 days. This was precisely why Zara had been dubbed the champion of the relatively new “fast fashion” industry. However Pablo Isla chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of Inditex did not endorse this term. “I don’t identify with the concept of fast fashion” he said. “We are not about selling a million striped T-shirts as fast as possible.” He went on to say that the success was “based not on speed but on accuracy on understanding exactly what customers want week by week and store by store.” This highlighted a key capability at Inditex—its ability to identify customer needs and desires and translate these critical inputs back to the design teams in La Coruña. Zara achieved this through employee groups dubbed “commercials.” There were three essential levels of commercials that worked closely with one another at Zara. The design team commercials which typically consisted of four employees—two product managers and two designers—were responsible for designs in a specific category such as women’s sport clothing. They were given all the decision authority required to succeed including independence in setting designs ordering fabric determining manufacturing quantities and pricing. These teams decided what Zara would make and sell. In fact they introduced roughly 12000 new individual designs for Zara stores each year. These teams were supported by regional commercials responsible for liaising with store managers (and customers) across certain geographic footprints. Their overriding responsibility was to identify the clothing styles that would sell in their markets. They did this through observing what people were wearing (and importantly wanted to wear) along with the insights (and orders) coming from the store managers. Store managers were the third level of commercials. Their primary responsibility was to select the inventory they believed would sell in their stores—something they accomplished through talking with and observing customers. They had to also be up to the minute and intimate with their store inventory levels and sales. They ordered new inventory within each category in the store twice a week. For many years Zara had chosen to not implement a store-wide inventory management system requiring store managers to count inventory by hand. This among other things forced the store managers to be on the floor and by default to interact with customers. The insights gained from this interaction helped managers purchase inventory for their store that was more relevant and compelling for their customers. However store managers would not always receive the items they ordered. At times the regional commercials would place new items in stores to “see how they would sell.” They usually made these new clothes in small batches to avoid any significant markdowns in the event they were not popular. This approach drove Zara’s industry leading fashion failure rates.Commercials were encouraged to remain vigilant in introducing new items weekly and not restocking old items giving Zara a replenishment rate of only 2.8 per cent. This led to two unique customer behaviours. Firstly Zara customers would visit stores often (17 times per year versus 4.1 for brand loyal shoppers) as there were always new fashions to be had. Secondly when customers found something they liked they were motivated to avoid deferring their decision to purchase as Zara had created a sense of scarcity; it simply would not be there next time. These two behaviours drove Zara to an industry-leading third quarter 2018 trailing 12-month inventory turnover ratio of 28:48.These three levels of commercial teams were the heart of Zara’s success and they ultimately represented Zara’s delivery of what customers wanted when they wanted it as CEO Isla had implied. A core capability at Zara related to its ability to efficiently manufacture clothes in small batches. Not only could it move a new item from concept to market very quickly but it was able to accomplish this in small batches permitting it to test the market with very little risk. The challenges of having achieved this level of mass customization should not to be underestimated. Inditex invested heavily in automation within its manufacturing plants and tied this to effective management of its entire supply chain with a focus on breaking down any bottlenecks in the manufacturing process. For instance it operated a local dye and finishing plant close to its factories in La Coruña and did most of its own pre-cutting prior to delivering product to its sewing subcontractors. This was not without cost implications; its clothes typically cost 20 per cent more to manufacture than its competitors’ clothes which were manufactured in vast quantities in third-world countries. Distribution was centrally managed through a large distribution centre in La Coruña. All clothes sold by Zara even those manufactured in Portugal or Morocco (or China for that matter) were sent to Spain for distribution. Bloomberg reported: Beyond the distribution center are the 11 Zara-owned factories. Every shirt sweater and dress made in them is sent directly to the distribution centre via an automated underground monorail. There are 124 miles of track. Across the surrounding Galicia region are subcontractors some of whom have worked for the company since Amancio Ortega founded it in 1975.This enabled Zara to ship new inventory to every store in its network at least twice a week. Orders typically arrived two days after a store placed its request.Additionally Zara looked to manage its production costs by focusing on fabricating apparel that was designed to be worn only a few times driving a lower cost of materials. This did not seem to be an issue with its customers who enjoyed changing their fashions often. MarketingThe foundation of Zara’s marketing strategy had always been its stores. New stores were opened at a dizzying pace: 0.62 net openings per day over the five years to 2017. The company took store location design and layout very seriously. In fact Zara had “a full-time team of architects and visual-merchandising experts whose sole job at Zara HQ [headquarters] is to design and curate every aspect of the store from the sleek decor and light-bulb colour to the music being played and the exact positioning of clothing.” Window-front designs were viewed as its pre-eminent form of advertising. In fact Zara had a “full team of window-front designers who constantly travel around to international locations to understand the culture and customers of each store. They then create the window design that is unique to the store and all the props and details are then shipped to each store to be put up under strict guidelines.” Zara traditionally had spent lavishly on its store locations. In fact it completely revamped each store every four to five years with minor tweaks in between. Its stores were characterized by a high-end look and feel along with relatively low levels of inventory. This was somewhat anti-intuitive in relation to its competitors who liked to fill their stores with inventory in an attempt to optimize the revenue of their retail space investment. On the contrary Zara had always been focused on making the shopping experience as pleasant as possible for its customers enticing them to come back more often. There were 2238 Zara stores across 96 markets at the end of 2017 driving €16.6 billion in sales. These stores were primarily situated in the high-end retail sectors of major urban centres. Inditex had recently announced the opening of a 4366 square metre store in the heart of New York’s SoHo district for an astonishing $280 million. Ironically this property was the former home of Old Navy. In March 2016 it had opened a 2800 square metre store in the World Trade Centre in the heart of New York’s financial district. Zara spent very little on advertising only advertising (some) new store openings and twice-yearly sales events. It spent just 0.3 per cent of its revenue on advertising versus the industry standard of 3.5 per cent. There was no advertising line item in its financial reports as this category had not amounted to a material expenditure. Marketing magazine’s assistant editor Belle Kwan discussed Zara’s approach to advertising:No four-page spread in a glossy publication no gaudy red posters with tacky WordArt bubbles screaming discounts no half-naked B-grade celebrity with perfect hair prancing across a billboard.This is a story about the brand that made it sans advertising sans endorsement and sans almost all forms of mainstream marketing. And when we say “made it” we mean a loyal global following across 78 countries and a name that draws squeals of excitement from consumers and nods of respect from industry experts. Zara typically priced its clothes an average of 15 per cent lower than its competitors. It had been Ortega’s goal from his humble beginnings in La Coruña in 1975 to provide good quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. The difference was Zara did not look like any discount fashion store in the marketplace. As Derek Thompson of The Atlantic put it Zara liked to “cozy up to the most famous brands in the world to sing their luxury ambitions even as they profit off a brilliant cheap short supply chain that delivers similar fashion at a much lower price.” Zara enjoyed placing its stores close to luxury brands such as Prada and Gucci which of course tried to keep as far from Zara as possible. Competing Industry Business ModelHistorically industry titans such as Gap introduced the majority of their new clothing launches twice a year during the spring and fall fashion seasons. These introductions were preceded by up to nine months of centralized planning production and marketing. New line items were revealed to the market on fashion runways and vetted through a team of elite fashion designers and corporate executives. Small runs were made at third-world manufacturers shipped to centralized facilities vetted once more changed and finalized. At this point large orders were placed with these manufacturers for production at ultra-low per-unit cost. Orders were shipped and stored in regional warehouse facilities relatively close to retail outlets. Retail point-of-sale strategies were drawn up and store layouts designed. Inventory levels determined centrally were shipped to stores. Subsequently the advertising and selling began in full force to push product offerings to prospective customers. This approach carried the risk of fashion misses which traditionally were more than offset by the ultra-low costs of manufacturing offshore. This led to industry-standard gross profit margins of approximately 38.3 per cent in 2017. Growth was accomplished through both geographic expansion and brand expansion. For example Gap grew from 1640 stores in 2004 to a peak of 3721 in 2015 and was currently sitting at 3594 stores. Gap also grew across multiple brands representing different market niches including Gap Banana Republic Old Navy Athletica and Intermix. It was not uncommon to have multiple Gap-branded stores in one mall or shopping district. Innovative new fashion CompetitorsAs with any successful business model that changed an industry Zara’s model inevitably led to the emergence of a host of new competitors who presented either variations of the model or totally new approaches. Zara was experiencing this first hand with the emergence of competitors such as Uniqlo Co. Ltd. (Uniqlo) and Boohoo.com (Boohoo). Uniqlo was a Japanese firm that had been labelled a technology company not a fashion company and it had a sole focus on revolutionary fashion changes through technology innovation around the products not the fashion. Kensuke Suwa Uniqlo’s director of global marketing explained its approach:Between fashion and sports is a new area. . . There are a lot of fashion trends going on but there is no true innovation that impacts your actual life. How to make your life better could be in the middle between fashion and sports. For example athletes wear technically sophisticated uniforms; some of the essence of that could result in better clothes that would change clothing itself instead of just following fashion trends.This approach helped Uniqlo quickly grow to 3445 stores as of the end of fiscal 2018 with a sales forecast of $18.2 billion in its 2017 fiscal year. In 2018 Uniqlo was the largest apparel chain in Asia accounting for 6.5 per cent of apparel sales in Japan alone with an eye to becoming number one in the world and a near-term goal of expanding beyond its 50 stores in the United States.Boohoo a U.K. online “ultra-fast fashion” retailer had seen tremendous growth since its inception in 2006 with 2018 sales of £579.8 million and gross margins rivalling those of Zara at 52.8 per cent. With a direct focus on 16–30 year olds Boohoo took products from concept to sale in just two weeks putting over 100 new products on its website daily. Boohoo’s sales had been growing outside the United Kingdom in both Europe and the United States across a growing number of online brands: Boohoo PrettyLittleThing and NastyGal.  Next StepsThe competitive landscape was changing. The fast fashion world Zara had invented and dominated was changing. Perhaps it was time to reposition how Zara and the other Inditex brands competed in this changing world. Zara had changed the retail fashion industry once.

Crème Couture a private corporation located in Guelph Ontario was founded in 2013 and operated as a retail outlet for memorable lifestyle events. Crème Couture primarily sold wedding dresses but also retailed bridalwear formalwear and various clothing accessories to women of all ages. External pressures from an increasingly saturated industry were forcing Sandra to contemplate the future of her business. She wanted to develop an expansion strategy that would best position Crème Couture for long-term success. Specifically Sandra wanted to assess the profitability of each revenue segment to determine which segments should be further enhanced or eliminated. She had work to do to put a successful strategy in place. Industry AnalysisThe Wedding Services IndustryThe average cost of a wedding had reached an all-time high of approximately US$32000 with industry revenues growing at an annualized rate of 3 per cent over the prior five years. Wedding industry success positively correlated with economic performance. In times of economic prosperity when consumer disposable income was highest the average wedding spend would increase whereas periods of high unemployment and economic suffering would restrict spending. Data from the 2008 financial crisis revealed that couples would lower spending on their weddings by reducing secondary costs such as DJ music photography or venue fees.Since the 1900s individuals had become increasingly less willing to commit to marriage at a younger age and prioritized work and cohabitation. The median age of marriage had risen since 1960 from ages 20 to 27 for women and 23 to 29 for men. Additionally the crude marriage rate (the number of marriages per 1000 people every year) had decreased from 6.2 in 1991 to approximately 4.8 in 2018 and was expected to further decline by an annualized two per cent over the next five years. Exhibit 1 provides a further overview of marriage statistics in Ontario. The Bridalwear IndustryThe bridalwear industry was one of the many sub-industries that comprised the wedding services market. Bridal salon operators retailed a variety of clothing lines and wedding-based accessories catering to the needs of the entire wedding party: brides bridesmaids mothers-of-the-bride grooms groomsmen and flower girls. The success of bridal salons could be attributed to a variety of factors: customer service the depth and quality of merchandise fashion selections pricing reputation and location. Bridal appointments were typically scheduled several weeks in advance; few salons accepted walk-in appointments. Other apparel was sold on a walk-in basis similar to that of a normal clothing store. During the bridal appointment a bridal consultant would assist the bride and her respective party with the apparel selection process by providing fashion and sizing advice carrying dresses to and from the podium and creating an enjoyable atmosphere. Once purchased it was often the case that wedding apparel would undergo alterations to better fit the consumer. Many bridalwear operators outsourced this process to third parties while some offered the service in-house.Due to the high capital requirements for in-house dress manufacturing it was standard for bridalwear operators to source their dresses from designers all over the world. This required industry players to stay up-to-date with relevant fashion trends and increased the average bridal gown price to CA$2000. The high price tag had led many brides to seek out cost-effective alternatives such as secondhand bridal gowns at consignment stores or gowns that could be rented for the duration of the wedding. Some consumers purchased counterfeit brands from overseas manufacturers.Finally the bridal industry was unique as the majority of consumer purchases were one-time in nature. In comparison to other apparel industries establishing customer loyalty was therefore difficult. Guelph OntarioGuelph located in Southwestern Ontario had experienced strong economic growth since emerging from the 2008 recession. Guelph’s gross domestic product (GDP) had out-paced all other metropolitan cities within Ontario increasing at an annual average of 3.1 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent province-wide. This growth was attributed to the success of Guelph’s manufacturing industry which attracted a constant influx of new families and residents. Similarly Guelph’s population had increased by 19.7 per cent since 2006 the largest growth rate in Ontario and third largest nation-wide. Many attributed this increase to the rising real estate prices and high cost of living in the nearby city of Toronto Ontario—many Toronto residents were moving to Guelph and commuting to work. Guelph’s population was expected to increase to more than 166000 by the year 2021. Exhibit 2 provides a summary of Guelph’s past and future economic indicators. COmpetitionThe bridal industry was highly fragmented as technological introductions and shifting social norms had decreased barriers to entry. With the exception of David’s Bridal which held a dominant 27 per cent market-share there were no major industry players. Niche independent retailers fought for the remaining revenues by differentiating themselves on four main pillars: product offering price quality and customer service. David’s BridalFounded in 1950 David’s Bridal operated as the world’s largest bridal gown retailer managing an e-commerce platform and 300 brick-and-mortar stores throughout North America and the United Kingdom. David’s Bridal primarily sold bridal gowns but also retailed a variety of other products including bridesmaid dresses prom dresses jewellery and accessories. David’s Bridal realized its successes by retaining control of its operational supply chain and manufacturing many of its dresses overseas. As a result the company passed all labour and overhead cost savings to the consumer. The average David’s Bridal wedding gown retailed for approximately $650. To mitigate developing a low-quality image David’s Bridal also sold premium third-party bridal lines such as Vera Wang and Jenny Packham. These luxury gowns were often more expensive than the average wedding dress. The nearest David’s Bridal was located approximately 20 kilometres from Crème Couture. Brick-and-Mortar RetailersThere were seven different brick-and-mortar bridalwear operators located within Guelph and over 30 different bridalwear operators within Southwestern Ontario alone. The highly fragmented nature of the industry forced each operator to differentiate or risk obsolescence. As a result each company leveraged a variety of unique strategies including but not limited to:Obtaining the exclusive rights to sell certain fashion lines.Competing on premium or discount price points.Catering to the needs of the entire wedding party.Diversifying product offerings to include other special occasion apparel such as eveningwear.Custom-designing altering and manufacturing bridal apparel in-house.Retailing consignment dresses and second-hand bridal gowns. Using online sales platforms.Bridalwear operators often pursued only a few of these strategies in order to carve out their own niche develop a competitive advantage and establish a unique brand image.E-Commerce RetailersThe high overhead costs of operating a brick-and-mortar store had given rise to various e-commerce retailers. Overseas manufacturers sold their bridal gowns online directly to consumers at a fraction of the cost. This consequently had a negative impact on brick-and-mortar stores which were forced to discount their products in order to compete. CustomersCustomers of the bridal industry expected premium customer service. This meant that consumers prioritized certain factors when selecting a bridalwear operator including the operator’s designer fashion selections style price and diversity of product offerings. Customer preferences varied drastically from person to person; for example those who preferred luxury apparel valued brand name and product style whereas price-conscious consumers often did not. Brides would drive more than 100 kilometres in search of the perfect wedding dress. Due to the diverse composition of the consumer-base—women and men of a widespread range of ages incomes and fashion preferences— servicing the entire market was difficult for a bridalwear operator. Individuals aged 18 to 34 comprised 57 per cent of consumers those who were aged 35 to 64 represented 40 per cent and individuals 65 and older made up the remaining three per cent.Bridal stores primarily catered to the female members of the bridal party: the bride the mother-of-the-bride the bridesmaids and flower-girls. Male consumers were considered a secondary market given that most men rented their apparel from men’s formalwear retailers a more specialized alternative. Due to many longstanding North American cultural traditions each member of the wedding party played a unique role in the purchasing process. The bride held the majority of the purchasing power selecting not only her own dress but also those of the bridesmaids and flower-girls. The bride was responsible for the cost of her own dress whereas the bridesmaids and families of the flower-girls traditionally paid for theirs. The mother-of-the-bride independently selected and purchased the outfit of her choosing and finally the groom and groomsmen rented tuxedos for the duration of the wedding. It was common for a wedding party to purchase almost all their apparel from one bridalwear operator if the bride had had a positive wedding dress purchasing experience. Additional operational constraints also made consumer segmentation increasingly difficult. For instance each bridal operator had a limited amount of inventory storage space and similarly could offer only a select range of designer styles and prices. As a result most operators serviced a subsection of the total consumer market. Sandra wanted to reevaluate her target market to better identify the consumer segment that she should focus on. Créme Couture Bridal Inc.Crème Couture was located inside the Old Quebec Street Mall in the heart of Guelph Ontario (see Exhibit 3). Positioned as an upscale bridal operator Crème Couture provided alteration services as well as a diverse portfolio of wedding-related products including bridal gowns bridesmaid dresses social occasion apparel prom dresses and accessories (see Exhibit 4). Sandra was selective as to where she sourced her inventory independently selecting and curating fashion designers from all over the world. To remain up-to-date with fashion trends she attended annual fashion conventions throughout Europe and North America. Sandra made it a priority to meet with each designer in order to maintain a positive working relationship as well as to secure regional exclusivity rights for the apparel. The average Crème Couture wedding dress sold for approximately $1500. Any inventory that could not be sold after several years was passed along to a consignment store. Due to the logistical complexities associated with retailing online Crème Couture sold inventory in-store only.One of Crème Couture’s longstanding goals was to be renowned for its customer service. Sandra strongly believed that although the product was important to the consumer the purchasing experience was what really drove sales. Many brides had noted that there was a societal standard to achieve “the perfect wedding” creating unnecessary pressures during the wedding planning process. With this in mind Sandra invested a large amount of capital in establishing an elegant comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Among other amenities Crème Couture offered private one-on-one bridal consultations conducted all apparel appointments on a first-name basis provided sparkling water during appointments and celebrated all purchases with complementary bridal gift bags. Crème Couture also made it a priority to give back to the community by participating in local charity fashion shows and frequently donating wedding dresses to those in need. In addition to the community outreach Crème Couture utilized a variety of advertising media. Radio Facebook and Instagram were used to promote in-store products while popular wedding magazines featured many of Crème Couture’s current fashion lines. Sandra also coordinated an annual fashion show within the Old Quebec Street Mall to highlight new prom dress inventory. Expenditures for the FY 2018 prom fashion show totalled $6045. Finally Sandra advertised her wedding dresses at 14 bridal conventions throughout the year. Each bridal convention spanned over two days and allowed brides-to-be to browse the many different bridal retailers and fashion lines. All other advertising expenditures would be allocated as a proportion of total applicable revenues.Nevertheless many operational issues plagued the business. Clothing racks were cluttered with an excessive amount of inventory and as a result staff struggled to locate dresses. Additionally the bridal boutique was not as efficient as Sandra had hoped operating at a 15 per cent utilization rate and servicing approximately 500 brides per year. Sandra knew that something had to be done in order to free up space increase the bridal utilization rate and ultimately achieve her long-term growth goals.Financial AnalysisSandra wanted to evaluate the performance of each revenue segment before creating her expansion strategy. She needed to determine which expenditures were direct and which were indirect to identify expenditures that should be allocated to the consignment sales segment. To do so she gathered information pertaining to the company’s financial performance (see Exhibits 5 and 6). Sandra concluded that any expense that could not be easily traced to a specific revenue stream would be spread evenly among all applicable segments. The travel expense included Sandra’s purchasing excursions as well as the cost to transport equipment to and from the bridal conventions. Transportation to and from the bridal conventions cost a total of $6478. Sandra also travelled to Atlanta Georgia once a year to browse new prom fashion lines and designers which cost a total of $1500. The remaining purchasing excursion costs could not be allocated to a specific segment and thus were divided among all product segments except prom dresses in proportion to the cost of goods sold for each product segment.In addition to Sandra Crème Couture employed two bridal sales consultants and two general sales employees. Sandra oversaw and indirectly worked on all components of the business. The bridal sales consultants worked on an as-needed basis and focused exclusively on fitting and altering all bridal and bridesmaid dresses whereas the general sales employees oversaw the remaining in-store apparel segments. In fiscal 2018 the bridal sales consultants earned a total of $40534 $6982 and $9406 for the bridal gowns bridesmaid dresses and alterations segments respectively. Similarly the general sales employees were paid a total of $19394 for the social occasion dress segment $8436 for the prom dress segment and $9891 for the accessories segment. All salaries and wages were allocated as a proportion of total applicable revenues.The insurance policy pertained to all inventory and equipment that Crème Couture owned. Sandra estimated that 50 per cent of the total insurance policy would be allocated to the bridal gown segment whereas the remainder would be split evenly among the remaining product segments. Rent and utilities were allocated based upon square footage. The bridal boutique occupied 950 of the total 1900 square feet whereas bridesmaid prom and social occasion apparel each occupied 200 square feet. The rest of the rent expenditure was split evenly between the remaining in-store revenue segments.Sandra did not believe that office supplies telephone and Internet expenditures should be allocated to consignment sales and therefore spread them evenly among all in-store revenue segments. Finally Sandra had taken out a bank loan to purchase Crème Couture in 2013 and the interest and bank expenses could be spread evenly among all segments. Future ExpansionAs she examined the company’s current state Sandra began to establish a detailed expansion strategy that would best position Crème Couture for future growth. Specifically she wanted to understand which revenue segments were most and least profitable and as a result which warranted further investment. She wanted her expansion strategy to align with her goals of freeing up inventory space attracting more clientele providing exceptional customer service and increasing net profit.

While mutual funds provide adequate diversification by investing in varied securities they are also managed by professional managers with significant experience in wealth management. In particular your colleague was impressed by the stellar performance of the Tata Equity P/E Fund (TEPF) and recommended investing in it.The TEPF had been successful in beating its benchmark by wide margins over a sustained period of time and was considered one of the top performing funds in its category. Importantly the fund had shown impressive consistency in retaining its position among the top performing funds over time. The fund adopted a value-based investment approach investing in stocks that were trading at a reasonable bargain compared to the broad market and could potentially beat the markets in the long run.Before considering the TEPF as a serious alternative for your personal investment you wanted to thoroughly evaluate the fund’s performance to find out the extent to which it truly succeeded at generating excess returns after adjusting for risks and to determine the sources of such outperformance if any. You collected relevant information to find these answers about investing in the TEPF.Business at Tata Mutual FundThe investments of the Tata Mutual Fund were managed by Tata Asset Management Limited part of the esteemed Tata Group one of the largest and oldest industrial groups in India. The fund had an average assets under management (AUM) of ₹461 billion which was 2.24 per cent of the industry AUM as of September 2017. Exhibit 1 summarizes the breakdown of the total AUM under Tata Mutual Fund into funds categorized according to their asset classes and their types for the last five years.As was the industry trend while most of the fund’s AUM was composed of debt funds (68 per cent) equity and hybrid funds contributed 17 per cent and 15 per cent respectively of the total AUM. Within debt funds liquid funds dominated and contributed 71 per cent of the corpus followed by income funds (25 per cent). For equity funds diversified funds contributed a significant share of 71 per cent followed by other sector-oriented and thematic funds (29 per cent). Importantly almost all funds under the Tata Mutual Fund were active in nature; the share of passive equity funds was negligible. Within the hybrid category equity-oriented funds contributed the bulk of the AUM (94 per cent). This was probably due to the favourable tax treatment of equity-oriented hybrid funds whereby investors were exempt from any long-term capital gains tax. Exhibit 1 also suggests that the overall AUM had grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36 per cent over the past five years. This growth was particularly fuelled by the growth in hybrid funds (65 per cent) followed by debt funds (36 per cent); equity funds had grown at a rate of 24 per cent per year. Interestingly within debt funds the fixed maturity plans witnessed a negative growth rate (−23 per cent). On the contrary investment in liquid funds had grown at 33 per cent per year. This reflected the increasing participation of institutional investors in these funds.The growth in the corpus of equity funds was primarily driven by the popularity and hence utility of diversified funds among retail investors. While diversified funds had grown at 33 per cent per year the growth in sector-oriented funds thematic funds and index funds had been approximately 10 per cent per year. Similarly most of the growth in hybrid funds was led by equity-oriented funds which had grown at a phenomenal rate of 80 per cent per year.The TEPFIn 2004 Tata Mutual Funds launched the TEPF with the objective of investing in a diversified portfolio of value-oriented stocks. Value stocks were those stocks that traded at a relatively lower price–earnings (P/E) ratio than did their immediate peers. Value-oriented investors believed that valuations for such stocks were temporarily depressed and would increase when markets eventually realized their true potential. The TEPF was an open-ended fund that aimed to invest in stocks whose rolling P/E ratio was lower than that of its benchmark the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensitive Index (SENSEX). As per the key information memorandum floated by the fund the fund was suitable for investors seeking long-term capital appreciation and reasonable regular income through dividends paid by the constituent stocks. Since April 2016 the TEPF had been managed by Sonam Udasi who also managed 10 other funds within the Tata Mutual Fund.Exhibit 2 shows data pertaining to the TEPF and its benchmark for the past five years. As of September 2017 the TEPF had a total AUM of ₹18.15 billion which was growing at a CAGR of 48 per cent per year. The fund had beaten its benchmark by a wide margin in four of the preceding five years ending September 2017. This was reflected in the fund’s ranking among its peers where it had stood in the top five funds for three out of the last five years.Exhibit 3 shows the constitution of typical portfolio holdings in the fund along with the benchmark. While the benchmark was a pure large-cap portfolio the fund also invested significantly in mid- and small-cap securities. Exhibit 4 shows additional information on TEPF attributes relevant to its investors.The Decision to InvestAlthough you were quite impressed by the seemingly stellar performance of the TEPF there were several matters that you wanted to clarify before deciding whether to invest in the fund. Specifically you were perplexed by the portfolio constitution of the TEPF versus that of its benchmark. Exhibit 3 suggests a possible benchmark mis-specification as the TEPF’s investment style differed significantly. Thus although the fund’s returns nominally exceeded those of the benchmark you wanted to assess the risk-adjusted performance of the fund versus the benchmark.You recalled from your basic knowledge of financial concepts that the risk could be measured as the volatility in returns in absolute terms or as compared to the benchmark. That is either the standard deviation of a fund’s returns or its beta might be useful in assessing the risk-adjusted performance. However in a case where the benchmark itself was incorrectly specified you wondered if such a measure would be useful for studying the fund’s outperformance even on a risk-adjusted basis. You were of the view that in such situations the fund’s performance should rather be evaluated with respect to a benchmark that reflected the true style of the fund’s operation.While collecting the inputs required to create a style-adjusted benchmark you considered the required properties of such a benchmark. Although a modified benchmark should reflect the fund’s typical style of operation it should be devoid of any active management—that is first the modified benchmark and the fund should have similar exposure to factors that could influence stock prices in general. According to the asset-pricing literature these factors were usually the size growth orientation and momentum in stock returns. Second the style-adjusted benchmark should not bet on any specific security. That is the benchmark should be a truly passive portfolio.After going through some studies on performance attribution you envisioned that a style-adjusted benchmark could first be created by mapping each constituent TEPF stock to a representative portfolio reflecting the stock’s concurrence with the three asset-pricing factors. Portfolios representing the interaction of these three factors could be created by sorting the universe of all available stocks in the broader market into quintiles based on these factors. Accordingly a total of 125 (5 × 5 × 5) portfolios would serve as representative portfolios for each month. Each constituent TEPF stock could then be mapped exclusively to one of these 125 portfolios for each month. For example assuming a TEPF stock XYZ at the end of a month was among the top quintile of stocks of all the available stocks trading in the broader market in terms of its size the bottom quintile of stocks in terms of its growth orientation and the third quintile of stocks in terms of its momentum then XYZ could be classified as the constituent of a portfolio of stocks representing these three quintiles for the given month. Second the monthly returns of these 125 representative portfolios would be recorded and assigned to the respective stocks for each month. Third the average weights of each constituent stock over the period of analysis would provide the TEPF’s specific style tilt during this period. Finally the product of these average weights and the assigned monthly returns of the representative portfolios would provide the style-adjusted benchmark returns for the given month. Importantly if the stated benchmark truly reflected the TEPF’s typical style there would not be any significant difference between the returns on stated and modified benchmarks. Panels A B and C of Exhibit 5 (provided as an Excel supplement to the case Ivey product no. 7B18N025) provide relevant information on TEPF holding percentages at the end of a month monthly returns for these constituent stocks and the monthly returns of assigned representative portfolios respectively over the last 12 months. Note that Exhibit 5C was created using data from Exhibits 5D and 5E. Exhibit 5D shows the assigned number of the 125 representative portfolios to each stock. Exhibit 5E shows monthly returns for these 125 portfolios for the last 12 months. Exhibit 6 shows additional relevant information about the fund and its benchmark.Apart from knowing the TEPF’s true outperformance you were also interested in knowing specific sources of value addition. For example managers could change their portfolio constitution in the short run so as to gain from the new information that they continuously gathered about stocks. Similarly fund managers often claimed to exhibit superior stock-selection and market-timing abilities. An exploration into the sources of outperformance would yield helpful information about the value added by the fund manager through her trading activities management of cash security selection and market timing.You further recalled that although the above-mentioned approach would decompose the portfolio returns at a granular level there were other ways to study the extent of managerial skill. For example one could use multiple-factor models with the three asset-pricing factors as explanatory variables to study the portfolio’s average outperformance after controlling for these factors. Further one could track the changes in the portfolio’s style configuration over time using a style analysis. You wondered what the specific advantages and disadvantages of these alternate approaches to conducting an attribution analysis might be.Exhibit 1: Assets under management for the Tata Mutual Fund (₹ Billion)Note: FMPs = fixed maturity plansSource: Compiled by the author using data from ACE MF (Accord Fintech 2018).Exhibit 2: Tata Equity P/E Fund versus its benchmarks and peers in the categoryExhibit 3: Constitution of the Tata Equity P/E Fund’s portfolio versus its benchmarkSource: Compiled by the author using data from ACE MF (Accord Fintech 2018).Exhibit 4: Fund-specific details pertaining to the Tata Equity P/E Fund as on September 30 2017Notes: NAV = net asset value; S&P BSE SENSEX = S&P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive IndexSource: Compiled by the author using data from ACE MF (Accord Fintech 2018).Exhibit 5: information on TEPF holding percentages and returnsPlease see the Excel supplement to the exercise (see Ivey product no. 7B18N025) for Exhibit 5.

Ltd. (Semir) Zhejiang Semir E-commerce Co. Ltd. (Semir E-commerce) achieved continuous revenue growth after its launch in 2012 and had become a main driver of Semir’s overall success. In 2016 Semir’s E-commerce earned revenue of more than ¥3.2 billion contributing approximately 30 per cent to Semir’s annual revenue. Even though Semir’s E-commerce had been a great success the whole casual clothing industry including Semir was still exploring E-commerce especially the online-to-offline (O2O) business model. In early 2016 Semir’s top management was faced with a rapidly changing online environment and increasingly fierce competition in the industry and had to decide how the company could maintain its early success in E-commerce. As traffic on all E-commerce platforms slowed they needed to answer several questions: Should Semir adopt a differentiated or a converged O2O model? How should Semir deal with the challenges of competition from fast-fashion retailers such as Uniqlo Co. Ltd. and Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M)?COMPANY BACKGROUNDSemir’s E-commerce ActivitiesSemir’s entry into E-commerce was not early at all. When Hongliang Zhang Semir’s chief operating officer in charge of E-commerce started Semir’s E-commerce activities with his colleagues in 2010 Semir’s major competitor Metersbonwe Group (Meters/bonwe) had been using E-commerce since 2007 and had already formed a mature E-commerce team and laid out its E-commerce market. In the beginning Semir outsourced the E-commerce activities of four affiliated brands to Taobao Partners. However because Semir and Taobao had conflicts of interest and Semir’s competitors gradually put more emphasis on E-commerce Semir decided to start its own E-commerce platform. In May 2012 Semir invested ¥130 million to fund Semir E-commerce. The first year was a great success. In only eight months Semir achieved online transaction revenues of over ¥100 million. In 2014 Semir’s E-commerce revenue topped ¥1 billion—which was near the top in the Chinese clothing industry. Semir ranked first in the Chinese casual clothing category and its children’s brand Balabala ranked first in the Chinese children’s clothing category. As a wholly owned subsidiary Semir E-commerce not only used the group’s resources more effectively but it also applied an independent financial accounting system in order to provide more potential for future development. April 21 2015 was the third anniversary of Semir’s venture into E-commerce. To celebrate its doubled revenue growth in every one of the last three years Semir united its eight affiliated brands with a celebration themed “Three years without regrets; 30000 items for free” and used this theme for its November 11 sale. This promotion brought Semir ¥50 million in online sales revenue; the sales revenue from two other E-commerce platforms Semir sold on—taobao.com and tmall.com—was close to ¥30 million. In only three years Semir’s E-commerce team had grown from just over ten people to nearly 700 people. The team’s office space had expanded from one floor to a whole building and a new industrial park was being planned. The founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Semir Group Guanghe Qiu had high expectations for Semir’s E-commerce. In a media interview in 2014 Qiu echoed Zhang’s comments stating that Semir would change its E-commerce strategy from reducing inventory to adding special online editions in order to differentiate between its online and offline products. This strategy was referred to as the “the second undertaking” by Semir employees. In accordance with Qiu’s expectations Semir would increase its online sales establish an interactive O2O retail model and rebuild a Semir brand that would be twice as large in 2017. Although expectations were good Semir’s general manager of E-commerce Feichun Shao pointed out that realizing the second undertaking in E-commerce would not be easy.SEMIR’S E-COMMERCE STRATEGIESVirtual Business ModelSemir had been practicing a virtual business model since it came into existence—that is the company outsourced its manufacturing to other companies while itself focusing on product design brand marketing supply chain management and channel development. This virtual business model was common in the clothing industry. Many of Semir’s major competitors including Meters/bonwe used this model. In order to minimize quality and delivery problems virtual business companies had to maintain long-term relationships with their upstream supply chain partners and this required long-term mutual trust and a win-win perspective. To ensure the quality of manufactured products Semir selected its manufacturers based on their quality control standards. Moreover Semir E-commerce thought that channel relationships should be partnerships rather than short-term trading relationships. That was why most of Semir’s manufacturers had been partners with the company for over ten years. Corporate Culture: Altruism and Win-WinAlthough Semir started using E-commerce fairly late the company was not anxious for success and first decided to strengthen itself. Semir was highly influenced by the management philosophy of Kazuo Inamori especially his Amoeba Management method. Zhang said that he believed in Inamori and the altruistic win-win philosophies he advocated in Amoeba and that these had inspired the Semir E-commerce executives a great deal.Evidence of Inamori’s philosophies was everywhere in the Semir E-commerce office building. The elevators displayed corporate mottos such as “Respect the divine and love people; value altruism and pursue win-win” and “Realize employees’ dreams and social value” and banners showing elected managers of Amoeba units were displayed at the entrances. Inamori stated that “a good company provides more than just a paycheque to its employees it is the attitude and vision of life.” Accordingly the whole Semir E-commerce building provided employees with a free and comfortable “home” full of positive energy. The first and third floors were where the offices were located. The whole second floor was a cafeteria. Upstairs there was a lounge a recreation room a library and a bar. There were plants adopted by employees on the top floor terrace. Employees could also see the entire Xixi National Wetland Park from the terrace. Zhang added “We hope that our employees do not just come to Semir to work but live a wonderful life here. We want them to see Semir as their home and not want to leave.”Like Semir Semir E-commerce held a “Semir Culture Month” every year which had become a highlight of Semir’s culture. During this month Semir E-commerce organized recreational activities such as sports chess dances model shows singing groups and galas. These activities brought vitality creativity and cohesion to the corporate culture and played a vital role in building a harmonious and vibrant atmosphere at Semir E-commerce. Semir E-commerce not only provided its employees with recreational facilities and activities but also organized employees from different departments to share and exchange ideas on a regular basis. One reason Semir had achieved top sales in the industry in three years and maintained a fast and stable growing momentum was because it had outstanding employees who were proactive at learning and improving. Semir E-commerce’s Promotion SystemSemir E-commerce was committed to optimizing and innovating its training system making employees’ learning and development a priority and carrying forward various career planning training to create growth paths for its employees and to vitalize the company by helping employees learn and grow rapidly. In 2014 the company implemented a system of elections for positions. Employees could compete for the positions that they thought they were competent for through elections (see Exhibit 1). The system created effective competition within each Amoeba unit and also helped employees realize their personal value. On the one hand it improved Amoeba units and employees’ understanding of the company’s operations; on the other hand it provided a shortcut for employees to find their ideal roles fulfill their duties and achieve harmony and unity between corporate values and personal values. Multi-Brand Business ModelSemir owned eight online brands: Semir Balabala GLM Glabuy Minette Mini Balabala Badibadi and Mongdodo. Except for the exclusive online brand Glabuy the brands each had both online and offline stores. The Semir brand founded in 1996 offered young stylish vibrant and cost-effective casual clothing for young people between 16 and 30 years old. Balabala founded in 2002 sold professional and stylish children’s clothing for children 0–14 years old in middle-class and well-off families. Balabala also owned the children’s brands Mini Balabala and Mongdodo. Whereas Mini Balabala founded in 2008 was aimed at children between 0 and 4 years old Mongdodo a new brand launched in 2014 filled the niche market of children’s shoes.  On July 7 2014 Semir E-commerce added its exclusive online brand Glabuy which promoted the image of fashionable men’s clothing to its Semir flagship store on tmall.com. Glabuy contracted popular Korean movie stars Lee Min-ho and Kim Soo-hyun to endorse its products and took great pride in this connection. Semir shared its resources with Semir E-commerce in order to make Glabuy known to consumers and to support its strategic plan. Glabuy’s major product was men’s dress shirts. Similar to its competitor Vancl.com (Vancl) which sold combed-cotton shirts Glabuy sold dress shirts designed for high-class male customers. However while Vancl had the endorsement of a successful businessman (the CEO of Xiaomi Inc. Jun Lei) Semir was endorsed by Kim who represented a fashionable young white-collar market. Glabuy’s target market was reflected in the offerings at its Tmall store. As well as dress shirts it sold T-shirts jeans and casual pants. Glabuy was trying to label itself as a high-quality low-price brand through online distribution channels.Semir also jointly established an international fashion information centre with the Italian company Promosle which collected information on trendy colours and materials and organized manufacturing plans accordingly. More and more celebrity-endorsed brands and products were emerging on the Internet. Some lacked manufacturing experience but knew how to market their products online. Some were traditional companies that were looking for online opportunities after having struggled offline. They all had their own strengths and weaknesses. However no matter how they marketed their products or which celebrities they used for endorsement the key to market performance was the product itself. As Shao explainedPerfect products and the fan effect are two contributing factors to successful Internet marketing. On the one hand we promote Glabuy as it was born for perfection because we believe that in order to win the market we have to provide our customers with the best products no matter online or offline. On the other hand Glabuy marks the transformation of Semir’s fan strategy from offline to online and this differentiates us from other online brands. We have confidence in Glabuy’s market performance. However whether it will become the new engine for Semir E-commerce’s revenue growth we will have to wait and see.  Amoeba Operation ModelHow did Semir manage its multiple brands? After three years of exploration Semir E-commerce had a clearer organizational structure. The general manager supervised the operation and product departments as well as supportive departments such as visual administration and finance. The operation and product departments were the most important. With a team of nearly 200 people the operation department was responsible for establishing organizational structure supervising and coordinating the work of all departments implementing the company’s business plan promoting and selling products and providing customer services. The product department had 20 employees. As the hub of the operation department and the offline supply chain this department predicted and planned which products should be put on which website at what time and in what quantities based on factors such as seasonal trends and life cycle.Semir E-commerce practiced the Amoeba Management business method. When it was founded in 2012 Semir E-commerce handed out Inamori’s book For People and for Profit: A Business Philosophy for the 21st Century to every employee. Book clubs were organized for employees to discuss Inamori’s philosophies including the correspondence principle and the muscular principle. Semir E-commerce also brought in scholars of Inamori’s Amoeba method and management style to give internal training classes and organized employees to study cases of successful applications of the Amoeba business model. According to the Amoeba Management method an organization was divided into multiple Amoeba units. The managers of each Amoeba unit made their own plans took responsibility for their own profits and losses and relied on their own teams to achieve goals. The Amoeba model kept employees motivated and encouraged them to proactively take part in the company’s operation. As a well-known advanced business philosophy the Amoeba model was becoming more and more mature at Semir E-commerce. As each Amoeba unit wanted to keep independent accounting in the finance human resources and marketing departments the management of Semir E-commerce had to constantly deploy divide and adjust Amoeba units according to the needs of the company’s general operations and the scales of targeted E-commerce platforms. For example there were two Amoeba units on tmall.com: Semir and Balabala. These two Amoeba units were the two largest within Semir E-commerce. The business on the second largest platform vip.com was handled by another Amoeba unit. Business on all of the other online sales platforms—such as yhd.com jd.com and dangdang.com—was the responsibility of another independent Amoeba unit. In daily operations each Amoeba unit’s position was relatively stable so each Amoeba manager’s responsibilities were relatively clear. Amoeba managers did the following: 1) developed and implemented annual business plans and budgets for their units; 2) held themselves responsible for team performance and built strong teams through recruitment interviewing and training; and 3) promoted the integration of internal and external resources and improved communication with other Amoeba units and corporate departments. Since Semir E-commerce began to use the Amoeba method to manage different brands at the end of 2012 revenue had grown rapidly each year: they had gone from ¥353 million in 2013 to ¥657 million in 2014 ¥1.2 billion in 2015 and ¥2.1 billion in 2016 (see Exhibit 2). SEMIR E-COMMERCE’S MARKETINGEmploying the Fan Effect to Promote New ProductsIn 2014 after it contracted Korean movie star Kim as its endorser Semir promoted the Kim Soo-hyun Edition 80 100 per cent combed-cotton dress shirt on Tmall and Taobao. This move caught the attention of many Kim fans. Messages promoting these Prince Charming shirts were massively forwarded on the two Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo even before the sale debuted. The successful sale of the Prince Charming shirts was supported by high-value low-price products. The 100 per cent combed-cotton dress shirts were made of very even strong durable fine knit cotton. Their fabric texture and comfort were far better than most shirts in the market. The cotton and yarn were from Aksu Xinfa Cotton Industry Co. Ltd. which was known for producing high-quality cotton. The workmanship and cuts were also ensured to be high quality. Although other companies sold similar shirts for about ¥1000 Semir sold them for only ¥149. This was very attractive to online customers especially those born after the 1980s and 1990s who sought out high-quality but low-price products. Cost effectiveness combined with limited edition availability was a popular E-commerce model. With a long history of offline operation Semir had strong large-scale supply chain management capabilities which provided important support for Semir E-commerce’s strategic transformation. The core of Semir’s new E-commerce strategy was to reduce intermediate costs by sharing supply chain resources and to provide high-quality low-price products relying on the most valuable customers and economies of scale. This strategy an E-commerce breakthrough was attributed to Semir’s strategic deployment of resources and the creativity of its employees. It was why the Prince Charming shirts associated with Kim were a great success and why Semir would continue using the fan effect and the high-quality low-price model as keys to its future development. After contracting Kim Semir invited other Korean celebrities such as Lee Min-ho to endorse its products. With the help of the celebrity effect to promote its online products Semir had undoubtedly enhanced online customers’ recognition of the Semir brand. As Shao explainedThe key about marketing cost-effective products is measurability. Customers are attracted to highly cost-effective products through standardized parameters low prices and the celebrity fan effect. The success of promoting Prince Charming’s shirts has confirmed the continuation of Semir’s E-commerce strategy. Semir will push out more representative single products in order to become an industry leader that is successful both online and offline. Obviously Semir’s breakthrough thinking and transformation in E-commerce had already put it ahead in the Chinese clothing industry.Marketing Channel PartnershipIn the last three years of its channel development Semir E-commerce had maintained a complementary partnership with its offline stores but at the same time it had focused even more on establishing good long-term partnerships with various E-commerce platforms. Zhao explained:In 2012 Semir E-commerce’s competitors such as Tonlion Meters/bonwe and Jeanswest were all far ahead of Semir in revenue generation. Jeanswest’s revenue was the highest at more than three times of ours. We knew that it is not ideal to simply apply competitors’ experiences to ourselves because we are all different so we started to visit the major platforms such as Tmall Taobao jd.com and vip.com in person to learn from them and seek resources. We got good results from doing it because it allowed these platforms to understand our thoughts and plans and they were willing to work with us to achieve win-win.However Semir’s relationships with more than 90 per cent of its franchised offline stores were game or trade relationships because each made profits from the other and therefore conflicts of interest between online and offline stores were unavoidable. In addition the objective of franchised offline stores was to maximize individual profits. If the interests of individual franchisees collided with Semir’s overall interests it would cause a variety of channel conflicts and negatively affect the efficiency of the channels. It seemed difficult to build a mutually beneficial partnership with franchised offline stores based on the O2O model. Of course this problem of allocating profit between online and offline interests was not unique to Semir E-commerce but affected the entire clothing industry.Marketing StrategySemir E-commerce’s marketing budget was always small but requests to improve marketing were always increasing. Semir’s early marketing was mostly based on platform and product. Later it relied more on celebrity resources and new media platforms to creatively promote online products. For example because Semir’s target customers young people between 16 and 25 years old liked watching South Korean soap operas and South Korean movie star Lee Min-ho had joined the 2014 National Chinese New Year Gala Semir successfully promoted Semir products on new media platforms such as Weibo Xiaonei and WeChat. The direct result was that 40000 Lee Min-ho edition down jackets were sold on November 11 also known as Singles’ Day. Semir also used the Chinese version of the well-known South Korean reality show Running Man to market its products. In the “three years without regrets; 30000 items for free” three-year anniversary celebration in April 2015 Semir E-commerce sold over ¥50 million online on the opening day alone. Moreover Semir E-commerce customized its marketing strategies for different brands. Some new brands might not get as much traffic when they were first launched so Semir E-commerce usually provided support in terms of promotion and staffing. For example although the Balabala brand had the highest online revenue in the children’s clothing category Semir E-commerce had barely promoted it online. It was successful because of the high quality of its products and its brand image which had been established offline over the years. Semir was a prudent company. It was sometimes slow to make decisions but once decisions were made it would spare no efforts to implement them. Although it entered E-commerce later than most other brands in the industry Semir still became a leader. For example Balabala entered the children’s clothing market later than most others but became the champion in a short time. Considering that some well-known international and national clothing brands such as ZARA H&M Uniqlo and Meters/bonwe were proactively exploring their own O2O models and that brands such as Meters/bonwe had already created their own shopping apps Shao said “Semir has always been tracking the market performance of the Meters/bonwe mobile app. We are ready to launch our own app at any time and believe that it will be a blockbuster.”  CLOTHING INDUSTRY’S E-COMMERCE TRANSFORMATIONThe clothing industry was one of the largest industries affected by E-commerce due to the rigid demands of clothes and the high coverage and acceptance of E-commerce in the clothing field. In this context clothing companies were suffering because overstock was increasing while external competition was intensifying. Fast-fashion brands ZARA H&M and Uniqlo had been competing for their share of the online market and winning the hearts of more and more customers. A lack of staff and unequal distribution of profits among channels were also restricting the development of traditional clothing companies. In such a market environment a majority of clothing companies had no choice but to transform themselves to seek out a successful future. Meters/bonwe: Dipping Toes into O2OMeters/bonwe was founded in 1995 in Wenzhou Zhejiang Province. Meters/bonwe owned five major brands—Meters/bonwe Me&City (including Me&City Kids) AMPM MooMoo and CH’IN—and a business-to-consumer E-commerce platform banggo.com. Meters/bonwe was a Chinese casual clothing brand created in 1995 that targeted dynamic and stylish young people between 16 and 25 years old. Me&City was founded in 2008 as a high-end fashion brand. MooMoo was a children’s clothing brand launched in 2012 that promoted the idea “have imagination; be different.” AMPM was an exclusive online brand aiming to provide high-quality reasonable prices and environmentally friendly clothes and daily necessities to customers. It advocated a creative environmentally friendly natural and simple life attitude that preserved individuals’ uniqueness. Meters/bonwe’s transformation path involved many of the characteristics of international fast-fashion brands. Meters/bonwe spared no effort in investing in and upgrading its product design supply chain lean management terminal channel development and E-commerce operation expecting to continuously improve supply chain responsiveness and develop more products that would meet consumers’ needs. As early as 2011 Meters/bonwe had already put forward its O2O E-commerce strategy but it did not implement it until two years later. On October 19 2013 Meters/bonwe announced that the company would operate in one system: it would merge its offline stores with the online business and would return the independently operated E-commerce platform Banggou which had been taken out two years ago back to the company’s system. This was Meters/bonwe’s first step in transforming to O2O. On October 28 2013 Meters/bonwe officially announced the start of its O2O strategy. In its flagship shop in Yanqing Hangzhou it held an O2O strategy launch ceremony to present its O2O concepts and practices to nearly 200 guests. The CEO of Meters/bonwe revealed that the company would invest more toward improving E-commerce by using mass data and cloud computing to target the most valuable customers and to market products more precisely. At the same time offline stores would be upgraded into experience stores to provide fitting rooms and pick-up locations for online customers. The first Meters/bonwe experience store was located on Yanqing Road in Hangzhou; the five-floor store had been turned into a leisure and recreational destination. Customers could enjoy a cup of coffee while browsing online products on provided iPads; they could request a product try-on with a click and the desired products would be sent to them right away by a staff member. As well as fitting rooms offline stores had another important function: to serve as pick-up locations. Once customers placed their orders and paid online they could choose to pick their purchases up from a store close by. The advantage of this was that if customers did not like the colour or the size when they were in the store they could exchange the products for new ones immediately. From the debut of the O2O Experience Store in Hangzhou in October 2013 to the reopening of the O2O-transformed All Brand Store in Chongqing in March 2014 Meters/bonwe upgraded its stores in seven cities. It was also planning to open 100 O2O stores in one year and 1000 stores in three years. Yishion: Developing the New Exclusive Online Brand A21Yishion was founded in 1997 in Dongguan Guangdong Province. Unlike Semir and Meters/bonwe Yishion was not a virtual business. It manufactured its products in its own factory. In the clothing industry the notion of valuing the brand over assets was agreed on but Yishion insisted on focusing on assets. Combined with efficient logistics Yishion had truly achieved responsiveness and had given itself advantages in inventory management and seasonal promotion. In 2002 Yishion greatly increased awareness of its brand by contracting popular Hong Kong movie stars Cecilia Cheung and Louis Koo as its brand endorsers. In 2014 Yishion contracted with Jun Ji-hyun the lead actress from the popular South Korean TV series My Love from the Star. Jun Ji-hyun appeared in an advertising campaign wearing classic black-and-white and striped clothes that were simple but eye catching thus further consolidating Yishion’s brand image of leading South Korean trends and creating fashion styles. On January 11 2013 Yishion announced the suspension of its brand’s e-business in online stores and introduced a new online brand A21. Yishion’s chief E-commerce officer Wenhua Yu explained that the company changed its E-commerce strategy because it wanted to differentiate its online and offline products. The new online-exclusive brand A21 was launched on March 21 2013. Its first-year revenue on Tmall reached ¥100 million. In the same year it became the first Chinese E-commerce clothing brand to advertise on the giant screen in Times Square in New York. A21 was the abbreviation for Always 21—that is forever young and fashionable. It was a style of western simplicity young fashion high quality independence and freedom designed specifically for young people. A21’s products were mainly for men. It launched six series: Street Basic Trend Refresh College and Jeans. In February 2015 A21 brought women’s clothes into the market. Following the successful experiences of ZARA and H&M A21’s buyers group made up of trend leaders from more than ten different countries used two-thirds of their time each year to fly to international fashion shows and well-known high-end brand stores all around the world to collect ideas. SEMIR E-COMMERCE’S CHALLENGESSemir E-commerce had already achieved outstanding market performance. In 2014 its revenue was the highest in the Chinese casual clothing category and Balabala’s revenue was the highest in the Chinese children’s clothing category. In 2015 Semir E-commerce’s goal was to break ¥1.6 billion in revenue. Although Semir E-commerce had made such remarkable achievements over the previous three years it was facing many challenges as well.O2O ExplorationAs a future direction Semir wanted to expand its online sales and build an interactive online-to-offline business model. However Semir was still exploring the method by which to execute this model. Highly developed information technologies such as cloud services and mass data had provided sufficient technical support for improving clothing companies’ digital responsiveness under the O2O model and some clothing companies such as Meters/bonwe had already started to explore O2O models. They introduced items such as “cloud wardrobe” and “cloud shelf” in their offline stores and effectively connected the offline experience with online resources in order to achieve full circulation of their online and offline products. However some analysts pointed out that the clothing industry’s O2O model should not just be reflected in the final sales step but should be traced back to the upstream manufacturing steps in order to maximize the value of the clothing brands. Regarding the O2O model in the clothing industry they commented further thatThe core of the O2O model is very understandable. It is to direct online customers to local business entities. The promotion and payment are previously completed online whereas the bought products or services are consumed offline. However it is very hard for both sides to come to an agreement on how to equally allocate the profits. To solve this problem effective communication and professional accountants are required to develop an appropriate profit allocation plan.Actually the O2O models for all companies in the clothing industry—from Meters/bonwe whose offline stores were all owned and managed by the company to Semir whose offline stores were all franchised—shared this problem of profit allocation. Semir E-commerce was continuously exploring its own O2O model. To do this it converted a few offline stores into experience stores. At the same time it studied the E-commerce of other clothing companies in the industry. In the era of mass data and O2O trends how should Semir E-commerce address the conflicts between online and offline stores? Based on the app recently launched by competitor Meters/bonwe Semir understood the importance of a mobile app to clothing companies’ O2O development. The question was when and how should Semir draw support from a mobile app to help its multiple brands connect online and offline businesses?Semir E-commerce’s Brand StructureSince its inception Semir had endeavoured to strengthen its existing brands as well as to introduce exclusive online brands such as Glabuy. Facing the penetration of international fast-fashion brands such as H&M ZARA C&A and Uniqlo in recent years some Chinese casual clothing companies had created their own fast-fashion brands such as Yishion’s A21. To stay in the game how should Semir E-commerce ",,,,,
eact to the challenges from fast-fashion brands in the Chinese market? On this issue Zhang saidThere is a long way in front of us. Our short-term strategies are not only to steadily improve the market performance of existing brands (Semir Balabala and Mini etc.) but also to continuously innovate to grow Glabuy into our new profit engine. Our long-term strategy is to use O2O to redesign the business sections in the children’s clothing brands. And of course the multi-brand strategy is a must. In a fiercely competitive market it was not easy for Semir to maintain its current growth through multiple brands because the positioning of international fast-fashion brands was higher while their pricing was very close to Semir’s. Should Semir take the road of internationalization and reposition its brands to the high end? How should Semir build its brand structure?

Larry Rogers chief operating officer OrganiGramOn December 1 2016 the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation (the Task Force) released its final report. It was the result of a long process of consulting with many stakeholders including patients various levels of government and experts across Canada and the United States. The Task Force was assembled in June 2016 soon after the Trudeau government announced (on April 20 2016) that legislation to legalize recreational cannabis would be introduced in the spring of 2017 with the intention of having it become law in the spring of 2018. Several cannabis companies including OrganiGram Holdings Inc. Canopy Growth Corporation Aphria Medical Marijuana Mettrum Ltd. and Aurora Cannabis Inc. had already been supplying medical cannabis to patients in Canada. The size of the recreational market was predicted to be approximately $5 billion and up to $22.6 billion if including the ancillary market (e.g. testing labs security and paraphernalia).With the potential to sell its product to this new market the New Brunswick-based cannabis company OrganiGram had already begun to prepare for expansion into the recreational market even before the government’s announcement was made. However there were still several unknowns that made the cannabis industry’s environment ambiguous. What would the timeline for legalization be? Who would be allowed to grow cannabis and how much? Would there be any safety regulations to ensure that customers would receive safe recreational products? Would there be regulations for drivers who medicated with and drove under the influence of cannabis? Which part of the Task Force report recommendations would actually become a reality? From a marketing perspective if the current cannabis companies were known as providers of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis was it possible to adjust their brand to attract recreational users? If so how would they do it? According to OrganiGram chief operating officer Larry Rogers several decisions had to be made based on “grey knowledge.” Even though the Task Force had released its report it was still unclear which suggestions the federal government would adopt.Cannabis Regulations in CanadaThe Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) were enacted under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in July 2013. Before the MMPR the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations enacted in 2001 and repealed in 2013 allowed patients to grow their own cannabis plants or have someone grow the plants for them. The MMPR was an attempt to control the production and distribution of medical cannabis with licensed producers (LPs) being the only companies authorized by Health Canada to cultivate and/or sell dried cannabis to patients who had prescriptions. The application process was very rigorous and as a result a low percentage of applicants were granted licences. As of August 1 2016 1561 applications had been received 253 had been refused 419 were in progress 54 had been withdrawn and 801 were incomplete. As of December 28 2016 only 37 licences had been issued with most of them in Ontario (22) and British Columbia (8). Some companies had more than one licence which meant that they had more than one site because each licence was location-specific. Patients could legally register and buy their medical cannabis at only one LP for each prescription.A subset of the LPs also had licences to produce and/or sell fresh cannabis seeds or cuttings and cannabis oil with some companies holding more than one licence. Twenty-two licences for producing and/or selling cannabis oil were held by only 18 companies. The authorization to produce and sell oils and fresh plant material meant that companies could create and sell other products such as cloned strains (clones) of cannabis (i.e. starter plants). LPs were required to keep detailed records of all cannabis received (including the name of the seller the date and place of the transaction and a full description of the product). In the Task Force report one of the recommendations was to implement a seed-to-sale tracking system. The oils made by LPs were better for dosing than homemade oils because the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabidiol (CBD) could not be clearly determined in the latter. For example when a patient smoked a joint made from dried cannabis it was unclear how much THC was being inhaled. However when using cannabis oil the dosage was measured by volume. When the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) was passed in August 2016 patients were once again allowed to grow their own cannabis plants. Some LPs started selling clones to patients. The ACMPR permitted companies to sell oil in a “capsule or similar dosage form” but not edibles—marijuana infused food products. OrganiGram was still in the research and development stage of capsule production. However the ACMPR allowed patients to “alter the chemical or physical properties of the fresh or dried marihuana or cannabis oil” meaning that patients could make their own edibles. OrganiGram patients received a copy of Aunt Sandy’s Medical Marijuana Cookbook as part of their client welcome kit.OrganiGram was the only LP on Canada’s east coast that had licences to cultivate (i.e. grow and process) dried cannabis produce fresh cannabis and cannabis oil and sell all of these products. The first few LP licences were granted in 2013. Its licences permitted it to produce up to 1500 kilograms of dried cannabis and 500 kilograms of cannabis oil and sell up to 1200 kilograms of dried cannabis and 500 kilograms of cannabis oil per year within Canada. Also medical cannabis plant cuttings and dried buds could be sold and shipped to other LPs on a wholesale basis.The only other LP in the Maritimes was Canada’s Island Garden Inc. (CIGI) in Prince Edward Island. However CIGI had a licence only to cultivate dried cannabis. OrganiGram received its licence to cultivate dried cannabis on March 26 2014 and received its oil licence on July 23 2016. CIGI was licensed to cultivate dried cannabis on June 16 2016. The first licences to produce and sell cannabis oils were granted in the summer of 2015. OrganiGram Company BackgroundOrganiGram was founded in 2013 in Moncton New Brunswick. In 2014 there were only approximately 17 staff members. The company employed 70 people as of December 2016 and it was looking forward to expanding its workforce up to about 170 staff in the next year or two to staff its new and expanding facilities. The organizational structure consisted of three levels: the C-suite (i.e. chief executive officer chief operating officer chief financial officer and chief commercial officer) directors and employees in various functions (e.g. garden workers and client support). Its facilities consisted of a main facility a newly acquired building next to the main facility and the adjoining 10-acre (4.1-hectare) property with a 136000-square-foot (12635-square-metre) industrial building. In addition to being the first medical cannabis company in the Maritimes to be licensed to grow and sell medical cannabis it was a certified organic medical cannabis producer. This organic certification meant that it needed to follow more rules than most of its competitors. Canada had only three organic LPs. Organigram was the only Maritime cannabis company with licences to cultivate produce and sell cannabis products.In a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report it was announced that at the end of March 2016 the New Brunswick government awarded payroll rebates of up to $990000 over three years to OrganiGram to help create up to 113 new jobs in the province. Chief executive officer Denis Arsenault stated “We are from New Brunswick and we’re excited to invest at home where the advantages of a well-educated work force low power rates and a competitive cost of living make New Brunswick and Moncton a logical place for our future.”In the summer of 2016 OrganiGram purchased a new building in Moncton. In an interview published on October 25 2016 chief commercial officer Ray Gracewood stated that much of the space in the new facility in Moncton would be for the manufacturing of edibles and extracts. To finance its expansion plans OrganiGram announced the closing of a $40 million bought deal on December 7 2016 to finance an expansion of its existing facility for an additional 32000 square feet (2973 square metres) of grow-room area and continue with its planned cannabis oil extracts and derivatives facility. In this bought deal a group of investment firms (led by Dundee Securities Ltd.) offered $40253450 for 11339000 shares at a price of $3.55 per share to OrganiGram.The Process of producing cannabis productsThe process of growing and processing cannabis started with purchasing and receiving materials such as soil and fertilizers. Cuttings taken from mother plants were started in the nursery to grow clones which were put into pots of soil for the pre-vegetative (pre-veg) process. The process of growing plants from clones had two benefits: (1) it took less time than growing from seeds and (2) it ensured that the plants would have the same characteristics as the mother plant. The pre-veg process took several weeks as did the vegetative process which began when the plants were set into larger pots. Next the plants were placed in grow rooms for the flowering stage which took 56–72 days. After harvesting the cannabis was trimmed dried cured and packaged for mailing to patients. OrganiGram had produced and posted a YouTube video that described the growing process. According to Rogers it could take over six months from starting the clones to packaging the final product. Under the ACMPR LPs were permitted to sell cannabis products only to patients directly through mail order or to other LPs on a wholesale basis.organigram’s Existing Product LinesOrganiGram differentiated itself by highlighting that some of its products were premium 100 per cent organic which meant that they were subject to audits were grown in regulated soil received organic fertilizers and were free of certain disallowed pesticides. These standards were in addition to the Health Canada regulations. OrganiGram received its organic certification from ECOCERT on October 10 2014.Many of OrganiGram’s strains had Maritime-themed names such as Highlands Rising Tides and Lighthouse. The price of the dried cannabis ranged from $9.25 to $10.50 per gram. Daily dosages for patients ranged from 75 milligrams per day to 3.2 grams per day. According to the ACMPR the possession limit was 30 times the daily dosage or 150 grams whichever was less. However OrganiGram offered a 25 per cent discount to patients who were on social assistance or disability programs. Competitors also had compassionate-pricing programs. OrganiGram oils were all priced at $99 per 50 millilitres. The oils had different names from their dried plant strain names and were labelled with the amounts of THC and CBD in milligrams or millilitres. Depending on each patient’s needs the choice would be made according to the amount of THC and/or CBD in the product. In addition to its cannabis products OrganiGram sold vaporizers that ranged in price from $97.50 to $195. CompetitorsIn 2016 Canada’s largest publicly traded LPs were Canopy Growth Mettrum OrganiGram Aphria and Aurora Cannabis. The first four companies had licences to cultivate the dried plant produce oils and sell both products. Aurora had licences only to cultivate the dried plant and sell it. However Aurora was enrolling new patients very quickly in a short period of time. In terms of licensed capacity and resources Canopy Growth was the largest player and was the result of a merger of the companies Tweed and Bedrocan. Tweed had a branding partnership with Snoop Dogg. Canopy Growth was working on international expansion activities in Brazil Australia and Germany. Mettrum was very much a medically focused company that concentrated on building a physician’s network to increase its patient base. On December 1 2016 it was announced that Mettrum would be acquired by Canopy Growth pending shareholder approval. Many LPs were in the process of increasing the number of registered patients while expanding their operations.The prices for most dried cannabis strains tended to be between $6 and $12 per gram. Several companies including OrganiGram offered “compassionate pricing” (i.e. a discounted price) for those patients in need. Strains with higher percentages of THC often were able to garner higher prices.The American Experience (with Recreational Cannabis)Colorado and several other American states had already legalized recreational cannabis. Data from the cannabis data firm Headset Inc. Cannabis Intelligence provided sales data on the most popular recreational cannabis products in the United States. The dried flower was the most popular product (48 per cent of all transactions) but had the lowest profit margin (53.5 per cent on average). The second most popular product was edibles (13.1 per cent of all transactions) and some types had the highest profit margins (ranging from 53 per cent for soup to 65.5 per cent for brittle). Concentrates beverages and vapour products were also becoming more popular. According to a 2016 report by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area on marijuana in Colorado the established demand in 2014 was 121.4 metric tons for residents (aged 21 years and older) and the estimated demand was 8.9 metric tons for out-of-state visitors (aged 21 years and older). The same report noted 485000 regular users of cannabis in Colorado. The total population of Colorado was 5.36 million.Based on data collected on approximately 40000 legal (recreational) cannabis purchases cannabis users spent an average of US$647 annually in Washington State. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars collected in taxes were reported in Colorado. According to Rogers Colorado “is like the gold standard for recreational marijuana in the world. It’s the only place of size that has had a recreational marketplace for more than a short period of time . . . at least they have some quantifiable data that you can try and use to project forward.” However regulations were very different in the United States and varied from state to state. For example the state law in Colorado permitted licensed retailers to sell only up to 30 per cent of their total “finished Retail Marijuana inventory” to other licensed establishments. Because marijuana was still illegal at the federal level it was difficult for American cannabis businesses to open bank accounts and many used only cash transactions.ChallengesIn September 2016 OrganiGram partnered with TGS International LLC a firm in Colorado that had experience with manufacturing and selling edibles which were not yet legal to sell in Canada. According to Rogers the TGS partnership was meant to help OrganiGram “spin up” its edible-marijuana manufacturing facilities in Moncton quickly. Soon after in a press release dated November 23 2016 OrganiGram announced “Trailer Park Boys Choose OrganiGram as Strategic Partner.” However in mid-December 2016 the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation completed and released its report which included many recommendations. For the purpose of minimizing the harm of use the Task Force recommended that the federal government “apply comprehensive restrictions to the advertising and promotion of cannabis and related merchandise by any means including sponsorship endorsements and branding similar to the restrictions on promotion of tobacco products.” The Task Force also recommended that recreational products not be packaged in such a way that it would be appealing to children. With that in mind what kinds of edibles would be permitted? The challenge was that OrganiGram was “deploying fairly substantive amounts of capital and not knowing exactly what the date is that that capital should be fully functioning” according to Rogers. Other LPs such as Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis were also preparing for the recreational market by developing strategic partnerships and raising capital to expand their operational capacities. On the medical side the total number of patients who could legally purchase medical marijuana was limited by the number of physicians who were willing and able to prescribe cannabis. Many of the cannabis clinics were in Ontario and Western Canada where most of the LPs were located. However some clinics had satellite offices in Atlantic Canada. According to Rogers many physicians were uncomfortable with prescribing cannabis to their patients and had to refer them to cannabis clinics. However the market data found on Health Canada’s website showed that the number of patients was increasing each quarter (see Exhibit 1). Even with these data and OrganiGram’s enterprise resource planning systems it was difficult to make forecasts because one did not know which companies the patients would choose.Next stepsThe largest players (including OrganiGram) in the medical cannabis industry were in the midst of expanding their operations in anticipation of the introduction of the Trudeau government’s recreational cannabis legislation in the spring of 2017. In addition to its domestic expansion activities Canopy Growth the largest publicly traded cannabis company in Canada was already engaging in several international expansion activities in Brazil Germany and Australia. However Rogers said that there was a shortage of product in Canada at that point in time and OrganiGram did not have any immediate plans to export cannabis. Its focus was on the current medical cannabis market and the anticipated recreational market in Canada.From Rogers’s perspective it was unclear when the company could roll out new products which products would be permitted or who would be allowed to produce and/or sell recreational cannabis products. The challenge for OrganiGram was to work with the “grey knowledge” while creating a strategy for the anticipated recreational cannabis market and working on its medical cannabis sales. What kind of strategy should OrganiGram have for the recreational cannabis market? How should it organize the company to market both medical and recreational cannabis? Would the legalization of recreational cannabis lead to regulations that allowed for imported cannabis? With so many variables still unknown what kinds of scenarios should OrganiGram prepare to face? Was it possible to create an implementation plan with a timeline roll out schedule and initial steps that would take into account the different scenarios?Exhibit 1: Market Data on canada’s quarterly supply of cannabis for medical purposes April 2015–September 30 2016Note: Q = quarter; kg = kilogram; g = gram; LPs = licensed producers; N/A = not availableSource: Government of Canada “Market Data” accessed December 28 2016 www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medical-use-marijuana/licensed-producers/market-data.html.endnotes",1,WHITE,SOUTHERN ASIA,MAN,

MAI’s chief executive officer Dr. Chelsea Bordon began the meeting by providing an overview of Shadow IT and summarizing the feedback from MAI’s client base. Bordon explained “Shadow IT is usually defined as devices data systems software and services outside the control of central IT.” She added that MAI’s customer service department was receiving an increased volume of requests for support from MAI’s nearly one thousand clients on a worldwide basis regarding the Shadow IT problem. Dr. Mike Champion the board’s vice-chairman weighed in and asked for a more descriptive characterization of the so-called Shadow IT issue. MAI’s chief information officer (CIO) Dr. Edward Keller provided more details. Keller reported that in a recent telepresence meeting with 20 of MAI’s top clients the refrain was essentially that clients were experiencing more data breaches which were due in large measure to employees’ unsanctioned use of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications (apps). Keller explained that he had reassured the meeting participants that MAI would be developing an appropriate plan to address the problem. Keller then advised the board that the deployment of a Shadow IT amelioration plan would both significantly improve customer loyalty and boost revenues. Bordon thanked Keller for his report and indicated to the board that MAI’s research department had been working on a blended Shadow IT strategy combining the best practices of central IT oversight without overly restricting end-users’ innovation and flexibility. As the board meeting concluded Bordon directed Keller to finalize the plan and report back at the next board meeting.Cloud Computing and the Rise of Shadow ITCloud computing was one of the most significant developments affecting the global business marketplace because it provided the opportunity for firms to lower their IT expenses. Cloud computing also known as on-demand computing provided computing resources (both hardware and software) that were delivered as a remote service over a network (typically the Internet) to host and manage a user’s data software and computational activities. Cloud computing offered a variety of benefits including a reduction of the data centre footprint access to the latest technology provided and maintained by the cloud provider and the ability to ramp capacity up or down based on demand. Cloud providers managed the infrastructure and platforms on which the applications ran. The cloud market was segmented into three broad sectors: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS consisted of network and storage capabilities complemented by scalable computing resources. IaaS customers could establish cloud-based data centres that had the same technologies and resource capabilities as a traditional data centre without having to invest in capacity and maintenance. PaaS was a category of cloud computing services that offered clients a vehicle to develop and manage applications without the costs associated with building and maintaining the required internal infrastructure. SaaS which was commonly referred to as on-demand software was usually priced on a pay-per-use basis as opposed to purchasing a perpetual licence which historically had been the norm. SaaS vendors were offering more customization and flexibility in their software offerings compared with traditional on-the-premises suppliers. Furthermore some SaaS providers furnished some of their products and services at no cost as a means of generating sales for their other products and services. In a variation of this approach called the “freemium model” software with limited functionality was provided free and fees were charged to enable enhanced capabilities. Overall observers estimated the cloud computing market would surpass one trillion dollars by 2024.Cloud computing had emerged as a new way for organizations to significantly cut their technology expenses while boosting organizational performance and productivity. As storage services and applications moved to the cloud corporations were seeking new and less expensive ways to deliver and manage their IT services. The ongoing growth of cloud computing however was one of the driving factors in the rise of the Shadow IT menace. An increasing number of employees were using BYOD (bring your own device) as their instrument of choice for accessing the cloud and communicating with customers but doing so left many organizations vulnerable. Specifically because end-users were downloading and uploading content to their own devices the opportunities dramatically increased for malware viruses and hacks. Further when employees used their devices on unsecured networks (e.g. at coffee shops) to access the organization’s cloud resources the firm’s data were made vulnerable and exposed to significant risk. Having employees use their own communication devices also raised privacy concerns not only for the end-users but also for their employers. Social messaging apps were another growing opportunity for organizations to maintain ongoing customer contacts and to improve the customer experience; however this growing trend again opened the firm to enhanced cyber security risks and increased the central IT monitoring of employees’ personal information. Shadow IT allowed end-users to bypass central IT solutions and develop their own customized approach to the specific task at hand. End-users strove to work around IT roadblocks (a concept known as “local optimization”) but the CIO considered this approach to be a suboptimal allocation of resources. CIO oversight could reduce duplication of applications and oversight could promote integration and interconnectivity between applications through a process of ongoing communications with the end-user community. For example operating a single help desk optimized both customer service and trouble ticket tracking and it allowed for root-problem analysis and remediation which could provide significant cost reductions. Consolidated data centres and data storage were advantageous on multiple levels (e.g. reducing the digital footprint). Institutionally provided IT improved supportability fostered project resource flexibility and allowed end-users to focus on the tasks at hand rather than developing their own IT solutions. As an added insurance policy some organizations were adopting firm-based devices known as “choose your own device” or CYOD which had the capability to isolate personal applications and data in a secure on-device system. THE SHADOWY WORLD OF SHADOW ITFor several decades CIOs had battled Shadow IT defined by many IT pundits as “devices data systems software and services outside the control of central IT.” The reasons for these concerns included unvetted IT brought into an organization which could result in numerous problems including cyber security breaches noncompliance with regulatory requirements duplication of existing applications lack of IT help desk support user-built applications not coded to institutional standards applications that did not integrate and inefficient use of the IT budget. However in a growing digital economy end-users had more IT options available to them than ever before and recent studies suggested that these users were increasingly using IT not provided or sanctioned by their CIO. For example 64 per cent of employees still used unapproved apps in the workplace even though this problem has been known for many years.The CIO’s traditional vertically integrated organizational structure provided a one-stop shop for applications infrastructure cyber security database architecture and support. As IT became ever more essential for the realization of enterprise objectives in the digital economy and demand for IT-enabled capabilities increased the timely fulfilment of IT needs was often beyond the CIO’s capacity. The unmet IT needs of organizational units had driven them to seek their own IT solutions and as a result diminish the CIOs’ control over the corporate IT environment. A common complaint from the end-user was that the CIO did not deliver requested solutions in a timely manner and the said solutions were not based on the latest cutting-edge technology. End-users also believed that they were handcuffed by outdated IT policies and processes and in many instances end-users did not need the support of centralized IT. In this regard the CIO needed to weigh the impression of being an institutional enabler and embracing user-sourced IT versus the perception of being an institutional obstacle perceived by end-users as frustratingly slow and outmoded. If the CIO could not meet the IT needs of its business constituents end-users then had an incentive to source IT on their own circumventing the CIO in the process. CIOs reacted to this phenomenon in various ways from clamping down on Shadow IT to assuming a more accepting posture. As IT affordances became increasingly available the notion that the CIO was responsible for all things IT had become doubtful.Identifying the various manifestations of unauthorized IT was the first step to understanding how best to address the Shadow IT challenge. Unfortunately no one had developed an acceptable definition of corporate non-sanctioned IT use. Adding to the confusion were implicit references to unsanctioned IT use such as users accessing SaaS cloud apps without the approval of the CIO; the unsanctioned implementation of PaaS and IaaS by business end-users; unsupervised Web 2.0 and social media use including blogs social networking mashups and video sharing; and end-user-developed digital capabilities (i.e. new applications or modifications of existing applications) (see Exhibit 1).COMPANY BACKGROUNDMAI which was founded in 2014 provided a variety of analytics-based services via the cloud including predictive algorithms for forecasting sales trends based on customer behaviours and external economic factors. MAI’s product and service offerings also included an extensive security suite to address the ongoing challenges associated with data breaches. MAI had experienced significant revenue growth over the previous few years with sales approaching US$160 million annually. MAI’s business model was based on the premise that the demand for cloud computing solutions would continue to grow as companies sought ways to lower their IT expenses. MAI provided both consulting services to assist in transitioning to the cloud and priority-based predictive analytics systems on a SaaS basis. MAI’s cloud computing strategy for its clients was based on four characteristics: A strong selling point for MAI’s SaaS analytics services was its suite of analytics development tools that allows end-users to rapidly get answers to ad hoc questions. MAI encouraged clients’ end-users to use these tools to develop their own applications to exploit the wealth of data now available on the cloud. While many end-users did indeed utilize these tools there were multiple “super users” who figured out how to access data on the cloud using unsanctioned means such as Excel spreadsheets and homegrown applications.As MAI’s push to move its clients to the cloud gained traction an uptick in the unsanctioned use of IT had increased the exposure of a number of clients to a variety of security risks as uncovered by the clients’ own cybersecurity departments. Many of the clients’ CEOs thought that this uptick in Shadow IT was a result of the move to the cloud and they held MAI responsible. MAI needed to step in and help their clients resolve the situation. Unless the company took quick action MAI could experience a significant client backlash resulting in a reduction in both revenues and clients. Since nearly 75 per cent of MAI’s revenues came from the consulting division any reduction in clients could have a major impact on the firm’s future financial viability.DEVELOPING A NEW APPROACHIn this context Keller MAI’s CIO had set about formulating a revised cloud-computing approach that could be suggested to MAI’s clients—an approach that balanced the legitimate needs of end-users with the overall perspective of the CIO especially in terms of security concerns. Keller’s first step was to survey both end-users and the CIOs from a subset of MAI’s client base. The results not surprisingly given the prior feedback revealed two fundamentally different perspectives. Almost all of the CIOs interviewed weighed in by expressing their number one concern: cybersecurity. Many of them were also frustrated that end-user self-sourcing of IT was a great deal more expensive to the company than buying IT at scale through a centralized IT procurement office. Fragmented IT also made user support more difficult. A third issue cited by multiple CIOs was a conflict over sourcing IT. The CIOs felt that their department possessed the IT expertise and that the CIO should be responsible for technology leadership; the business units should focus on what they did well not on sourcing IT. From the perspective of the end-users the dominant issues were by and large completely different. End-users viewed CIOs as obstacles and providing poor solutions. End-users considered themselves self-sufficient and were unaware of CIOs’ regulations. None of these factors surprised Keller given his nearly 30 years of experience in the IT community. Keller was also aware that many of MAI’s customers were expanding their use of social messaging apps as yet another opportunity for organizations to maintain ongoing customer contacts and improve the customer experience. However the use of social messaging simply opened another cyber security challenge.Keller understood that MAI’s initial approach had increased the duplication of applications by allowing end-users at each of its clients to develop their own self-styled IT solutions. Experience suggested that in most situations this behaviour would lead to suboptimal use of the client firm’s resources. Making the case for technological leadership at the CIO level was another area not addressed by MAI’s initial plan. The notion was that institutionally provided IT improved supportability fostered project resource flexibility and allowed end-users to focus on the task at hand instead of developing their own IT solutions. However end-users often viewed solutions provided by central IT as being ineffectual in terms of both timelessness and costs. Furthermore as the survey results revealed end-users were generally unaware of central IT’s regulations and had differing views on organizational culture especially in terms of promoting innovation. Keller’s next step was to try to coalesce these two different perspectives. He decided to use a causal loop diagram (CLD) approach. CLDs provided a useful methodology for helping to resolve qualitative-based conflicts such as those encountered in the survey data. CLDs offered a visual perspective on how different factors (e.g. classifications) were interrelated and how they had been widely used across a variety of organizational applications including Shadow IT. Basically CLDs consisted of nodes and edges with the nodes representing the identified factors and the edges connecting the factors. CLDs were useful for depicting in a simplified manner how systems worked. The diagrams featured two types of loops: positive or reinforcing loops; and negative or balancing loops. Reinforcing loops were depicted as moving in a clockwise direction while balancing loops moved counter-clockwise. These loops could be conceived of as a dialogue between two competing interests. The reinforcing loop sought to extend previous limits while the balancing loop pushed back when the reinforcing loop had “gone too far.” Reinforcing feedback represented goal-seeking and balancing feedback represented stability-seeking behaviour. For this application the reinforcing loops represented the end-users and the balancing loops portrayed the CIOs. Armed with these new insights Keller decided to formulate a plan that balanced the competing interests and could be communicated to MAI’s client base. He concluded that communication and relationship-building represented a first good step in attempting to ameliorate the basic differences between the two groups. He then set about developing a PowerPoint presentation that was to be delivered at the board’s next meeting as Bordon had directed.Exhibit 1: Shadow IT ExamplesNote: apps = applications; BYOD = bring your own device; IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service; PaaS = Platform as a Service; SaaS = Software as a Service.Source: Created by the case author.",1,WHITE,NORTH AMERICA,MAN,

This represented a 6 per cent premium above its last closing price or a 49 per cent premium above its closing price on July 16 2015 the last trading day before NOL said it was considering strategic options. Singapore’s state investment firm Temasek Holdings Private Limited (Temasek) gave an irrevocable undertaking to sell its entire majority stake of 67 per cent in NOL at this price for a total of $2.3 billion. CMA CGM sought to delist NOL and take it private. In order to delist the company would need to acquire another 23 per cent to hit the acceptance threshold of 90 per cent. Should the remaining shareholders sell their shares at the offer price of $1.30 per share or hold out for a better price? Should bondholders of CMA CGA and NOL be concerned about the acquisition? NEPTUNE ORIENT LINES: BACKGROUNDNOL was started in 1968 as Singapore’s national shipping line to facilitate industrial development and support the economy. It was wholly owned by the government. Under the leadership of its managing director Goh Chok Tong (who later became Singapore’s second prime minister) NOL turned profitable in the mid-1970s. In 1981 its initial public offering on the Singapore Exchange successfully raised $155 million. The funds were used to grow the business globally diversifying away from containerization into the bulk carrier market. In 1997 NOL acquired American President Lines Ltd. (APL) for US$825 million and started operating under the APL brand. Through the acquisition NOL gained access to major container trades key logistical support and terminals in the United States and Asia. In July 2008 NOL attempted to acquire Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG for US$7 billion but eventually pulled out because of the onset of the global financial crisis. The crisis was hard on NOL: in 2009 it recorded a net loss of US$741 million. This decline was followed by an amazing turnaround of its fortunes in 2010 which saw a net profit for the company of US$461 million. However the performance could not be sustained. NOL dipped into the red again with losses of US$478 million in 2011 US$419 million in 2012 US$76 million in 2013 and US$260 million in 2014 for a total loss of US$1.233 billion over this four-year period. In February 2015 NOL sold the profit-making APL for US$1.2 billion to concentrate on its container-shipping business which had grown to become the 12th largest in the world. In November 2015 it was announced that French shipping giant CMA CGM was in exclusive discussions to buy Singapore icon NOL. With its high debt levels and inability to return to profitability NOL had been looking for a buyer for months. CMA CGM was the world’s third-largest container-shipping firm and was privately owned by the billionaire Saadé family. On the deadline to complete due diligence December 7 2015 CMA CGM offered $1.30 cash for each of NOL shares. The company intended to take NOL private and also planned to sell assets worth $1.4 billion from the merged entity to reduce debt.Temasek’s head of portfolio management said We are supportive of this transaction [because] it presents NOL with an opportunity to join a leading player with an extensive global presence and solid operational track record. We also note and welcome the commitment of CMA CGM to enhance Singapore’s position as a key maritime hub and grow Singapore’s container throughput volumes. The offer was subject to the approval of the American European and Chinese regulators. why sell a national icon?According to the director of research at Drewry Shipping Consultants Limited NOL was suffering from overcapacity in the container-shipping industry and from falling freight rates: “The 2015 volume total is on course to be the lowest since 2009 while average freight rates are destined to be the lowest in at least a decade. It’s a toxic combination that the management has failed to arrest and Temasek appears to have seen the writing on the wall that a turnaround is not imminent.”NOL’s deputy chief executive and chief financial officer in the 1990s felt that NOL might fetch a better price if it waited “but there’s also the worry that if they don’t sell now there may not be a suitor later.” Although the offer price was 0.96 times NOL’s book value Ocean Chinese Banking Corporation Investment Research analyst Eugene Chua agreed that it was fair given the poor sentiment of the shipping industry. He was of the opinion that Temasek had accepted the offer “[in the hope] that the deal would bring greater economic benefit to Singapore.”CMA CGM had pledged to “increase its commitment” and help reinforce Singapore’s position as a leading maritime hub; the company intended to establish its regional head office in Singapore and sought to enhance Singapore’s position in Asia. Vice-chairman Rudolphe Saadé (son of CMA CGM’s founder and chairman Jacques Saadé) said We recognize the strategic importance of Singapore as a key hub for the maritime industry and we are committed to reinforcing its regional leadership. At a time when the shipping industry is facing strong headwinds scale is more critical than ever to capitalize on synergies and capture growth opportunities wherever they arise. NOL’s chief executive officer Ng Yat Chung said that the buyout would deliver “the scale that is required for NOL to succeed” and reaffirmed that “the change in ownership of NOL will not impair Singapore’s continuing journey to be a premier maritime hub.” Motivation on the part of CMA CGMOver the years CMA CGM had acquired several national icons namely the French state-backed Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM) in 1996 the Australian National Line in 1998 French rival Delmas in 2005 and Taiwan’s Cheng Lie Navigation in 2007. There was some pressure for CMA CGM to expand given that the two state-owned Chinese shipping giants China Ocean Shipping Group Co. and China Shipping Group Co. were in advanced talks to merge. If successful the merger would create the world’s fourth-largest container-shipping line after the Maersk Group Mediterranean Shipping and CMA CGM in that order.Saadé revealed “We were the first ones to initiate discussions with NOL and Temasek and it made sense to them; that is why we carried on with the discussions.” As of the end of 2015 most of CMA CGM’s ships called at Malaysia’s Port Klang but Saadé explained that there were “enough volumes to operate in the two terminals.” He added that it was chronic overcapacity that had pushed freight rates down and disagreed that shipping was a dying industry: People have said many things about shipping for many years but if shipping was not there we would not have TV sets and all kinds of other goods at competitive prices. Because today the only competitive and environmentally friendly mode of transport is shipping. Maybe one day it will be different but at least for the years to come I don’t believe so.Without directly stating how CMA CGM planned to chart NOL’s fortunes Saadé concluded “I will not comment on the way it is being managed now but I would say we firmly believe we have the expertise to allow NOL to develop a much stronger and better business.” ValuationAt its highest NOL’s share price traded at $5.839 on July 16 2007. At $1.30 a share Temasek would take a big hit. In 2004 it had launched a cash offer for the 70 per cent of NOL that it did not own at $2.80 a share. Many had commented that CMA CGM’s offer was reasonable given the present slump—but was that really so? What would be a reasonable valuation for each of NOL’s shares based on the company’s past financial performance (see Exhibits 1 and 2) and other relevant market information?   For a discounted cash flow analysis some growth projections would be necessary before a reasonable terminal growth rate could be applied in perpetuity (see Exhibit 3). For a dividend discount model valuation it would be reasonable to assume that dividends would continue to grow for some years before applying a terminal growth rate (see Exhibit 4). For a relative valuation analysis using peer comparison data had been collected but a suitable peer group had not been be identified (see Exhibit 5). The past stock price performances of NOL and its potential peers had been traced and charted for easy comparison (see Exhibit 6). effect on the bondsSome of NOL’s bonds had clauses that would be “triggered by the planned sale allowing for potential early repayment or compensation.” Such clauses were often inserted in bonds that received implicit parental support of triple A-rated (triple A-rated entities were unlikely to default) majority stakeholders like Temasek. The head of fixed income for Asia at Coutts Royal Bank of Scotland commented that “the confidence placed in government-owned companies was somewhat over-extended. Investors who are looking to invest in these companies should look closer at the covenants of each issue ensuring they are well protected on the downside should government support be removed.”Of the four outstanding NOL bonds two contained trigger clauses (the 2017 and 2019 bonds) while the other two (the 2020 and 2021 bonds) did not. The prices of all four bonds had suffered as events unfolded but not all to the same extent (see Exhibits 7 and 8). In addition CMA CGM’s offer also had an impact on its own bond (see Exhibits 7 and 8). ISSUES FACING INVESTORSIn light of NOL’s past financial performance should NOL’s shareholders accept CMA CGM’s offer of $1.30 per share? Given the impact that the offer had on the value of the bonds what should the bondholders of NOL and CMA CGM do?

Exhibit 3: assumptions underlying Discounted Cash Flow VALUATIONThe assumptions behind the pro-forma statements are listed below.Assumptions regarding revenues: Revenue from the logistics segment that had been carved out would be ignored. Only revenue from the container-shipping segment would be used in the valuation exercise.Shipping volume was assumed to be 2600000 forty foot equivalent units (FEUs) in 2016 and to increase at a 3 per cent annual rate thereafter. Average Revenue/FEU was assumed to increase to US$2000/FEU in 2016 and to US$2286/FEU in 2017 (which was the rate during the 2008 financial crisis) and then increase at a 3 per cent annual rate until 2020.Other revenues in the form of “Miscellaneous” and “Finance and Investment Income” were assumed to stay the same as 2015.b. 	Assumptions regarding costs:  Since NOL had been improving its cost efficiency the gross margin was predicted to improve steadily from 8.5 per cent in 2016 to 9.5 per cent in 2017 and to 10 per cent in 2018 2019 and 2020. This estimate was relatively conservative because the gross margin before the oversupply situation set in was 14 per cent. Other expenses mainly consisted of administrative (IT and non-IT) and finance expenses. Administrative (IT) expenses were expected to grow at a low rate of 2 per cent for the next five years to adjust for inflation and increase in revenue. Administrative (non-IT) expenses were expected to reduce by 8 per cent and 4 per cent for the next two years as NOL strove to cut costs in this area before growing at a positive 2 per cent rate. The yearly finance expense was equal to the cost of debt (2.5 per cent) multiplied by the total debt in the previous year. Other operating expenses were assumed to stay the same as 2015.c.	Assumptions regarding assets:All current assets except for “Assets of Group Companies as Held for Sale” were assumed to grow with revenue using 2015 as the base. It was assumed that “Assets of Group Companies as Held for Sale” would drop to zero in 2016 and thereafter. All non-current assets except for “Investments in Associated Companies” “Investments in Joint Ventures” “Property Plant and Equipment” and “Goodwill Arising on Consolidation” were assumed to grow with revenue using 2015 as the base. It was assumed that “Investments in Associated Companies” “Investments in Joint Ventures” and “Goodwill Arising on Consolidation” would stay the same. It was assumed that “Property Plant and Equipment” would grow at 5 per cent per year—to take overcapacity into consideration. Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) was assumed to depreciate at 7 per cent per year. Capital expenditure was the sum of the change in PPE and depreciation. Exhibit 3 (continued)Change in net working capital was the difference in net working capital from one year to the next. Net working capital was defined as current assets not including cash minus current liabilities.d.      Assumptions regarding equity:All items under equity were assumed to stay the same except for “Retained Earnings.”Retained earnings was equal to retained earnings from previous years plus profit/loss of the current year less dividends paid. Payout ratio was assumed to be zero in 2016 20 per cent in 2017 40 per cent in 2018 60 per cent in 2019 and 80 per cent thereafter.e.      Assumptions regarding liabilities:All current liabilities except for “Liabilities of Group Companies Classified as Held for Sale” were assumed to grow with revenue using 2015 as the base. It was assumed that “Liabilities of Group Companies Classified as Held for Sale” would drop to zero in 2016 and thereafter.

He had to tackle the performance issue of the company’s garment manufacturing joint venture (JV) in Cambodia—after two years in operation it had run out of cash. Soon after meeting with his partner Wu concluded that the existing JV in Sihanoukville was beyond repair. He now needed to decide whether to exit Cambodia or to remain there albeit in a different city and with a new partner. A new factory there would require more investment. If he quit Cambodia how could his company survive and develop in the future? Over the past decade with ever-increasing labour costs and difficulties in recruiting staff Chinese garment export enterprises had been facing more and more challenges.The history of Sunton ManufacturingThe First Development Stage: Start-up (March 2000–July 2006)Wu founded Sunton in Wuxi New District (WND) in 2000. Before establishing the company he had worked as an export sales representative within a stable and comfortable environment in a state-owned foreign trade company in Nancang the capital city of Jiangxi Province. In 1999 Wu learned by chance that a friend had opened a foreign trade company in the WND. Inspired by his friend Wu moved to Wuxi rented an office in the WND and founded Sunton. Wu said “The creation of Sunton in 2000 was due to my courage of not fearing to fail as well as the trend towards reform in China’s foreign trade system.” Indeed the existence of the WND presented a great opportunity for Wu to start Sunton.In addition to the convenience and preferential treatment offered by the WND China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the implementation of China’s import and export registration system also accelerated the establishment and development of Sunton. On December 11 2001 China officially joined the WTO. After July 2004 China cancelled all of the examination and approval procedures for the establishment of foreign trade companies and accordingly had these companies use the same registration system as all other foreign business entities.On January 1 2005 the abolition of the global textile quota system and termination of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) created a great opportunity for Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) like Sunton. On the other hand the new exchange rate system presented new challenges to the company. Since July 21 2005 China had implemented a managed floating exchange rate system (see Exhibit 1) which brought increased financial risk to the company’s operation.These events could be seen as the “contributors” during Sunton’s first development stage. After six years of operation Sunton had a firm foothold with stable customers and products. The company had developed additional products besides t-shirts. The first development stage laid a solid foundation for Sunton’s further internationalization. Having experienced the difficulty of the start-up Wu asked himself: “Is dealing with factories and customers every day for the rest of my life all I want?” The answer was a big no. He desired something different which led him to the idea to study abroad. Wu joined a master of business administration (MBA) program at an Australian university from July 2004 to July 2006 while still actively participating in the company’s operations and management.The Second Development Stage: Standardizing Management and Developing New Business (August 2006–August 2012)After finishing his MBA Wu decided to explore new business instead of continuing the existing one. At that time e-commerce was just emerging in China. The Chinese online shopping website Taobao was established in May 2003 and by 2006 it had become the largest e-commerce platform in Asia. Meanwhile the number of netizens was also significantly increasing. Wu’s consideration and development of new business was also affected by the global environment. After the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008 international sales shrank drastically. China’s foreign trade enterprises were confronted with unprecedented difficulties: orders plummeted capital availability dried up and many SMEs went bankrupt. Sunton was also a victim of the financial crisis. Many of its clients in Europe and other areas did not survive the crisis including several well-known companies with decades of history. Sunton lost many customers. Eventually Sunton chose to create its own branding. It built a domestic sales team and hired designers to create brands for the domestic market. Over the next four years Wu pursued three different directions in the domestic market but failed in each. He came to three conclusions: first that foreign trade companies lacked an understanding of the domestic market; second that Sunton did not have an overall cost advantage; and last that branding was difficult. Wu elaborated The export enterprises shifted to selling products in the domestic market. Not only was the market different [but] it was [also] hard to change from international trading to brand-based selling in the domestic market. Such a fundamental transition from industrial marketing (2B) to consumer branding (2C) can also incur unpredictable and substantial risks. The experience of branding our own products in the domestic market was a long-term process which required huge continuous investments in people and money. It would never be an easy thing for small and medium-sized enterprises.The Third Development Stage: Deepening Internationalization (September 2012–On)Wu considered that internationalization might be the only path for his company. Internationalization would encourage Chinese businesses to move from only selling products to finding opportunities throughout the entire industry chain where there might be a much higher value proposition.In 2012 Wu decided to establish a sales office in Italy. He did so for two reasons. First Europe was the largest market for Sunton. Second Italy was the largest producer of clothing in the European Union with a highly developed and convenient transportation system.With Sunton’s own China-based factory shut down in 2010 Wu faced a decision. At the same time there was a trend in the Chinese textile industry of moving factories abroad. Chinese factories in the textile industry had been getting smaller and smaller. Foreseeing future limitations Wu decided to keep pace with the trend and go abroad to sustain his company’s development.Wu was unsure about where in the world to move his factory as many locations were unfamiliar to him. A friend of Wu’s recommended the economic zone in Sihanoukville Cambodia. Prior to his friend’s suggestion Wu had never visited any Southeast Asian countries to investigate business opportunities as he worried about the corruption and poor infrastructure in the region. He had heard that there was some corruption in Vietnam but his impression of Cambodia was that it was not that bad. Wu visited the economic zone in October 2013. The Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone was not run by the government but by a large Chinese enterprise called Hong Dou Group. The economic zone was open not just to Chinese companies but to all companies; however because it was run by a Chinese enterprise most companies in the zone were from China. Although the information provided about running a company in the zone was limited Wu decided to establish a factory in Sihanoukville.Sunton MANufacturing operation statusSince its establishment in 2000 in Wuxi Sunton had positioned itself as a supplier of casual wear and sportswear brands sold in specialty stores and hypermarkets. Sunton dedicated itself to being “a useful company as long as possible.” Over the past decade Sunton had always focused on its original positioning and it gained many advantages especially in the knitwear sector by partnering with multiple knitwear factories. Sunton provided good services in four sectors of the garment supply chain—namely orders management fabric sourcing and procurement manufacturing and quality control and warehousing and shipping. Sunton differentiated itself by consolidating its strengths in these four segments to serve the different needs of its clients in different parts of the world. Sunton’s target clients were retailers importers and wholesalers as well as garment supermarkets.In 2017 there were around 30 Sunton staff members grouped into three departments in Wuxi: the International Business Department the Domestic Business Department and the Production Department (see Exhibit 2). The sales office in Italy consisted of four local staff who were in charge of market exploration and customer service. Sunton’s Cambodian factory had around 350 local workers. Sunton was planning to set up an office in the United States in the future in order to create a broader value chain. Counted by pieces t-shirts made up the largest proportion of the products sold by Sunton whose biggest supplier was located in Nantong Jiangsu Province. For the fashion products Sunton deemed its designs to be an advantage with the designers hailing from Italy and other countries. Sunton fully owned a factory in China which had not been in operation since 2010. Sunton worked with 15 to 20 partner factories in China but had never invested in nor owned any of them. Sunton’s partner factories were mainly located near Wuxi in the provinces of Jiangsu Jiangxi and Anhui. The productivity and products of these partners varied significantly. Many but not all of their suppliers of t-shirts and other knitwear produced solely for Sunton.Many Chinese SMEs in the garment export field averaged sales of around US$15 million. The profitability varied. Generally the gross margin ranged from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. Wu believed that internationalization would greatly benefit the company feeling it could (1) bring the company more flexibility to sell the products made in either China or Cambodia; (2) optimize the flow of the supply chain as the company would be more likely to meet and seize opportunities; and (3) occupy more links in the supply chain and enhance the company’s competitiveness.China’s foreign investment in THE garment industry The world textile and apparel industry had undergone several production migrations since the 1950s. The first was from North America and Western Europe to Japan in the 1950s and early 1960s when Western textile and clothing production was displaced by a sharp rise in imports from Japan. The second shift was from Japan to Hong Kong Taiwan and the Republic of Korea. In the late 1980s and the 1990s there was a third migration. Starting in the 1980s production moved principally to mainland China several Southeast Asian countries and Sri Lanka. In the 1990s new suppliers included South Asian and Latin American apparel exporters.In recent years the major garment exporters had been China the European Union the United States and Asian countries. The top 10 exporters of the garment industry in 2015 were China the European Union Bangladesh Vietnam Hong Kong India Turkey Indonesia Cambodia and the United States—of these exporters seven were in Asia. According to statistics published by the WTO from 2014 to 2016 most countries experienced an output decline. In contrast Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam Bangladesh and Cambodia had witnessed continuous growth reflecting the great advantage in export competitiveness among Southeast Asian countries (see Exhibit 3). Asia was widely regarded as the centre of the global garment supply because of China’s role in building production capacity along with other Asian countries. The partnership between China and Southeast Asian countries had two sides. On one hand the bilateral trade volume had been rising. On the other hand China and Southeast Asian countries were strong competitors with each other when doing business in developed countries. To utilize the advantages in Southeast Asian countries of costs tariff benefits and low prices for raw material (such as cotton) many Chinese companies had successfully implemented a strategy of shifting production capacity thus turning the competitive relationship with Southeast Asian countries into win–win co-operation.SUNTON’s investment in Cambodia: October 2013 onThe First Joint Venture in Cambodia (October 2013–January 2017)Sunton’s JV in Cambodia was located in the Sihanoukville economic zone. Though Wu thought it would be convenient to operate a factory in the zone progress had not been easy because of the lack of development in the country (see Exhibits 4 and 5). The establishment of the factory took much longer than expected with the registration process spanning almost a year. In January 2015 Sunton was finally granted a license from the Cambodian government. The idea of having a partner in Cambodia occurred to Wu right after the registration of the new company in Sihanoukville. At the outset he had tried but was ultimately unable to find a partner from within his list of suppliers. Through a friend’s recommendation Wu found a partner—Xiao Ma and Ma’s close friend Ping Yu. Ma was a factory owner in China and was interested in also setting up a factory in Cambodia. Ma’s friend Yu had invested in Cambodia and was a shareholder of a garment bag factory in Cambodia. He had little experience in management but at least had been living in Cambodia for several years. In contrast to Sunton’s wide coverage in terms of product offerings Ma’s factory produced only a single product: men’s tennis shirts. Sunton dealt with a wide range of products and aimed to make its own manufacturing base in Cambodia a multi-product one. The partner negotiations took several months and the preparations for and construction of the factory took half a year. Recognizing his lack of familiarity with Cambodia and its operational environment Wu entrusted the daily management of factory operations to his JV partner. Ma and Yu handled the operation and management of the factory. From the beginning Ma had claimed he would need six months for decoration and recruiting and six months to train workers. He also requested that Wu wire money to his account so that his people could procure all machinery. At the end of the training period Ma told Wu that things had not gone smoothly as the workers were still too slow. It took an additional six months to complete the training. Operations began in January 2016 upon completion of the factory’s construction. After one year of operation Ma suddenly called a meeting and told Wu that all the investment money was lost and that if they wanted to continue Sunton needed to invest more money. Ma’s message came as a complete surprise to Wu. Wu knew that he no longer wanted to do business with Ma and that he would have to dissolve the JV.Reflecting on the co-operation with Ma Wu perceived that Ma had never planned to operate a multi-product factory in Cambodia. It seemed that what he really wanted from this co-operation was to use the business licence and money from Sunton to do his own test because even as an experienced factory owner he could not guarantee that a new factory in Cambodia would be a success. Furthermore because Ma was aggressive in wanting total control of the daily management of the JV Wu did not insist on auditing the bank accounts and books every month. Consequently he did not follow up properly nor did he effectively control the financial situation of the factory. As a result Wu acknowledged that although he was the legal owner of the company he had never had total control of it.A Second Investment in Cambodia? (January 2017)Once Wu received the disappointing news from his JV partner he realized he might need to visit Cambodia multiple times in the coming months to meet with lawyers accountants and government departments in order dissolve the JV. While Wu was getting more and more familiar with the Cambodian business context as well as its system of “corruption” his feelings towards this country were becoming quite complicated. Although Wu still recognized the huge advantages of operating in Cambodia including its duty-free status for exporting to developed countries and lower labour costs he felt less comfortable about its investment climate.A major concern for Wu was the efficiency of workers in Cambodia. Wu believed that while further progress was possible the upper limit of Cambodia’s labour productivity seemed to be about 80 per cent of the level of Chinese labour productivity. Wu cited a number of reasons for this view. First Cambodian workers did not seem to be as eager to make money so they were unwilling to work overtime. Furthermore they did not seem to strive to do their best while working. Second Cambodian labour law imposed strict restrictions on factories to limit workers’ work hours. Third in China’s garment industry the wages of workers were usually calculated by their performance namely on a piecework basis a system which most workers in Cambodia did not like. Instead they preferred to be paid according to the number of hours they worked. One Chinese manager in Cambodia observed “Yes you pay the Khmer [Cambodian] workers 30 per cent [of] the Chinese level but their productivity is less than 20 per cent of the Chinese level. And there are a lot of defects.” Wu had taken advantage of the opportunity presented by the low-cost labour in Cambodia but had still witnessed an increase in the minimum wage from US$83 per month in 2013 to US$156 per month in 2017. Wu perceived that there would be a window of five to eight years in Cambodia relative to other regional locales for factories that were labour-intensive and cost-sensitive. The two years he had seen wasted by the first JV had left him feeling severely frustrated.Sunton’s Italian sales department staff claimed that with the establishment of the Cambodian factory the mixture of Chinese and Cambodian culture had convinced some European clients that Sunton was an attractive international corporation. And when invited to the biggest show in the garment fashion supply industry Sunton was urged to use its Cambodian trademark and local language because it was the only company present with activities in Cambodia. In Wu’s view it would take time for companies like his to establish and make a profit in an unfamiliar market. Despite the failure of the first JV Wu was considering setting up another new factory in Cambodia. In order to take full control of the company Wu refused to co-operate with the existing companies even when doing so might make operations easier. Any partner he would consider would have to be an insider in Cambodia with a strong network and a rich knowledge of the manufacturing industry.One potential new partner Wu met was also Chinese and had been in Phnom Penh for over 14 years. This person had been in Cambodia to help his Singaporean boss to operate a company that had ultimately gone bankrupt. He aspired to open his own factory.Besides having a new partner Wu believed that if Sunton was to remain in Cambodia he would have to relocate the factory. Sihanoukville was not suitable for a factory as almost all the infrastructure was too expensive and the workers were not skilled enough. Various potential new partners had suggested he set up in Phnom Penh. But should he even stay in Cambodia? And if not were there more suitable locales?

It is 181035 square kilometres bordered by Laos to the northeast Vietnam to the east and Thailand to the northwest and southwest.Cambodia has a population of over 15 million. The official religion is Theravada Buddhism practised by approximately 93 per cent of the population. The three biggest cities are Phnom Penh Siem Reap and Battambang. The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh. From 1975–1979 Cambodia was under the leadership of Pol Pot part of the Khmer Rouge regime. During this period 2 million people were killed considered one of the worst mass killings of the twentieth century. Among those killed were individuals wearing glasses or knowing a foreign language or anyone thought to be intellectual. Special centres were used to torture and execute hundreds of thousands of individuals in the educated middle class. The head of the government is Hun Sen currently the prime minister a non-royal leader. He has ruled Cambodia for over 30 years.While its per capita income is the second lowest among Southeast Asian countries Cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in Asia averaging 6 per cent over the last decade. Agriculture remains the largest economic sector. There has been strong growth in textiles construction garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade. Cambodia scored dismally in an annual index (2015) ranking of the rule of law in 102 countries placing 99th overall and the worst in the region.Phnom Penh is located on the banks of the Tonlé Sap lake and Mekong River. It has been the national capital since French colonization and is the nation’s economic industrial and cultural centre. Phnom Penh accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh with new hotels restaurants bars high-rises and residential buildings springing up around the city. Sihanoukville is a coastal city in Cambodia. Its beaches and nearby islands make it Cambodia’s premier seaside resort with steadily rising numbers of tourists yet its infrastructure problems persist in particular those related to the supply of water and power. International-standard health facilities remain limited. Sihanoukville also faces major challenges related to crime security and safety. The city of Phnom Penh has a population of approximately 1.7 million. The city’s airport managed 3.48 million passengers in 2016. Sihanoukville had a population of just over 250000 and in 2016 its airport handled 0.15 million passengers.

It was now beginning to deliver its mass-market Model 3 sedan and this milestone marked its move from a niche producer of eclectic and expensive electric cars to a major American automobile manufacturer. Tesla had grown through a combination of managerial talent led by chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk and his team; capital from the public and private markets; and key partnerships that provided complementary technology.In the past the company had partnered with future rivals such as Daimler AG and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and with multinational firms such as Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic). Tesla had pursued partnerships even though the record showed that Musk preferred to maintain complete control of his companies’ destinies avoiding outside collaboration and mergers. Musk himself was on record as saying he did not like partnerships in general because they were complicated and they seldom worked.The stakes were high as Tesla moved into regular production of its Model 3. Worldwide demand for electric vehicles was set to soar after reaching the 2 million milestone in 2017—up 60 per cent from 2016. The International Energy Agency estimated that there would be 140 million electric cars globally by 2030. The challenge for Musk was to define Tesla’s future partnership strategy and to determine what would become of its tie-ups with its global partners.The Global Vehicle IndustrySince its adaptation for the automotive market in 1879 by Karl Benz the internal combustion engine (ICE) had been the dominant technology in the global vehicle industry. The ICE generated power by igniting a mixture of petroleum or oil and air inside chambers and using the hot gases to power pistons. In turn pistons and gears transferred this energy into forward motion. The ICE was inefficient at converting fuel into usable energy achieving only about 20 per cent thermal efficiency—the measure by which the industry calculated the percentage of the total energy in fuel that was actually converted into motive power.The search for a more efficient engine began with the oil crisis in 1973 when members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an oil embargo against the United States. The first electric-powered car was the EV1 launched in 1996 by the General Motors Company (GM). Unfortunately the EV1’s short range and long recharging time earned it a spot on Time’s 2008 list of the “50 Worst Cars of All Time.” The next year 1997 Toyota launched the Prius which would become the first successful energy-efficient vehicle. The Prius was a petrol–electric hybrid car that combined an ICE with a high-torque electric drive motor a separate generator and a nickel-metal hydride battery pack.The race to develop a commercially viable battery electric vehicle (BEV) began in the early 2000s as battery technology improved. BEVs worked by using electricity stored in powerful batteries to power electric motors. As there was no ICE a BEV was significantly less complicated than a hybrid car and it produced no exhaust. A BEV incorporated additional technology to minimize energy waste. For example the car would be switched off when it was stopped and regenerative braking technology allowed energy to be recovered during the braking process.Worldwide 79.5 million passenger cars were sold in 2017: 6.3 million cars were sold in the United States and 24.7 million cars were sold in China. When including the other types of passenger vehicles available—light-duty trucks sport utility vehicles and cross-over vehicles—the market for passenger vehicles in the United States totalled 24.4 million vehicles in 2017. Global sales of BEVs were expected to break the 1 million unit mark for the first time in 2017.The Growing Demand for Electric VehiclesElectric vehicles were becoming more viable and more popular due to advances in technology. Starting in 2009 battery costs declined by a factor of four and battery energy density increased six times. In addition an estimated 2.3 million charging stations were available globally in 2016. These charging points allowed owners of electric vehicles to recharge their cars during visits to shopping malls or doctors’ offices for example.Approximately 200000 electric cars were sold in the United States in 2017. China was the world’s biggest market for electric cars with 600000 units sold in 2017 up 71 per cent in one year. The Chinese market was dominated by local brands including the BAIC EC-Series the market leader with 78079 units sold and the Zhidou D2 EV with 42342 units sold.In September 2017 China indicated that as part of a change in industrial policy it would require foreign automakers with manufacturing locations in China to build electric vehicles by 2019. Large automakers set their targets high: GM planned to offer 10 models of electric vehicles in China by 2020; Volkswagen Group stated a target of selling 1.5 million electric cars in China alone by 2025; and Ford Motor Company and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance announced Chinese joint ventures to build electric cars. In 2016 China accounted for one-third of global car sales—about 28 million units—an increase of 13.7 per cent over the previous year. In the first half of 2017 the best-selling electric cars in China sold between about 6000 and 18000 units each (see Exhibit 1).China’s goal was for 11 per cent of all cars sold or about 3 million vehicles per year to be electric models by 2020. The country was also building out the infrastructure necessary to support the growth of electric vehicles. In March 2017 China had 156000 charging points across the country compared with 43000 in the United States. By 2020 China intended to have 4.8 million charging points.In a sign that Chinese firms were looking beyond local automotive players Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) a large Chinese technology firm acquired a 5 per cent stake in Tesla on March 28 2017. Tencent’s investment served to reinforce the importance of strategic partnerships in Tesla’s founding and emergence as only the fourth major American automaker in the last century. With Chinese interest in electric cars on the rise Tencent’s investment seemed timely.Tesla’s History of PartnershipsTesla was founded by Martin Eberhard Marc Tarpenning J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright. Tarpenning observed that by the early 2000s car makers had outsourced the majority of their parts development and sourcing keeping just three technologies in-house: “internal combustion research sales and marketing and final assembly.” In January 2004 the co-founders looked to raise a round of capital in support of their plan to build a powerful electric car around licensed drivetrain technology from AC Propulsion. AC Propulsion had created a prototype car called the tzero but had decided to focus instead on another electric car project based on a Toyota model the Scion xB. Musk who had been excited by the prospects for electric cars ever since building models as a child became both the start-up’s largest investor by contributing $6.35 million and the firm’s chairperson. In 2006 Eberhard explained the partnership with Lotus Engineering Inc. (Lotus):For those of you who don’t know the Lotus Elise’s chassis is a work of genius. . . . Some have suggested that the Tesla Roadster is built on a Lotus chassis. This is not true. Tesla licensed the Elise chassis technology but Tesla’s UK-based chassis engineering team designed the Roadster’s chassis using that technology. . . .Tesla has built a strong friendly relationship with the team at Lotus focused primarily on bringing a great new sports car to the market quickly and efficiently. . . . Tesla has licensed key technology from Lotus principally related to structure and safety Tesla has contracted Lotus Engineering for various engineering and styling jobs Lotus Cars is the contract manufacturer for the Tesla Roadster with Tesla as a key supplier to the factory in Hethel [England]However Eberhard’s goals for Tesla—to be selling Roadsters by 2006 and to be profitable by 2008—were overly optimistic. Eberhard’s original plan was to drop Tesla-designed drivetrain components into a stock Lotus Elise “glider” or chassis and then finish the car with customized technology and body panels. Tesla itself was to have been responsible for just five subassemblies in the Roadster with Lotus providing the rest of the parts and installation. But attempts to improve the Roadster—by adding customized headlights and a carbon-fibre body for example—meant that Tesla took responsibility for hundreds of subassemblies introducing complex processes—such as reworking engineering sourcing materials and retooling so that new parts could be made—which a start-up could not handle.By August 2007 Musk realized his venture was at stake ousted Eberhard and appointed himself as president of technology. He took steps to assert his authority over Tesla even working to recast his role as a key contributor at the firm even though he had been the chairperson:The way that my role has been portrayed to date where I am referred to merely as “an early investor” is outrageous. That would be like Martin [Eberhard] being called an “early employee.” Apart from me leading the Series A & B and co-leading the Series C my influence on the car itself runs from the headlights to the styling to the door sill to the trunk and my strong interest in electric transport predates Tesla by a decade. Martin should certainly be the front and center guy but the portrayal of my role to date has been incredibly insulting. I’m not blaming you or others at Tesla—the media is difficult to control. However we need to make a serious effort to correct this perception.A new CEO Michael Marks was installed in the summer of 2007. Marks had been CEO of Flextronics International Ltd. (Flextronics) a contract electronics manufacturer. He had experience growing firms having taken Flextronics from $93 million in revenues to $16 billion. In addition Marks invested $2.5 million in Tesla in 2007. Marks set out a list of priorities for Tesla’s operations team focusing on the battery pack the battery cooling system and the transmission. He narrowed Tesla’s scope eliminating a side unit that was producing batteries for other companies and delayed the opening of Tesla’s factory in New Mexico.In November 2007 Marks was replaced by a new CEO Ze’ev Driori. Driori had experience building and selling both a semiconductor firm (sold to Applied Micro Devices) and an electronic auto security firm (sold to Allstate Insurance Company). While no public reason was provided for Marks’s departure Musk stated that he wanted someone with experience taking a firm through the initial public offering process and someone with Silicon Valley experience. Tesla released its first vehicle the Tesla Roadster in February 2008.Preparing to Launch the Model SMusk who was guiding Tesla’s development earmarked $130 million to create engineer launch and put into production the company’s Model S with a target of 10000 vehicles a year. This estimate was a significant cost reduction; a typical automaker would spend $1 billion and commit thousands of employees for a new model designed from scratch. Musk aimed to achieve this goal by keeping as much of the work as possible in-house making up for the company’s “lack of R&D money by hiring smart people who could outwork and outthink the third parties relied on by the rest of the automakers.”Musk replaced Driori appointing himself CEO in December 2008. He referred to the unfolding economic malaise—later dubbed the Great Financial Crisis—as his reason for ousting Driori and naming himself CEO. Facing a working capital shortage the same month which threatened to bankrupt his firm Musk personally invested $20 million to keep Tesla going. For Musk it was an all-or-nothing bet on Tesla’s future.Relying on Key Partnerships to Provide Funding and InfrastructureTesla was not a typical car manufacturer that had gone it alone developing a new product internally based on its own technology. A large part of its success was because it had been able to secure partnerships along the way and had managed and maintained the partnerships so as to generate value for both sides. Tesla had deals with more than 10 major entities harnessing expertise infrastructure and capital.In January 2009 a few weeks after the financing closed Musk seized an opportunity for a discounted spot at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit showing up at a time when other automakers were declining to attend. Displaying the Roadster and its electric powertrain helped Tesla attract the attention of Daimler and the two firms partnered to create an electric version of a Daimler smart car. Daimler also gained a 10 per cent stake in Tesla by investing $50 million.The validation by one of the industry’s largest automakers seemed to help persuade the U.S. Department of Energy to provide a $465 million loan to Tesla in January 2010. A third piece of good news arrived in April 2010 when Tesla acquired GM and Toyota’s New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) factory in Fremont California. GM and Toyota had spent $1 billion to develop NUMMI but closed the plant in 2009 as a result of the recession and GM’s bankruptcy. Toyota in late 2009 was preparing to make all of its workforce at NUMMI redundant when Tesla stepped in and bought the plant for $42 million. As part of the deal Toyota invested $50 million for 2.5 per cent of Tesla and agreed to work with the firm to produce an electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) based on Toyota’s RAV4 platform.To add to its cash reserves Musk took Tesla public on June 29 2010 raising $226 million. The company with no near-term cash issues focused on bringing the Model S to production.Panasonic Provides the “Heart” of the CarTesla deepened its partnership with Panasonic in October 2011 securing a supply of automotive-grade lithium-ion battery cells to build up to 80000 Model S cars in the following four years. Tesla’s collaboration with Panasonic began in 2009 with a supply agreement for battery cells for 6000 cars and Panasonic had built upon that agreement with a $30 million investment in Tesla stock in 2010. Importantly the October 2011 agreement meant that Tesla would be able to deliver on its cost and margin targets for the Model S. In remarks made to the Japanese press in September 2014 Musk emphasized the significance of Panasonic’s involvement in Tesla’s cars: “An important point that I should emphasize about the Model S is that the batteries are all made in Japan. . . . Because the battery is the ‘heart’ of an electric car . . . the heart of Model S is Japanese. I think that’s a pretty cool thing.”Musk Reaches Out to GoogleThe first Model S sedans were delivered in June 2012 to much fanfare. The base 85-kilowatt hour model retailed for $77400 and had an estimated range of 350 miles (563 kilometres). However instead of selling 10000 cars as Musk had forecast the company delivered only 3000 by the end of 2012. By February 2013 Tesla was facing another working capital deficit. Due to negative publicity from the first Model S deliveries—mostly due to complaints about workmanship and battery issues—Tesla was having trouble converting $5000 Model S reservations into sales. The situation became so tenuous that Musk entered into a handshake deal with Larry Page the co-founder of Google to sell Tesla to Google for what was thought to be $6 billion with the understanding that Google would provide an additional $5 billion in capital to fund the firm and would guarantee that Musk could continue to be involved. He had agreed to sell Tesla because the company was running short of cash. Meanwhile Musk rallied his employees temporarily reassigning them the job of closing sales. He was desperate: “I don’t care what job you were doing. Your new job is delivering cars.” The last-chance appeal was a success and the 500 reassigned employees helped drive Tesla to its first quarterly profit $11 million on May 8 2013. Tesla’s shares rose from $30 to $130 by July 2013. The deal with Google was scrapped. Broadening Tesla’s ReachBy June 2014 Tesla shares broke through the $200 mark. Taking advantage of this momentum Musk delivered a surprising announcement: Tesla’s patents would be open-sourced. In a blog post entitled “All Our Patent Are Belong to You” Musk stated that he used to believe in creating and holding patents as a way to erect barriers to entry. At Tesla he changed his mind believing that the firm’s ability to attract talent would differentiate it from the rest:Technology leadership is not defined by patents which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.Tesla aimed to build a manufacturing cluster by attracting automotive suppliers to Silicon Valley and Fremont. This location was far from traditional automotive clusters such as Detroit and therefore represented a commitment by these suppliers to Tesla’s business model. These automotive parts manufacturers and technology firms included Cypress Semiconductor Corporation SolarCity Corporation (SolarCity) Methode Electronics Inc. Kennerly-Spratling Inc. AGC Automotive South Bay Solutions Inc. Tentex A&P Solutions AMAX Information Technologies Inc. Dimensional Control Systems Inc. and Autodesk Inc. (see Exhibit 2). Even electric car competitors Faraday&Future Inc. and Atieva decided to locate their offices in the vicinity.Tesla’s success attracted new partners some of whom were not even in the electric car industry. In 2015 the utility company Southern California Edison teamed up with Tesla to build a 20-megawatt lithium-ion battery storage facility to store and deliver electricity. The contract’s value was purported to be around $45 million. In November 2016 Tesla expanded its scope by acquiring SolarCity an installer of rooftop solar panels run by Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive. After the transaction Musk personally owned 22 per cent of SolarCity as well as 21 per cent of Tesla’s shares. More than 85 per cent of Tesla shareholders voted in favour of the acquisition. While the offer valued SolarCity at $2.1 billion Tesla’s market value declined by $4.8 billion in the time between the acquisition announcement and SolarCity’s acceptance of the deal. Musk explained the rationale behind the acquisition: “We’re trying to make an integrated product. So you have an integrated solar roof with a Powerwall and an electric car and you just go into a Tesla store just say yes it just happens. It all works it’s seamless and you love it.”With the objective of developing innovative dies to shape aluminum—which was difficult to work with—Tesla partnered with Fuji Technica & Miyazu Inc. a Japanese supplier of dies to design the tools to make the Model S possible. Tesla required a partner that could produce aluminum panels that retained an aesthetically pleasing smooth curve. The choice of aluminum was deliberate: it was a lightweight metal helping Tesla deliver longer range for its vehicles.Tesla Sells Direct to ConsumersTesla’s founders had always wanted to sell directly to consumers because of the value the company could gain from customer feedback—information it would not be able to rely upon if its cars were sold through dealerships. Musk realized that traditional dealers would be interested in protecting existing sales and that it would be difficult for them to tout the benefits of an electric car without undermining their business of selling cars driven by internal combustion engines. He also noted that before stepping into a car dealership most car consumers had either conducted research or had an idea of the type of car they wanted to buy. The only issue left to resolve was the price at which they could buy the car from the dealer. Musk concluded that selling through dealerships would offer little opportunity given the interests and incentives on both sides to educate consumers on the benefits of a Tesla. He offered an alternative: to sell Teslas through company-owned stores:That is why we are deliberately positioning our store and gallery locations in high foot traffic high visibility retail venues like malls and shopping streets that people regularly visit in a relatively open-minded buying mood. This allows us to interact with potential customers and have them learn about our cars from Tesla Product Specialists before they have decided which new car to buy. The Product Specialists are also trained to answer questions about electric vehicles in general not just ours. They are not on commission and they will never pressure you to buy a car.At the start of 2012 Tesla had 10 stores one gallery and nine service centres in the United States. By the end of that year this collection had grown to 19 stores 3 galleries and 26 service centres. In June 2016 Tesla partnered with Nordstrom Inc. a high-end retailer to offer an electric car boutique in the men’s section at its store in The Grove in Los Angeles. This store-within-a-store concept was discussed in detail before it was approved by both firms. In November 2016 a second Tesla boutique opened in Nordstrom’s SouthPark store in Charlotte North Carolina (see Exhibit 2). Here was Tesla’s official comment on the venture:Tesla and Nordstrom share a relentless drive to engage and delight customers with new and innovative shopping experiences. . . . The Nordstrom shopper embodies a lifestyle that parallels that of many Tesla owners—people who are forward-thinking savvy and curious to explore the latest and best trends.Yet as of late 2017 there were no further announcements about Nordstrom and Tesla’s partnership. In some states such as Texas it was illegal for Tesla to circumvent the automotive dealerships. Despite hiring 20 lobbyists and making $150000 in campaign contributions Musk was unable to gain permission to sell Tesla cars direct to consumers in Texas.Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff tabled a bill in February 2016—for the second year in a row—to allow the sale of electric vehicles directly to consumers without going through the franchise dealership model. However Duff’s efforts were blocked by GM and its local dealership association which successfully lobbied legislators not to support the bill. Tesla had 265 sales and service locations globally at the end of 2016. Tesla Prepares the Model 3 for the Mass MarketTesla announced that it would launch its third-generation mass-market vehicle the Model 3 on March 31 2016. The car’s starting price was $35000 and it had a range of 215 miles (346 kilometres) on a full charge. Within an hour and a half of the announcement 15000 pre-orders had been placed by buyers who each put down $1000 as a deposit. By the start of April 2016 Tesla had 130000 pre-orders for the Model 3.By May 2016 Tesla had 373000 pre-orders and by September 2016 it was holding nearly $690 million in cash from customers’ deposits. An automotive analyst Sandy Munro estimated that Tesla’s Model 3 had margins of over 30 per cent. Musk took the unusual step of “anti-selling” the Model 3: it would not offer test drives and would not advertise the model for six to nine months beginning in May 2017. He intended to convince potential customers to select the Model S and hoped to dispel the notion that the Model 3 was an upgrade to the Model S: “Model S will be better than Model 3 as it should be because it’s a more expensive car.” Tesla began delivering Model 3 cars on July 28 2017. The Model 3 was touted as the car that would finally nudge Tesla into profitability—a significant milestone that would herald the company’s entry into the ranks of both global and independent automakers. Musk was not unaware of the challenges that still lay ahead for Tesla. Speaking to his employees on July 31 2017 he said “We’re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell. Welcome. Welcome to production hell.” But Musk was not afraid of falling short. He had once said “Failure is an option here. If things are not failing you are not innovating enough.”Meanwhile Tesla continued to expand its Supercharger network to support its growing number of cars. In 2015 Tesla had 584 Supercharger locations around the world and a total of 3400 Supercharger stalls. It valued its Supercharger network at $339 million. By 2017 it aimed to have 7200 Supercharger locations around the world. It cost Tesla about $197000 to set up each new location and the company spent $40.6 million to build Supercharger locations in 2016. For comparison Tesla’s total capital expenditures in the same year were $1.3 billion. Operating costs for Supercharger locations were “immaterial” according to Tesla and the costs were allocated to its cost of goods sold and to selling general and administrative expenses. To encourage users to use its stations efficiently Tesla introduced a $0.40 per minute “idle fee” that would be charged five minutes after the car was fully recharged.Elon MuskMusk born in South Africa had suffered through a tough childhood as the target of bullies and the son of a disciplinarian father. Later in life he pointed to his difficult upbringing as a reason why he was able to work punishing hours leading three large companies: Tesla SolarCity and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX).After leaving home he enrolled at Queen’s University then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he completed a dual degree in physics and economics. While he was a student he and a friend had cold-called a high-ranking executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and secured a summer internship reviewing the bank’s emerging market bond portfolio. Then in 1995 two days into his program Musk abandoned a Stanford doctorate program in applied physics and materials sciences to co-found Zip2 an online city guide and mapping firm with his brother. Key to Zip2’s growth was getting the code for navigation software—for free—from Navteq a firm that developed Global Positioning System (GPS) products.Musk invested about half of the $22 million gain he had realized from the sale of Zip2 into X.com an online financial services company. As with Zip2 Musk knew next to nothing about the intricacies of the banking and financial industry. He just had a hunch he could do it better. X.com which provided banking services merged with its competitor Confinity Inc. which had a new product called PayPal. However as X.com gained traction in the market it began losing even more money as a result of the increased transaction volume. In September 2000 the board ousted Musk from his position as CEO of the combined entity. Nevertheless he continued to stay involved as an advisor and even increased his stake in the venture. When eBay Inc. paid $1.5 billion for PayPal in July 2002 Musk walked away with $250 million. He used that money to start SolarCity SpaceX and to become an investor in Tesla.Musk was well known as a trailblazing entrepreneur. He had steered Tesla from a concept to its current position as a premier luxury electric car company. His SolarCity venture run by his cousins focused on leasing solar-power systems to homeowners. SpaceX had contracts with governments to launch payloads into space using its Falcon Heavy rocket technology. Musk insisted he would land a Tesla on Mars one day. This announcement had the added benefit of signalling to NASA that SpaceX was readying its rockets to make the trip to Mars should the space agency require it.Musk stated in a 2006 blog post humorously entitled “The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (Just between You and Me)” that “the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy which I believe to be the primary but not exclusive sustainable solution.”With his many innovative ventures and ambitious goals it was remarkable that Musk seemed to manage his businesses directly. He did not insulate himself from the front line of the business for example by surrounding himself with multiple layers of managers. As Musk’s biographer noted “Most high-profile CEOs have handlers all around them. Musk mostly moves about Musk Land on his own.”Tesla Looks to the FutureTesla a company that had raised its first Series A round of funding in February 2004 was now seen as a legitimate challenger to the world’s premier car brands. Yet Tesla still had many hurdles to overcome. In the United States the automotive dealer network continued to fight Tesla in several key states to prevent it from selling vehicles directly to consumers. Tesla had shouldered the burden of creating its own Supercharger network recharging stations at which Tesla owners could refuel their cars. But while owners were initially offered use of the Supercharger network for free Tesla took steps to introduce fees and penalties in an effort to defray the network’s operating costs a move that concerned them.Tesla’s Gigafactory was the first attempt to bring battery manufacturing in-house albeit with support from Panasonic the company’s long-term battery partner. The Gigafactory was focused on producing batteries for the upcoming Model 3. Tesla announced that the Gigafactory would be built with an estimated price tag of between $4 billion and $5 billion the majority of it provided by Tesla. At the start of 2016 Panasonic announced that it would be investing up to $1.6 billion in the Gigafactory. Six months later Panasonic raised its stake in the Gigafactory after it raised $3.86 billion by issuing corporate bonds and earmarked the majority of those funds to the Gigafactory. The relationship between Panasonic and Tesla would deepen with the former proposing a supply agreement on self-driving sensors and a research pact on sensor development.On October 23 2017 Tesla announced that it would build a wholly owned plant in Shanghai’s free-trade zone. Tesla would continue to pay a 25 per cent import tariff on cars destined for the Chinese market from its Chinese factory. Tesla sold $1 billion worth of cars—11000 units—in China in 2016 tripling its sales over the previous year. The demand for Tesla cars in China was high even though import duties and shipping fees meant that a Tesla in China cost 50 per cent than the same car in the United States.In March 2017 Musk announced a production target of 500000 vehicles in 2018 six times the volume Tesla had achieved in 2016. But Musk’s ambitious goals for ramping up production of the Model 3 were tested in July 2017 when battery pack shortages delayed deliveries. Worse in July 2017 customer demand for Tesla’s Model S and Model X had stalled according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and KeyBanc Capital Markets. The pressure placed in August 2017 on Tesla’s production workers who feared that the additional workload could lead to injuries led some to call for a un",,,,,
on at the automotive firm.Tesla’s financial position continued to deteriorate as it invested in ramping up production. Tesla’s cash burn increased to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2017 up from $622 million the year before. Estimates were that its capital spend would be $2 billion in the second half of 2017. In June 2017 Tesla reported that it had $3.01 billion in cash and short-term investments. Tesla’s junk bonds—$1.8 billion of 5.3 per cent notes due in 2025—traded below par in August 2017 a decline that suggested investor confidence was waning in the firm’s ability to deliver on schedule. Unfortunately for Musk and his team Tesla’s momentum stalled in September 2017. On October 2 Tesla announced that it had produced only 260 Model 3 cars in September far fewer than the 1500 units it had stated as its goal. Tesla told investors that production bottlenecks were to blame but provided no specifics. According to Oppenheimer & Co. a stock analyst firm Tesla’s production problems stemmed from the inability of its suppliers to deliver parts on time. Major portions of the Model 3 continued to be built by hand which was a painstaking process. By October 18 Tesla fired between 400 and 700 employees due to assembly issues. With only 1500 vehicles anticipated to be produced in the third quarter Tesla’s group of 450000 Model 3 deposit holders would have a long wait before they could take delivery of their cars.In contrast rival BMW AG (BMW) noted that it had sold 10000 electric and hybrid cars in the same month and that its year-over-year sales were up 64 per cent. When Tesla announced dismal earnings higher than expected cash burn and production misses in November 2017 its stock fell to about $300 down from the high of $389 it had reached in September 2017. Tesla continued to be in cash conservation mode; it was losing $4000 per car on its current production vehicle the Model S. Skeptics pointed to Tesla’s quarterly cash burn of up to a billion dollars which had been earmarked to bring its mass-market $35000 Model 3 sedan to the market and to ramp up sales in general. Musk had publicly announced targets of $20 billion in revenues and $5 billion in gross profit in 2018. An analyst for investment bank UBS predicted that Tesla would run out of cash by the third quarter of 2018 due to its aggressive spending as it ramped up production. Tesla’s income statements and balance sheets (see Exhibits 3 and 4) provided details. The company’s unit sales appeared modest compared with those of competitors in the U.S. and global electric car market (see Exhibit 5).The shift in sentiment seemed stark given that only a few months ago on June 9 2017 Tesla’s market capitalization had briefly surpassed BMW’s $61.3 billion value. This notable event had left analysts searching for rational explanations: why was a relatively new (in the automotive world) start-up selling fewer than 80000 cars and losing $725 million in 2016 worth more than one of the world’s premier luxury automakers which sold 30 times more cars and had booked a net profit in 2016 of $7.7 billion?Worse Consumer Reports magazine estimated that Tesla would be able to achieve only “average reliability” with its Model 3 sedan and ranked the company 21st of 27 brands for quality. The Model S had been awarded a very high rating in 2015 but that rating was revised two months later following reports of quality problems. One of Musk’s earlier comments suggested he was expecting to tweak his products as they evolved: “There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.”By the end of 2017 Tesla was missing its production goals producing 2425 Model 3s in total in the fourth quarter of 2017 against an estimate of 5000 cars per week. Musk was reportedly sleeping on the roof of the Gigafactory so that he could keep a closer eye on production. A comparison of Tesla’s stock price against the S&P 500 and CARZ an exchange-traded fund that tracks the shares of global automakers (see Exhibit 6) suggested that Tesla would continue to need a network of partners to realize its vision of selling luxury electric cars. The question was what types of partnerships were needed and with which entities? It was January 2018. Was it time for Tesla to go it alone to chart its own path forward?Exhibit 1: Top-selling Electric Cars in China first Half of 2017Note: 1 mile = 1.609 kilometresSource: Adapted from “Electric Avenue: The Best-Selling Pure-Electric Cars in China in the First Half of 2017” in Trefor Moss “China with Methodical Discipline Conjures a Market for Electric Cars” Wall Street Journal October 2 2017 accessed September 25 2018 www.wsj.com/articles/china-with-methodical-discipline-takes-global-lead-in-electric-cars-1506954248.Exhibit 2: Tesla’s PartnershipsJuly 2005: Tesla licensed key technology principally related to structure and safety from Lotus Engineering Inc. (Lotus). Tesla signed a contract with Lotus for various engineering and styling jobs. Lotus was the contract manufacturer for the Tesla Roadster and Tesla was a key supplier to the Lotus factory in Hethel United Kingdom. After selling 1650 units Tesla stopped taking orders for the Tesla Roadster in mid-2011 and expected to sell down its inventory of Roadsters by the end of 2011. Tesla then prepared to sell its Model S. January 2009: Displaying the Roadster and its electric powertrain helped Tesla attract the attention of Daimler and the two firms partnered to create an electric version of a Daimler smart car. Daimler also gained a 10 per cent stake in Tesla by investing $50 million. On October 22 2014 Daimler sold its stake in Tesla for $780 million.January 2010: The U.S. Department of Energy provided a $465 million loan to Tesla. On May 22 2013 Tesla repaid the loan nine years ahead of schedule.April 2010: Tesla bought GM and Toyota’s New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) factory in Fremont California for $42 million. As part of the deal Toyota invested $50 million for 2.5 per cent of Tesla and agreed to work with the firm to produce an electric SUV based on Toyota’s RAV4 platform. On December 22 2011 test models of the Toyota RAV4 EV concept were seen on the road. Toyota paid Tesla $100 million to supply the battery motor gearbox and power electronics for the e-RAV4. The components were built in California and then shipped to Toyota’s U.S. factory. Toyota sold its stake in Tesla in June 2017 as the two manufacturers become rivals. Toyota was thought to have received $478 million for its Tesla shares.October 2011: Panasonic entered into a supply agreement with Tesla to provide automotive-grade battery cells batteries and sensors for self-driving vehicles. Panasonic was a co-investor in Tesla’s battery factory the Gigafactory investing $1.6 billion out of the $5 billion invested. January 2014: Tesla released its patents as open source. In a blog posting Musk statedThe unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn’t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales. . . .Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.We believe that Tesla other companies making electric cars and the world would all benefit from a common rapidly-evolving technology platform.Technology leadership is not defined by patents which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard. February 2016: Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff tabled a bill in February 2016 to allow the sale of electric vehicles directly to consumers without going through the franchise dealerships model.June 2016: Tesla Motors partnered with Nordstrom to open a car showroom in Nordstrom’s store in in Los Angeles. It added a second store in Charlotte North Carolina in November 2016.August 2016: A high-tech manufacturing cluster started to form around Tesla’s production plant in Fremont. It included automotive part manufacturers and technology firms: Cypress Semiconductor Corporation SolarCity Corporation Methode Electronics Inc. Kennerly-Spratling Inc. AGC Automotive South Bay Solutions Inc. Tentex A&P Solutions AMAX Information Technologies Inc. Dimensional Control Systems Inc. and Autodesk Inc.September 2016: Tesla entered into a joint venture with Southern California Edison a utility firm based in Ontario California. Tesla would build a 20-megawatt battery storage facility for South California Edison. The amount paid was undisclosed. For perspective a 2-megawatt Tesla battery system cost about $2.9 million according to Tesla.September 2016: Fuji Technica & Miyazu Inc. a Japanese supplier of dies (custom tools to shape materials) worked with Tesla beginning in the early stages of development to design the tools to make the Model 3 possible. The technology was able to shape aluminum sheets a material which was difficult to work with.March 2017: Tencent Holdings Ltd. a Chinese technology firm bought a 5 per cent stake in Tesla. In November 2017 Tencent revealed that it had developed its own autonomous driving system.Source: “Supply Agreement [Amendment No. 1]—Lotus Cars Ltd. and Tesla Motors Inc.” Onecle August 4 2009 accessed September 25 2018 http://contracts.onecle.com/tesla-motors/lotus-supply-2009-08-04.shtml; Matthew Lynley “Tesla Motors to Stop Taking Roadster Orders in Two Months” Venture Beat June 23 2011 accessed September 25 2018 https://venturebeat.com/2011/06/23/tesla-roadster-orders-stop/; Chuck Squatriglia “Tesla Motors Joins Daimler on a Smart EV” Wired January 13 2009 accessed September 25th 2018 www.wired.com/2009/01/tesla-motors-jo/; Bloomberg News “Daimler AG Sells Its Tesla Motors Inc Stake for US$780M as Model S Rises as Luxury Car Rival” Financial Post October 22 2014 accessed September 25 2018 http://business.financialpost.com/transportation/daimler-ag-sells-its-tesla-motors-inc-stake-for-us780m-as-model-s-rises-as-luxury-car-rival; U.S. Department of Energy “Tesla” Loans Programs Office 2017 accessed September 25 2018 www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla; Adi Robertson “Tesla Repays $465 Million Government Green Energy Loan Ahead of Schedule” The Verge May 22 2013 accessed September 25 2018 www.theverge.com/2013/5/22/4356860/tesla-repays-465-million-government-green-energy-loan; Camille Ricketts “Tesla Paid $42M for NUMMI But Doesn’t Have Deal to Build Cars with Toyota” Venture Beat May 27 2010 accessed September 25 2018 https://venturebeat.com/2010/05/27/tesla-paid-42m-for-nummi-but-doesnt-have-deal-to-build-cars-with-toyota/; Tim Pollard “Toyota Rav4 EV (2012)—Tesla/Toyota SUV Scooped” Car December 22 2011 accessed September 25 2018 www.carmagazine.co.uk/spy-shots/toyota/toyota-rav4-ev-2012---teslatoyota-suv-scooped/; Alec Macfarlane “Toyota Dumps Stake in Tesla as Former Partners Become Rivals” CNN Business June 5 2017 accessed September 25 2018 http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/05/investing/toyota-sells-tesla-stake/index.html; Tim Pollard “Toyota Has Sold All Its Shares in Tesla—Here’s Why” Car June 6 2017 accessed September 25 2018 www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/industry-news/tesla/toyota-has-sold-all-its-shares-in-tesla---heres-why/; “Panasonic Aims to Move Tesla Auto Partnership Beyond Batteries: CEO” Reuters January 19 2017 accessed September 25 2018 www.reuters.com/article/us-panasonic-tesla/panasonic-aims-to-move-tesla-auto-partnership-beyond-batteries-ceo-idUSKBN1530UC; Elon Musk “All Our Patent Are Belong to You” Tesla June 12 2014 accessed September 25 2018 www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you?redirect=no; Kyle Constable “Auto Retailers Makers Call on Tesla to Apply for Franchise” CT Mirror March 1 2016 accessed September 25 2018 https://ctmirror.org/2016/03/01/auto-retailers-makers-call-on-tesla-to-apply-for-franchise/; Matthew Stern “Nordstrom Tries Tesla Showroom in Menswear—Does the Partnership Have Wheels?” Forbes (blog) June 29 2016 accessed September 25 2018 www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2016/06/29/nordstrom-tries-a-tesla-showroom-in-menswear/#94b585b53a69; Fred Lambert “Tesla Expands Partnership with Nordstrom Adds Another Retail Location inside the Upscale Fashion Store” Electrek November 25 2016 accessed September 25 2018 https://electrek.co/2016/11/25/tesla-expands-nordstrom-north-carolina/; Patrick Hoge “The Tesla Effect: How the Cutting Edge Company Became the Most Powerful Engine in Bay Area Manufacturing” San Francisco Business Times August 4 2016 accessed September 25 2018 www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/08/04/how-tesla-drives-manufacturing-bay-are-elon-musk.html; Garrett Reim “Tesla Motors to Build 20MW Battery Storage Facility for SoCal Edison” Los Angeles Business Journal September 15 2016 accessed September 25 2018 http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/sep/15/tesla-motors-build-20mw-battery-storage-facility-s/; Matt Pressman “Fuji Technica A Japanese Tesla Supplier Talks Tesla Model 3” Clean Technica September 15 2016 accessed September 25 2018 https://cleantechnica.com/2016/09/15/fuji-technica-japanese-tesla-supplier-talks-tesla-model-3/; Lulu Yilun Chen “Tesla-Partner Tencent Plans Its Own Driverless Technology” Bloomberg November 6 2017 accessed September 25 2018 www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/tesla-partner-tencent-is-said-to-plan-own-driverless-technology.Exhibit 3: Tesla Inc.

Daljit sat back and reflected on the day’s events. The day had been hectic yet deeply satisfying. During the organization-wide review of a major change initiative called Fortis Operating System (FOS) the mood had remained consistently upbeat. Clearly the change initiative had succeeded beyond most people’s expectations having generated great enthusiasm all around. When Ashish Bhatia facility director (FD) at Fortis Hospital Mohali and a key member of the core change team had said that he and his colleagues on the change team would regard the experience of FOS implementation as the high point of their careers thus far his words seemed to resonate with others present at the meeting.The top leaders of the organization including promoter and chief executive officer Shivinder Mohan Singh had been present at the meeting. They were pleased that an important and strategic change intervention which had been initiated six months earlier at Mohali a small city in the northern part of India had worked out so well. Shivinder had smiled and said to Daljit “As you well know the reward for good work is more work. We should roll out FOS in two more hospitals in the next two months and then plan to quickly take it to all the hospitals in our group.”Daljit knew that the successful implementation of FOS at the Mohali facility was only the first in a series of steps that the top team had worked out. Given the ambitious plan of growing to 35 hospitals in the following five years it would be important to rapidly implement FOS in all of the Fortis facilities to streamline non-clinical processes that affected patient satisfaction predictability of outcomes and efficiency. Some of the hospitals in the Fortis group had been acquired and some were located in smaller towns with limited management bandwidth and depth. Despite such differences FOS had to be rolled out quickly and effectively in all of those hospitals mainly through in-house efforts. Given the strategic importance of the change the board would certainly want a detailed presentation of how the change would be quickly and effectively scaled up.HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN INDIA The health care industry in India was categorized into public and private health care providers. Inadequate public investments provided an opportunity for the private players to contribute significantly to the development of the health care industry. The private sector accounted for 73.8 per cent of the country’s total health care expenditure. Rising income levels an aging population and growing health awareness was driving the growth of the health care industry which was estimated at US$38 billion in 2007 and was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent for the next 15 years.Corporate hospitals accounted for less than 10 per cent of total private ownership; the remainder was made up of unorganized and fragmented clinics and nursing homes. Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited founded in 1983 was the first organized private player in the health care industry. After a long gap Fortis was set up in 1996. Other players followed including CARE Hospitals Max Hospitals Aravind Eye Hospitals Manipal Group of Hospitals and Narayana Health. Though there were myriad growth opportunities for the health care sector in India there were challenges in health care delivery even for private players—there were hardly any standards of quality of service delivery and little focus on patient engagement activities. Most of the hospitals including the corporate hospitals followed traditional methods of paper-based record keeping which resulted in delays both in access to records and in diagnosis and ultimately affected the quality of health care services.FORTIS HEALTHCARE LIMITEDFortis a leading provider of integrated health care was founded by the late visionary business leader Dr. Parvinder Singh whose contributions to the Indian pharmaceutical industry were legendary. His vision for Fortis was “to create a world-class integrated health care delivery system in India entailing the finest medical skills combined with compassionate patient care.” After Parvinder’s death his sons Malvinder and Shivinder pursued their father’s vision by bringing in talented personnel instilling strong values building efficient systems and inculcating responsibility toward stakeholders on a strong foundation of trust.Fortis commenced its commercial hospital operation by setting up the Fortis Hospital at Mohali a multi-specialty hospital in 2001. Fortis pursued an ambitious growth path through a combination of acquisitions greenfield projects brownfield projects and management contracts. By 2007 Fortis had a network of 11 hospitals in India with 1580 inpatient beds in use across its network of hospitals.Each hospital under Fortis was headed by an FD. Heads of departments such as Human Resources Finance Patient Care Services Quality and Marketing reported directly to an FD who was supported by a medical director—in charge of the medical administration—and a unit head administrator who was in charge of the non-medical administration and other support services.WHY AN OPERATING SYSTEM AT FORTIS?Until 2006 hospital operations across Fortis locations were disparate and based on local infrastructure and local needs. Computerization at Fortis hospitals which began in 2006 was limited to stand-alone systems to take care of routine local area needs with the emphasis mainly on bookkeeping activities.Shivinder had always felt the need to improve hospital processes to ease the pain experienced by the patients and their attenders. He had gained a first-hand experience of hospital processes when he accompanied his father Parvinder who was undergoing treatment for cancer to a hospital in 1997. During his visits to one of the world’s best hospitals Shivinder saw hospital functioning from the patient’s and the attendant’s perspectives. He realized how crucial it was to ensure that the patients and attendants did not have to fret over delayed appointments misplaced reports shuttling from one department to another billing issues delayed discharges poor emergency responses or a lack of information on what would happen next or the line of treatment. In the words of Shivinder “We [Fortis hospitals] are able to attract patients from across the country but the processes are not standardized and efficient. When a patient enters any Fortis hospital he or she should expect the same service everywhere. It is like becoming the McDonald’s of health care; you know exactly what to expect irrespective of where you are. There has to be one Fortis—one Experience.”Fortis had articulated its “Mission 2011” as follows: providing excellence in service delivery; showing domestic leadership in cardiology orthology neurology nephrology and gastroenterology; being globally recognized in cardiology and orthology; having a pan-India presence with 35 to 40 hospitals with about 6000 beds; having talented staff comprising about 3500 doctors and 15000 nurses; and having an international presence. There was a specific plan in place to reach 35 hospitals by 2011 (see Exhibit 1).Daljit outlined why the top team considered standardization such a key issue for a new player with growth aspirations in a new industry:In 2006 we were a young organization with six hospitals each with its own way of functioning. We had a strategy mandate that there will be standardization in the way we run our organization. The aspiration was to grow to 40 hospitals. We realized early on that it is tough enough to run one hospital let alone 35! We . . . [made the] call that it would be prudent to standardize now so that we [could] build a meaningful network with high quality and SOPs [standardized operating procedures]/ways of working and not 40 disparate individual hospitals. This platform would not only be a major enabler for us to replicate and scale up our operations as we grew but it would also drive the improvement and standardization of the various patient-facing non-clinical processes that impact patient satisfaction predictability of outcomes and efficiency.McKinsey & Company (McKinsey) was appointed as consultant to help with the development of FOS. From the McKinsey side Dr. Mandar Vaidya was made the project manager for the assignment. As Vaidya explained The assignment was unique in the sense that it involved creating standard operating procedures for an organization on a high-growth path. The top management believed very strongly that this was a key priority for building an institution of scale. Clearly the burning platform was that without FOS we cannot achieve our aspiration of rapid growth in a new industry. The mandate was to make the operating system Reliable Repeatable and Replicable. “Reliable” meant that the process would work to produce intended results again and again without intervention. “Repeatable” meant that it would happen every single time and 365 days per year. And “Replicable” meant that by the time the system was set up in one hospital the codification would have been completed and the process would be ready to be rolled out in 10 other hospitals.Fortis defined the objectives and specific deliverables of FOS (see Exhibit 2).PREPARING THE GROUNDIn February 2007 Fortis Hospital at Mohali was made the test bench for implementing FOS. This would establish the concept and McKinsey would play a key role in facilitating change. In Wave 2 it was expected that FOS would be taken to two more hospitals and this change would be driven by Fortis leadership with some limited back-end support from McKinsey. In Wave 3 FOS would be taken to a much larger number of Fortis hospitals completely on its own. On the choice of Mohali Ashish stated “Mohali was chosen basically for the reason that it was the first child of Fortis and it had reached a certain maturity level to handle a large change initiative of this kind. There was [a] comfort level in terms of getting the basics right. Other hospitals were relatively new and were in the process of settling down.”A steering committee was formed that included Shivinder Daljit the chief operating officer of hospitals under Fortis head of the Medical Operations group head of Finance head of Human Resources and Vaidya from McKinsey. The committee conducted several meetings over a week and discussed the need for and benefits of change. Daljit was designated as the corporate champion to steer the change; he also coordinated with McKinsey. The entire engagement from the conceptualization stage to implementation to institutionalizing the change was led by Daljit as he understood Shivinder’s vision. Daljit statedThe objective of FOS was essentially to have a framework to ensure uniformly delivered high quality efficient and predictable services to our patients; to make the patient journey within the hospital informed and pain free recognizing their state of vulnerability. This would necessitate the creation of a one “look and feel” Fortis across locations. A major benefit of this would be to optimize utilization of resources; i.e. inpatient beds OPDs [outpatient departments] OTs [operation theatres] ICUs [intensive care units] radiology/pathology/emergency services admissions/discharge processes etc. Last but not least we also wanted to leverage this major initiative to build leaders of tomorrow—for a growing organization this was an important deliverable.Daljit knew that the most important task was to get the clinicians on board the project. The clinicians’ domain was a specialist domain and it was important to clearly convey that the exercise dealt with non-clinical areas and would ease and support their work in the hospital. Vaidya conducted one-on-one interviews with senior clinicians to understand their pain points. As all activities revolved around the clinicians this helped in figuring out what had to be tackled and what could be left alone. The interviews clearly brought out that most of the pain points were outside the clinical domain; for example delayed reports patient crowding poor OT scheduling and disparate and un-smooth step-downs from the ICU to regular wards.The McKinsey team realized that given the scope of the change it would be necessary to have a strong full-time internal team. At their request the steering committee approved the move of six high-performing and high-potential individuals to this initiative full-time for the duration of the assignment. A core team was formed that included Ashish and Vaidya as well as six staff members selected from different functional areas. The selection process of the core team was rigorous and involved the screening across the organization of 30 high-potential staff members who were in the 25–35 age group and who had been with Fortis for the past five years. At the next level interviews were conducted by a mixed panel of consultants and only those who were best in their areas of work and showed the potential to become future facility heads were selected. The selection process conveyed that the six individuals selected were the best among the lot and positioned FOS firmly at the top of management’s agenda.The various departments in the hospitals were called assets and 12 assets were identified for FOS implementation. To keep staff excited and motivated about FOS initially only six assets were picked up for FOS implementation in the first three months. As Vaidya pointed out “We felt that we had to function like a ‘haretoise’—be rapid flexible and fast-moving like a hare and at the same time steady consistent and no pauses and rests like a tortoise. Let us concentrate on just six assets in the first three months and even among the six let us pick up one or two areas where we can have [the] most rapid improvements to quickly establish proof of concept. This will galvanize the entire organization.”Daljit realized that obtaining buy-in for FOS from all stakeholders (clinicians nurses medical staff and administrators) would be a challenging task as they were themselves busy dealing with their routine activities. He strongly believed that powerful communication was the only way forward in catalyzing the change. He ensured extensive communication with staff at all levels to make them understand the benefits of the change. Banners on FOS implementation were put up at various locations across the hospital to provide the initiative with high visibility.The first meeting involving the core team and all department heads was conducted every day for a week and the need for and benefits of change were discussed. A boot camp was organized at an offsite location for the core team and the heads of various departments including Pathology Radiology Outpatient Emergency and OT. All members of the steering committee addressed the team at the boot camp sending a clear signal about top management’s involvement in and commitment to the change program. Ashish said “The leaders made us feel as the ‘chosen ones.’ Their expectations and approaches strengthened our ownership and commitment to the change agenda.”The core team was divided into two teams and these visited all the departments to talk to staff and explain to them the benefits of the change. Town hall meetings were conducted every week which everyone attended and where department heads/process owners made presentations about the ongoing progress made during the previous week. The FOS presentation was recorded on compact disc and made available to every employee. McKinsey remained in the background and instead put employees at the front recognizing their expertise in their areas of work. As a result ownership was steadily built and shop-floor problems dictated the solutions.FOS METHODOLOGYThe FOS team viewed the various processes in the hospital from three dimensions: processes within the department patient flow processes and performance management system–scorecard and review process (see Exhibit 3). For processes within the department/asset the core team identified process owners or process champions who were energetic keen and analytical. They posed questions to the process owners on what they were doing and the rationale behind it and challenged them to find ways to improve the process.The process owners took the lead in defining the process and collected data to measure analyze and identify bottlenecks and suggest solutions. Each process was broken down and analyzed from the beginning of the process for example from the time of patient accession in the Outpatient/Inpatient departments or of blood sample collection in the Pathology department. It was found that several tasks in most of the processes were being held up because something else had to be taken care of before they could be addressed. The staff had to record the delays that were occurring in the various processes along with the reasons for them. The data included information on the time taken for admission discharge waiting for appointments and getting test results; workloads; staffing; hygiene; and meals. The core team then had discussions with various stakeholders process owners and department heads in an effort to frame the FOS agenda.For instance Vaidya had initial discussions with the departmental heads of Laboratory (Lab) OT Wards and Emergency. Dr. Anita Sharma the head of Lab saidDr. Vaidya asked me “How do you measure your performance and the departmental performance? The head of the hospital may have P&L [profit and loss] as a possible performance measure; but how does a department like Lab assess itself?” The question made me reflective. Let us say that the Lab performance measures are: turnaround time by which you give reports to patients; accuracy of the reports; and equipment utilization. The next question was what behaviours or processes are needed to achieve these performance measures. Again these could be identified through reflection. For Lab the processes may include: calibrating the equipment every day; receiving samples; running the samples; doing the reports; vetting the reports; delivering them; and patients collecting the report. For each one of these processes there is a separate one for inpatients and a separate one for outpatients. In short there were ten-odd processes. [The] next question was “How do these processes happen today?” After all we were functioning reasonably well. Thus we define the processes; then we think about how to improve the processes. Once we improve the processes then we’ll have to convince others as to why the improved process is better. Actually we would already have involved the others in [the] idea generation stage itself and so the buy-in would have been partly achieved by that stage. In a nutshell that’s how we went about creating SOPs.As Vaidya put it McKinsey had access to processes followed in the best of the hospitals across the globe. But if we had sat and written processes for them the exercise would have totally failed. We would have written 100 SOPs. They would have just sat on the shelf and collected dust. If the process comes externally and people are told “do this” it will fail. What created huge enthusiasm and success was the strong feeling of ownership.The approach was based on a few fundamentals. First everything has to be focused on performance management measurement and analysis. Second ten-odd processes had to be the backbone for each department and the starting point would be “what you do today.” Then we borrowed from “lean” and “six sigma” thinking—we applied [the] DMAIC [define measure analyze improve and control] framework: “Define” involves laying down what you do today. Then you “measure” and “analyze.” This will help you understand the process and come up with “improvement” ideas. While McKinsey played a facilitative role the primary role was that of people directly involved with the tasks. Finally in terms of “control” the idea was to measure and monitor on a regular basis and report to your boss. The boss will report to the unit head; and the unit head reports to [the] CEO [chief executive officer].Staff members were trained in the DMAIC methodology and they used it to implement FOS (see Exhibit 4). In the spirit of the “haretoise” certain departments such as Lab ran far ahead of the rest. Within six weeks of the initiation of the exercise there were dramatic improvements in certain areas. For instance the waiting time for patients for sample collection decreased from 35 minutes to 5 minutes. The reporting time decreased from 210 minutes to 45 minutes. Without adding more machines or increasing staff how did such changes happen so soon? As Ashish pointed out Earlier the equipment calibration used to happen every morning. As the day shift starts at 8:00 a.m. calibration was done between 8:00 and 8:45 a.m. The sample processing could start only at 8:45 a.m. But the peak time for sample collection for inpatients was 6:30 a.m. and the peak time for [the] OPD was 9:00 a.m. The OPD samples could not be started before 10:30 a.m. When the concerned people measured analyzed and thought of improvement ideas they quickly realized that the equipment calibration should be the last job of the night shift rather than the first job of the day shift. This single change put an end to the mad morning rush and frayed tempers. Earlier when the doctors took ward rounds at 9:30 a.m. they had no reports. Now the reports were there so [the] discharge of patients got streamlined and the length of stay started to come down. Even the OPD patients left the hospital earlier and happier with their reports.When a team looked at the discharge process it realized that the improvement ideas were constrained by the fact that the shift nurse was just too busy to focus on this process. Then as a small digression the team looked at what kept the shift nurse so busy. When the shift nurse’s routines were mapped it was found that the nurse spent 40 per cent of the time filling in registers—and there were 23 registers to be filled in. Three nurses were co-opted to apply DMAIC to the registers to examine the data entered in them. The exercise brought down the number of registers from 23 to three and freed up significant spare time for the nurses.Since the teams were measuring and documenting everything news of the rapid performance improvements spread across the organization. People started turning up at meetings participating enthusiastically and volunteering to take up process improvements. The process documentation exercise was no longer a mundane chore to be performed—DMAIC had become part of the vocabulary. Several processes were re-engineered such as cutting out a process/doing some things in a different order; and resources and tasks were re-allocated and re-prioritized to remove wastage from the system. Frequent reviews of various processes took place within the departments. Process owners were designated the change agents to convince their colleagues to follow the new process to improve scores.After many interactions the FOS scorecard was framed. The scorecard was a comprehensive document that captured 12 assets. Each asset had seven to eight parameters to be monitored so the scorecard initially had 130 items across various functions. As it was difficult to measure and review 130 items every week an extract of the scorecard called the report card was framed. The report card which had 30 items from the scorecard became the metric. The scorecard and report card were continuously reviewed and both underwent many changes before being finalized (see Exhibit 5). The score reflected the ability to anticipate bottlenecks in various processes and helped in making the processes more efficient; thus it had a major impact on patient satisfaction. Every department created process manuals for their department.Benchmarks were set for each parameter. For example the admission process should take “X” minutes and the discharge process should take “Y” minutes the waiting time before meeting the doctor should not be more than “Z” minutes and the final bill and the estimate bill should not vary by more than “X” per cent. The benchmarks were based on whatever was actually happening. The aim was to keep improving the values by removing the bottlenecks. McKinsey remained in the background and facilitated the finding of solutions.Since the core team members had been moved to this assignment full-time they initially wondered if the move would derail their careers. As young internal change agents they were required to influence without much authority. Of course they were strongly backed by the top leaders; still influencing senior physicians who were experts in their own areas was a big challenge. The core team members received special and intensive training from McKinsey. They worked at the Mohali hospital from Monday to Thursday and every Friday they moved to Delhi for reviewing and debriefing the change experience. They received training and coaching on influence tactics and on developing communication personality and Excel skills. These off-site interactions were also used to help the core team members understand the dilemmas and challenges they faced and to hone their leadership skills.MEASUREMENT AND REVIEWThe workflows in the hospital health care system were highly complex and involved many people so any short-sightedness could result in inefficiencies and scope for error. The workflows had to be consistently measured and reviewed. The steering committee set the overall direction was accountable for the overall program results and monitored progress against milestones (see Exhibit 6). The measurement and review process was a cascade of three levels. There were 12 assets and each process owner measured five to six parameters in their asset and reviewed these daily with their team. Out of these parameters only three were reported weekly to the FD. Therefore 36 parameters (12 assets × 3 parameters) were amalgamated as a scorecard which was presented by the FD at the steering committee meeting every month. Reviewing the scorecard made it easy for top management to deep dive and identify any pain points in the hospital processes. So every asset was reviewed by the FD at least once a week and Daljit—being the corporate champion—reviewed progress every Friday with the core team and the whole process once a month.After implementation of FOS in September 2007 an FOS audit was done to check the authenticity of the data. Carrying out an audit was institutionalized quarterly and through it patient satisfaction scores were analyzed; this ensured that all of the effort that had been put into the change was reflected in the patient satisfaction score and that ultimately the patient felt the difference.COMMUNICATIONThe steering committee meeting was conducted once a month at Mohali and was different from any conventional board meeting. The members spent only 30 minutes in the boardroom and three hours walking around the hospital. The meeting in the boardroom included a three-minute video in which different people talked about their experience with the change initiative and a PowerPoint presentation which displayed the scorecard metrics. A printout of the metrics was provided to all members who were then divided into two teams for a tour of the hospital so they could see for themselves the improvements and pain points. This also gave top management an opportunity to interact with the staff in the spirit of “seeing is believing.” Ashish said that the impact of this design had positive outcomes all around. He stated “When the top leaders walked around and talked to people it gave them far greater confidence than any number on any chart displayed in the boardroom. For the employees it was an opportunity to show and tell directly to top leaders.”Quick wins were celebrated and people were appreciated for any small progress. A pat on the back appreciation letters movie tickets or cake sent to a specific department generated excitement among staff. Appreciation letters from patients were also forwarded to staff. In addition an FOS newsletter was introduced that recognized the contribution of different people. This publication was circulated across all Fortis hospitals.By August 2007 FOS had made a significant impact in making various processes more efficient. To understand and recognize the impact a video was made in which key doctors talked about how they felt about the change experience. These videos were shown across the organization. During this time tours to Mohali were conducted for clinicians and staff from other hospitals to see for themselves the impact of FOS and to interact with the people involved. These interactions created a huge buy-in for the initiative resulting in other Fortis hospitals clamouring for FOS implementation.MAINTAINING EXCITEMENTThe FOS outcomes were evident and generated much excitement. The process at Fortis Mohali became very efficient and standardized. Ashish saidWith the high patient footfall at Mohali we had been struggling with the existing infrastructure and had put up the requirement of two more OTs to the management. When FOS was initiated McKinsey told me to wait for the FOS outcomes. Sure enough processes became so efficient that we did not need those additional OTs. Another example was cutting throughput time. For an operation at 2:00 p.m. normally the patient was admitted one day prior and various pre-operative tests were done. Now we are admitting the patient on the day of operation and tests are conducted in the OPD leading to [an] increase in the availability of beds.Remarkable results were seen within a period of three to four months. The average length of stay in the hospital in Mohali decreased from four and a half days to less than three and a half days which meant that FOS had enabled the creation of 25 per cent excess capacity by simply improving the various processes. The percentage of discharges before 11:00 a.m. improved from 14 per cent to 71 per cent (see Exhibit 7). Ambulances left in seven to 10 minutes whereas earlier they had taken 20 minutes to leave the hospital (see Exhibit 8). The percentage of patients waiting beyond 15 minutes for an appointment reduced from 32 per cent to 15 per cent (see Exhibit 9). The average billing time reduced from 13 minutes to seven minutes (see Exhibit 10).NEXT CHALLENGE: SCALING UP FOS With FOS successfully implemented at Mohali the agenda for Daljit was to ensure its effective rollout in two more hospitals in Wave 2 and thereafter in the remaining hospitals in the Wave 3. The plan was for two core team members to continue to institutionalize the change at Mohali and for the remaining members of the core team to move to other hospitals to initiate change. New members would be recruited from the respective hospitals to join the core team; this was also expected to help groom them for future leadership positions.As Daljit reflected on the presentation he had to make to the board the following week on the FOS rollout plan certain specific issues crossed his mind. The first challenge would be to ensure the consolidation of changes and the sustenance of gains already achieved; there would be a sharp drop in the energizing presence of top management and external consultants at Mohali but there should be no slippage in the commitment of the hospital team to strengthen FOS. Second with the Mohali staff creating all the SOPs pertaining to hospital operatio",,,,,
s it had taken six months to complete the entire change process. But now with a blueprint available it was expected that FOS would be implemented within the following two months in two more hospitals. Would a ready-made plan be able to generate the same level of excitement and enthusiasm in the subsequent hospitals? Another nagging question was whether FOS would receive the same level of open acceptance in the acquired hospitals. How should interventions be modified to implement FOS in small-town hospitals that did not have the same quality of talent to kick-start the process? Finally McKinsey had played a significant role as a change partner at Mohali; going forward it would have a far diminished role in the Wave 2 and none at all in Wave 3. It would therefore be necessary to negate or minimize the impact of this major gap. The internal team would need to be fully prepared to step up to this challenge. Daljit opened his notepad to a fresh page to start drawing up plans for scaling up FOS.EXHIBIT 1: FUTURE GROWTH PLANS AS Of MARCH 2007Note: *Fortis Mohali Noida Amritsar; **La femme Escorts Heart Escorts Faridabad Escorts Raipur Escorts Amritsar Escorts Jaipur; ***Jeevan Mala Jessa Ram.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 2: FOrtis operating system OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC DELIVERABLESObjectives:To ensure uniform high quality of customer-facing processes across Fortis hospitalsTo embed best practices in operational efficiency to yield bottom-line impactTo facilitate performance management across all sites through use of a standardized cascade (scorecards at different levels) of metrics tools and templatesTo build the next generation of leaders in the Fortis systemSpecific Deliverables:A methodology for the management of hospital capacity (operation theatres emergency rooms intensive care units etc.) Well-defined standard operating procedures for key patient-related processes including driving service excellence Efficient management of facility services like pharmacy food and beverage housekeeping etc.Criteria for staffing levels across departments A performance management system with a cascading scorecardManagers trained in the “continuous improvement methodology”Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 3: PROCESSES AT FORTIS FROM FOS PERSPECTIVENote: OT =operation theatre; ER = emergency room; OPD = outpatient department; ICUs = intensive care units.Source: Company files.EXHIBIT 4: DMAIC FOR IMPLEMENTING FOSSource: Company files.EXHIBIT 5: OVERALL PERFORMANCE REPORT CARD 2009Note: OPD = outpatient department; PHC = primary health care; ER = emergency room; IPD = inpatient department; OT = operation theatre; Lab Med = laboratory medicine; Cath Lab = catheterization laboratory; ICUs = intensive care units; mins = minutes; USG = urine specific gravity.

He walked into cork manufacturer Antonio Amorim’s foyer and declared “The new Australian problem is terroir.” Amorim asked him to go outside and come back in: “Could you please go outside and come back in? I want to pinch myself so when you come back in I know it’s real.”For the past 14 years Antonio Amorim had run Corticeira Amorim S.G.P.S. S.A. (Amorim) the world’s largest cork manufacturing company. For him Australia had been generally hostile territory because it was home to more cork critics than enthusiasts. Australian winemakers had for years pointed to cork as the source of their problems and had mostly abandoned cork in favour of screw caps. A shift in their focus to terroir the industry’s term for the way in which soil and climate factors interact with certain grape species would be groundbreaking. It was a great day for Antonio.Instances like this—small but significant indications of the cork industry’s resurgence—had become more commonplace in the period from 2010 to 2015. This trend was not accidental but rather the result of intense industry-wide efforts to solve natural cork’s problems specifically “cork taint.” Cork taint had become such a problem by the end of the 20th century that droves of vineyards around the world opted for alternative stoppers such as synthetic cork and metal screw caps. Amorim responded with new strategies research initiatives and marketing campaigns. After a decade or more it looked like these investments were paying off.A positive future for the industry seemed attainable and Antonio was particularly focused on three questions. First how could his company continue to improve cork? Second how could the industry do a better job of communicating the product’s remarkable attributes and environmental benefits? Finally how could Amorim work with farmers to grow the long-term cork supply enabling future growth? Amorim’s employees had trouble containing the enthusiasm that made it clear they were ready to tackle these challenges. There was a pervasive sense of both excitement and gravity in this group of about 3000 colleagues who understood that the future of a 1000-year-old industry rested in their hands.CORK AT A CROSSROADSNatural cork had enjoyed a near-monopoly in the wine stopper market for over 300 years. This situation brought profits and stability but it had also allowed the cork industry to ignore big problems that were alienating its customers. Chief among these problems was the complex enigmatic and growing issue of cork taint which was thought to have ruined up to 7 per cent of all wine produced in certain years (although misinformation had been so prevalent in this highly contentious industry battle that it was hard to know for sure). Cork taint occurred when chemicals used in processing interacted with a natural fungus in the cork to produce trichloroanisole (TCA) a chemical compound that left an overwhelming musty smell and taste in affected wines. By 2000 cork’s reputation was so tarnished that innovators saw an opportunity to develop cork alternatives such as plastic stoppers and screw caps and large numbers of vineyards eagerly embraced these. The share of wine bottles capped with cork dropped from 95 per cent in the late 1990s to 60–70 per cent by 2013.Since 2000 the cork industry had made enormous progress in solving cork taint. Amorim had led the charge investing hundreds of millions of euros in research and development new equipment and vertical integration initiatives that were all geared toward securing a long-term future for the industry. These strategies had worked so well that by 2015 many industry insiders felt the problem could soon be a thing of the past.However the cork industry’s challenges were far from over. Winemakers had long memories and many remained unconvinced that returning to cork was a safe choice. Because fine wines may sit in a bottle for over a decade some of the best wine bought and consumed in 2015 still suffered from problems the cork industry had faced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. How could the cork industry shift consumer perceptions when problems from past decades still lingered in the marketplace? Meanwhile many customers had become accustomed to screw caps and synthetics. Was this a permanent preference or merely a temporary trend?Finally in light of the upheaval this industry had faced cork manufacturers worried about whether Mediterranean landowners would continue to plant new cork trees or devote land to less sustainable trees that promised quicker profits. How could a company like Amorim convince growers that natural cork would always have a place on top of the wine bottle given all the recent turmoil?As the industry’s leader Amorim faced all of the above challenges and more. Its leaders knew that if they did not finance the majority of the marketing research and development product innovation and sustainable forestry practices nobody else would. They also knew it would take years for smaller cork companies to implement many of the expensive quality-control measures Amorim pioneered. In the meantime any low-quality cork produced by smaller companies would reflect poorly on the whole industry.PRODUCING CORKCork was the bark of the Quercus suber tree more commonly known as the cork oak. Indigenous to the Western Mediterranean Basin cork had historically been grown commercially in seven countries: Portugal Spain France Italy Morocco Algeria and Tunisia. By the early 21st century 80 per cent of all cork was harvested from the Iberian Peninsula (50 per cent from Portugal and 30 per cent from Spain). Each tree could live on average between 150 and 200 years.Cork oaks had a unique molecular structure that allowed them to regrow their bark. For hundreds of years specially trained workers harvested cork each summer using an axe to remove the outer layers of bark without harming the tree. The cork was typically harvested first when the tree was 25 years old and then roughly every nine summers thereafter. However the industry did not consider cork moist enough to be suitable for wine stoppers until the third harvest when the tree was 43 years old. This protracted timeline meant cork forests were profitable only as long-term investments.By 2015 global cork manufacturing had evolved to follow a specific process: After the harvest manufacturing companies bought raw cork strips from growers or intermediaries. These companies negotiated prices each year based on demand and harvest quality. After curing and boiling the raw cork manufacturers used it to produce a variety of products ranging from construction materials to surfboards. Wine stoppers however generated the largest share of revenue throughout the industry. According to Antonio “There is no other product in cork today that adds as much value as cork stoppers. If I don’t have the cork stopper I cannot pay as much to the cork grower. If I cannot pay as much to the cork grower the guy is going to be planting something else.”Amorim sent its highest-quality bark (thick bark with small pores and just the right moisture level) to workers operating cork-punching machines with their hands and feet. These employees worked eight-hour shifts and punched an average of 14000 stoppers per day. The rest of the stopper-quality bark went to robots which used sensors to orient the bark correctly and punch corks perpendicular to the grain. Robots operated 24 hours per day and punched an average of 105000 stoppers in that time. Yet unlike humans robots could not use judgment to punch around flaws. The cork-punching processes used about 20 per cent of the raw cork and the rest was ground into granules that would be compressed into technical corks also known as composite corks. Most cork stoppers sold by 2015 were made from these compressed cork granules. Amorim sent on the leftover materials from this process to be used as biofuel or products unrelated to wine.Cork manufacturers then sold these corks to winemakers around the world who mostly bottled their product in house. A company like Amorim maintained relationships with large and small vineyards from New Zealand to California.WHAT WAS AT STAKEWhile it was illegal to cut down cork trees in Portugal other cork-producing countries did not have such rigid protections. Eucalyptus used in paper manufacturing promised a much shorter payback period than cork. However non-native alternatives degraded the soil over time and did not support the same biodiversity that cork oaks did. Cork oak forests were critical to the Western Mediterranean ecosystem in 2015. They formed habitat for hundreds of other species of plants and animals including endangered species such as the Bonelli’s eagle Spanish imperial eagle Iberian lynx and Barbary deer. Finding ways to maintain demand for natural cork had direct implications for the preservation of cork oak forests and the ecosystems they supported.Cork’s ecological benefits were not confined to the Mediterranean region as forests were carbon sinks. According to the Cork Quality Council each cork stopper represented about 113.5 grams of carbon offsets. By comparison alternative closures were typically made of petroleum-based products or metals which were not biodegradable and were much more energy intensive to manufacture. A 2008 PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that the lifecycle carbon emissions associated with producing and transporting plastic closures were about 10 times those of natural cork and the carbon emissions associated with screw caps were about 24 times those of natural cork. According to Amorim using a cork instead of an alternative closure reduced a wine bottle’s carbon footprint by 18–40 per cent.Amorim’s manufacturing facilities were particularly environmentally friendly thanks to the company’s use of biomass in boilers and in a cogeneration plant; started in the 1980s this was one of the first biomass cogeneration units installed in Portugal. All cork powder and dust not used for retail products was used to produce energy. According to Paulo Bessa Amorim’s director of corporate sustainability the use of biomass satisfied 60 per cent of Amorim’s energy needs.The cork industry was also an important source of middle-class jobs in the economically struggling Iberian Peninsula. In 2015 Spain and Portugal had two of the five highest unemployment rates of all European Union countries. According to Amorim cork harvesting was the highest paid agricultural job in Europe. About 10000 skilled workers depended on income from the annual cork harvest. In addition the cork manufacturing industry employed nearly 12000 workers in the Iberian Peninsula. Finally 90 per cent of the cork produced in this region was exported; economists generally agreed that export industries improved a nation’s balance of trade and created important multiplier effects throughout the economy.A BROKEN MONOPOLYWhile the cork industry was enjoying its centuries-old monopoly on top of the wine bottle winemakers were slowly accumulating a list of grievances against natural cork. By 2000 the international community of winemakers was overwhelmed with horror stories about large quantities of wine lost to bad cork—probably somewhere between 5 and 9 per cent by the turn of the century. The issue had devastating effects on both profits and reputations.Carlos de Jesus Amorim’s marketing director readily admitted that the cork industry was slow to respond. For years the most common approach among cork manufacturers had been either to deny that TCA was a big problem or to blame the problems on competitors. Because of the third-party cork distributors it was very difficult for anyone to be sure about the origins of a certain bad batch. Of course Amorim and the other cork companies eventually realized that this squabbling over whose cork was worst only served to erode the reputation of cork in general. The cork industry had lost control of its product’s narrative. Frustrated with the industry’s reluctance to take TCA seriously winemakers began looking for viable alternatives. A number of options existed including boxed wine and glass stoppers. The two main alternative closures to emerge were metal screw caps and synthetic corks made of plastic. However each presented its own set of problems.A French company had developed a basic wine screw cap called the Stelvin cap in the 1970s. Some winemakers were initially attracted to the concept because in addition to solving the TCA problem screw caps negated the need for corkscrews. They also made long-term storage easier for retailers and consumers. Wine bottles with natural corks were ideally stored horizontally in order to keep the cork moist thus preserving a perfect seal but bottles with screw caps could be stored vertically.As of the early 2000s however screw caps had failed to catch on as a popular wine closure. Shipping was a big concern. A slight nick at the top of the bottle could break the whole seal. Moreover screw caps required winemakers to make a significant up-front investment in the form of new bottling machines—a major risk for a product that winemakers were not sure the public would buy. Winemakers also needed new more uniformly shaped bottles with ridges for the caps. Because cork was forgiving bottles destined for cork stoppers did not require tight manufacturing tolerances. Contrastingly screw caps required precision which required collaboration with the bottle manufacturers. Finally winemakers had no information on how their wine would perform under screw caps in the long term—whether contact with the new type of seal would negatively affect the wine’s taste and whether the wine would age better or worse than with a natural cork. In fact winemakers soon found that the completely airtight seal created by screw caps could cause a process called reduction whereby an aging wine developed sulphuric flavours. Learning about and mitigating some of these long-term taste concerns involved years of trial and error. Even by 2015 screw caps were generally used only for wines intended for consumption within a year of bottling.Possibly the largest hurdle for screw caps was their association with cheap wine. In the 1970s some Australian vineyards had partnered with airlines to introduce screw caps as a convenience for travellers. They made the mistake of doing so only in the economy section while continuing to use corks for wine served in business and first class. When it came time to take the technology mainstream Australians rejected it stating that screw caps made them feel they were drinking cheap wine.The main problem with synthetic corks at least initially was that they did not exist. Entrepreneurs realized that such a product would be a major success and began developing prototypes as early as 1990 but the path to a viable synthetic cork was long and riddled with spoiled wine. Eventually two functional synthetics emerged: Cellucork manufactured by a British company and Supreme Corq made by a company based in Seattle Washington. Both closures were somewhat more rigid than the spongy synthetics available by 2015 and both had oxidation problems (that is they did not always form a complete seal). Consumers also had a lot of trouble getting synthetic corks out of wine bottles. As with screw caps vineyards were concerned about customers’ perceptions of quality as well as the unknown variables of taste and long-term performance. Some were still frustrated enough to entertain alternatives.Australians were the most willing to abandon cork. Their comparatively young wine industry had only begun to flourish after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 caused concerns about fallout in vineyards across Europe and European grocery stores scrambling to keep shelves stocked turned to Australia. The Australians did not have the centuries-old commitment to cork that many European and South American vineyards had. They also suspected that cork producers were keeping higher-quality cork for their friends in Europe and dumping the problematic cork in Australia and New Zealand. This claim was difficult to substantiate but the rumour certainly contributed to Australia’s dissatisfaction with natural cork.In 1995 Southcorp which at the time produced 20 per cent of Australia’s wine under brands such as Penfolds Wines and Lindeman’s Pty. Ltd. was the first large export-oriented winemaker to begin transitioning to Supreme Corq. Yet it was screw caps that eventually seized the Australian market. In 2000 the number of Australian wine bottles topped with screw caps was about 300000. By 2007 this figure had grown over 50000 per cent to 160 million bottles (120 million litres). By 2011 about 70 per cent of Australian wine and 90 per cent of New Zealand wine was sealed with a screw cap. These were not just cheap wines either; some vineyards topped their most cherished US$180 vintages with screw caps. Although the percentage of Australian winemakers who continued to use natural cork for all or some of their product line was much greater than 30 per cent a relatively small group of vineyards produced the majority of wine in nations like Australia and the United States. Thus decisions made by export-oriented vineyards had an outsized impact on the overall percentage of bottles capped by alternative closures. This wine mostly retailed for under $15 per bottle and was usually consumed within 48 hours of purchase.Meanwhile the use of synthetic cork surged in the United States and by 2015 about half of all U.S. wine was topped with synthetic cork. Cork’s global market share dropped to somewhere around 65 per cent of wine bottles by 2013. (Studies tended to report contradictory information because in reality no one knew the exact number.) This represented a market-share erosion of about one-third since 2000. The long monopoly had ended and it was uncertain which material would dominate the wine closure market in the future.AMORIM’S QUEST FOR SOLUTIONSRelative António Alves Amorim founded a small cork company in 1870 then opened a new shop when he realized his business partner had been cheating him out of profits for years. He founded Amorim & Irmãos Lda. in 1922. At the time the cork industry was fragmented both horizontally and vertically. Portuguese cork manufacturing took place in small family-operated shops while most of the country’s raw cork was exported to France and Spain for production. Central components of Amorim’s strategy during the 20th century included consolidating both raw-material processing and cork manufacturing within Portugal and eventually selling directly to vineyards. Joana Mesquita in the company’s public relations department described the situation before Amorim’s third generation of management decided to forge direct customer relationships:We were selling to somebody who would sell to somebody who would sell to somebody and the cork would then arrive in the [United States]. We had no contact with the winemaker. If the middleman would mix Amorim corks with a ton of other suppliers we wouldn’t know. A lot of the Portuguese companies today are still in that stage of getting out of Portugal and we’re farther away—we did that 30 to 40 years ago.As a result of its consolidated production processes and direct customer relationships Amorim became the industry leader. The company went public on the Lisbon Stock Exchange in 1988. By the time Antonio Amorim became chief executive officer in 2001 the company was producing 2 billion corks per year which represented about one-quarter of the world’s cork wine stoppers at the time. Antonio had taken the reins during a difficult time for cork. Before the company could even determine the best way to go about saving cork’s future it needed to make an even more fundamental decision. In Antonio’s words “The most important decision that we made was to stay in cork. We could have sold ourselves out to plastics or screw caps. We said ‘No. We are a cork company we exist to add value to cork in whatever form or shape. That’s what we believe in. And we think we can do better than what we have done so far.’”The company’s strategy had many components. First it needed to become the world leader in TCA knowledge. Tired of receiving rejected cork shipments from customers Amorim bought all the testing equipment its customers were using and more. The company also started a TCA research lab where about seven chemists studied the causes of and remedies for TCA; the price tag for all of this was hundreds of millions of euros but Amorim saw it as necessary to save the company.Second Amorim vertically integrated as a strategy for controlling quality. It opened a raw materials company to buy directly from cork farmers and was buying 95 per cent of its cork through its own channels by 2006—up from 25 per cent 15 years earlier. This allowed the company to build an extensive database for tracing quality problems back to specific farmers. Long-term relationships with growers also allowed Amorim to encourage sustainable forestry practices which benefited the ecosystem and helped eradicate TCA at the source. Although few customers demanded it Amorim began paying more for cork that met sustainable forestry certifications.Third Amorim diversified its products. It invested in research and development to develop new more competitive closures which resulted in a range of technical corks with various cost-saving and performance-enhancing attributes. In 2015 these stoppers sold for as little as €0.02 each. In an initiative designed to steal the advantage of convenience from screw caps Amorim partnered with a bottle manufacturing firm to develop a twist-out cork called the Helix. The company also diversified to include products outside the wine industry; although minuscule in volume compared to its wine stopper business its beer-stopper business grew. Amorim also rolled out new products in three other business units: floor and wall coverings insulation and high-tech composite cork products (see Exhibit 1).Finally Amorim sought industry-wide solutions. The firm worked with the European Cork Confederation to raise standards over time and it worked with the Portuguese Cork Association to launch a marketing campaign called “100% Cork.” In 2014 in the cork industry’s first effort to market directly to wine consumers 100% Cork bought Facebook ads and radio ads in Northern California.These efforts were successful. By 2015 evidence indicated that less than 1 per cent of the finished corks leaving Amorim had detectable amounts of TCA. The figure for the rest of the cork industry was not very far behind Amorim. While it was not clear whether cork was gaining territory back from alternative closures it no longer appeared to be losing ground.AMORIM’S POSITION WITHIN THE CORK INDUSTRYThe Portuguese countryside was still dotted with between 300 and 400 smaller cork companies. While most of these firms followed quality standards similar to Amorim’s dozens did not. These renegade companies produced up to 10 per cent of Portuguese cork and they posed a big challenge for those attempting to eradicate TCA entirely and solve the problems with cork’s worldwide reputation. At the same time cork’s disastrous decade had created opportunities for Amorim. Many smaller cork companies either went out of business or lost customers and Amorim was there to pick up the slack. As Antonio explained “Today we are selling 4 billion cork stoppers worldwide annually. When cork had 90 to 100 per cent of the market share we were selling 2 billion.”From 2005 to 2015 the company’s revenue had grown steadily at an average annual rate of 2.7 per cent: it had increased from €429 million in 2004 to €560 million in 2014. Perhaps counterintuitively a greater percentage of Amorim’s sales and profits in 2014 came from its wine stopper business than they had a decade earlier. The share of total sales attributable to stoppers rose from 53.9 per cent in 2004 to 63.1 per cent in 2014. Further the company’s cork stoppers business unit was the main customer of its raw materials business unit which meant the raw materials unit was also essentially in the wine business. The combined earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of these two business units was 74.2 per cent of Amorim’s total EBITDA in 2014.Amorim’s largest competitor was a French company named Oeneo founded by a Spanish individual who fled to France during the Spanish Civil War. Oeneo’s 2014 revenue was €190 million although about half of this revenue came from making wine barrels. Oeneo’s production capacity was about 1.3 billion closures per year.THE FUTURE OF CORKWhen Antonio took over management of his family’s company in 2001 he knew that Amorim would either need to make big changes or face extinction in 15 years. Now that the company had secured a safe and profitable niche for the time being its managers began looking to the next 30 to 50 years. They had made a commitment to stay in cork but what type of cork products would they pursue? Was remaining dependent upon stoppers too risky a strategy for Amorim? Was there a way to diversify away from stoppers without giving up profits and spreading the company’s competencies too thinly?If Amorim committed fully to the battle against alternative stoppers what should be the basis of its competitive positioning? When surveyed many winemakers cited the low cost of synthetics and screw caps among the primary reasons for choosing those closures over cork (see Exhibit 2). This observation put pressure on the cork industry to lower its prices. If Amorim engaged in a cost-cutting race to the bottom however would it risk repeating the folly of the first-generation screw caps in the 1970s? The company preferred to condition its customers to pay more for cork. Antonio who sometimes used soccer metaphors to explain the battles within his industry articulated the challenge his company faced in trying to sell cork for its full value:We have analysis on the product lifecycle of cork compared to plastics compared to screw caps. We beat them eight [to] nil. And then we have to go to a customer to the market and justify why cork is 1 cent more expensive than the plastic. In many other products such superior performance would yield a much higher premium than 1 or 2 per cent.Was price-based competition necessary to arrest the rise of alternatives or would it come back to haunt Amorim’s margins in the future?Antonio had an even bigger concern than alternative stoppers when thinking toward the future: how long would the company be able to keep growing? Amorim could potentially expand in two directions but both involved big challenges. Ideally it would like to grow the number of cork stoppers being used worldwide. Unfortunately neither wine production nor consumption had seen any real growth in the last decade (see Exhibit 3). In fact revenue among winemakers had declined at an average annual rate of 3.1 per cent from 2010 to 2015 as other types of alcohol grew in popularity and winemakers struggled to resolve industry-wide oversupply issues. Unless these trends reversed growing global demand for cork stoppers would likely necessitate winning back market share from screw caps and synthetics. Doing this would mean increasing the total supply of cork which in turn involved convincing landowners to plant more cork trees. The myth of a global cork shortage had been a strangely effective marketing tool used by the alternative stopper industries but until then it had remained a myth. If cork was able to start growing its market share again the future might be different. How could Amorim convince landowners to plant more trees that would not yield wine-grade cork for 43 years when cork had lost one-third of its market share in the last 15 years?Should Amorim pursue further vertical integration buying cork forests to try to better align supply with long-term demand projections? Buying up half the Portuguese countryside would be expensive and another push for vertical integration might spread Amorim too thin taking the company outside of its core competencies and forcing it to internalize the risk of future oversupply.Alternatively Amorim could grow at the expense of other cork companies. While this strategy may negate the need to plant more cork trees it would bring other challenges. Would Amorim need to cut prices to undermine its competitors? Would there be a way to ramp up production without driving up the price of raw cork? Would intense competition against other cork companies risk undermining all the goodwill and cooperation on marketing and quality initiatives—efforts that Amorim saw as critical to improving cork’s global image?Finally if Amorim were able to resolve all of these challenges and achieve consistent growth into future decades what should its geographic strategy look like? Wine production was strongly clustered in 20 countries which produced over 93 per cent of all wine in 2011. However these countries were spread throughout the world; the top nine wine-producing countries in 2011 were spread over six continents (see Exhibit 4). Should Amorim focus on all regions equally or should it focus its growth in certain regions? Should it focus on hostile areas like Australia and New Zealand traditional European strongholds growth markets like China and the United States or in-between areas like South Africa and South America?exhibit 1: amorim’s EBITDA contribution by business unit (€ thousands)Note: €1=US$1.38 on March 31 2014.

Roberta Scott head of Vancouver Coastal Health AuthorityOn March 17 2020 provincial health officer Bonnie Henry declared a public health emergency in British Columbia (BC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic spreading worldwide including throughout Canada. This decision regulated non-essential work and travel within the province to curb the inevitable spread of COVID-19 among the public.On the local level the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA) reported its first case on January 28 2020 and had to adapt quickly. Cases increased in February and March and by April 7 the VCHA was once again in the process of restructuring its COVID-19 response strategy to accommodate the growth in cases and to address the obstacles that followed. At both the provincial and federal levels there was a shortage of testing swabs and personal protective equipment (PPE) in turn affecting the efficacy of the VCHA’s response. Limitations on testing capacity exacerbated this problem; the VCHA was completing approximately 3000 tests per day even though facilities were designed to complete over 5000 tests per day.Sitting at her office in the VCHA headquarters Roberta Scott head of the VCHA wondered how she could better position the VCHA to combat COVID-19 in the long term while securing enough supplies. As Scott was concerned that COVID-19 cases would continue to surge she knew this strategy had to be effective and time-sensitive.Coronaviruses COVID-19 and the Global ResponseCoronaviruses were a family of viruses that affected the respiratory systems of both animals and humans with symptoms parallel to those of a common cold. If severe the virus responsible for COVID-19 could cause pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome influenza kidney failure and even death.COVID-19 was a strain of coronavirus that was widely unfamiliar to expert scientists. The first case appeared on November 17 2019 in Wuhan China. Virus transmission was presumed to be airborne meaning that individuals could spread the virus through breathing and talking at close range. The virus via salivary droplets could remain on specific surfaces and could also be transmitted once picked up. The virus could be absorbed through the eyes nose and mouth.Patients demonstrated symptoms in two forms: symptomatic and asymptomatic. With symptomatic patients individuals and health care professionals could detect COVID-19 through the symptoms alone. Asymptomatic individuals were mostly unaware that they were infected unless they were tested. As a result asymptomatic individuals were more likely to spread the virus.As information on the virus was limited there was no confirmed vaccine to prevent transmission. At the time a combination of existing medications was used to treat COVID-19 patients who were experiencing symptoms with some success. However social distancing and self-isolation mandates had proven to be even more effective. The World Health Organization (WHO) had advised everyone to remain one metre apart to wear masks when out in public to avoid non-essential travel and to self-isolate when symptoms occurred.Although the virus made its first appearance in China it quickly spread across the globe. Countries including the United Kingdom Spain Italy and the United States were infected more severely exacerbating already existing public health concerns. As the virus continued to spread many countries developed their own strategies which often differed in terms of funding medical accessibility public policy and ultimately the means by which to flatten the curve.Canada's Health Care SystemCanada’s federal health care system was responsible for upholding the quality of care across the nation. The federal government provided equalization payments to each province and territory to help fund standardized health care infrastructure under the Canada Health Act 1984. The act covered general health care costs for approximately 36 million Canadians in Canada including general check-ups vital prescriptions and emergency surgeries.However 66 per cent of Canadian residents participated in privatized insurance plans which helped cover extensive health care costs such as non-essential prescriptions and surgeries counselling and therapy. Privatized insurance plans were most commonly offered through an employer or independently through a provider. All provinces and territories operated under this hybrid approach to ensure that the majority of Canadians had access to affordable care.The Impact of COVID-19 in CanadaCanada reported its first case of COVID-19 on January 25 2020 following the arrival of a traveller from Wuhan China. From this date on Canada’s cases grew exponentially from 587 cases on March 17 2020 to 17897 cases on April 7 2020. In addition to the health implications of COVID-19 the safety measures implemented across Canada resulted in an economic slowdown across many industries (see Exhibit 1). Industries such as retail manufacturing food and services and airlines were hit hardest from the immediate halt of non-essential businesses. Consequently Canadian unemployment rates began to plummet from 5.5 per cent in February 2020 to 7 per cent in March 2020 as businesses could not withstand massive declines in their revenue. The increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with April’s projected unemployment growth rate of 10 per cent.With high unemployment rates and business closures Canada passed a response bill to assist those who were economically impacted: Bill C-13 the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act. This bill valued at CA$765 billion provided monetary assistance to both businesses and individuals and included the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit which provided $2000 per month to Canadians who were impacted by COVID-18 but did not qualify for Employment Insurance. Most importantly this bill allocated $500 million in funding to support provinces with their health care system needs.The sustainability of these economic response programs was questionable given the uncertainty of the virus’s spread. If the virus continued to adversely affect daily living economic activity could not resume further increasing Canada’s debt pool. Therefore the role of COVID-19 testing had become integral to policy-making and public regulation. If Canada could effectively control the virus by increasing testing volume then the country would be able to keep Canadians safe and restart the economy organically. However if Canada could not increase its testing capacities it would be unable to effectively control the virus or revamp the economy.In early April experts projected that Canada’s COVID-19 case numbers would increase peaking in late April and early May (see Exhibit 2). Thereafter the number of cases was expected to decline. An inevitable second wave however was expected to occur between September and November with case counts worse than those in April.BC’s Health Care System and the Regional Health AuthoritiesBC’s health care system was unique compared to those of its provincial neighbours. The infrastructure of BC’s health care system mimicked a centralized system with the BC Ministry of Health (BC Health) overseeing the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) and five regional health authorities (RHAs): Fraser Health Authority (Fraser Health) Interior Health Authority (Interior Health) Northern Health Authority (Northern Health) Vancouver Island Health Authority (Island Health) and VCHA (see Exhibits 3 and 4). The PHSA was generally responsible for governing and helping RHAs organize and deliver services.The five RHAs founded in 2001 under the Health Authorities Act were responsible for planning and delivering all health services including hospital management long-term care acute care and public health within each respective region. Given this centralized system each RHA operated as a silo loosely administered under the BC Health mandate and in close consultation with the PHSA. The divisions within these silos were strongly interconnected tightly controlled and mostly dependent on stakeholder consultation when planning strategy.Each RHA under regulations from the PHSA was responsible for its own COVID-19 response strategy. However the number of cases and associated issues within each region varied as a consequence of differences in population and demographics. What remained congruent was the PHSA’s stance on limiting false-positive tests. A false-positive test referred to a patient being incorrectly diagnosed as having COVID-19. This testing defect could have had widespread adverse economic implications shuttering businesses and reducing trust in the health care system.The Fraser Health AuthorityFraser Health was responsible for all health operations in Fraser Canyon Burnaby Abbotsford Maple Ridge Surrey and the surrounding areas. This region subsumed three former health regions making it the largest RHA in BC with respect to population (1.8 million residents) and budget ($3.8 billion in 2019/20). The Fraser Institute operated 12 acute care hospitals with three regional hospitals: Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Centre Royal Columbian Hospital and Surrey Memorial Hospital (regional). It also operated nine community hospitals. Fraser Health had experienced a growing number of COVID-19 cases peaking on March 23 with 56 new cases. Given the region’s size it was projected that the number of cases would continue to grow and predominate in the province.The Interior Health AuthorityInterior Health provided health care for almost one million residents in the Southern Interior Okanagan and Kootenay regions of BC. With a $2.3 billion budget (2019/20) Interior Health oversaw 16 community hospitals two tertiary hospitals 22 health care centres and four regional hospitals. Interior Health had experienced steady growth in COVID-19 cases peaking on March 25 and March 31 with 17 new cases.The Northern Health AuthorityNorthern Health oversaw health care for 300000 residents within a 600000-kilometre region including the cities of Dawson Creek Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert. Northern Health was BC’s smallest region. With a budget of $0.84 million (2019/20) it encompassed 18 hospitals with the largest being the University Hospital of Northern BC. Northern Health had experienced a low but stable number of COVID-19 cases peaking on April 2 with four new cases.The Vancouver Island Health AuthorityIsland Health was responsible for 850000 residents within a 56000-kilometre region on the island. This RHA operated within a $2.8 billion budget (2019/20) and oversaw operations for 150 hospitals and health centres with the largest being the Royal Jubilee Hospital and Victoria General Hospital. Island Health had experienced a fairly stable number of COVID-19 cases peaking on March 18 and 19 with seven new cases.The VCHA and HospitalsThe VCHA oversaw all health operations in Vancouver Richmond the North Shore and surrounding areas along the Sea-to-Sky Highway Sunshine Coast and Central Coast. This region had 1.25 million residents accounting for 25 per cent of the population of the province. This entity operated under a $3.7 billion budget (2019/20) employed 14000 staff 5500 nurses 2700 physicians and 900 investigative researchers. The VCHA maintained two prominent hospitals Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and St. Paul’s Hospital (St. Paul’s) the latter of which was primarily used as a teaching hospital for the University of BC’s Faculty of Medicine. Due to its size the VCHA had the largest number of COVID-19 cases in the province with an all-time high of 43 new cases on March 25. Given its population the VCHA was projected to see a spike in cases as indicated by its proportion of the province’s positive cases since March 17 (see Exhibit 5).St. Paul’s HospitalSt. Paul’s was located in east Vancouver and operated primarily as an acute care teaching and research hospital. This hospital was the seventh-oldest within the province and was currently being transitioned to a new location due to capacity concerns. The hospital contained 400 beds and had approximately 4000 employees. St. Paul’s hosted a teaching centre with large lab facilities which were mainly used for the University of BC’s Faculty of Medicine program. As a result St. Paul’s had been the sole testing lab for all COVID-19 cases in the VCHA.For testing St. Paul’s lab received vials from collection centres within the region. The virus was individually tested using commercialized COVID-19 kits as per Health Canada regulations. Although this model had proven somewhat successful in the short term experts suggested that cases would continue to surge. It was likely that St. Paul’s would be unable to meet capacity or have sufficient supplies to combat the backlog independently.Vancouver General HospitalLocated in Vancouver VGH was Canada’s second-largest hospital. Given its size VGH was also a research and teaching institute partnered with the University of BC’s Faculty of Medicine. It had sufficient testing space. On an annual basis the hospital accommodated approximately 27000 in-patient visits and 23000 outpatient cases.VGH’s research centre had state-of-the-art testing labs which had been vacated since the virus’s first appearance in order to house over 1000 beds. To replace the commercialized COVID-19 kits for genetic extraction VGH had also been piloting in-house tests which were projected to be ready for use by April 10 2020.The COVID-19 Testing ProcessCollection and Swabbing (Collection Centres)To locate a collection site the VCHA listed seven potential collection centres across the region. These centres operated on a first-come first-served basis (see Exhibits 6 and 7).The swabbing that occurred at each collection centre involved the insertion of a long and skinny swab into the nose and mouth to test for viral cells. This process was relatively quick and was effective in gathering the necessary data. One swab was used per patient and was stored in its own vial which was filled with a preservative fluid. This fluid removed the viral cells from the swab and preserved them for later testing. Initially in March the swab supply was scarce as the VCHA could only access 5000 per day. However in April hospitals acquired alternative sources giving the VCHA access to 7000 swabs per day.At each centre five full-time employees could each test 19 patients per hour. Henry the provincial health officer argued that mass testing was an ineffective strategy to slow transmission of COVID-19 because it had a false-negative rate as high as 30 per cent in people who were infected but did not show symptoms. As a result collection centres reduced the number of tests per day and only tested individuals with symptoms. The VCHA’s collection centres experienced different demand levels and due to limited capacity and testing supplies may have had to turn down individuals looking to be tested. Therefore there was the potential for among between the test centres to improve capacity in this step.Processing and Bar-CodingCOVID-19 swabs gathered from the collection sites were transported to St. Paul’s lab for processing and bar-coding. The vials were unloaded from trucks and then stored in a cooling-regulated fridge until processing started. All specimens were to be processed in preparation for genetic extraction. Once the specimens were ready they were processed by machines at a constant rate. The lab operated 24 hours a day every day in three eight-hour shifts (with an hour break) where each shift had three full-time technicians working to individually bar-code the samples. Each technician could complete one sample in 0.4 minutes excluding transport time between the fridge and the cart. This process was carefully completed as cross-contamination due to sample mislabelling would have had adverse consequences.Genetic ExtractionAfter the samples had been bar-coded the vials were transported via cart to be genetically extracted. In this stage all liquid from the COVID-19 swab vials was extracted to isolate the ribonucleic acid (RNA). This step was largely dependent on the availability of COVID-19 kits and the chemical reagents needed to test the RNA. This stage was carried out in the same lab under the same hours. Six full-time doctors were tasked with isolating RNA from COVID-19 genetic extraction kits. These doctors generally did not work in shifts as there was a shortage of experienced doctors. Therefore each full-time doctor had a 10-hour workday with a 1.5-hour break. On average it took 0.6 minutes to complete one sample per technician.These kits included several chemical reagents that were needed for accurate extraction. Given that COVID-19 testing had exploded across the globe these tests had become increasingly unavailable. The complexity of these kits also made it difficult for BC Health to locate alternative solutions (as recommended by Health Canada) within the given time frame. BC Health had made an effort to reallocate the testing kits based on need but the demand exceeded the supply. Technicians only had access to 3000 kits per day a supply that could have decreased if the cases continued to rise in other RHAs. As a result there was a significant difference between how many tests the doctors could complete and how many tests they could complete given the supply constraint.AmplificationOnce the RNA had been extracted the samples were transferred to the amplification stage. This stage occurred in the same lab at St. Paul’s which helped concentrate the testing and its exposure to other variants. In this stage a polymerase chain reaction test was conducted to search for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strain. Once located it was then copied and amplified using a machine until it could be detected. This process required two main types of chemicals—transcriptase which was used to convert RNA to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and primers which were typically two reagents that matched the DNA with the genetic material and latched onto the virus’s RNA if applicable. The two reagents needed were provided in kits which were allocated by the PHSA. The DNA was then processed through an additional machine and run through both hot and cold temperatures to amplify the virus’s genetic material in the sample.This step operated with seven full-time technicians who completed eight-hour workdays with a one-hour break. These technicians used kits to complete this process and to ensure no cross-contamination. Each technician could load and process 1000 samples per shift. However there were only 6000 kits allocated for use per day. If more cases were required each health authority would need to send a request to the PHSA. As the VCHA was one of the largest health authorities Scott was confident in acquiring more kits.CountingFollowing the amplification step the DNA was carefully counted by a second expert to determine the cycle’s genetic material. If the material appeared over a dozen times the patient tested positive. However if the material appeared less frequently the patient was not definitively positive for COVID-19.Although this step was relatively simple each technician carefully recorded their findings to avoid false-positive results. The counting process operated almost simultaneously with the amplification process and thus operated for three shifts where each shift was assigned three full-time technicians. Shifts ran on an eight-hour workday (with a one-hour break) with each technician counting at a rate of 0.5 minutes per sample.ReportingOnce the sample had been determined to be positive or negative the information was recorded and reported through a communication database called Ploverb. This system gathered all testing data throughout the province which was reported to the people governments and testing labs. One full-time employee per shift completed this step. This reporting step took place within St. Paul’s lab; it was also subject to its hours with three eight-hour shifts with a one-hour break. Each employee took approximately 0.2 minutes to input one dataset.This step was highly dependent on its accuracy as provincial reporting numbers dictated COVID-19 responses and policy changes. With the backlog the VCHA was experiencing there were large inconsistencies between the number of COVID-19–infected residents and what was reported (see Exhibit 8).Testing Lab Personal Protective EquipmentSt. Paul’s testing lab had enough N95 masks gloves and other materials for operations. However BC Health was concerned that these materials including swabs and COVID-19 kits would run out if testing were to increase in the future.Retired ProfessionalsOn March 12 BC Health and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC called on retired doctors to support the front-line workers to alleviate high hospital and testing capacity issues. This decision helped the RHA to reassign their workers where needed and to ensure that regular hospital and clinic operations could continue despite COVID-19. Recalling retired professionals was a viable option given the physicians’ experience and expertise regarding outbreaks (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome) and following testing and lab protocols.As the cases continued to grow the VCHA was under immense pressure to curb the spread of the virus in all capacities.Personal Protective EquipmentAt the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in BC many doctors and medical professionals feared a PPE shortage would occur given the need for 60 million masks. Since other businesses and households would acquire PPE for their personal use there was concern that there would not be enough supplies for the first responders and front-line workers. The most significant concern was the shortage of long swabs for COVID-19 testing and PPE. To combat this issue the chief medical leaders of BC Health recalled all PPE among the RHAs and redistributed the resources based on necessity and case counts. As stated this distribution strategy proved beneficial for the short term as the VCHA was able to provide enough swabs for the April demand. However a shortage was likely to reoccur if cases and testing capacity increased.All medical PPE had to adhere to the provincial and federal standards outlined on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s website. The criteria guaranteed a standard of safety for both the front-line workers and the patients. Large corporations had been pivoting their business models to produce masks and other PPE needed to sustain medical operations across Canada. In BC there had been talks that a Vernon company called V02 Master was developing a reusable mask that could replace the N95 disposable covers. Although the mask had not been medically tested the VO2 Master mask filtrated at a 99 per cent rate versus the N95 rate of 95 per cent.Capacity and Supply Chain IssuesScott addressed the short- and long-term action plan for the VCHA’s COVID-19 response plan and the consequences surrounding demand increases for April 2020. Experts advised that VCHA testing sites could see almost 7000 people per day with a 2 to 5 per cent growth rate weekly. Given the current systems in place the VCHA was not prepared to accommodate this influx and would have to consider turning away patients.Scott had been in talks with VGH’s test centre about reutilizing their lab to offset some testing constraints. VGH was able to open a collection and testing centre that would perform the first step of the swab collection and the third step of the genetic extraction. As the hospital had created its own testing and genetic extraction kits it could operate without government supplies.To operate the collection centre step VGH would be open between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and would require 10 technicians to work an eight-hour day (with a one-hour break). Each technician would take 2.5 minutes to test one sample. Approximately 70 per cent of the Squamish Assessment Centre’s demand would be redistributed to VGH. For the genetic extraction step at VGH the lab would require five full-time doctors to work a 10-hour day with a 1.5-hour break. Similar to St. Paul’s each doctor would take 0.6 minutes to test one sample.Transitioning testing capacity in the swab collection and genetic extraction steps would help alleviate constraints and promote a more effective COVID-19 testing strategy. Given that VGH was also an educational hospital proper equipment and systems were in place if needed to operate the counting and reporting steps. Both the counting and reporting steps would need technicians to perform at the same rate as St. Paul’s.As all qualified technicians doctors and nurses worked on the front line to slow the transmission of COVID-19 the VCHA was experiencing a scarcity of qualified technicians. At VGH to operate the counting and reporting steps the VCHA would need to explore different options to ensure all steps were adequately staffed.Interestingly the Fraser Health region had seen success in its recent partnership with LifeLabs. This region had resolved their capacity constraints by outsourcing their testing at a costly rate. Since this relationship was new there was uncertainty regarding its sustainability or accuracy with regard to test data.Moving ForwardScott recognized that her team had to finalize its strategy before the next morning’s report. She knew that any recommendations had to be immediate and easily implementable to combat the exponential growth rate of COVID-19.Exhibit 1: COVID-19 Milestones in CanadaJanuary 25: Health Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 after a traveller from Wuhan China flew to Toronto Ontario.January 28: Health Canada confirmed its second and third cases of COVID-19 one related to the traveller from January 25 and one in BC.February 6: Health Canada mandated COVID-19 testing for all incoming travellers from China with symptoms.February 20: Canada reported its first case related to travel outside of China.February 26: Canada reported 12 confirmed cases (9 related to travel from China; 3 related to travel from Iran).March 11: The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.March 16: Canada announced the closing of its borders to non-Canadians.March 17: Ontario and Alberta both declared states of emergency.March 18: Canada and the United States announced the closing of their shared border to all non-work-related travel.
